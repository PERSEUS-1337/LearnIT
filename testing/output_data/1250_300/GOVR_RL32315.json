The conflict between environmental concerns and the need for increased domestic energy production from public lands is a major policy issue. The Bush Administration has its own initiative to expedite the oil and gas permitting process on federal lands. Oil and gas development practices have generated considerable debate in Congress. The Mining Law of 1872 allowed oil and gas resources on public lands to be transferred to private ownership, leading to abuse and wasteful use of public lands. President Taft withdrew 3 million acres of lands prospective for oil in Wyoming and California in 1909, which led to the Pickett Act of 1910. Congress eventually decided that defense-related minerals, including oil and gas, should remain under federal ownership, resulting in the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 removing oil and gas from the patenting process and placing it under a leasing system. The Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 removed oil and gas from the patenting process, placing it under a leasing system. This created split-estate situations where federal government owns minerals under privately held lands. Specific policies must be followed by mineral estate holders for developing minerals, including obtaining surface agreements or consent from private surface owners. Environmentalists and ranchers have expressed concerns about the impact of oil and gas development on public lands, citing inadequate environmental protection under the Mining Law of 1872 and Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. Development supporters argue that current environmental laws, such as the National Environmental Policy Act and Clean Water Act, regulate oil and gas development on public lands effectively. The federal government and oil industry must comply with environmental laws in leasing oil and gas on public lands. Delays in drilling are a concern. Proposed energy bills aim to address industry concerns and expedite permitting. Environmentalists fear harm to the environment and oppose the bills. The House approved the conference report, but the Senate has not due to a cloture motion on November 21. The House approved a conference report on oil and gas leasing on public lands, but the Senate has not due to a cloture motion. The Senate's substitute bill, S. 2095, is awaiting action. The report provides an overview of the oil and gas leasing system on U.S. public lands, including permitting, production, and reserves. It also discusses the contribution of onshore oil and gas to U.S. energy demand and estimates of reserves in restricted areas. The Bureau of Land Management develops Resource Management Plans for onshore federal public lands for oil and gas development. Tracts with potential are offered for competitive leasing each quarter, with a drilling permit required for each well. In FY2002, 1,765 new oil and gas leases were issued on public lands totaling 1.4 million acres. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act requires Resource Management Plans prior to development, with environmental impacts considered by the Bureau of Land Management. Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, Resource Management Plans are required for public lands prior to oil and gas development. These plans cover diverse uses and consider environmental impacts, with public participation and adherence to environmental regulations. The Bureau of Land Management determines which lands with oil and gas potential will be available for leasing through this process. The BLM determines lands for oil and gas leasing through land-use planning. Public lands are offered for leasing through competitive bidding, with a minimum bid of $2/acre. If no bids are received, noncompetitive leasing is available. Geophysical exploration permits are also available on unleased public lands. Geophysical exploration permits on unleased public lands may be issued by BLM, excluding drilling for core samples or oil and gas. Lease applicants are prioritized based on filing time, with exclusive rights granted to lessees for exploration and production. Approval of an Application for a Permit to Drill is required for each oil and gas well, with a drilling plan and surface use plan necessary for operations within the lease area. The Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) must include a drilling plan, surface use plan, and bond/surety coverage. The APD is reviewed for 30 days, followed by consultation with the surface managing agency. The BLM must process the application within 35 days, with possible outcomes of approval, approval with stipulations, rejection, or delay. Despite the 35-day review requirement, a study found that it took an average of 137 days to approve an APD in 2002. In 2002, despite the 35-day review requirement, it took an average of 137 days to approve an Application for a Permit to Drill (APD) in the region. Delays were attributed to the need to update outdated Resource Management Plans (RMPs) due to increased natural gas leasing and development. The Secretary of the Interior is required to develop, maintain, and revise land use plans with public involvement under FLPMA, section 1712. The Bureau of Land Management must develop and revise land use plans under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. Planning regulations require an environmental impact statement to be prepared. The process of rewriting Resource Management Plans has become lengthier, with some taking up to three years. Environmentalists argue that outdated plans do not address current land use concerns, particularly in relation to coalbed methane development. This delay in updating plans could impact site-specific analysis for drilling permits. Environmentalists argue that outdated Resource Management Plans (RMPs) are not suitable for land management decisions, leading to delays in site-specific analysis for drilling permits. The Bureau of Land Management has implemented strategies to expedite the permit process, including conducting environmental analyses on multiple permit applications and revising relevant manuals. Public lands for oil and gas leasing are categorized as open under standard lease terms, open with restrictions, and... The Bureau of Land Management has categorized public lands for oil and gas leasing into three categories: lands open under standard lease terms, open with restrictions, and closed to leasing. Many areas are closed due to land withdrawals, wilderness areas, national parks, and environmentally sensitive areas. Approximately 165 million acres of federal subsurface minerals have been withdrawn from mineral entry, leasing, and sale. Approximately 165 million acres of federal subsurface minerals have been withdrawn from mineral entry, leasing, and sale, subject to valid existing subsurface mineral rights. Lands in the National Park System, Wilderness Preservation System, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are among those that are statutorily withdrawn. Additionally, mineral development on another 182 million acres is subject to the approval of the surface management agency and must not conflict with land designations and plans. Public lands open to leasing may have restrictions imposed by the Department of the Interior, such as no surface occupancy, timing limitations to protect wildlife, and controlled surface use requiring a mitigation plan. The federal government has imposed various restrictions on leasing public lands for oil and gas development, including no surface occupancy, timing limitations to protect wildlife, and controlled surface use with mitigation plans. Industry sources argue that these restrictions hinder exploration and limit reserves, while environmental groups believe they are necessary to protect non-mineral values of public lands. The Rocky Mountain region holds a significant portion of the natural gas and crude oil resources on public lands in the lower 48 states. The Rocky Mountain region holds a significant portion of natural gas and crude oil resources on public lands in the lower 48 states. 60% of the undiscovered resource base in the region is on public lands, with 40% inaccessible or subject to lease stipulations. Recent reports have studied restrictions on natural gas in the region, focusing on total domestic natural gas supplies and major geologic basins within the Rocky Mountain region. The EIA and NPC studies compare natural gas supplies in the Rocky Mountain region, with similar definitions of the region. The EIA estimates 293.6 tcf of technically recoverable natural gas resources, while the NPC study indicates 335 tcf in the region. The EPCA study found 138.5 tcf in five major geologic basins. The relative amounts of natural gas closed or restricted for development are similar across the studies. The EIA and NPC studies show similar amounts of natural gas closed or restricted for development in the Rocky Mountain region. The EIA data indicates 11.5% closed and 37% restricted, while the NPC reports 9% closed and 32% restricted. The EPCA study found that 63% of proven reserves on federal lands are open for leasing. Including Rocky Mountain reserves in the EIA report would likely increase the percentage of natural gas open for leasing. The EPCA study found that about 600 million barrels of oil resources in the Rocky Mountains fall under the \"no access\" category, with another 3.2 billion barrels available for leasing, one-third of which have restrictions. About 2.5 billion barrels of oil are estimated to be available on non-federal lands in the studied basins, representing about 7% of all technically recoverable oil in the United States. The EPCA study included the five major geologic basins in the Rockies, resulting in smaller numbers compared to other reports. The percentage of natural gas under standard lease terms would likely increase, while the percentage of natural gas under restrictions would likely decline if included in the EIA report. The NPC and EIA studies show that developing natural gas in restricted land use areas would likely face costly delays. The EIA suggests that with more flexibility in federal regulations, 29 tcf of gas could become immediately available, and removing certain lease stipulations could make 51 tcf less costly to develop. Environmental groups argue that relaxing these restrictions would pose a greater risk to the environment. The NPC study estimates that 41% of gas resources in the Rocky Mountain region are closed or restricted. The NPC study estimates that 41% of gas resources in the Rocky Mountain region are either closed or restricted, totaling 335 tcf of natural gas resources as of 1999. If the estimated 108 tcf of natural gas currently restricted were produced, it could last between 20-30 years, meeting about 15% of projected annual U.S. demand. Currently, U.S. natural gas demand is being met with supplies from various sources including the Rocky Mountain region. The EIA estimates 4 tcf to 5 tcf of natural gas per year, meeting 15% of U.S. demand. The Wilderness Society asserts the U.S. has enough supply for the next 40 years, with 1,351 tcf available for development. 16% of this may be restricted. The NPC report argues that 70 tcf of Rocky Mountain natural gas is restricted and could be brought into production with resolved impediments. They propose relaxing land-use constraints to allow more drilling on federal lands in the intermountain west. The RAND Corporation suggests focusing on access restrictions based on the reserve category of the resource base. The RAND Corporation's 2002 Issue Paper proposes focusing on access restrictions for the most viable resource category to minimize environmental damage. Total U.S. oil production is forecasted to decline, with oil imports expected to make up 65% of total supply by 2025. Federal onshore oil production accounts for 5.4% of all U.S. oil production. In 2002, federal onshore oil production accounted for 5.4% of all U.S. oil production, with Wyoming, New Mexico, and California being the top producing states. Natural gas production in the U.S. varied between 18-20 tcf annually from 1993-2002, with projections showing an increase to 20-24.3 tcf by 2025. Imports from Canada are expected to rise to 3.7 tcf in 2010 before falling to 2.6 tcf in 2025. LNG imports are projected to increase from 170,000 bcf in 2002 to 4.8 tcf in 2025. Canadian reports indicate declining gas production, uncertain offshore supplies, and increased domestic use for oil sands, expected to triple by 2025. Imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are projected to rise significantly. U.S. gas production on public lands has increased, with New Mexico and Wyoming leading in production. Proved U.S. oil reserves were 22.7 billion barrels as of December 31, 2002, with significant natural gas reserves as well. Proved U.S. oil reserves were 22.7 billion barrels as of December 31, 2002, with natural gas liquids estimated at 8 billion barrels and natural gas reserves at 187 tcf. Texas leads in both oil and natural gas reserves in the United States. U.S. oil reserves have declined by 1.2 billion barrels over the past 10 years, while production declined by 500 million barrels. Discoveries in 2001 were three times greater than the average annual discovery since 1976. There are still substantial amounts of oil available in the U.S., but the rate of production is likely to continue declining over the long term. Technically recoverable onshore and state offshore oil resources are estimated at 92 billion barrels. The United States has seen an increase in gas reserves by 16.5 tcf since 1991, with production also rising. Gas imports have risen to 17% from about 9% in 1991. Annual discoveries were up 70% above the average since 1976. Technically recoverable gas resources are estimated to be about 1,000 tcf, over five times the amount of current proved reserves. Over two-thirds of the total amount of onshore natural gas is on nonfederal land and may be available for exploration and development. The 2002 oil and gas resource assessment in the Rocky Mountain West estimates 1.9 billion barrels of oil, 183 tcf of natural gas, and 3.1 billion barrels of natural gas liquids as undiscovered resources. Over 90% of the undiscovered gas is unconventional, with coalbed methane accounting for 25%. Proven reserves in the region show that oil and natural gas liquids on public lands account for 53.6%, while natural gas accounts for 60.1%. Federal onshore oil is estimated to be 12.5% of all technically recoverable oil, and natural gas on public lands is estimated to be 22.3% of all technically recoverable gas. Undiscovered conventional oil is estimated at 30.1 billion barrels, and undiscovered conventional natural gas resources are estimated at 319.7 trillion cubic feet. The 2002 oil and gas resource assessment in the Rocky Mountain West estimates significant undiscovered oil and gas resources. Coalbed methane gas, a form of natural gas trapped in coalbeds, is extracted by removing water through pumping to allow the gas to flow. Concerns about groundwater contamination have been raised due to the varying quality of water pumped out of coal beds. The USGS reports that water pumped out of coal beds can vary in quality, with options for disposal including surface discharge or subsurface injection. A tax credit in 1980 incentivized coalbed methane (CBM) development, leading to significant production starting in 1987. CBM accounted for 8% of natural gas production in the US in 2002, with 10,000 CBM wells producing 1.65 million barrels of water per day. Production rates vary due to coalbed geology, and DOE estimates anticipate 39,000 new wells by 2010, with most on federal lands. CBM reserves remain largely undeveloped. Production rates of coalbed methane (CBM) vary due to geology, with 23,900 new wells expected on federal lands out of 39,000 by 2010. Only about 100 tcf of the estimated 700 tcf of CBM in the US are economically recoverable. CBM proved reserves were 18.5 tcf in 2001, doubling since 1991. Colorado and New Mexico hold over half of US CBM reserves, with Wyoming, Utah, and Alabama also having significant reserves. The San Juan Basin is the most productive, followed by the Warrior Basin in Alabama. USGS estimates CBM resources in the Powder River Basin at 39 tcf. The Juan Basin is the most productive, containing 65% of known reserves and 80% of production. The Warrior Basin in Alabama is the second most productive, with 9% of U.S. production and 8% of reserves. The Powder River Basin has 39 tcf of CBM resources, with split-estates between federal government and private surface rights. Concerns arise over surface use agreements and compensation for damages, leading to the establishment of the Wyoming Split-Estate Initiative in 2002. In Wyoming, stakeholders established the Wyoming Split-Estate Initiative in 2002 to resolve conflicts between surface owners and mineral owners. Environmental concerns about CBM production focus on land and water issues, including surface infrastructure, water removal, water table effects, and water disposal. Hydraulic fracturing for CBM production has raised concerns about the impact of injected fluids on underground drinking water, with a draft EPA report finding no evidence of contamination from diesel fuel used in the process. The EPA expressed concern over the use of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing for CBM production due to its potential impact on underground drinking water. An agreement was reached to end the use of diesel fuel as an injection fluid. Proposed energy legislation includes provisions to prohibit EPA regulation of fluid injection for hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act. CBM production can lead to water pollution with sodium-tainted water, as most water from production seeps into underground aquifers. CBM production can result in water pollution with sodium-tainted water seeping into underground aquifers and formations, potentially contaminating drinking water sources. Environmental concerns include water discharges into surface waters, holding ponds, and reinjection underground, leading to depletion of aquifers, loss of natural vegetation, and threats to wildlife habitats. BLM has mandated CBM producers to drill monitoring wells to monitor groundwater quality and quantity since 1992. The BLM has required CBM producers to drill monitoring wells since 1992 to monitor groundwater quality and quantity. Monitoring wells are required on public lands but not on private lands. The IBLA invalidated three leases in 2002 due to insufficient evaluation of environmental issues related to CBM production. Supplemental environmental assessments were prepared for the Powder River Basin to determine CBM development in approved leasing areas. The Wyoming Outdoor Council sued BLM to withdraw additional leases in Wyoming. The Wyoming Outdoor Council sued BLM to withdraw leases in Wyoming due to violations of an IBLA ruling. BLM halted lease sales on public lands with high CBM content. The IBLA dismissed the case in 2003. The Wyoming BLM office finalized a new EA and RMP, planning to approve 39,000 permits for new wells. Demand for oil and natural gas is forecasted to rise, with imports projected to increase. Oil and natural gas demand is expected to increase, with imports projected to rise due to faster consumption growth than domestic production. The outlook for increased production from U.S. public lands is mixed, with uncertainties surrounding the supply from restricted areas. The Bush Administration has taken steps to ease restrictions, but opposition and challenges based on alleged violations of BLM's mandate have been reported. Production of conventional natural gas is expected to remain steady, while onshore unconventional natural gas production, mainly in the Rocky Mountain region, is also anticipated to increase. The forecast for natural gas production in the U.S. includes steady production of conventional natural gas on available lands, with an increase in onshore unconventional natural gas production, particularly in the Rocky Mountain region. Industry seeks greater access to federal lands for drilling, while environmental concerns focus on potential damage to sensitive lands and wildlife habitats. The U.S. is expected to rely more on natural gas imports, including LNG from stable countries and increased production from the deepwater OCS. Additionally, a proposed Alaskan natural gas pipeline could contribute significantly to production by 2025. The United States is expected to rely more on natural gas imports, primarily LNG from stable countries, and increased production from the deepwater OCS. A proposed Alaskan natural gas pipeline could provide 2.71 tcf by 2025. Oil and gas firms worldwide continue exploration and development, considering factors like political stability and resource base for investment decisions. Terms for competitive and noncompetitive leases include maximum acreage, bonus bid, term length, and bond requirements. Rents and royalties for leases are also specified. The onshore leasing program covers 10,240 acres in all states with no minimum bonus bid and a 10-year term. There is a $75 application filing fee and a $10,000 bond requirement. Rentals start at $1.50/acre for 1-5 years and increase to $2/acre thereafter, with a royalty of at least 12.5% on production. Revenues from leases are collected by the Minerals Management Service and distributed to states and the U.S. Treasury. Alaska receives 90% of revenues, while other states receive 50%. Revenues fluctuate due to oil and gas prices, with a significant increase in 2000. The federal oil and gas leases in Alaska generate varying revenues due to price fluctuations, with a significant increase in 2000. In 2001, there were 23,000 federal leases covering 17 million acres of public lands. The National Park System was established in 1916 to conserve natural and historic objects for future generations, with early tensions between the National Park Service and the Forest Service. During the early 1900s, tension arose between conservationists advocating for National Parks and utilitarians promoting National Forests. The President had the authority to make withdrawal orders for public lands, changing their designation from available to unavailable for various activities. Presidents have historically reserved lands for specific purposes, such as military reservations. The President has the authority to withdraw public lands for specific purposes, such as military reservations, under various acts like the Antiquities Act and the Taylor Grazing Act. National monuments can be created through statutory delegation, and wilderness areas can be designated by Congress or the executive branch under FLPMA. Under FLPMA, withdrawals of public lands can be made by the executive branch or Congress. The Wilderness Act requires the Forest Service to study designated primitive areas for wilderness suitability. Wilderness is defined as areas off-limits to development to preserve nature's pristine characteristics. Congressional designations as \"wilderness\" are considered essential to prevent administrative revocation. The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act withdrew large areas of Alaska from resource use pending congressional disposition. Currently, there are four types of withdrawal, including Congress's authority to create National Parks and wilderness areas. Currently, there are four types of withdrawal of public lands: Congress has sole authority to create National Parks and wilderness areas, the executive branch can use power delegated by Congress, Congress may withdraw specific resources, and there is a \"general congressional\" withdrawal for lands pending final disposition. Modern executive withdrawals are governed by FLPMA, which allows for significant public and congressional input in land use planning. FLPMA outlines procedures for sales, acquisitions, withdrawals, and exchanges of public lands. Withdrawals can be temporary or permanent, with parcels over 5,000 acres requiring congressional approval. The Secretary of the Interior can make emergency withdrawals for up to three years. A review of public land withdrawals in 11 Western states is mandated to determine continuation. The Secretary of the Interior can make emergency withdrawals of any size for up to three years. FLPMA mandated a review of public land withdrawals in 11 Western states to determine the continuation of existing withdrawals. BLM is reviewing approximately 70 million withdrawn acres, prioritizing 26 million acres for potential multiple uses. As of November 2000, BLM had completed reviewing 7 million withdrawn acres, with over 6 million acres having their withdrawals revoked. Retention of a withdrawal requires a compelling show of need according to the BLM Manual. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is continuously reviewing public land withdrawals, with over 6 million acres having their withdrawals revoked. A compelling show of need is required for retention of a withdrawal, and lands not opened to multiple use may be developed for oil and gas resources. The review process must be supported by documentation under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)."
