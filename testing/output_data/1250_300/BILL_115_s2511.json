    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018.\" The table of contents for this Act is provided. The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018\" includes definitions, coordination for assessment and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, regular assessments to support NOAA missions, acquisition of unmanned maritime systems, reports on their usage, and funding provisions. Key definitions include the Administration as NOAA, the Administrator as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, and cooperative activities with external entities. The curr_chunk defines \"cooperative activities of the Administration\" as collaborations with external entities like Cooperative Institutes and Sea Grant Colleges, specifies \"data specifications\" as the required type and quality of data, and explains a \"test or training range\" as an area for operating unmanned maritime systems for evaluation or training purposes. The curr_chunk explains the term \"unmanned maritime systems\" as remotely operated or autonomous vehicles designed to function without human presence, including undersea and surface vehicles. It also includes aerial vehicles and specifies training personnel on operating procedures for such systems. The Administrator directs coordination for research, assessment, and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including aerial vehicles, to address maritime issues. The Administrator directs coordination for research, assessment, and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, including aerial vehicles, to address maritime issues. This involves utilizing the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board (USEOB) for coordination and ensuring representation from various offices actively engaged with unmanned maritime systems. Coordination with the Navy is also required in carrying out these activities. The Administrator coordinates with the Secretary of the Navy to leverage expertise in unmanned maritime systems development and operations. Efforts include aligning with strategic priorities, utilizing Naval test ranges, and formalizing coordination through a memorandum of understanding. The Administrator collaborates with the Secretary of the Navy to enhance interagency cooperation, prioritize Administration requirements in Navy research, partner in unmanned maritime systems procurement, access Naval facilities for testing, and address additional topics like mapping and ocean exploration. The Administrator and the Secretary of the Navy collaborate on advancing unmanned maritime systems, utilizing co-located facilities for research, testing, and integration. They also coordinate with other federal agencies through the National Oceanographic Partnership Program for interagency collaboration. The Administrator and the Secretary of the Navy may utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program for interagency coordination in advancing unmanned maritime systems. They can also coordinate with academic institutions for research, training, and commercialization purposes. The Administrator and the Secretary of the Navy collaborate with research institutions, private industry, and public safety agencies to arrange access to facilities for testing unmanned maritime systems under various environmental conditions, promote information sharing between academic, environmental, and military institutions, and engage with the private sector to support commercialization of unmanned maritime systems. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of the Navy, may coordinate with the private sector to support the commercialization of unmanned maritime systems and assess their availability for Navy and Administration missions. Additionally, the Administrator will regularly assess publicly and commercially available unmanned maritime systems for potential use in supporting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration missions. The Administrator will assess unmanned maritime systems for their suitability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness to meet data specifications required by Administration programs. This assessment will also determine the operational reliability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of these systems for making observations needed by the Administration. The Assistant Administrator and Director will collaborate with the Unmanned Maritime Systems Ocean Technology Coordinating Committee and consult with various stakeholders to conduct these assessments. The Administrator will coordinate the acquisition of unmanned maritime systems to meet data requirements identified by OAR and OMAO. A memorandum of agreement may be developed with the Secretary of the Navy to enhance savings and efficiency in procurement, decommissioning, and sharing of unmanned maritime systems. The Administrator will coordinate the acquisition of unmanned maritime systems to meet data requirements identified by OAR and OMAO. This may involve accepting decommissioned unmanned maritime systems from the Navy, developing sharing policies, or finding other ways to increase efficiency and savings in Federal acquisition. A report on the usage of unmanned maritime systems for the mission of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must be submitted to Congress every four years, detailing current systems, data benefits, and data requirements. The Administrator will coordinate the acquisition of unmanned maritime systems to meet data requirements identified by OAR and OMAO. This may involve accepting decommissioned systems from the Navy, developing sharing policies, or finding ways to increase efficiency and savings in Federal acquisition. The appropriate committees of Congress are defined, and funding for this Act will be carried out using existing amounts appropriated to the Administration. Additional authorities are granted to the Administrator in carrying out this Act. SEC. 7. FUNDING AND ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES. The Administrator may enter into contracts, accept donations, and utilize funds from other Federal departments to carry out this Act. The Administrator can transfer funds to any organization and use resources from various government entities or international organizations with their consent and subject to availability of appropriations. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
