    "content": "In this work, a strategy for encoding curiosity algorithms as programs in a domain-specific language is proposed. The approach involves searching for algorithms during a meta-learning phase to enable RL agents to perform well in new domains. The rich language of programs allows for the expression of highly generalizable programs that excel in various domains. Several pruning techniques are developed to make the approach feasible, including learning to predict a program's success based on its syntactic properties. Empirical results show the effectiveness of the approach in finding curiosity strategies that are competitive with those in published literature and generalize well. Our approach involves meta-learning over a complex space of programs to augment RL agents with a curiosity module. This module computes a pseudo-reward at every time step to balance exploration and exploitation effectively in complex environments. Researchers face the challenge of designing good exploration strategies for RL systems with large state and action spaces and sparse rewards. Constructing reward signals based on curiosity or intrinsic motivation is one way to address this problem. Researchers are tasked with designing effective exploration strategies for RL systems in complex environments by creating reward signals based on curiosity or intrinsic motivation. The challenge lies in hand-designing these strategies, as it is difficult to systematically consider all possible strategies tailored to various environments. Drawing inspiration from curious behavior in young humans and animals, the concept of curiosity is seen as a mechanism that encourages meaningful exploration early in an agent's life to facilitate long-term learning and behavior. This problem is proposed to be addressed through meta-learning, where an outer loop operates at an \"evolutionary\" scale to search for optimal strategies. The problem of generating curious behavior is approached through meta-learning, with an outer loop searching for optimal strategies. The inner loop performs reinforcement learning using adapted reward signals. The goal is to optimize the agent's lifetime return or another global objective. The process involves continually adapting the inner RL algorithm to input streams of states and rewards. In a meta-learning setting, the goal is to find a curiosity module that performs well across a distribution of environments. The internal RL algorithm must handle nonstationary reward signals, possibly requiring minor changes. If the environment distribution is low-variance, a simple curiosity strategy like an \u03b5-greedy exploration may suffice. Meta-RL is widely used for this purpose. In a meta-learning setting, the focus is on discovering curiosity mechanisms that can generalize across a broad range of environments, including different state and action spaces. This paper introduces three novel contributions by exploring meta-reinforcement learning in a diverse space of programs.

By exploring meta-reinforcement learning in a rich space of mechanisms represented in a domain-specific language, this study aims to discover general curiosity-based exploration methods. The search for effective solutions in a combinatorial space of programs is made feasible through various strategies, including evaluating algorithms in different environments of varying difficulty levels and predicting algorithm performance based on structure and operations. The study explores meta-reinforcement learning in a domain-specific language to find curiosity-based exploration methods. Algorithms are evaluated in various environments, with unpromising programs pruned early to save computation time. The approach predicts algorithm performance and monitors agent learning curves to stop ineffective programs. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated empirically, showing competitive and generalizable strategies. The study delves into meta-reinforcement learning in a domain-specific language to develop curiosity-based exploration methods. An algorithm is designed to maximize discounted rewards by incorporating a curiosity module that provides proxy rewards. This setup allows the agent to efficiently explore the environment while still maximizing rewards. The goal is to design a curiosity module that encourages the agent to maximize total rewards over a specified number of time-steps or achieve a global goal like final episode performance. The study focuses on developing a curiosity module in meta-reinforcement learning to maximize rewards over a specified number of time-steps or achieve a global goal. The objective is to find a curiosity module that maximizes the expected original reward obtained by the system in the environment. Mathematics and algorithms play a crucial role in describing phenomena and algorithms efficiently. The study aims to develop a curiosity module in meta-reinforcement learning to maximize rewards over a specified number of time-steps or achieve a global goal. Valiant emphasizes the power of mathematics and algorithms in describing varied phenomena efficiently. The curiosity module is described in terms of general programs in a domain-specific language, mapping history into a proxy reward. It is decomposed into two components: one outputs an intrinsic reward value based on experienced transitions, while the other incorporates the actual reward and intrinsic reward to guide exploration. The curiosity module in meta-reinforcement learning aims to maximize rewards by developing a proxy reward based on experienced transitions. It consists of two components: one calculates intrinsic reward values from past and current transitions, while the other combines actual rewards and intrinsic rewards to guide exploration. The modules are based on a directed acyclic graph with input modules for states, actions, intrinsic rewards, and actual rewards. The curiosity module in meta-reinforcement learning utilizes a directed acyclic graph with various modules for states, actions, intrinsic rewards, and actual rewards. Functional, update, buffer, and parameter modules work together to compute output values and update parameters for gradient descent. The curiosity module in meta-reinforcement learning utilizes a directed acyclic graph with various modules for states, actions, intrinsic rewards, and actual rewards. The DAG includes nodes that add variables to buffers or modules with real-valued outputs for gradient descent. The output node, designated in green, is considered the program output. Input and parameter values are propagated through modules on each call, with output saved for the program. FIFO buffers and parameters are updated using the Adam optimizer. Multiple copies of the agent run simultaneously with shared policy and curiosity modules, executing reward predictions on a batch and updating accordingly. In meta-reinforcement learning, multiple copies of the same agent run simultaneously with shared policy and curiosity modules. The programs use neural network weight updates via gradient descent as a form of memory. Various designs for curiosity modules that perform internal gradient descent are represented, including inverse features, random network distillation, and ensemble predictive variance. In meta-reinforcement learning, various curiosity modules like inverse features, RND, and ensemble predictive variance are used. These modules utilize polymorphic data types where the instantiation of operations depends on the environment. For example, a neural network module can be instantiated differently based on the input data type, such as an image or a vector. A neural network module can be instantiated differently based on the input data type, such as an image or a vector. This abstraction allows for the same curiosity program to be applied regardless of input representation or action space. The meta-learning approach enables curiosity modules to generalize across tasks with different input and output spaces. The RND program processes input data through two neural networks, with parameters depending on the type of input. The program utilizes two neural networks with parameters dependent on the input type (image or vector). The output is a 32-dimensional vector, with the L2 distance serving as the program's output and input to a loss module. The intrinsic reward is based on the difference in outputs between the networks. The weights in one network are updated to mimic the other, driving the agent to explore new states. The search space is limited to 7 modules to prioritize concise programs. The program limits the computation graph to 7 modules to prioritize concise programs. The language is expressive but has a large search space, making it challenging to find effective curiosity programs.

Each machine aims to find the highest-scoring 625 programs in its section of the search space. The program selection strategy involves predicting performance using a 10-nearest-neighbor regressor and choosing the next program to evaluate with an \u03b5-greedy strategy.

Most work on meta-RL focuses on learning transferable feature representations or parameter values for quickly adapting to new tasks. The range of variability between tasks is typically limited to variations of the same goal or generalizing to different environment variations. Some attempts have been made to broaden the spectrum of generalization, such as showing transfer between Atari games thanks to modularity or proper pretraining. Nichol et al. suggest using different levels of the game Sonic to benchmark generalization. The study explores generalization between different environments, even those with different state and action spaces.
