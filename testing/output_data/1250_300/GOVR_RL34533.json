    "content": "Recent media reports suggest movement in negotiations on amending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in the 110th Congress. Oversight activities have included hearings and requests for information on warrantless surveillance programs. A National Intelligence Estimate highlighted the evolving threat from Islamic terrorist groups, particularly Al Qaeda. The Director of National Intelligence emphasized the need for modernizing FISA. On August 2, 2007, the Director of National Intelligence emphasized the need for modernizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to respond to technological changes and meet current intelligence collection needs. He proposed two key changes: not requiring a court order for gathering foreign intelligence from overseas targets and providing liability protection for those aiding in foreign intelligence collection efforts. The Protect America Act of 2007 was enacted into law on August 5, 2007, with a 180-day sunset provision to address these concerns. The Protect America Act of 2007 (PAA), P.L. 110-55, was enacted into law on August 5, 2007, with a 180-day sunset provision. Various attempts were made to extend the sunset provision, including a 15-day extension with H.R. 5104 and a failed attempt with H.R. 5349 for an additional 21 days. Bills were introduced in the Senate to extend the sunset further, but the Protect America Act ultimately sunseted on February 16, 2008. The Protect America Act sunseted on February 16, 2008, with provisions allowing authorized acquisitions to remain in effect until their expiration dates. Bills were passed in the House and Senate to address surveillance concerns, including H.R. 3773, the RESTORE Act of 2007, introduced in October 2007. On October 12, 2007, H.Rept. 110-373, Part 1, and H.Rept. 110-373, Part 2 were reported out of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. On October 16, 2007, H.Res. 746 was reported out of the House Committee on Rules, providing for consideration of an amendment to H.R. 3773. The resolution was agreed to on October 17, 2007. On November 15, 2007, the House passed H.R. 3773. S. 2248, the FISA Amendment Act of 2007, was reported out of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on October 26, 2007. On November 16, 2007, S. 2248 was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee with an amendment. The written report was filed on January 22, 2008. Senate floor activities on S. 2248 resumed on January 23 and 24, 2008, with a modified version of the amendment being tabled. Senator Reid sought unanimous consent for consideration of H.R. 3773, but Senator McConnell objected. Senator Rockefeller proposed an amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 2248. On January 28, 2008, a cloture motion on the amendment to S. 2248 failed to pass. Several other amendments were proposed and considered between January 24 and February 12, 2008. On February 12th, S. 2248, as amended, was passed by the Senate with a vote of 68-29. The text of S. 2248 was inserted into H.R. 3773, which was then passed and the motion to reconsider was tabled. The House passed H.R. 3773 with the text of S. 2248 inserted, but the passage was later vitiates and the bill returned to the calendar. The House then considered and agreed to a House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 3773, known as the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. Negotiations are ongoing to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. The Senate and House are working on amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, with differences in their approaches. The Senate's amendment includes provisions for surveillance targeted outside the US, while the House lacks a similar provision. They also differ in their treatment of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court's role in approving targeting procedures. The House amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act requires prior approval by the FISC for acquisition of communications of non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. The FISC has 30 days to review and approve or deny the certification and procedures. The Attorney General must adopt guidelines for compliance and submit them to relevant committees. The House bill amends FISA to require FISC approval for acquiring communications of non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. Guidelines must be submitted to relevant committees. FISC approval is needed for certification and procedures within 30 days. In non-emergency situations, FISC must approve if requirements are met, otherwise, deficiencies must be corrected. In emergency situations, AG and DNI can authorize acquisition temporarily, with certification to FISC within seven days. The Senate bill does not require prior FISC approval for certifications, targeting procedures, and minimization procedures for acquiring communications of non-U.S. persons abroad. Instead, it mandates submission of these documents to the FISC within five days of making or amending them. In cases of immediate action, the Attorney General and DNI can authorize acquisition temporarily, with certification to the FISC within seven days. The Senate bill mandates submission of certifications, targeting procedures, and minimization procedures to the FISC within five days. Immediate action can be authorized temporarily by the Attorney General and DNI, with certification to the FISC within seven days. The FISC will approve continued use if statutory requirements are met, otherwise, the government must correct deficiencies within 30 days or cease acquisition. The House bill clarifies that no application under section 104 of FISA is required for targeting non-U.S. persons. The FISC order requires correction of deficiencies within 30 days or cessation of acquisition. Both House and Senate bills allow targeting of U.S. persons outside the country for up to 90 days with FISC approval. Emergency authorizations require notice to a FISC judge and application within seven days. The FISC order requires an application within seven days of emergency authorization by the Attorney General. Without a judicial order, the acquisition terminates when information is obtained or after seven days. Information from emergency acquisitions cannot be used in proceedings without a FISC order, except in cases of threat to life. The House and Senate bills differ on the exclusivity of FISA. The House and Senate bills differ on the exclusivity of FISA for electronic surveillance, with the House emphasizing FISA as the exclusive means unless there is a statutory authorization, while the Senate adds a new section to FISA defining electronic surveillance as the exclusive means. The amendment to H.R. 3773 would expand the definition of \"foreign power\" and \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA to address groups or individuals involved in international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Both the House and Senate bills allow federal officers conducting surveillance to coordinate with law enforcement to investigate such activities. Both bills also provide limitations of liability for those aiding the government in authorized acquisitions. The House and Senate bills aim to address international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. They differ in their treatment of electronic communication service providers who assisted the government with warrantless electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes between September 11, 2001, and January 17, 2007. The Senate's version includes retroactive immunity for providers meeting certain criteria, while the House measure does not provide retroactive immunity for such assistance. The House amendment in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, includes provisions for court examination of state secrets privilege in civil actions against electronic communications service providers. It also mandates an audit of the Terrorist Surveillance Program and establishes a Commission on Warrantless Electronic Surveillance. The Senate amendment lacks similar language and provisions. The House bill includes provisions for court examination of state secrets privilege in civil actions against electronic communications service providers and establishes a Commission on Warrantless Electronic Surveillance. The Senate bill does not have similar provisions and does not address additional manpower and training for FISC applications. The report provides a detailed comparison of the two measures based on H.R. 3773 as passed by the Senate. A glossary of FISA terms is attached for better understanding.
