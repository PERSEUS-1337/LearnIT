    "content": "The Western Sahara was a Spanish possession until the mid-1970s when Spain planned to decolonize the region. Morocco and Mauritania opposed Spain's plan and claimed the territory due to its valuable resources. The International Court of Justice found no tie of territorial sovereignty between Morocco and Western Sahara. In response, Morocco launched a \"Green March\" to claim the region, leading to Spain agreeing to transfer it to joint Moroccan-Mauritanian administration. The independence-seeking Polisario resisted the takeover. In the 1970s, a majority of Sahrawis left for refugee camps in Algeria and Mauritania. With Algeria's support, the Polisario established the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) in 1976. Morocco built a sand wall to separate the Western Sahara it occupied from the Polisario. A long war ensued until a U.N. settlement plan in 1988 and a cease-fire in 1991. In 1991, U.N. Resolution 690 established MINURSO for a referendum in Western Sahara. Disagreements between Morocco and Polisario led to voter identification issues. James A. Baker III brokered an agreement in 1997 to restart the process, completed in 1999 with 86,000 voters identified. Over 130,000 appeals were made, leading to U.N. Resolution 1301 in 2000 suggesting alternatives to a referendum. Effective implementation required cooperation from Morocco and Polisario. The U.N. Resolution 1301 in 2000 proposed alternatives to a referendum in Western Sahara due to challenges in processing appeals and lack of cooperation from Morocco and the Polisario. The Secretary-General's June 2001 Report suggested a framework agreement for the population to elect executive and legislative bodies, with Morocco controlling certain areas. A referendum on final status was planned within five years based on residency in Western Sahara. Morocco would control foreign relations, national security, and defense in Western Sahara. A referendum on final status was planned within five years, with residency in the region as the sole criterion for voting. The electorate would include \"settlers\" alongside native Sahrawis, favoring Morocco. Algeria and the Polisario criticized the framework for not specifying options for the final status of Western Sahara. Annan proposed four options, including a possible division of the territory or the withdrawal of the U.N. from resolving the conflict, as the parties showed a lack of political will to cooperate. The Security Council asked for a new plan from Baker to ensure the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. In January 2003, Baker presented the Baker Peace Plan, proposing a U.N.-organized referendum for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. The plan included options for integration with Morocco, autonomy, or independence. Morocco objected to the referendum option and preferred the term \"self-determination\" over \"independence.\" Morocco objected to the U.N. reviving the referendum option for Western Sahara, preferring the term \"self-determination\" over \"independence.\" In April 2004, Morocco declared it would only accept autonomy as a solution and called for negotiations with Algeria. James Baker resigned as the U.N. Secretary-General's personal envoy in June 2004 after Security Council Resolution 1541 showed stronger support for a political solution over his peace plan. U.N. referendum-related activities ceased, and the Baker Plan was no longer mentioned. After Security Council Resolution 1541, U.N. referendum-related activities stopped, and the Baker Plan was no longer mentioned. In 2005, Peter van Walsum was appointed as the new envoy, stating that Morocco would only endorse a plan excluding independence, while the U.N. could not endorse a plan without a referendum on independence. Van Walsum suggested that the options were deadlock or direct negotiations, with responsibility lying with the parties. Security Council Resolution 1754 (2007) called for negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario without preconditions for a political solution allowing self-determination for the people of Western Sahara. Since independence, Morocco and Algeria have competed for regional dominance, with the Western Sahara serving as a focal point for their rivalry. Despite Security Council Resolution 1754 (2007) urging negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario for a political solution allowing self-determination in Western Sahara, talks have stalled. Van Walsum's statement in 2008 that an independent Western Sahara is not feasible led to accusations of bias and the Polisario's refusal to continue negotiations. Algeria, Mauritania, and other countries have been involved in the dispute. Morocco and Algeria have a rivalry over regional dominance, with the Western Sahara being a key point of contention. The Western Sahara serves as a unifying factor for Moroccans and supports the monarchy. King Mohammed VI has asserted Morocco's claim to the territory since 1999. The Western Sahara is seen as a strategic asset for Morocco to counter Algeria's regional ambitions. Financially, the territory may be a burden due to infrastructure costs, but its resources could provide long-term economic benefits. King Mohammed VI has proposed decentralization as a solution for the Western Sahara issue. Morocco and Algeria have a rivalry over regional dominance, with the Western Sahara being a key point of contention. King Mohammed VI has proposed decentralization as a solution for the Western Sahara issue, reinforcing Morocco's claim to the territory. Morocco presented an autonomy plan for the region under Moroccan sovereignty in 2007, aiming to prevent independence. Algeria sees the Western Sahara as a decolonization campaign and a potential route to the Atlantic Ocean if Polisario gains control. Algeria supports the Polisario's independence claims in the Western Sahara, viewing it as a decolonization campaign. Algeria's strong ties in Sub-Saharan Africa have helped the SADR gain African Union membership and recognition from many African governments. Morocco's rivalry with Algeria over regional dominance is evident in their dispute over the Western Sahara. The US diplomat Christopher Ross has been involved in negotiations regarding the Western Sahara since 2009. Morocco is the only state in Africa not part of the African Union. Ambassador Christopher Ross has been the UN Secretary-General's Personal Envoy on the Western Sahara since 2009. Despite attempts at negotiations, no progress has been made. In 2012, Morocco withdrew confidence in Ross, but the UN Secretary-General supported him. Ross visited Western Sahara in 2012 and announced a new approach to negotiations. Moroccan officials criticize MINURSO as biased. Ambassador Christopher Ross visited Moroccan-administered Western Sahara in late 2012, announcing a new approach to negotiations. He called for expanding confidence-building measures and advocated for the extension of MINURSO's mandate despite ongoing violations of the cease-fire accord. The mission operates in a challenging political and security environment, with a gradual shift in the military balance favoring Morocco. The report highlights concerns about the military balance favoring Morocco and the compromised operational effectiveness of MINURSO due to a shortage of military personnel. There are also worries about terrorist threats in the region and decreased budget for MINURSO. Human rights advocates and Polisario activists have raised concerns about freedom of expression in Moroccan-administered Western Sahara. Human rights advocates and Polisario activists have expressed concerns about restrictions on civil liberties and political rights in Moroccan-administered Western Sahara, including arbitrary detention, abuse of detainees, and use of disproportionate force against protesters. Morocco also limits entry to foreign visitors sympathetic to the Polisario and restricts pro-independence civil society groups. Reports by Human Rights Watch and the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture indicate instances of torture and ill-treatment. The U.S.-based organization Human Rights Watch and the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture have reported evidence of torture to extract \"confessions\" from Sahrawi prisoners. Positive developments in human rights include expanded activities by Morocco's National Human Rights Council and efforts by King Mohammed VI to address past abuses. Concerns over freedom of expression and movement in Polisario-administered refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria have been raised. Concerns over freedom of expression and movement in the Polisario-administered refugee camps in Tindouf, Algeria have been raised. The U.N. Secretary-General has called for independent monitoring of human rights in both Moroccan-administered areas and the refugee camps. The Polisario and human rights advocates are pushing for the U.N. Security Council to include human rights monitoring in MINURSO's mandate, but Morocco, supported by France, opposes this. In 2013, the U.S. proposed adding human rights monitoring to MINURSO's mandate, leading to backlash from Morocco. Concerns over terrorism and insecurity in the region surrounding Western Sahara have escalated due to regional arms and combatant flows. Violent extremist groups have emerged in the region with varied aims, including the kidnapping of European aid workers in Tindouf, Algeria by a splinter faction of AQIM. AQIM and associated groups are working to expand their recruitment efforts. A splinter faction of AQIM, MUJWA, claimed responsibility for terrorist activities in the region. Analysts suggest AQIM is expanding recruitment in Sahrawi refugee camps. Moroccan officials fear an independent Western Sahara could be vulnerable to terrorist infiltration. The Polisario denies links to AQIM and accuses Moroccan security services of supporting terrorist networks. US State Department Coordinator for Counterterrorism dismissed reports of al-Qaeda involvement in Polisario camps. Department Coordinator for Counterterrorism Daniel Benjamin testified before Congress that reports of al-Qaeda involvement in Polisario camps were unfounded. The United States has not recognized Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara or the SADR. The U.S. supported the U.N. settlement plan and the Baker Plan, with President George W. Bush acknowledging Moroccan sensitivity over the Sahara issue. The U.S. viewed Morocco's 2007 autonomy plan as credible and urged negotiations for a mutually acceptable autonomy regime. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reaffirmed U.S. support for the U.N.-led mediation effort in Western Sahara during a visit to Morocco in 2009. During visits to Morocco, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reaffirmed U.S. support for the U.N.-led mediation effort in Western Sahara. She praised Morocco's autonomy plan as a potential solution and encouraged all parties to engage in negotiations for a peaceful resolution. Clinton's stance was reiterated in joint statements with Moroccan and Algerian officials. Former Secretary Clinton's 2011 phrasing regarding the autonomy plan for Western Sahara was reiterated in various joint statements between the U.S. and Morocco. The U.S. values its relationship with Morocco as a key regional ally and seeks a resolution to the Western Sahara issue that does not destabilize King Mohammed VI's rule or impact security cooperation. The U.S. also aims to avoid antagonizing Algeria by emphasizing the U.N.-led process for a settlement, believing it could enhance regional stability. The U.S. values its relationship with Morocco as a key regional ally and seeks a resolution to the Western Sahara issue that does not destabilize King Mohammed VI's rule or negatively affect U.S.-Moroccan security cooperation. Successive Administrations have emphasized the U.N.-led process for a settlement to avoid antagonizing Algeria. U.S. officials support the continuation of MINURSO, which has effectively maintained the cease-fire. The U.N. Security Council reauthorized MINURSO in April 2014, increasing its troop ceiling. The United States provides funding for MINURSO but does not contribute uniformed personnel. The United States provides funding for MINURSO, contributing $15.9 million in FY2014 and requesting $17.5 million in FY2015. In 2013, there was discussion about adding human rights monitoring to MINURSO's mandate, but Morocco opposed it. No such proposal was made in 2014. Many Members of Congress endorse Morocco's autonomy initiative. The U.S. delegation did not propose adding human rights monitoring to MINURSO's mandate during the most recent renewal in April 2014. Many Members of Congress support Morocco's autonomy initiative, while others advocate for a referendum and express concerns about human rights in Moroccan-administered areas of Western Sahara. Congressional positions are reflected in foreign aid appropriations legislation, with funds for Morocco not to be used in Western Sahara to avoid implying Moroccan sovereignty. Reporting on human rights conditions is also a focus in appropriations acts. The FY2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act carries over a reporting requirement on human rights conditions in Western Sahara, directing the Secretary of State to update a report on Morocco's respect for human rights. Efforts to release political prisoners and support human rights monitoring by the U.N. in Western Sahara have been ongoing, with diplomatic efforts to negotiate prisoner releases in the past. U.N. envoy Ross's shuttle diplomacy has not yet resolved the stalemate. In diplomatic efforts involving the United States, Morocco, and Algeria, Senator Richard Lugar helped negotiate the release of 404 Moroccan prisoners of war held by the Polisario. Despite U.N. envoy Ross's shuttle diplomacy, the stalemate remains. The U.N. Secretary-General has called for a comprehensive review if no progress is made by April 2015. The Sahel region's instability emphasizes the need for a resolution in Western Sahara. The Polisario seeks self-determination through a referendum, while Morocco insists on autonomy under its sovereignty. Some Sahrawis feel caught between the two sides. The Polisario insists on self-determination through a referendum, while Morocco proposes autonomy under its sovereignty. Some Sahrawis feel trapped between the two sides. The international leverage is uncertain, with the U.N. reporting a cease-fire holding. The Polisario threatens armed struggle but lacks the capability without Algeria's support. Morocco's military strength outweighs the Polisario. The Polisario faces challenges in its independence struggle against Morocco, with some threats possibly being rhetorical. The group encourages protests but denies links to terrorism. Morocco maintains its autonomy proposal as the best solution, citing investments and governance reforms in the region. Reports of a splinter movement within the Polisario are difficult to assess. Morocco's Economic, Social, and Environmental Council (CESE) issued reports proposing a new development model for Western Sahara focused on sustainability, participatory democracy, and social cohesion. International investor interest in the territory has increased due to offshore oil exploration, fishing agreements, and natural resource extraction disputes. The Polisario opposes agreements between private firms and Morocco, opting for its own offshore agreements with oil companies. The Polisario opposes natural resource extraction agreements in Western Sahara, conducting its own offshore agreements with oil companies. The status of the territory under international law complicates investor operations. Aid is provided to Sahrawi refugees in Tindouf by UNHCR, World Food Program, and international humanitarian organizations. The camps are administered by the Polisario, with Algeria not allowing a census of refugees. Socioeconomic hardships lead to dissatisfaction among the refugees, especially the youth. Relations between Morocco and the Polisario remain unresolved. The number of refugees in the camps is disputed, with reports on conditions being independent. Socioeconomic hardships have led to dissatisfaction among the refugees, especially the youth. The Western Sahara issue continues to strain relations between Morocco and Algeria, with the border closed since 1994. The unresolved dispute hinders the Arab Maghreb Union's activity."
