    "content": "The Great Lakes watershed, spanning 300,000 square miles across eight U.S. states and one Canadian province, holds nearly 90% of the U.S. surface freshwater and 20% of the world's. It supports 40 million people with jobs, drinking water, and recreation, but faces water quality degradation from agricultural and urban development. In recent decades, agricultural and urban development in the Great Lakes basin have degraded water quality, posing threats to wildlife and human health. The introduction of non-native species and contamination of sediments have led to the listing of over 50 threatened or endangered species. Governments in the basin are implementing restoration activities, with the U.S. Congress enacting more than 30 laws focused on restoring the ecosystem, including grant programs and restoration efforts to improve water quality and habitat. The Great Lakes basin has seen degradation due to agricultural and urban development, leading to threats to wildlife and human health. Over 30 laws have been enacted by Congress to fund mitigation and restoration programs. However, there is no detailed plan for overall restoration like the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The Great Lakes Interagency Task Force was created in 2004 to provide strategic direction on federal policy, chaired by the EPA Administrator and involving various agencies and stakeholders in the region. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration, established through the Great Lakes Framework, aims to restore and protect the Great Lakes ecosystem. It includes representatives from various stakeholders in the region and has three main goals: creating a restoration strategy, addressing regional issues, and coordinating implementation. The Strategy, released in 2005, provides recommendations for actions over the next five years in eight issue areas. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration aims to restore and protect the ecosystem through a Strategy with recommendations in eight issue areas. Recommendations are justified and include specific activities, estimated costs, goals, and milestones for implementation over five years. The Strategy for restoring and protecting the Great Lakes ecosystem includes recommendations with estimated costs, goals, and milestones for implementation over five years. It relies on existing resources and aims to improve coordination among stakeholders. Some recommendations may require additional funding, and decisions should be guided by the Strategy. The Strategy for restoring the Great Lakes ecosystem includes recommendations to prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic invasive species, address habitat loss, and support species declines. Economic losses from invasive species were estimated at $5.0 billion annually in 2005. The goals are to prevent new introductions of AIS, control existing AIS, and protect habitat and species that support the recreation industry. Habitat loss and species declines in the Great Lakes basin due to agricultural expansion, toxic pollutants, and invasive species have led to economic losses. The goals include improving fisheries, restoring wetlands, and enhancing habitat conservation. Recommendations involve increasing funding for habitat conservation and species management, improving water quality by reducing toxic contaminants, and protecting drinking water quality through better wastewater treatment and pollution source regulation. The recommendations aim to reduce toxic contaminants in the Great Lakes, protect drinking water quality, and restore degraded Areas of Concern (AOCs) through implementing wet weather programs, improving wastewater treatment systems, and managing pollution sources. Contaminated sediments, resulting from toxic pollutants settling in sediment, are a common issue in AOCs. The goal is to restore all AOCs in the United States by reauthorizing programs under the Great Lakes Legacy Act and developing sediment treatment technologies. Nonpoint source pollution is a major contributor to impaired waters in the Great Lakes ecosystem. Nonpoint source pollution, including excessive levels of nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen, is a significant issue in the Great Lakes ecosystem. Recommendations include restoring wetlands and buffer habitat, reducing soil loss, and waste flows into waterways. Persistent toxic substances are released from contaminated sediments, industrial processes, and atmospheric deposition, posing a long-standing problem in the region. The goal is to reduce excess sediment, phosphorus, and nitrogen loading into the Great Lakes ecosystem and improve flow regimes in waterways. Persistent toxic substances (PTS) in the Great Lakes are a long-standing issue, released from various sources like contaminated sediments and industrial processes. The goal is to virtually eliminate PTS discharge and increase scientific understanding. Recommendations include reducing mercury, PCBs, dioxins, and pesticides, creating a research program, and increasing public education. Ecosystem monitoring, research, and indicator development are underfunded, with goals to establish a monitoring network, double research funding, and coordinate scientific information. The Strategy for the Great Lakes aims to conduct research in a coordinated manner, develop indicators of ecosystem health, and balance economic, social, and ecological factors. It recommends doubling research funding, coordinating scientific information, and enhancing sustainable planning. The Strategy calls for $20 billion in funding over the next five years, with a significant portion allocated to coastal health issues. The Strategy for the Great Lakes calls for $20 billion in funding over the next five years, with $15.3 billion allocated to coastal health issues. Some argue that this amount is too high compared to other ecosystem restoration initiatives. The Interagency Task Force suggests funding the Strategy from existing programs. According to the task force, federal and state programs spend approximately $523 million and $100 million annually on restoring water quality in the Great Lakes. Proponents argue that the ecosystem's size justifies a higher funding amount compared to other restoration initiatives. Inadequate funding is seen as a barrier to restoration efforts in the Great Lakes. Data on current spending for all components is lacking, making it difficult to separate new funding from existing programs. The Strategy for ecosystem restoration in the Great Lakes lacks clear funding details and a cost-sharing plan among federal, state, and other entities, hindering the identification of funding gaps. The Collaboration and Strategy aim to improve coordination among stakeholders, addressing the issue of inadequate coordination and the absence of a comprehensive plan for restoration efforts in the region. Some view the Interagency Task Force and Collaboration as entities that facilitate coordination, while others believe governance issues need to be addressed to enhance coordination and assign restoration responsibilities effectively. The Strategy for ecosystem restoration in the Great Lakes lacks clear governance structure and coordination plans. The task force aims to coordinate restoration activities, with the executive committee creating plans for implementation. The Strategy Implementation Framework outlines the committee's role in directing activities and promoting coordination. The executive committee will oversee the implementation of the Strategy, directing activities, promoting accountability, and facilitating coordination among stakeholders. Governance and coordination in large-scale restoration initiatives have been addressed in federal and state laws, such as in the Everglades. Some question the financial feasibility of implementing all programs within the Strategy's five-year timeframe. Some suggest setting priorities for implementing programs within the Great Lakes Strategy to make it financially feasible. Priorities discussed include restoring and protecting near-shore waters, controlling invasive species, and addressing nonpoint source pollution. The Strategy could serve as a basis for federal legislation for Great Lakes restoration, with two main approaches in pending legislation: authorizing a grant program or increasing funding for existing programs. Several projects in the Strategy could be funded through grant programs. The Strategy for Great Lakes restoration proposes funding through grant programs or reauthorizing existing programs to increase funding. In the 109th Congress, grant programs were proposed with $4-6 billion for restoration activities. However, similar bills have not been introduced in the 110th Congress. Another approach is to reauthorize existing federal programs identified in the Strategy to achieve its goals. For example, the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act of 2006 reauthorizes appropriations for the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Act of 1990. The Strategy for Great Lakes restoration proposes funding through grant programs or reauthorizing existing programs to increase funding. In the 110th Congress, new programs and amendments were introduced to support the Strategy, including the establishment of a task force, executive committee, and Collaboration for program oversight and implementation. The Strategy for Great Lakes restoration aims to restore the ecosystem in the near term with a $20 billion price tag. It outlines goals and recommendations for a five-year span but acknowledges that more needs to be done. Questions remain about the process, cost, timeline, roles, governance, success metrics, and funding increases. These questions are not addressed in the Strategy but may be answered through collaboration.

Questions about the process, cost, timeline, roles, governance, success metrics, and funding increases are not addressed in the Strategy but may be answered through collaboration. Measures for completion and potential funding increases are key areas yet to be determined."
