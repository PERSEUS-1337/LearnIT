The new section added to title 38 of the United States Code establishes presumptions of service connection for diseases associated with Project 112, specifically for diagnosed diseases linked to increased exposure to biological, chemical, or toxic agents during military service.

The new section in title 38 of the United States Code establishes presumptions of service connection for diseases associated with Project 112, specifically for diagnosed diseases linked to increased exposure to biological, chemical, or toxic agents during military service. This presumption applies even if there is no record of evidence of the disease during the period of service. Veterans who served on active duty and were subjected to a chemical or biological warfare test under Project 112 are presumed to have been exposed to toxic agents associated with the disease unless there is conclusive evidence to the contrary. The regulations prescribe a presumption of service connection for diseases associated with exposure to biological, chemical, or toxic agents during military service, specifically for those subjected to Project 112 tests. This presumption applies unless there is conclusive evidence to the contrary. The regulations establish a presumption of service connection for diseases linked to exposure to biological, chemical, or toxic agents during military service, particularly for those involved in Project 112 tests. The Secretary considers all medical and scientific information in making determinations, evaluating results for statistical significance, replicability, and peer review. An association between a disease and exposure to a toxic agent is deemed positive if credible evidence outweighs evidence against it. If the presumption of service connection is removed, the regulations apply. The regulations establish a presumption of service connection for diseases linked to exposure to biological, chemical, or toxic agents during military service, particularly for those involved in Project 112 tests. The credible evidence for the association is equal to or outweighs the credible evidence against it. If the presumption is removed, veterans and survivors will still be entitled to compensation.
