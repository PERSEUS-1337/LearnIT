    "content": "In April 2009, a novel influenza virus emerged, initially called \"swine flu\" due to its genetic makeup. The World Health Organization later named it influenza A (H1N1), a reassortment of swine, avian, and human flu viruses. This combination had not been seen before in humans or swine. The virus is now spreading from human to human, with investigations ongoing into the role of swine in its emergence. The novel influenza virus, known as H1N1, emerged in April 2009 and is a reassortment of swine, avian, and human flu viruses. It is now being transmitted from human to human, with investigations ongoing into the role of swine in its emergence. The virus is slightly more lethal than seasonal flu but not as deadly as H5N1 avian influenza. Researchers are uncertain about the virus's future virulence. On April 21, 2009, CDC reported two children in California recovered from a unique influenza strain with gene segments from swine flu viruses, despite no contact with pigs. On April 24, 2009, Mexico announced a new strain of influenza with over 1,000 suspected cases. Schools were closed and public gatherings canceled. By April 27, WHO reported cases in Canada and Spain with no deaths. The pandemic alert level was raised to Phase 5, indicating human-to-human spread in multiple countries. Phase 5 of the pandemic alert level is characterized by human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region. On June 11, 2009, WHO raised the alert level to Phase 6, the highest level, as more than 50,000 human cases of H1N1 had been confirmed in over 80 countries with 231 deaths reported. The virus was described as \"moderately severe,\" with the potential to become more virulent. The number of H1N1 cases reported may not reflect the actual number of people infected. WHO advises against travel restrictions as they would not stop the virus spread but could disrupt global community. Most H1N1 patients experience flu-like symptoms and recover without antiviral treatment. Antiviral drugs can help reduce symptoms, prevent severe illness, and death. The circulating H1N1 strain is a new virus. The WHO has found that older antiviral drugs are not very effective against the new H1N1 virus, but oseltamivir and zanamivir are. They have a global stockpile of oseltamivir and are distributing treatments to developing countries. There is no vaccine available for the current strain of H1N1, but efforts are being made to develop one. Efforts are being made to develop a vaccine against the current strain of H1N1. WHO and CDC are preparing vaccine candidate viruses, estimating it could take 5-6 months to mass-produce. Sanofi-Aventis and GlaxoSmithKline plan to donate millions of vaccine doses to WHO for distribution to developing countries. Most countries are following WHO recommendations against banning international travel, except for China which has quarantined Mexican nationals. Mexico responded by halting flights to China until discrimination concerns were addressed. China has quarantined Mexican nationals, leading Mexico to halt flights to China. Some countries have advised against nonessential travel to the United States and Mexico. The CDC recommended avoiding nonessential travel to Mexico but later downgraded the warning. Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano argued against closing U.S. borders with Mexico due to high costs and minimal benefits. Janet Napolitano testified that closing the border to Mexico would have minimal benefits and high costs. The strain of the virus is already present throughout the United States, making containment through border closures unrealistic. Some countries are using thermal scanners in airports to screen travelers for high body temperatures, but the effectiveness of these measures is debated. Egypt has ordered the slaughter of pigs, and several countries have banned pork imports from the US, Canada, and Mexico. Egypt was the first country to order the slaughter of pigs, and several countries banned pork imports from the US, Canada, and Mexico. USAID established a Pandemic Influenza Response Management Team to coordinate humanitarian response to H1N1 outbreaks. The US provided over $16 million to assist Latin America and the Caribbean in responding to H1N1 outbreaks. Assistance efforts focus on commodity delivery and disease detection. USAID and the Department of Defense have provided support for foreign assistance efforts focusing on commodity delivery and disease detection. USAID donated personal protection equipment kits and biodegradable powder to Vietnam to help respond to potential outbreaks of avian or H1N1 influenza. CDC, as a WHO collaborating center, receives viral samples from many countries and develops testing kits for detecting influenza subtypes, sending them to public health laboratories worldwide. The CDC sends testing kits to detect influenza subtypes to national centers worldwide. HHS Secretary announced the distribution of treatment courses to Mexico. CDC has deployed staff to Mexico and Guatemala to control the spread of the virus. Teams aim to understand the clinical illness under WHO/Pan American Health Organization Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. The CDC collaborates with international teams to study H1N1, improve laboratory capacity, and support pandemic preparedness efforts in over 50 countries. USAID provides additional funding for disease surveillance and control measures in Latin America and the Caribbean. USAID provided an additional $5 million to WHO and PAHO for H1N1 response in Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on disease surveillance and control measures. They also distributed PPE kits valued at over $1 million to protect first responders in the region and pre-positioned 400,000 PPE kits in 82 countries for pandemic preparedness. Additionally, USAID conducted a pandemic preparedness exercise in Ethiopia as part of its H2P Initiative. USAID distributed 400,000 PPE kits in 82 countries for pandemic preparedness. A pandemic preparedness exercise was held in Ethiopia as part of the H2P Initiative, bringing together stakeholders from nine East African countries to develop response plans and test existing ones. The exercises help governments prepare for potential influenza pandemics and address cross-border population movement. USAID conducts pandemic preparedness exercises in various regions, including South Africa and Asia in 2009. They collaborate with the Department of Defense to provide military assistance in 30 countries across Africa and Asia. Congress has provided funding for U.S. technical assistance efforts related to global pandemic influenza preparedness and response since FY2005. Since FY2005, Congress has funded U.S. efforts to train health workers in foreign countries for pandemic preparedness. The U.S. has pledged $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts, making it the largest donor. The funds have supported international efforts in over 100 nations, focusing on preparedness, surveillance, and response. The U.S. has provided $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts, focusing on preparedness, surveillance, and response. Funding includes support for bilateral activities, international organizations like WHO and UNICEF, regional programs, global contingency, technical assistance, research, stockpiles of supplies, and wild bird surveillance. The U.S. has allocated $949 million for global avian and pandemic influenza efforts, with funding for preparedness, surveillance, and response. This includes support for various agencies such as USAID, HHS, USDA, DOD, and DOS, as well as a request for $1.5 billion in supplemental funding for domestic and international pandemic activities. The 2009 Supplemental Appropriations bill allocated $50 million for USAID pandemic preparedness and $200 million to CDC for H1N1 activities. Concerns about infectious diseases threatening global security have increased due to outbreaks like H5N1 and SARS. 75% of emerging diseases originate from animals, requiring a multidisciplinary response. The threat of infectious diseases like H1N1 has highlighted the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving stakeholders from various sectors. Investments made by the United States and other countries have helped in preparing for pandemics and monitoring disease spread. While progress has been made in developing tests and treatments for H1N1, concerns remain about the capacity of poorer countries to respond effectively. Experts warn against complacency as influenza transmission tends to increase in winter months. Experts are concerned about poorer countries lacking capacity to monitor and respond to H1N1. Transmission of influenza viruses accelerates in winter months, with Southern hemisphere countries beginning to report cases. Questions arise about potential gene reassortment, especially in countries dealing with H5N1 bird flu. Debate surrounds whether WHO should maintain its pandemic phase system or develop a severity-based alert system. WHO raised the pandemic phase level from 5 to 6 on June 11, 2009, without a change in severity. The update included a new pandemic influenza preparedness and response guide, outlining steps for governments to plan and prepare for an epidemic. The update redefined pandemic phases to reflect risk accurately and outlined steps for governments to plan for epidemics. USAID announced a new program in collaboration with CDC and USDA to establish a global early warning system for diseases of animal origin infecting humans. Some concerns exist about the limited number of sub-Saharan countries confirming H1N1 cases. Some observers are concerned about the limited number of sub-Saharan countries confirming H1N1 cases, with South Africa being the only one so far. Laboratory and surveillance systems in sub-Saharan Africa are generally poor, reflecting limited public health and surveillance capacity. Efforts by CDC, USAID, and other international health experts are underway to improve these systems, including sending H1N1 testing kits to laboratories in Africa. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poor countries remains a debated issue. Access to treatments and vaccines for diseases in poor countries has been a debated issue, with concerns raised about affordability and access to patented treatments. Poorer countries rely on the generosity of donor countries as the majority of global capacity to develop influenza vaccines is located in Europe and North America. USAID estimates that 30% of the world's population lacks regular access to medicines, with over 50% of the poorest areas in Africa and Asia lacking access. More than 90% of global capacity for influenza vaccine development is in Europe and North America, leading to concerns that poorer countries may not have access to treatments and vaccines during a pandemic. WHO expects national authorities to handle mass vaccination campaigns, but there are doubts about the capability of poorer countries to do so effectively. Approximately 1.4 million deaths in children under five could have been prevented with routine vaccinations, raising concerns about global mortality rates in this age group. In 2002, 1.4 million deaths in children under five were due to preventable diseases, representing 14% of global child mortality. Health experts are concerned about the potential reassortment of H5N1 and H1N1 flu strains, which could create a new strain with human illness potential. Concerns about an H5N1 influenza pandemic arose in 2004, with human cases linked to outbreaks in poultry. By 2006, 50 countries had confirmed H5N1 outbreaks. The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in poultry in 2003 led to human cases in eight Asian nations. By 2006, 50 countries worldwide had confirmed H5N1 outbreaks. In 2008 and 2009, six countries reported human H5N1 cases, with Indonesia and Cambodia not reporting H1N1 cases. H5N1 bird flu is more deadly but less transmissible than H1N1. Most human deaths from H5N1 occur after direct contact with sick birds."
