Certain immigration programs may need to be temporarily suspended to ensure national security interests are not compromised. Certifications from the Secretary of Homeland Security are required for the effective transfer of immigration enforcement functions to the Directorate. Additionally, there is a temporary suspension of the Visa Waiver Program. The temporary suspension of various immigration programs, including the Visa Waiver Program, adjustment of status, renewals of Temporary Protected Status, and certain immigrant visa programs, is mandated to ensure national security interests are protected. This suspension includes halting the admission of aliens, adjustment of alien status, extension of designations, and acceptance of applications related to these programs. The suspension of family-sponsored immigrant visas for siblings, sons, daughters, and unmarried sons and daughters of permanent resident aliens is mandated under the Immigration and Nationality Act.

RESTRICTION OF NONIMMIGRANT VISAS FOR NATIONALS OF COUNTRIES DENYING OR DELAYING ACCEPTANCE OF ALIENS. The Secretary of Homeland Security will create a public listing of aliens with final removal orders but no significant likelihood of removal due to countries refusing or delaying acceptance. If 24 or more citizens of a foreign state are on the list, that state will be considered as denying or unreasonably delaying acceptance, leading to visa restrictions. The Secretary of Homeland Security will notify the Secretary of State to discontinue nonimmigrant visa issuance to citizens of a foreign state with visa restrictions, which will sunset in accordance with section 9. SEC. 8 allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive certain sections on a case-by-case basis or for designated classes of applicants, with concurrence from the Secretary of State. The waiver authority can be delegated to the Secretary of State for certain applicants. The specified sections will expire one week after the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies to Congress that certain conditions are met, including the full operational status of entry and exit data systems, machine-readable visas, and the capability to detain and remove individuals. The Department of Homeland Security must certify certain conditions, including operational entry and exit data systems, machine-readable visas, and detainment capabilities, before specified sections expire.

Adequate federal funds are available for reimbursement of verified claims, and the data system for alien registration must be fully compliant with integration and interoperability standards.

The audit program should indicate that fraud or false statements in approved applications are no more than 3%. The foreign student monitoring system must be fully operational for certified educational institutions receiving nonimmigrant students.

The Secretary of State's authority to issue nonimmigrant visas and the Secretary of Homeland Security's authority to admit nonimmigrant aliens into the United States are suspended. This includes the suspension of acceptance for filing of nonimmigrant visa applications and applications for admission. The Secretary of Homeland Security may waive these suspensions under certain conditions, including the repeal of certain provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and mandatory personal interviews for admission. Verification by the Secretary and the Secretary of State is required for each alien admitted on a nonimmigrant visa. Aliens admitted to the United States under section 217 of the Immigration and Nationality Act must have a personal interview with a consular officer before receiving a nonimmigrant visa. A waiver granted under certain conditions does not apply to aliens barred from receiving nonimmigrant visas under section 7(a)(2). SEC. 11. TEMPORARY FUNDING FOR DETENTION AND REMOVAL ASSISTANCE BY STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. The Secretary of Homeland Security will reimburse law enforcement agencies for emergency medical care, housing, and transportation of detained aliens if certain conditions are met, including transfer to Federal custody and a determination of removability."
