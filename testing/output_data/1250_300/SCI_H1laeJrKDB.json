    "content": "Recent deep generative models have shown the potential to create realistic images and embeddings useful for computer vision and natural language processing tasks. However, the lack of control over the generative process and understanding of the learned representation limits their usefulness. Recent works have focused on studying the semantics of the latent space of generative models to address these issues. This paper introduces a method to enhance the interpretability of the latent space by finding meaningful directions for precise control over specific properties of generated images, such as object position or scale. The method is weakly supervised and suitable for simple transformations like translation, zoom, or color variations. It has been demonstrated to be effective for both GANs and variational auto-encoders. The method enhances the interpretability of the latent space in generative models by allowing precise control over specific properties of generated images. It is effective for GANs and variational auto-encoders, enabling transformations like translation, zoom, and color variations. This control can improve applications such as image in-painting and dataset synthesis. The latent space of generative models provides insights into its structure, showing that factors of variations like object presence, position, and lighting can be encoded. These factors can be categorized as modal (discrete values) or continuous (range of values), making them efficient representations of natural images. In this paper, the authors propose a method to find meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models for precise control over specific continuous factors of variations. Previous works have mainly focused on discrete factors and labeled attributes like gender or emotion. The authors propose a method to find interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models, allowing precise control over specific continuous factors of variations such as position and scale in images. The method does not require a labeled dataset or encoder and can potentially be adapted to other variations like rotations or color changes. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated both qualitatively and quantitatively, showing insights into the latent space structure. The authors propose a method to find interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models, allowing precise control over specific continuous factors of variations in images. They demonstrate the ability to control properties of generated images by sampling latent representations along linear directions and discuss the impacts of disentanglement on controlling generative models. The text discusses the process of determining the latent code of a transformed image in a generative model, allowing for precise control over specific factors of variation. By finding the difference between the latent codes of the original and transformed images, the direction in the latent space corresponding to the transformation can be estimated. This method enables the control of properties in generated images by manipulating the latent representations along linear directions. When determining the latent code of an image in a generative model, the choice of reconstruction error L is crucial. Commonly used pixel-wise Mean Squared Error (MSE) and cross-entropy can lead to blurry images. Alternative reconstruction errors have been proposed but are computationally expensive. The poor performance of MSE is attributed to favoring solutions that are unrealistic. The poor performance of pixel-wise Mean Squared Error (MSE) in generative models is due to its bias towards solutions that are the expected value of all possibilities. This bias leads to textures being reconstructed as uniform regions, resulting in blurry images. By studying the effect of MSE in the frequency domain, it is shown that the limited capacity of the generator's latent space prevents it from producing arbitrary texture patterns. This limitation causes the optimization to favor solutions with less high frequencies, leading to blurry results. To address this issue, reducing the emphasis on high frequencies in the loss function is proposed to achieve sharper image results. The text discusses the limitations of using Mean Squared Error (MSE) in generative models, which leads to blurry images due to bias towards uniform textures. By reducing the weight of high frequencies in the loss function, sharper image results can be achieved. The text introduces the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) by Zhang et al. (2018) and presents an optimization problem for finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I). It discusses the challenges of using an L2 penalty and proposes creating a dataset of trajectories in the latent space for training the model. The text discusses the challenges of optimizing the transformation function T in pixel space, highlighting the curved nature of the manifold of natural images. To address slow convergence, smaller transformations are decomposed and solved sequentially. Training a specific network for initialization is costly, and an auxiliary network proposed by Zhu et al. (2016) can be used to estimate z T. Our approach decomposes the transformation T into smaller transformations to optimize on the manifold without extra training. The method ignores undefined regions in images and considers the limitations of generative models in producing arbitrary images. Our approach decomposes the transformation T into smaller transformations to optimize on the manifold without extra training. To reduce the impact of outliers, we discard latent codes with high reconstruction errors. Algorithm 1 is used to generate trajectories in the latent space, followed by defining a model to encode factors of variations. The model assumes that a specific factor can be predicted from the latent code coordinate along an axis u. The model assumes a specific factor can be predicted from the latent code coordinate along an axis u using a parametrized model g\u03b8 with trainable parameters. The model uses a parametrized model g\u03b8 to estimate u and \u03b8 by training f(\u03b8,u) to minimize the MSE between \u03b4t and f(\u03b8,u)(z \u03b4t) \u2212 f(\u03b8,u)(z 0). This allows for control over the distribution of images generated by G, enabling the sampling of images based on a desired distribution. The study conducted experiments on two datasets: dSprites, consisting of binary images with varying shapes, and ILSVRC, containing natural images from different categories. The experiments were implemented using TensorFlow 2.0 and a BigGAN model, allowing control over the distribution of generated images. The model takes a latent vector and a one-hot vector as inputs to generate images. The study used a BigGAN model with TensorFlow-Hub weights to generate images from different categories. The model takes a latent vector and a one-hot vector as inputs, with the latent vector split into six parts for different scale levels. Several \u03b2-VAEs were also trained to study disentanglement importance. Training was done on dSprites with an Adam optimizer for 1e5 steps. Evaluation focused on position and scale variations. The study focused on analyzing position and scale variations in images generated by a BigGAN model. Position was estimated using barycenter of white pixels, while scale was evaluated based on salient pixels proportion. The evaluation procedure involved sampling latent codes, generating images, and estimating the factor of variation. Jahanian et al. (2019) proposed an alternative method using an object detector for quantitative evaluation. The study analyzed position and scale variations in images generated by a BigGAN model. Results showed precise control over object position and scale for selected categories of objects from ILSVRC dataset. Common directions were learned across datasets, indicating independence from specific object categories. The study merged trajectory datasets to learn common directions for various categories. Results in Figure 2 show shared directions for factors of variations. Figure 3 provides qualitative results, while Figure 4 shows that spatial factors are mainly encoded in the first part of the latent code. The spatial factors of variations are primarily encoded in the first part of the latent code. The contribution of level 5 is higher for the y position compared to the x position and scale. Results on the ILSVRC dataset show the distribution of transformation parameters and the impact of scale on algorithm performance. The correlation between object position and background affects algorithm performance, especially when the object covers most of the image. Testing different \u03b2 values in \u03b2-VAE models on dSprites shows varying performance. The study tested the effect of disentanglement on the performance of \u03b2-VAE models trained on dSprites with different \u03b2 values. Results showed that higher \u03b2 values led to more control over object position in generated images. This highlights the importance of disentangled representations for controlling the generative process in models like GANs. Our work aims to find interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models for control. Different generative models like GANs and auto-encoders offer ways to manipulate the generative process. Unlike other methods, our approach does not require labels for control. Our method focuses on finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models for control, without the need for labels. Unlike other approaches, we do not rely on conditional reconstruction or network activations to manipulate the generative process. Our work includes a procedure to determine the latent representation of an image when an encoder is not available, a task that has been explored in previous works. Our method introduces a procedure to find the latent representation of an image without an encoder. Previous works have focused on inverting the generator of a GAN to find the latent code, but struggle with more complex datasets. We adapt a reconstruction loss to improve reconstructions and discuss the challenges of inverting a generative model. The text discusses the challenges of inverting a generative model and proposes a method to find interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models. This method involves generating a dataset of interesting trajectories to train the model, which differs from other recent works that train the model directly. The text discusses the differences in training and evaluation procedures between their method and other recent works in the field of generative models. Their model allows for more precise control over the generative process and can be adapted to more cases, addressing the challenges of little control and lack of interpretability in latent representations. In the context of generative models, a method is proposed to extract meaningful directions in the latent space for controlling properties of generated images. A linear subspace of the latent space of BigGAN can represent factors like translation and scale, aiding in understanding the model's representations. The method involves considering target and generated images, utilizing Fourier transforms to analyze loss contributions from specific frequencies. The \u03b2-VAE framework aims to discover interpretable latent representations in images without supervision. A simple convolutional VAE architecture is designed for generating 64x64 images, with the optimization process favoring smoother images with fewer high frequencies. The model utilizes Fourier transforms to analyze loss contributions from specific frequencies. The convolutional VAE architecture was designed for generating 64x64 images, with the decoder network using transposed convolutions. The model's loss function was analyzed with and without constraints on the latent space, showing artifacts without constraints. Good reconstruction results were observed with specific values of sigma, penalizing low frequencies at higher values. Results from the study show good reconstruction accuracy with specific sigma values, compared to MSE and DSSIM methods. The approach restricts the latent code to a ball of radius \u221a d to avoid artifacts. Quantitative evaluation using LPIPS on 1000 images from ILSVRC dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. The study evaluated reconstruction accuracy using LPIPS on 1000 categories of the ILSVRC dataset. Results in Table 2 show images reconstructed with the proposed method are perceptually closer to the target image than MSE or DSSIM. The optimization problem is challenging due to the curvature of the natural image manifold, especially for transformations like translation and rotation. The trajectory of images undergoing common transformations is curved in pixel space, as demonstrated with images from the dSprites dataset. The study evaluated reconstruction accuracy using LPIPS on 1000 categories of the ILSVRC dataset, showing images reconstructed with the proposed method are perceptually closer to the target image than MSE or DSSIM. The trajectory of images undergoing common transformations like translation, rotation, and scaling is curved in pixel space, posing challenges in optimization due to the curvature of the natural image manifold. When the direction of descent in pixel space is near orthogonal to the manifold described by the generative model, optimization slows down. In an ideal GAN scenario, moving an object in the image may result in a gradient of zero if the intersection of objects is empty. Moving an object in the image may result in a gradient of zero if the intersection of the two circles is empty. Qualitative examples for 10 categories of ILSVRC dataset show images generated with the BigGAN model for position, scale, and brightness. The images' latent codes are sampled using specific methods for each transformation. Some categories may have issues controlling brightness due to training data limitations. The direction is learned for position and scale categories, while only the top five categories are used for brightness."
