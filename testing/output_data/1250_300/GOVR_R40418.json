Various government departments have expanded their high-containment laboratory capacity to study dangerous pathogens, playing a crucial role in biodefense efforts. These labs offer hope for better responses to biological attacks but also pose a risk as potential sources of materials or training for attackers. Additionally, research has been invested in developing countermeasures, diagnostics, and detectors for dangerous pathogens. The federal government increased funding for biodefense after 9/11 and anthrax attacks, focusing on expanding laboratory capacity for research on dangerous pathogens. This funding supported the development of countermeasures, diagnostics, and detectors. The increase in high-containment laboratory capacity has raised new policy questions and concerns about existing infrastructure limitations. The proliferation of high-containment laboratories internationally has raised new policy questions and concerns about capacity, federal investment, consolidation, optimal size, coordination, risk of accidents, and government oversight. Policymakers are increasingly interested in expanding these facilities due to accidents, regulatory noncompliance, and community resistance. The Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism recommended tightening government oversight of high-containment laboratories due to accidents, regulatory noncompliance, and community resistance. This report focuses on the federal government's regulation of high containment laboratories, explaining biosecurity and biosafety concepts, discussing issues facing federal policymakers, and identifying policy options for congressional consideration. Biosecurity involves securing pathogens from theft, while biosafety lowers the risk of unintentional infection or environmental release from the laboratory. The Select Agent Program was established in 1996 to regulate commerce in pathogens with severe consequences if released. It was created in response to the 2001 anthrax mailings, highlighting the importance of biosecurity in preventing bioterrorist attacks. The Select Agent Program was established in 1996 to regulate commerce in pathogens with severe consequences if released, in response to the 2001 anthrax mailings. The program identifies select agents for potential bioterrorist attacks and enforces restrictions on their possession, transfer, and use. Entities possessing select agents must develop security and biosafety plans certified by the federal government. Scientists seeking access to select agents must register and undergo background checks by the Department of Justice. Scientists seeking access to select agents must register with the federal government, providing information to the Department of Justice for background checks. Permits to handle select agents are valid for five years and nontransferable. Facilities using select agents must develop security plans to protect them from theft or improper access, which are reviewed by HHS or USDA. Failure to comply with regulations may result in fines. As of February 2009, around 390 entities were certified to work with select agents, with 15,300 staff having security risk assessment approvals. The majority of certified entities are owned or operated by state or local governments, including public health laboratories. The federal government established a Laboratory Response Network to enhance testing and response capabilities after a biological attack, aiming to have a lab in each state capable of handling dangerous pathogens. The presence of numerous academic entities and researchers has raised concerns over the Select Agent Program. The Laboratory Response Network was established to have a lab in each state capable of handling dangerous pathogens. Tensions have risen in academia over the Select Agent Program, with some entities choosing to transfer or destroy their select agent inventories rather than comply with regulations. Investigations by agency Inspectors General have found compliance issues with select agent regulations in universities and laboratories. The HHS and USDA Inspectors General found non-compliance with select agent regulations in universities and laboratories, leading to fines and license withdrawals. The CDC suspended a select agent certificate at Texas A&M University for failure to report exposures and inadequate security measures. Other entities have also faced citations and fines for violations of select agent regulations. The HHS OIG fined 12 organizations $1,887,000 for not complying with Select Agent regulations. Scientists studying dangerous pathogens acknowledge the risks and have developed best practices over time. Biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) guide researchers in handling biological agents based on their danger level. Each level includes specific protections. The BMBL guidelines outline biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) with specific protections based on the pathogen's danger level. High-containment laboratories typically refer to BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs. The guidelines provide criteria for defining biosafety levels, best practices for safe lab operation, and mechanisms for determining the appropriate level for each organism and procedure. Biosafety levels are linked to a combination of pathogen and experiment, with primary and secondary barriers to infection described for each level. The Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) guidelines outline biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4) based on the pathogen's danger level. The correct biosafety level depends on the pathogen, its potential for transmission and treatment, and the research procedure being conducted. Researchers and laboratory workers at institutions receiving federal funds must be trained in BMBL procedures before accessing the laboratory. Procedures with potential for serious diseases should be conducted at BSL-3, while high-risk activities should be at BSL-4. Pathogens can be handled at lower biosafety levels based on the specific activity. Some dangerous pathogens can be managed outside high-containment facilities, as per BMBL guidelines. For example, anthrax can be handled at BSL-2 for certain activities and at BSL-3 for others. BSL-2 is for activities using clinical materials and diagnostic quantities of infectious cultures, while BSL-3 is for work involving production quantities or high concentrations of cultures. Some select agents require BSL-4 containment, while others may be studied at BSL-2 depending on circumstances. BSL-4 facilities in the US work with select agents and are regulated under the Select Agent Program. BMBL guidelines are widely adopted as best practices, with some mandatory compliance requirements. The BMBL guidelines are best practices for facilities under the Select Agent Program, with some mandatory compliance requirements for federal contracts and grants. Compliance with the guidelines is widely adopted as facility policy, and they are incorporated into building design standards, grant and contract requirements, and other federal regulations related to DNA research and the Select Agent Program. The BMBL guidelines are integrated into building design standards, grant and contract requirements, and federal regulations related to DNA research and the Select Agent Program. Federal facilities and those built with federal funds adhere to these guidelines, which include design specifications for systems like ventilation and access controls. NIH issues checklists to ensure compliance with security requirements before high-containment laboratories are occupied. The NIH has developed a guide for certifying or commissioning laboratories to ensure requirements are met before occupancy. Other agencies follow similar processes, contracting out the commissioning of labs at specific biosafety levels. The NIH Model Commissioning Guide recommends using specialized individuals, such as licensed Professional Engineers, with experience in designing, optimizing, and testing relevant systems. Laboratory facilities receiving federal funding must adhere to biosafety guidelines outlined in the BMBL to avoid potential withdrawal of current and future funding. Grantee organizations may be required to provide evidence of compliance with federal, state, and local health and safety standards upon request. Federal research grants involving recombinant DNA research typically follow similar compliance requirements. Federal research grants for recombinant DNA research require compliance with health and safety standards, including the creation of an institutional biosafety committee (IBC) to oversee research activities. The IBC determines the appropriate biosafety level for research and has the authority to enforce specific precautions. Some experts have raised concerns about the oversight provided by IBCs. The Select Agent Program regulations incorporate the BMBL guidelines by reference, making it mandatory for entities possessing select agents to develop security and biosafety plans. The number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories in the United States has increased significantly in recent years due to federal construction and funding for high-containment research activities. The expansion of high-containment laboratory space in the United States has increased twelve-fold since 2004, driven by federal construction and funding for research activities. Examples of federal investment in biocontainment laboratories are provided by the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture. The Department of Defense has maintained high-containment laboratories since World War II, conducting offensive and defensive research. The Department of Defense (DOD) has modernized its high-containment laboratory infrastructure, focusing on defensive research since President Nixon discontinued the offensive biological weapons program in 1969. The United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Frederick, MD, is the sole location of BSL-4 laboratory space in DOD, with ongoing expansion efforts. Other DOD laboratories have also increased their BSL-3 capacity or containment levels since 2001 for various research purposes. The DOD has modernized its high-containment laboratory infrastructure, including increasing BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratory space. The DOD maintains these laboratories for research on infectious diseases, vaccine evaluation, and bioforensic analysis. President Bush assigned bioforensic responsibility to the DHS in 2004, leading to the establishment of the National Bioforensics Analysis Center. Permanent facilities are under construction in Frederick, MD to accommodate BSL-4 and BSL-3 laboratories. The National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center, currently located in interim facilities at USAMRIID in Frederick, MD, is constructing permanent facilities including a BSL-4 laboratory and several BSL-3 laboratories for bioforensic and biological threat assessment activities. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS, which is now establishing the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF) to replace PIADC. The NBAF will focus on researching animal pathogens and developing countermeasures, expanding research capabilities for high-level biocontainment pathogens. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is expanding research capabilities for high-level biocontainment pathogens by constructing BSL-4 National Biocontainment Laboratories (NBLs) and BSL-3 Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) across the United States. These facilities will support biodefense research and assist public health efforts during bioterrorism or emerging infectious disease emergencies. The HHS is constructing BSL-4 National Biocontainment Laboratories (NBLs) and BSL-3 Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) in Boston, MA, and Galveston, TX. The LRN is a network of laboratories for public health activities, including response to bioterrorism and other emergencies. The USDA is building new BSL-3 laboratories for animal health research. The USDA is constructing new BSL-3 laboratories in Ames, IA and Fort Collins, CO. Academic institutions, like the University of Minnesota, Purdue University, and Ohio State University, are also investing in high-containment laboratory facilities to increase their ability to compete for federal funding. Private sector companies and non-profit institutions maintain high-containment laboratory facilities for medical testing and product development purposes. Private sector companies and non-profit institutions maintain high-containment laboratory facilities for medical testing, product development, and other purposes. Some companies choose to have in-house facilities, while others contract with firms like Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute and Battelle Memorial Institute. The expansion of high-containment laboratories has raised issues for policymakers, including determining appropriate capacity, increasing oversight, balancing desire for more capacity with increased risk, and addressing international and local concerns. The 2001 anthrax mailings highlighted the need for sufficient high-containment laboratory infrastructure. After the 2001 anthrax mailings, policymakers recognized the need for additional high-containment laboratory space due to increased risk and international concerns. The high capital and maintenance costs required federal investment, but decisions were made without a national needs assessment or coordinated plan. Concerns have been raised that the new capacity may exceed national needs or safety limits, with a lack of information hindering coordinated planning. The new high-containment laboratory capacity may exceed national needs or safety limits. Lack of information hinders coordinated planning. Estimates vary on the number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories, with criticism from experts. Registration with select agents does not always indicate high-containment lab use. Non-governmental estimates show significant increases in high-containment lab capability. The Government Accountability Office has documented an increase in high-containment laboratory capability, but the exact number of BSL-3 laboratories remains uncertain. A government-wide assessment involving multiple federal agencies may be necessary to determine if current and planned construction exceeds national needs. Congress may need to decide on conducting a survey at the agency level or through an external coordinating body. Increased funding for research, operations, and management will be necessary to fully utilize the additional capacity, especially for agencies experiencing a significant increase in high-containment laboratory capacity. Increased funding may be necessary for agencies undergoing a large increase in high-containment laboratory capacity to cover operations and maintenance costs. Interagency federal planning efforts could help reduce overcapacity costs, but would require agreement on prioritization and shared facility use among agencies. Individual agency initiatives may struggle to address synergies or redundancies between agencies, while higher-level strategies may not specify facility utilization. The coordination of high-containment laboratory use at the agency level or through central coordination is a key consideration for Congress. Concerns about pathogen release, biological weapon proliferation, and oversight of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories have led to a reexamination of the current regulatory framework. Consensus on the best approach to overseeing these laboratories has not been reached, with some analysts viewing the current self-regulatory approach as insufficient. Inadequate biosafety levels have prompted a reevaluation of the current oversight framework for high-containment laboratories. There is no consensus on the best approach, with some experts advocating for increased federal oversight and mandatory biosafety training, while others suggest enhancing self-regulation with more robust self-policing by scientists. The expansion of high-containment laboratory capacity has benefits such as enabling more biodefense research and efficient public health testing, but also raises concerns about the potential for theft or accidental release of dangerous pathogens. The increase in high-containment laboratories has benefits for biodefense research and public health testing, but also raises concerns about security and potential theft of dangerous pathogens. Legislation has been passed to enhance physical security, but security weaknesses have been identified at some facilities. Additional regulatory focus on compliance with the Select Agent Program may help minimize security risks. Accidents can still occur despite planning for safety controls. High-containment laboratories are designed to minimize accidents, but risks still exist. The GAO testified that each facility has inherent risks, which increase with more facilities. The incremental risk is hard to measure and depends on compliance with regulations. Policymakers may estimate costs and benefits of research in these labs, considering factors like accidental releases and subsequent illnesses. Breakthroughs in biodefense research, such as vaccines, are potential benefits. The expansion of high-containment laboratories raises concerns about personnel surety, specifically the \"insider threat\" posed by trained individuals with malicious intent. As more people are trained in high-containment techniques, the risk of insider threats increases. The expansion of high-containment laboratories requires additional trained technicians and scientists. The risk of insider threats increases as more people receive training in high-containment techniques. The DOJ believes the perpetrator of the 2001 anthrax mailings was a government scientist expert in high-containment technique. The increase in high-containment capacity may have international ramifications, leading to concerns about offensive biological weapons development. This could damage U.S. efforts to persuade other countries to adhere to the Biological Weapons Convention. The expansion of high-containment laboratories may lead to international proliferation of such facilities, increasing the risk of misuse. Differences in biosafety regulations among countries could impact business decisions of pharmaceutical companies, potentially affecting national capabilities to respond to bioterrorism or disease outbreaks. Countries relying on foreign production of disease treatments may face restricted access during emergencies. The construction of high-containment laboratories in different countries may impact international collaborations among scientists and lead to potential barriers in research and industry investments. Biosecurity regulations could influence the decision-making of pharmaceutical companies and affect access to disease treatments during emergencies. The presence of U.S. biosecurity standards may encourage other countries to develop similar policies. The construction of high-containment laboratories in the United States has faced local resistance, with some groups supporting the economic benefits while others oppose it due to public health and security concerns. Policymakers have various options to address these issues. Policymakers have options to address concerns about high-containment laboratories, including current oversight efforts and potential for additional actions to balance security controls with research productivity. While the community supports measures to reduce the threat of terrorists acquiring deadly pathogens, there is strong opposition to measures that hinder research. Policymakers may find current oversight of high-containment laboratories sufficient, with some in the scientific community supporting no additional action. Supporters of the status quo argue that focusing on identifying potential bioterrorists is more effective than implementing new regulations. Additional resources for intelligence on bioterror groups could disrupt activities at a lower cost than new regulatory frameworks affecting domestic scientists. If current oversight is deemed insufficient, policymakers may choose to defer action. President Bush created expert groups to examine biosafety and biosecurity issues, including the Working Group on Strengthening Biosecurity of the United States. Congress may choose to wait for their recommendations before taking action. Some policymakers may require additional studies despite these efforts. President Bush established the Working Group on Strengthening the Biosecurity of the United States through an Executive Order. This group, consisting of various government officials, is tasked with reviewing and evaluating existing laws and practices related to biosecurity. Recommendations are due in July 2009. Additionally, the HHS announced the formation of the Trans-Federal Task Force on Optimizing Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight in October 2007. The HHS formed the Trans-Federal Task Force on Biosafety and Biocontainment Oversight in October 2007. The task force, co-chaired by HHS and USDA, includes staff from various government agencies. Recommendations on biosafety and biocontainment oversight at high-containment laboratories will be presented to HHS and USDA leadership. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is developing policies on dual-use research. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity is developing policies for dual-use research, including oversight, a code of conduct, and biosafety training programs. The Board has working groups producing analysis and recommendations. The GAO is expected to release a report in 2009 on high-containment laboratory issues with potential legislative and executive branch recommendations. Congress may benefit from waiting for these recommendations to avoid duplication and generate new policy ideas. Several policy options may facilitate Congress addressing high-containment laboratories issues without waiting for executive branch or GAO reports. Efforts to determine the number and capacity of such laboratories have been unsuccessful, with calls for a comprehensive inventory of existing capacity from various sources. Non-federal high-containment laboratories are located in academic research institutions, public health agencies, and industrial research facilities, making compiling a comprehensive inventory a challenging task. A voluntary self-reporting mechanism could be considered. Efforts to identify high-containment laboratories have been challenging due to their diverse locations and work. A voluntary self-reporting mechanism may not be sufficient to gather information on existing facilities. Incentivizing self-reporting or mandating registration with the federal government could help create a comprehensive inventory of these laboratories. This registry could provide valuable information on laboratory capacity and usage. Efforts to identify high-containment laboratories have been challenging due to their diverse locations and work. A registry of these laboratories could provide valuable information on capacity and usage, potentially aiding in efficient resource allocation and planning. The government could efficiently plan for high-containment laboratory capacity and resource allocation by conducting a needs assessment. Comparing existing capacity with the needs assessment can help prevent overexpansion and security concerns. Congress may consider the economic costs of surveying laboratories and the benefits of comparing the survey with a needs assessment. Some policymakers suggest a moratorium on new federally funded laboratories. Some policymakers have called for a moratorium on new federally funded construction of high-containment laboratories and a decrease in the proposed final number of laboratories. Policymakers need to weigh the benefits of constructing the right amount of laboratory capacity versus the potential costs of overbuilding. Without a government-wide capacity needs assessment, building additional laboratories increases the risk of redundancy and overcapacity. Incremental increases in high-containment laboratory capacity may be more beneficial than constructing large amounts of new laboratory space. Some agencies argue for incremental increases in high-containment laboratory capacity rather than constructing new facilities, citing dated infrastructure as a reason for expansion. However, without a government-wide assessment, potential synergies and available infrastructure in other agencies may be overlooked. Enacting a construction moratorium could impact the federal government's ability to meet national research goals. Delays in construction of laboratory facilities may hinder national research goals and priorities, such as establishing a permanent bioforensics capability. Calls for expanding high-containment laboratory facilities have been made, with suggestions to license and certify all high-containment laboratories. One proposed approach is to apply Select Agent Program requirements to all high-containment laboratories. One approach to regulating high-containment laboratories is to apply Select Agent Program requirements universally. Alternatively, a separate licensing program could offer flexibility based on the presence of select agents. Challenges in implementing and gaining acceptance for laboratory licensing and certification exist, as they may not cover all relevant laboratories. A more comprehensive approach to regulating laboratories capable of BSL-2 or higher containment is suggested, which would capture all locations with sufficient biosecurity for select agent use. This approach would impact various types of laboratories, including public health, diagnostic, hospital, industrial, and academic facilities. Another proposed approach involves expanding the select agent list to include more dangerous pathogens not currently regulated by the Select Agent Program. Expanding the select agent list to include more dangerous pathogens not covered by the current regulations has been suggested. Some experts argue that the current list does not capture all potentially dangerous diseases like SARS, dengue fever, and yellow fever. This expansion would mean more high-containment facilities would be regulated, but some scientists are concerned about the specificity of the current list in differentiating between pathogens of concern and others. The NIH has requested the National Academies to determine the scientific advances needed to identify select agents accurately. The NIH has requested the National Academies to determine scientific advances necessary to identify select agents based on features beyond taxonomy. Regulatory impacts would only affect entities using pathogens of concern, potentially limiting disruption of scientific development and public health activities. Background checks for personnel in BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities could be expanded. Efforts to enhance personnel oversight at high-containment facilities may face challenges, such as resistance to government documentation and certification of laboratory researchers. Some scientists may choose to leave research fields requiring high-containment laboratories rather than undergo the necessary government clearance. The Department of Defense maintains more extensive personnel oversight programs than required. Efforts to enhance personnel oversight at high-containment facilities may be challenging due to potential resistance to government clearance. The Department of Defense has more extensive personnel oversight programs, but there have been instances of misconduct, such as the 2001 anthrax mailings by a DOD scientist. The Select Agent Program requires worker training tailored to individual needs and work risks, but there is a need for standardized training to ensure core competencies are met. Experts suggest expanding biosafety training programs to meet current demand. Some experts recommend expanding biosafety training programs to meet current demand. Training could range from voluntary local programs to mandatory federal certification. Enhanced training may reduce laboratory infections but may not address biosecurity vulnerabilities. Including considerations for dual-use pathogens could improve biosecurity understanding among high-containment lab workers. Lessons from incidents can inform future training and reporting mechanisms. Enhancing reporting mechanisms in high-containment laboratories is crucial to learning from incidents and improving practices. The fear of penalties or professional repercussions may hinder reporting, leading to a lack of information sharing. Experts suggest establishing a database of accidents and remediation efforts to prevent future incidents. Experts recommend enhancing the reporting system by creating a database of accidents and remedies to prevent future incidents. They suggest coupling this database with the Select Agent Program reporting requirements and minimizing penalties for reporting accidents. Policymakers need to balance increasing oversight with regulatory burden, considering potential resistance from scientists and stakeholders. Policymakers must balance increasing oversight with regulatory burden, facing resistance from scientists and stakeholders. Expanding the Select Agent Program could hinder public health response and international collaboration. Critics argue that the program's requirements may impede timely transfer of materials between laboratories, impacting public health response negatively. International collaboration may also be affected by the program's scope and certification requirements. Increasing the scope of the Select Agent Program may hinder international collaboration and public health response. Licensing and certification requirements could impact scientists not involved in biodefense activities, leading to reduced productivity. Regulatory activities may incur costs for public health laboratories and hospitals, requiring additional federal resources for oversight. Identifying the appropriate oversight agency remains a challenge. One challenge in expanding oversight of biosafety and biosecurity programs is determining the most suitable regulatory agency. Historically, USDA and HHS were considered appropriate regulators due to their technical expertise and relationships with the scientific community. However, with increasing homeland security concerns, policymakers may consider DHS as a more suitable agency. Depending on whether existing authorities are augmented or new ones are created, oversight could be carried out by the agency with statutory authority or a combination of agencies. The expansion of oversight for biosafety and biosecurity programs poses challenges in determining the most suitable regulatory agency. Policymakers may consider DHS as a more appropriate agency due to increasing homeland security concerns. If new authorities are developed, a mixture of oversight authority may occur, with one agency regulating security under the Select Agent Program and another regulating high-containment laboratories. Harmonizing new requirements with existing ones and deciding whether to consolidate oversight into one agency are important for smooth implementation. Additional funding and staffing may be necessary for agencies to meet new mandates. Legislation addressing these issues has been introduced in the 111th Congress. Legislation introduced in the 111th Congress addresses the Select Agent Program, expanding criteria for pathogens, requiring National Academy of Sciences review, mandating biosafety training, and improving monitoring procedures. The bills also call for evaluation of current laboratory capacity, sharing lessons learned, and streamlining guidance on infrastructure. The Laboratory Surge Capacity Preparedness Act (H.R. 1150) directs the USDA Secretary to evaluate current and planned capacity, share lessons learned, improve guidance on laboratory infrastructure, and establish a Biological Laboratory Incident Reporting System. It also authorizes DHS to award grants to Regional Biocontainment Laboratories for operation and maintenance costs, and requires a report on integrating the RBL network and assessing the need for additional BSL-3 laboratory surge capacity. The need for additional BSL-3 laboratory surge capacity to effectively respond to biodefense or emerging infectious disease emergencies is highlighted. International harmonization of biocontainment technologies is crucial to address the threat of high-containment laboratories being used for bioterrorism. Congressional policymakers face the challenge of defining the goal of enhanced oversight for high-containment laboratories, which can impact policy choices and security benefits. Enhanced oversight programs for high-containment laboratories may offer security benefits but come with regulatory burdens, increased costs, and hindered scientific progress. Policymakers must balance competing national needs when considering policy options for addressing these complex issues."
