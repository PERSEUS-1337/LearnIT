    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Alternative Energy Refueling System Act of 2006\" and pertains to alternative energy refueling systems. The Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to include definitions for alternative energy refueling systems, which are used to refuel vehicles with various alternative fuels. Eligible entities are defined in the Act. The Administrator will establish a reimbursement program for eligible entities to cover costs of purchasing and installing alternative energy refueling systems. Eligible entities include refueling vendors or owners of facilities with these systems. The Administrator will establish a reimbursement program for eligible entities to cover costs of purchasing and installing alternative energy refueling systems. Eligible entities must submit an application for reimbursement, and once the system is verified to be operational, reimbursement will be provided within 30 days. The Administrator will provide reimbursement to eligible entities for installing operational alternative energy refueling systems. An entity cannot receive reimbursement if they have already received a tax credit for a similar system. The Administrator will reimburse eligible entities for up to 2 alternative energy refueling systems per facility. The reimbursement amount for each system will not exceed the cost of the system. The Administrator will reimburse eligible entities for up to 2 alternative energy refueling systems per facility, with a maximum reimbursement of 30 percent of the system cost or $30,000. This reimbursement will not affect other trust fund projects or activities. The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 and the Alternative Energy Refueling System Act of 2006 amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The responsibilities of owners or operators to comply with other provisions of the subtitle remain unaffected."
