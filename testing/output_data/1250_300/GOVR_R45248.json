    "content": "Under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), agencies must submit a report to Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) before a rule can take effect. For major rules, there is an additional waiting period for Congress to review. GAO must also provide a report on major rules to Congress within 15 days. Members of Congress can use expedited procedures to overturn a rule, primarily in the Senate. Under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), Congress must act on a resolution of disapproval within specified time periods to utilize expedited procedures, mainly in the Senate. These procedures include discharging a Senate committee with a petition signed by 30 Senators, a nondebatable motion to proceed to consider the disapproval resolution, up to 10 hours of debate, and a simple majority vote. No amendments are allowed, and the resolution requires a simple majority to pass. If both houses pass the resolution, it goes to the President for signature or veto, with the option for Congress to override a veto. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to override a rule by passing a joint resolution of disapproval within specified deadlines. If the resolution is signed by the President or Congress overrides a veto, the rule is deemed not to have any effect. The CRA also prohibits a similar rule from being issued unless authorized by a subsequent law. The CRA applies to rules issued by federal agencies, as defined in the APA. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to override rules issued by federal agencies, excluding actions of the President. The CRA defines \"rule\" broadly as agency statements implementing law or policy, with exceptions outlined in the APA. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to override agency rules, defined broadly as statements implementing law or policy, with exceptions outlined in the APA. The APA defines \"rule\" as agency statements of general or particular applicability designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy. The CRA narrows this definition by excluding rules of particular applicability, agency management or personnel rules, and rules that do not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. The CRA allows Congress to override agency rules, defined broadly as statements implementing law or policy, with exceptions outlined in the APA. Determining if an agency action is a rule under the CRA involves a two-part inquiry: first, if it qualifies as a rule under the APA definition, and second, if it falls within exceptions to the CRA's definition of rule. The APA's definition of \"rule\" is expansive but not every agency action is encompassed. To qualify as a rule, an agency statement must be of general applicability, have future effect, and be designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law. The CRA allows Congress to override agency rules, defined broadly as statements implementing law or policy, with exceptions outlined in the APA. To qualify as a rule, an agency statement must be of general applicability, have future effect, and be designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law. The CRA defines the word \"rule\" by incorporating the APA's definition, with exemptions for rules of particular applicability, agency management or personnel, and rules that do not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. The interpretation of \"rule\" under the CRA may be influenced by cases interpreting the APA's definition. The APA provides a framework for agency actions, distinguishing rules from orders and investigatory acts. Courts look beyond labels to determine if an action is a rule or order. The CRA relies on the APA's definition of \"rule,\" with exemptions for certain types of rules. In determining agency actions as rules or orders under the APA, courts consider the substance rather than the label. Adjudications resolve specific disputes, while rulemaking affects broad classes of individuals. Rulemaking is prospective and has a definitive effect after application, unlike adjudications. Agency investigations, such as compelling information submission, may not always be subject to rulemaking requirements but can qualify as rules in some cases. When agencies conduct investigative actions like requiring reports, they may not be subject to APA rulemaking requirements. However, some investigative actions may qualify as rules if they meet certain criteria. For example, a federal court of appeals found that procedures governing an agency's decision to investigate can be considered a rule. To qualify as a rule under the APA, an agency statement must be of general or particular applicability, have future effect, and be designed to implement law or policy. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has noted that most agency statements will meet the first requirement. The second requirement, that a rule have future effect, is subject to some ambiguity. The second requirement for a rule under the APA is that it must have \"future effect.\" Courts have interpreted this to mean that rules must operate prospectively and have legal consequences only for the future. This distinction separates rules from orders, which can have both future and past legal consequences. Judge Silberman of the D.C. Circuit argued that not every agency statement with future effect should be considered a rule under the APA, but only those that authoritatively answer a policy or legal issue. This raises questions about the binding nature of agency statements and the distinction between binding rules and notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. The case law reading on \"future effect\" and APA rules does not clarify how to differentiate between agency actions subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. Courts distinguish between \"legislative\" rules requiring notice-and-comment and \"interpretive\" rules that are not legally binding. The \"future effect\" inquiry determines if an agency action is a rule under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7551(4), while the \"legal effect\" inquiry determines if the rule is subject to notice-and-comment procedures under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7553. These tests are tied to distinct statutory provisions and should not both hinge on whether a rule is legally binding. The distinction between \"legislative\" and \"interpretive\" rules under the APA is crucial in determining if agency actions are subject to notice-and-comment procedures. Courts have held that interpretive rules, although not legally binding, still qualify as rules under the APA. Agency actions must be designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy to be considered APA rules. Documents that merely restate existing law or do not change any law or policy are not considered rules under the APA. The APA outlines rulemaking procedures for agencies to follow when formulating, amending, or repealing rules. Notice-and-comment rulemaking requires agencies to publish proposed rules in the Federal Register and allow public comment. However, not all agency actions classified as \"rules\" under the APA require compliance with rulemaking procedures. Interpretative rules, general policy statements, and agency organizational rules are exempt from notice-and-comment requirements. The APA exempts certain agency actions from notice-and-comment rulemaking, such as interpretative rules and general policy statements. Courts often classify agency guidance documents as interpretative rules or general policy statements, which do not require formal rulemaking procedures. The key factor is whether the agency action imposes new obligations or prohibitions. The distinction between interpretive rules, general policy statements, and legislative rules is based on whether the agency action binds private parties or the agency itself with the force of law. General policy statements are not legally binding and do not require notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. Some cases suggest that general policy statements may not be considered rules under the APA definition. The binding effect requirement is crucial in determining whether a statement qualifies as an APA rule. The CRA incorporates the APA definition of \"rule\" by reference, and should likely be read to incorporate judicial constructions of that definition. Some courts have imported the APA's distinction between rules and orders when interpreting the CRA, suggesting that agency actions through orders or investigatory acts may not always meet the requirements of the law. Some courts have applied the APA's distinction between rules and orders to the CRA, indicating that agency actions through orders or investigatory acts may not always comply with the CRA. The CRA does not explicitly mention agency \"orders,\" leading to debates on whether certain guidance documents qualify as CRA \"rules.\" The term \"guidance document\" is not defined under the CRA or the APA, but agency statements labeled as guidance may still be considered \"rules\" under the CRA. The key question is whether these guidance documents fall within the statutory definition of \"rule\" and if they are exempt from the CRA under any exceptions. The CRA does not explicitly exclude agency \"orders\" from its definition of \"rules,\" leading to debates on whether certain guidance documents qualify as CRA \"rules.\" Agency guidance documents exempt from APA's notice-and-comment procedures may still be subject to the CRA, if they do not fall within its exceptions. However, the impact of a disapproval resolution on such guidance documents may be limited as they generally lack legal effect. The CRA may apply to agency guidance documents exempt from APA's notice-and-comment procedures, even if they do not fall within its exceptions. The post-enactment legislative history of the CRA indicates that it was intended to cover a wide range of agency actions. The CRA may apply to a broad range of agency activities, including policy statements and interpretive rules, despite not being subject to APA's notice-and-comment requirements. GAO has determined that general policy statements should be considered \"rules\" under the CRA, providing clarity on which agency actions are covered by the law. The CRA incorporates the APA definition of rule but exempts rules of particular applicability, agency management or personnel, and agency organization or practice not affecting non-agency parties' rights. The CRA does not apply to monetary policy rules by the Federal Reserve. The CRA exempts rules concerning monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and rules of particular applicability. It allows agencies to determine when a rule takes effect, despite CRA requirements. The CRA does not require rules to generally apply to the population as a whole to be considered generally applicable. The CRA does not require rules to generally apply to the population as a whole. GAO has stated that a rule only needs to have general applicability within its intended range, regardless of the magnitude of that range. Examples of rules of particular applicability include those concerning rates, wages, prices, services, corporate structures, mergers, and accounting practices. The CRA exempts rules that approve future rates, wages, prices, services, corporate structures, mergers, or accounting practices. It also excludes rules related to agency management or personnel, such as hiring policies. This exemption covers internal matters that do not substantially affect parties outside the agency. The CRA's second exemption covers internal agency matters like hiring policies, not affecting external parties. The substantial-effect requirement from the APA may not apply to the CRA. The third exemption mentions a rule's impact on third parties, suggesting intentional differences in language by Congress. The CRA's second exception excludes rules related to agency management or personnel without considering their impact on third parties, potentially broadening its scope compared to the APA. Congress may have omitted the substantial-effect requirement in this exception due to prior judicial interpretation. The third exception includes a substantial-effect requirement to clarify ambiguity in cases interpreting similar provisions in the APA. The CRA also exempts rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice that do not substantially affect non-agency parties, similar to the APA's exclusion of such rules from notice-and-comment rulemaking. The CRA exempts rules related to agency management or personnel without considering their impact on third parties, potentially broadening its scope compared to the APA. The APA also excludes rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice from notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures. Courts have interpreted this APA exception to include agency decisions on how regulated entities must meet investigative requirements. The impact on a third party is not the sole factor in distinguishing between substantive and procedural rules under the APA. Courts use the substantial impact test to differentiate between substantive and procedural rules under the CRA. The D.C. Circuit also considers whether a rule encodes a substantive value judgment. The CRA excludes rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice that do not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. This mandates a similar test to the substantial impact test to determine if a rule falls within this exception. The CRA mandates a test similar to the substantial impact test to determine if a rule falls within the exception. The focus is on the effect on non-agency parties' rights or obligations, covering rules with a minor effect. The GAO sometimes uses APA case law to analyze if actions fall under the CRA, but the tests may not directly apply. Agencies must submit actions falling under the CRA's rule definition to Congress and GAO before they take effect. The CRA requires agencies to submit rules to Congress and GAO before they take effect. This includes providing a report with a copy of the rule, a general statement, and information on cost-benefit analysis. GAO assesses compliance with these requirements for major rules. The Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act require agencies to submit a report along with major rules to Congress and GAO. The report must include information on compliance with additional requirements, and a standard form issued by OMB is used for this purpose. The report is due within 15 days of rule submission or publication in the Federal Register. Submission of rules to Congress under the CRA is crucial as it triggers expedited procedures for considering a resolution of disapproval. The receipt of the rule in Congress initiates the CRA's fast-track procedures, allowing Members to consider a joint resolution to disapprove the rule. Failure to submit a rule to Congress would prevent the House and Senate from utilizing these special procedures. The CRA's expedited procedures for introducing and considering a joint resolution disapproving a rule are triggered when an agency fails to submit a rule to Congress. Concerns were raised about agencies not complying with the submission requirement, leading to hearings in 1997 and 1998. In 1998, Congress required OMB to issue guidance to improve agency compliance with the CRA, resulting in a memorandum issued by then-OMB Director Jacob J. Lew in March 1999. In response to concerns about agency compliance with the CRA, Congress mandated OMB to issue guidance on the submission requirement. OMB Director Jacob J. Lew's 1999 memorandum provided instructions on where agencies should send their rules, what information to include, and which rules needed to be submitted. GAO began monitoring agencies' compliance by comparing final rules published in the Federal Register with those submitted to GAO voluntarily. This review aimed to ensure all final rules under the CRA were properly submitted. The GAO conducted voluntary reviews to ensure agency compliance with the Congressional Review Act submission requirement. They submitted a list of rules not filed with Congress to OIRA for distribution to affected agencies. GAO followed up with agencies in February 1998 to address un-submitted rules. The GAO conducted reviews to ensure agency compliance with the Congressional Review Act submission requirement. They submitted a list of rules not filed with Congress to OIRA for distribution to affected agencies. GAO recommended OIRA to play a more proactive role in ensuring agency compliance. Until 2012, GAO regularly followed up with agencies regarding un-submitted rules. In March 2012, GAO informed OIRA that they would only track major rules not received due to resource constraints. Agencies generally submit rules to Congress and GAO comprehensively, with exceptions noted by GAO. Despite agencies generally submitting rules to Congress and GAO comprehensively, there are exceptions noted by GAO. Agencies often do not fulfill the submission requirement for rules that are not subject to notice-and-comment procedures, making tracking compliance more difficult. GAO's methodology for tracking agency compliance did not result in a complete list of agency actions that should have been submitted. Comparing regulations published in the Federal Register against regulations received pursuant to the CRA was used as a reference point, but many agency actions not subject to notice-and-comment requirements are not published in the Federal Register or submitted to GAO. The difficulty in tracking compliance with the submission requirement for rules not subject to notice-and-comment procedures led to many rules going undetected by GAO. This issue prompted Members to request GAO's opinion on specific agency actions not submitted to Congress or published in the Federal Register. The high rate of noncompliance is attributed to the challenge of submitting various agency statements that qualify as rules under the CRA. The CRA's submission requirement includes a wide variety of items such as FAQs, press releases, bulletins, and statements made by agency officials. Agencies take tens of thousands of actions annually that could fall under the CRA's definition of a rule. Compliance with the submission requirement could overwhelm Congress and the GAO with filings, potentially diverting attention from larger, controversial matters. Many agencies may be unaware of the full extent of the CRA's coverage. Many agencies may be unaware of the full extent of the CRA's coverage, leading to potential challenges in identifying which actions are subject to the submission requirement. GAO has highlighted instances where agencies have disputed whether certain guidance documents are considered rules under the CRA, emphasizing the need for clarity and awareness among agencies regarding the CRA's coverage. The GAO disagreed with HHS's stance that guidance documents are not subject to the CRA's submission requirement. Congress relies on agencies submitting rules for review under the CRA, but the Senate has a practice of seeking GAO opinions on whether agency actions should have been submitted. This practice has been used multiple times since the CRA's enactment in 1996. Since 1996, Members of Congress have sought GAO opinions on whether certain agency actions are covered by the CRA, even without notice-and-comment rulemaking. GAO has issued 21 opinions, defining \"rule\" expansively. In 11 cases, GAO determined agency statements should have been submitted to Congress. The Senate uses GAO opinions to trigger the CRA's disapproval process, making the nature of GAO's opinion crucial. The Senate can use GAO opinions to trigger the CRA's expedited disapproval process for rules. GAO plays a significant role in determining if agency actions qualify under the CRA, even though its specific role is not explicitly defined in the statute. The history of CRA implementation and GAO's activities suggest a link between GAO's role in defining rules and its other responsibilities under the CRA. GAO voluntarily created an online database of rules submitted under the CRA, going beyond its required role to facilitate implementation. The database allows searching for rules by various elements and contains links to GAO's major rule reports. The GAO created an online database of rules submitted under the CRA, allowing searches by various elements. GAO's determination of agency actions as \"rules\" under the CRA is linked to monitoring agency compliance. In a congressional hearing in 1997, GAO's role in determining if the Tongass Land Management Plan should be considered a rule was discussed. In 1997, GAO's role in determining if the Tongass Land Management Plan should be considered a rule under the CRA was discussed. GAO's general counsel stated that the CRA does not specify who decides what constitutes a rule, unlike the identification of major rules. The GAO's role in determining if the Tongass Land Management Plan should be considered a rule under the CRA was discussed. GAO's general counsel stated that the CRA does not specify who decides what constitutes a rule, unlike the identification of major rules. GAO acknowledged that its opinion was provided in an advisory capacity to Congress, not pursuant to any specific provision of the statute. Members have requested GAO opinions on the applicability of the CRA, with varying responses from Congress over time. In response to GAO opinions on the applicability of the CRA, Congress's reactions have varied over time. Initially, there were no joint resolutions of disapproval introduced following GAO opinions until 2008. Senator John D. Rockefeller introduced S.J.Res. 44 in response to a GAO opinion on a letter from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, but the Committee on Finance did not take further action due to missing the window for expedited procedures under the CRA. The House and Senate took action on resolutions of disapproval following GAO opinions in 2012 and 2018, respectively. GAO opinions on agency actions under the CRA are advisory and do not have legal effect. The GAO opinions on agency actions under the CRA are advisory and do not have legal effect, but the Senate has treated them as dispositive. Once a GAO opinion is published in the Congressional Record, the agency action becomes subject to the CRA disapproval mechanism. Congress has shown willingness to consider GAO opinions as a substitute for agency submissions, as seen in the enactment of a joint resolution of disapproval in May 2018 following a GAO opinion on a 2013 CFPB bulletin. The GAO opinions facilitate congressional review of rules not submitted under the CRA. A provision in the CRA prevents judicial review of GAO opinions or congressional determinations regarding rule applicability. This allows Congress to use GAO opinions to address agency failures to submit rules for review. The provision in the CRA prevents judicial review of GAO opinions or congressional determinations regarding rule applicability, allowing Congress to use GAO opinions to address agency failures to submit rules for review. This means that the question of whether an agency action is subject to the CRA and its fast-track procedures will likely be settled in the political arena rather than in the courts. The provision barring judicial review may also impact whether a rule has taken effect, as agencies must submit covered rules to Congress before they can become operative. The CRA requires agencies to submit rules to Congress before they can take effect, but courts have been hesitant to enforce this provision. If an agency fails to submit a rule, it may be due to the agency's belief that the rule is not subject to the CRA. A GAO opinion stating that an agency action constitutes a rule could be the first indication to the agency that the rule did not take effect. The GAO opinion may indicate to an agency that a rule did not take effect due to non-compliance with the CRA submission requirement. The term \"effect\" in the CRA may not always refer to legal effectiveness, especially for non-legislative rules. Some courts have ruled that the CRA can suspend a rule's operation, even if it technically became effective. The CRA can suspend a rule's operation, even if it technically became effective. GAO opinions determine if agency actions are eligible for disapproval under the CRA. The Emergency Sale Timber Program was part of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act of 1995. The Emergency Sale Timber Program was enacted to increase salvage timber sales for forest health. A memorandum from the Secretary of Agriculture provided policy clarifications. GAO determined the memorandum was a rule under the CRA. The Tongass National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan was issued in 2007. The Tongass National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan issued in 2007 was determined to be a rule under the CRA by the GAO. President Clinton's Executive Order 13061 regarding the American Heritage River Initiative was not considered a rule under the CRA. The GAO determined that Executive Order 13061 regarding the American Heritage River Initiative was not considered a rule under the CRA. However, the Environmental Protection Agency issued Interim Guidance for investigating Title VI complaints challenging permits, which was deemed a rule under the CRA. Additionally, the Farm Credit Administration published a booklet providing guidance on the national charter application process. The Farm Credit Administration published a booklet in the Federal Register on July 20, 2000, providing guidance on the national charter application process and territory. The GAO concluded that the booklet constituted a rule under the CRA and was not exempt, as it would have an effect on non-agency parties. The Trinity River Record of Decision (ROD) was issued in December 2000 by the Department of the Interior. The Farm Credit Administration published a booklet in July 2000 regarding national charter application guidance. The Trinity River Record of Decision (ROD) issued in December 2000 by the Department of the Interior aimed to restore anadromous fish in the Trinity River. GAO determined the ROD as a \"rule\" under the CRA due to its policy-setting nature and potential impact on river ecosystems and economies. In July 2002, the Department of Veterans Affairs issued a memorandum to network directors on marketing activities for enrolling new veterans in the VA health care system. The VA issued a memorandum directing network directors to stop certain activities for enrolling new veterans in the health care system. GAO determined the memorandum was not a rule under the CRA as it only affected internal agency procedures and did not impact veterans' ability to enroll. Additionally, the VA terminated the Vendee Loan Program through a memorandum, stating it would no longer finance the sale of acquired properties. GAO also concluded this memorandum was not a rule under the CRA. The VA Secretary announced the termination of financing for the sale of acquired properties in a memorandum. GAO determined the memorandum did not constitute a rule under the CRA as it pertained to agency management and did not affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. On August 17, 2007, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a letter regarding the State Children's Health Insurance Program. On August 17, 2007, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a letter to state health officials regarding the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and the prevention of crowd out for states providing coverage to children with family incomes over 250 percent of the federal poverty level. GAO determined the letter was a rule under the CRA. On July 12, 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families issued an information memorandum about the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, offering waiver authority for some work requirements. The Department of Health and Human Services issued an information memorandum regarding the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, offering waiver authority for some work requirements. The memorandum was considered a rule under the CRA by GAO. On January 8, 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a proposed rule for greenhouse gas emissions from electric utility generating units. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that proposed rules are not covered by the Congressional Review Act (CRA). Additionally, on March 22, 2013, interagency guidance on leveraged lending was issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. On March 22, 2013, interagency guidance on leveraged lending was issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. GAO concluded that the leveraged-lending guidance was a rule under the CRA. On December 9, 2016, the Forest Service approved an amendment to the Tongass Land and Resource Management Plan, identifying uses in the forest. GAO determined the amendment was a substantive rule under the CRA, impacting the regulated community. Despite USDA's argument, the plan did not fall under an exception. On December 30, 2016, the Bureau of Land Management issued a resource management plan for four areas in Alaska. On December 30, 2016, the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management issued a resource management plan for four areas in Alaska, in accordance with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The plan was considered a rule under the CRA by the GAO due to its general applicability and future effect. The plan did not fall under any exceptions, including the designation of uses by nonagency parties in the areas it governed. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a bulletin on \"Indirect Auto Lending and Compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act\" in 2013. The bulletin provided guidance on fair lending requirements for indirect auto lenders. GAO determined the bulletin to be a rule under the CRA in 2017. President Trump released a memorandum on global health assistance funding in 2017, known as the \"Mexico City Policy,\" which prohibited funding to organizations promoting abortion for family planning. The Mexico City Policy, established by President Trump in 2017, prohibited funding to foreign organizations promoting abortion for family planning. The Department of State and USAID issued fact sheets and revisions to implement this policy, which were deemed not reviewable under the APA based on a 1989 court case. The court case DKT Memorial Fund v. Agency for International Development held that agency actions implementing President Reagan's Mexico City Policy were not reviewable under the APA. The court concluded that it did not have authority to review the President's policy decisions in foreign affairs. GAO determined that agency actions implementing President Trump's policy decision were also not subject to the CRA. IRS announced it would not accept electronically filed tax returns without ACA reporting requirements. GAO concluded this statement was not a rule under the CRA. The GAO concluded that the IRS statement regarding ACA reporting requirements was not a rule under the CRA as it only changed the timing of compliance measures, not the basis for assessing taxpayers' compliance. Additionally, the GAO found that two sections of the SSA's HALLEX manual regarding the use of internet information in disability benefit claims were not rules under the CRA. The GAO found that two sections of the SSA's HALLEX manual regarding internet information in disability benefit claims were not rules under the CRA. The IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2018-38, modifying reporting requirements for tax-exempt entities, submitted to Congress under the CRA. The IRS submitted Revenue Procedure 2018-38 under the CRA, but later argued it was not covered by the definition of \"rule.\" GAO's opinion focused on whether the submission triggered CRA timelines, not on the rule's definition. The GAO confirmed that the IRS revenue procedure was available for congressional review under the CRA because the IRS had already submitted it, triggering Congress's oversight powers. The GAO stated that their opinion was unnecessary as Congress was not deprived of its powers under the CRA. The Attorney General's zero-tolerance policy for illegal border crossings was also determined not to be a rule under the CRA by the GAO. The Attorney General issued a zero-tolerance policy for illegal border crossings at the southwestern border in April 2018. GAO determined it was not a rule under the CRA as it pertained to agency organization and did not change rights or obligations. The Secretary of Commerce justified adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census in a memorandum to the Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs. The Department of Justice directed the Census Bureau to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) concluded that the directive was not a rule under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) as it was part of the statutory process and did not meet the definition of a rule under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)."
