    "content": "Title VI of the Higher Education Act authorizes grants to institutions for enhancing foreign language and area studies. The program has a long history of supporting courses in less commonly taught languages and regions, reflecting federal priorities on diplomacy, national security, and trade competitiveness. Interest in federal programs supporting FLAS has increased due to concerns about terrorism from foreign regions. The report provides an overview of Title VI programs, focusing on reauthorization issues and funding allocation. Interest in FLAS programs has grown due to concerns about terrorism from regions not commonly included in American curricula. The appropriation for Title VI remained at $93.1 million in FY2007 and $95.6 million in FY2008, with discretion given to the U.S. Department of Education in allocating funds among specific activities. The U.S. Department of Education has discretion in allocating funds for Title VI programs, with separate authorization levels for Parts A, B, and C. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 authorized funding through 2005, with specific allocations for each part. The last specific authorization was in FY1999, with a majority of funds going towards National Language and Area Centers and FLAS Fellowships. Under HEA Title VI, the majority of funds are allocated to National Language and Area Centers (NLACs) and FLAS Fellowships. These programs are the core activities supported, with other smaller-scale supplementary activities also funded. Funds are distributed competitively, with an emphasis on excellence and equitable distribution. The Title VI programs allocate funds competitively based on excellence and equitable distribution. Earmarks were included in previous appropriations acts, specifying languages or regions for specialization. The FY2002 and FY2004 appropriations acts included provisions for increased funds. The Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2004 and subsequent legislation retained provisions for directing Title VI funds to specific world regions and languages, aiming to sustain investments in training experts with foreign language proficiency. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 contained no constraints on language emphasis or fund distribution, earmarking one percent for program evaluation and $1,500,000 for outreach and dissemination. The H.Rept. 108-792 and conference report do not impose constraints on language emphasis or fund distribution for Title VI programs. One percent of the total appropriation is earmarked for program evaluation and $1,500,000 for outreach and information dissemination. Evaluations of HEA Title VI programs are mainly conducted by the National Foreign Language Center (NFLC). Funds from the International Research and Studies program can be used for assessing the effects of HEA Title VI programs. The NFLC has received funds to develop the \"Evaluation of Exchange, Language, International and Area Studies (EELIAS) Project\" to meet evaluation and assessment needs. The EELIAS project aims to evaluate HEA Title VI programs and Fulbright-Hays program, develop performance indicators and data reporting system, assess the need for foreign language and international studies, and conduct internal and external evaluations over a five-year period. A 2000 report by NFLC evaluated the impact of foreign language components on national language capacity. The 2000 report by NFLC evaluated the impact of HEA Title VI support on maintaining the nation's capacity in less commonly taught languages, which are strategically important for the United States. It found that IHEs receiving Title VI NLAC grants enroll a majority of graduate students in these languages and that Title VI grants have supported the development of over half of the textbooks used in these languages. The Higher Education Act may be up for reauthorization during the 110th Congress. The Higher Education Act (HEA) may be considered for reauthorization during the 110th Congress. There is a need to provide education and support for people to acquire advanced knowledge of languages and cultures of nations of current concern, such as Afghanistan, to address national security concerns. Ongoing support is crucial as it is difficult to predict which nations will generate concern in the future. The importance of ongoing support for instruction in critical foreign languages and cultures, including those of nations like Afghanistan, is emphasized. The question is raised on whether federal support should be provided for instruction in these languages, and if so, whether it should be focused on colleges, universities, or federally-operated institutions. The federal government currently operates two language schools to meet immediate foreign language needs. The federal government operates two foreign language schools, the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center in Monterey, California, and the Foreign Service Institute School for Language Studies in Arlington, Virginia, to meet immediate foreign language needs. Title VI of the Higher Education Act provides institutional aid and fellowships for specific subject areas, unlike other HEA programs focused on student aid based on financial need. Title VI provides institutional aid and fellowships for specific subject areas, emphasizing the importance of advanced study in foreign languages and regions for national security, defense, and economic competitiveness. Supporters argue that maintaining research and instructional programs in critical foreign language and area studies is a national priority that should be supported in both federally-operated institutions and colleges accessible to the Nation. Skills in foreign languages and cultures are essential not only for national defense and diplomacy but also for international trade and outreach activities. The needs for foreign language skills extend beyond federal employees to national defense, diplomacy, international trade, and cultural understanding. Research and language instruction are more likely to occur in educational institutions than federal agencies. Quality FLAS programs rely on partnerships with foreign educational institutions, which are easier for colleges to establish. Support for specific subject areas under HEA Title VI is not unique to the Department of Education. Support for specific subject areas under HEA Title VI is not unique to the Department of Education. Other federal agencies provide support to institutions for instruction in specific subject areas on a larger scale. Examples include health care education by the National Institutes of Health, science and mathematics education by the National Science Foundation, and more. These subject areas are considered of special national interest and receive targeted federal support. If enough students are interested, institutions may provide adequate instruction in critical foreign languages and area studies without federal subsidies. If federal aid is necessary, it could be limited to covering start-up costs. Institutions may offer instruction in critical foreign languages and area studies without federal subsidies. If aid is needed, it could cover start-up costs, not ongoing expenses. Efforts could be made to utilize language skills of recent immigrants. Private foundations also support FLAS programs. Individual institutions find it challenging to offer instruction in rare languages like Pashto or Farsi. Proponents argue for continued federal support under Title VI programs. Title VI programs provide crucial federal support for rare language instruction in institutions, addressing national needs for languages like Pashto and Farsi. Without this funding, ongoing support may be insufficient. The reauthorization of Title VI is being considered by Congress, as it is the primary source of federal aid for FLAS programs in colleges and universities. Coordination with other related programs and potential consolidation is also being questioned. Title VI is a key source of federal support for FLAS in U.S. colleges and universities. Coordination with other related programs like the Fulbright-Hays Act and NSEP is being questioned for efficiency. The Fulbright-Hays Act authorizes international exchange activities primarily administered by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the Department of State. These activities involve exchanges of graduate students and scholars in various fields, as well as professionals, with the majority of participants being citizens of nations other than the United States. In contrast, the Fulbright-Hays programs relevant to HEA Title VI are administered by ED's Office of Postsecondary Education, supporting foreign travel-related activities for American graduate students and professors. These activities include faculty research abroad, doctoral students conducting dissertation research abroad, and group seminars abroad, available only to U.S. citizens or nationals. The NSEP, under the David L. Boren National Security Education Act, provides aid for international education and foreign language studies for American undergraduate and graduate students. It offers scholarships for undergraduate students to study in critical foreign countries, grants to institutions for programs in critical language and area studies, and fellowships for graduate students in critical foreign language and area studies. The goal is to allocate one-third of annual grant funding to each of these activities. The NSEP provides aid for international education and foreign language studies through scholarships for undergraduate students to study in critical foreign countries, grants to institutions for programs in critical language and area studies, and fellowships for graduate students in critical foreign language and area studies. Recipients are required to seek employment in a national security position or in higher education related to their field of study. Institutional grants focus on supporting instructional and exchange programs involving less commonly taught languages and increasing minority participation in international education programs. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) supports international education and foreign language studies through scholarships for undergraduate students, grants for instructional programs in critical languages, and fellowships for graduate students. The program aims to increase minority participation in international education and emphasizes the pursuit of a Flagship Language Initiative for advanced study of critical foreign languages. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) supports international education and foreign language studies through scholarships for undergraduate students, grants for instructional programs in critical languages, and fellowships for graduate students. Administered by the Department of Defense's National Defense University, the NSEP includes a service requirement and travel grants for undergraduates. The program is overseen by a National Security Education Board (NSEB) and determines critical nations, disciplines, and subject areas for national security. The NSEP is largely administered through non-governmental organizations like the Institute of International Education (IIE) for undergraduate students. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) is administered through non-governmental organizations like the Institute of International Education (IIE) for undergraduate students. In the past, there were funding cuts and compromises made in Congress regarding the program's trust fund. The NSEP focuses on meeting national security-related FLAS skill needs, has a service requirement, and supports international travel for undergraduate students. The NSEP, unlike HEA Title VI, has a service requirement, focuses on national security-related FLAS skill needs, is funded through a trust fund, and supports international travel for undergraduate students. Administered by DOD, it is smaller in scale and offers scholarships of up to $5,000 for U.S. citizen undergraduate students with financial need. Preference is given to first-time study abroad students, and they can study any subject and travel to any region except Cuba or countries with travel warnings. The Gilman program provides study abroad opportunities for low-income students who have not studied abroad before. Students can study any subject and travel to any region except Cuba or countries with travel warnings. Preference is given to first-time study abroad students. The program is administered by the Department of State through the Institute of International Education. For the 2002-2003 academic year, 179 students received Gilman Scholarships. FIPSE, authorized by Title VII, Part B of the HEA, offers grants for innovative approaches in U.S. postsecondary education. Three specific programs support international education activities through grants to form consortia with foreign institutions. Funding levels for FY2002 are $2,043,000 for the Program for North American Mobility in Higher Education, $1,495,000 for the U.S.-Brazil Higher Education Consortia Program, and $2,254,000 for the European Community-United States of America Cooperation Program in Higher Education and Vocational Education and Training. The funding levels for international education programs in FY2002 are $2,043,000 for the Program for North American Mobility in Higher Education, $1,495,000 for the U.S.-Brazil Higher Education Consortia Program, and $2,254,000 for the European Community-United States of America Cooperation Program in Higher Education and Vocational Education and Training. There is a question of whether these programs should be consolidated under a coordinated national strategy for efficiency. Coordination among these programs may be less important due to their smaller scale compared to Title VI programs. The NSEP institutional grant programs are similar to HEA Title VI activities and are administered by ED's Office of Postsecondary Education Programs. Coordination and efficiency could be improved by consolidating or placing them under a single advisory board. The NSEP's emphasis on national security needs and service requirement for aid recipients set it apart from other programs. Coordination with Title VI is currently done through the National Security Education Board. However, questions arise about operating a separate program with similar purposes, especially considering the NSEP's reduced trust fund. The NSEP has faced a reduction in its trust fund, raising concerns about its long-term viability. The Gilman International Scholarship Program, which lacks a national security focus, could potentially be transferred to the Department of Education and integrated into the Undergraduate International Studies and Foreign Language Programs. Consideration could also be given to establishing a multi-agency board or entity to coordinate federal programs related to foreign language and international studies. A proposal is made to establish a multi-agency board or entity to coordinate federal programs related to foreign language and international studies, including Fulbright-Hays activities and the K-12 Foreign Language Assistance Program. This board would focus on long-range planning to meet the nation's needs for language specialists and could involve increased coordination between institutions funded by HEA Title VI and federal agencies offering language instruction. Currently, HEA Title VI grants are dispersed across various languages and regions, including critical areas like the Middle East and South Asia. While the importance of certain languages may change over time, there should be a stable group of languages supported by Title VI funding. The decision on targeting Title VI funding for less commonly taught languages or regions can be made by ED alone, through an interagency advisory body, a new entity responsible for federal FLAS programs, or Congress. Matching federal funds with non-federal resources is required for some HEA Title VI programs, leading to additional funding support beyond direct grants. The scale of federal support for FLAS studies under the Title VI program extends beyond direct funding, attracting additional funds from various sources. There is debate on whether the current targeting of HEA Title VI grants is adequate to meet national needs, with opponents arguing for a broader approach to support a comprehensive range of languages and regions. The debate surrounds the best approach for allocating Title VI grants to address national language needs, with some suggesting relying on IHEs to submit proposals rather than a central coordinating body. Efforts to quantify national language needs include annual surveys and reports, as well as a recent study by the General Accounting Office focusing on federal departments and agencies. The General Accounting Office conducted a study on language needs in federal departments and agencies, highlighting shortages of translators, interpreters, diplomats, and intelligence specialists with critical foreign language skills. These shortages have impacted agency operations and hindered various U.S. efforts in military, law enforcement, intelligence, counterterrorism, and diplomatic fields."
