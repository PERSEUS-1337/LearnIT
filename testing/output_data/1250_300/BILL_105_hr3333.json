The Congress finds that the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a major threat to national security, especially in unstable regions. The United Nations has recognized this threat and established measures to prevent proliferation. Additionally, aside from the 5 declared nuclear weapon states, other nations are also pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities, leading to regional arms races. (4) Besides the 5 declared nuclear weapon states, other nations are also pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities. Regional nuclear arms races increase the likelihood of nuclear weapons use in the future. Concerns about Russia's ability to secure its nuclear materials and weapons have raised the threat of nuclear proliferation. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Iraq had a clandestine nuclear weapons program aided by dual-use exports from western countries. (8) Iraq had a clandestine nuclear weapons program aided by dual-use exports from western countries. \n(9) North Korea exchanged nuclear reactors for light water reactor technology, but its history of pursuing nuclear weapons remains a concern. \n(10) Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa renounced nuclear weapons and accepted IAEA safeguards for their facilities. The United States supports nuclear weapons free zones in various regions to prevent conflicts and arms races. The IAEA is important for countering proliferation and has strengthened its safeguard system. The IAEA has strengthened its safeguard system but faces challenges due to constraints. The US supports using plutonium as an energy source and mixing it with low-enriched uranium for nuclear reactors. Plutonium from dismantled warheads poses storage and disposal challenges. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has been extended indefinitely, and more steps are needed to enhance the nonproliferation regime. The US is committed to strong support for non-proliferation. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 emphasizes the US commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and strengthening the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The US aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, rollback proliferation, and establish more effective controls over nuclear transfers. SEC. 3. COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION POLICY. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by placing fissile materials under international controls, ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, ending production of new nuclear warheads with Russia, negotiating to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals, and enforcing multilateral agreements for continuous disarmament. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by reaching multilateral agreements to significantly reduce nuclear arsenals, halt production of weapons-usable fissile materials, and strengthen IAEA safeguards for nonproliferation commitments. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by strengthening IAEA safeguards, enhancing nuclear export controls, reducing regional tensions, and increasing the role of the UN Security Council in enforcing nonproliferation agreements. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by strengthening IAEA safeguards, enhancing nuclear export controls, reducing regional tensions, and increasing the role of the UN Security Council in enforcing nonproliferation agreements. Additionally, they plan to adopt a \"no first use\" policy with other nuclear weapon states, dismantle tactical nuclear weapons with Russia, ratify nuclear-free zone treaties, and monitor North Korea's nuclear activities. The United States plans to adopt a \"no first use\" policy with other nuclear weapon states, dismantle tactical nuclear weapons with Russia, ratify nuclear-free zone treaties, and monitor North Korea's nuclear activities. They also aim to begin formal negotiations on START III with Russia before START II enters into force. The President must report to Congress every year on the actions taken to implement policy objectives, including those related to nuclear disarmament and monitoring North Korea. Reports must detail actions by the US, Russia, and other countries, as well as obstacles encountered. Definitions are also provided in the Act. The Act defines key terms related to nuclear materials, organizations, and treaties, such as fissile materials, IAEA, no first use policy, Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and nuclear weapon states. The Act defines key terms related to nuclear materials, organizations, and treaties, such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, START I treaty, START II treaty, and START III treaty."
