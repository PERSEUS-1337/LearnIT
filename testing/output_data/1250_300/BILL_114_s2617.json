    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Mapping a New and Innovative Focus on Our Exploration Strategy for Human Spaceflight Act of 2016\" or the \"MANIFEST for Human Spaceflight Act of 2016\". It reaffirms policy and findings related to human spaceflight. Congress reaffirms the long-term goal of expanding human presence beyond low-Earth orbit in collaboration with international partners. The National Academy of Sciences conducted a review on human space flight goals and published findings in a 2014 report. The Committee on Human Spaceflight, with input from various communities, concluded that human space exploration has multiple rationales including economic benefits, national security, and scientific discovery. They affirmed Mars as the long-term goal and recommended NASA define sustainable steps to achieve it. The Committee on Human Spaceflight identified multiple rationales for human space exploration, including economic benefits, national security, and scientific discovery. They affirmed Mars as the long-term goal and recommended NASA define sustainable steps to achieve it. SEC. 3. HUMAN EXPLORATION STRATEGY. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to include human exploration of Mars as a goal, with a strategy involving successive missions in cis-lunar space to achieve this objective. The Administration Authorization Act of 2010, as amended, outlines a strategy for human exploration in cis-lunar space using the Space Launch System and Orion crew capsule. The strategy includes expanding human presence for missions to various destinations like lunar orbits, the lunar surface, asteroids, Mars, and collaboration with international partners for economic, scientific, and technological advances. The curr_chunk discusses the utility of an expanded human presence in cis-lunar space for economic, scientific, and technological advances, opportunities for collaboration with international partners, private industry, and other Federal agencies, the importance of the International Space Station for supporting scientific research and technological developments, exploration mission architectures, and a comparison of different approaches. The curr_chunk summarizes a comparison of architectures and approaches for missions related to the Orion crew capsule and the Space Launch System. It evaluates factors like cost effectiveness, schedule resiliency, safety, sustainability, international collaboration opportunities, market enablement for US private industry, scientific discovery, technological excellence, competitiveness, leadership, national security considerations, and flexibility of architectures. The curr_chunk discusses crew health and safety standards, radiation exposure limits, medical emergency protocols, crew training needs, space suits, and life support systems for missions identified under paragraph (1). The curr_chunk includes crew training needs, prioritizing missions, assessing recommendations from a previous report, and providing technical information for potential stakeholders. The Administrator will arrange for the National Academy of Sciences to independently review and comment on each interim report regarding the strategy described in paragraph (1), identifying agreed-upon matters, concerns, and recommendations for further action. The Administrator will ensure timely review and incorporation of National Academy of Sciences' comments on interim reports on the strategy, submitted every five years. The Administrator must submit interim reports on the strategy to the National Academy of Sciences every five years for independent review. Final reports, including the Academy's response to the interim reports, must be submitted to Congress within one year of the Act's enactment and every five years thereafter."
