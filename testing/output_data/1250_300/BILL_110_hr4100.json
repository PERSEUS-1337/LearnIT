    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on Instructional Level Assessment Pilot Program. This program aims to assess students' instructional levels. The Secretary will award grants to up to ten State educational agencies for pilot programs to assess students with disabilities below grade-level proficiency and provide quality instruction. Grants will be for a 3-year period. States must apply for the grant and meet eligibility criteria. The State educational agencies awarded grants for pilot programs must demonstrate intervention in implementing requirements, develop alternate assessments, provide guidance to local education agencies, and ensure data collection and reporting. The pilot program requires participating local education agencies to implement a response to intervention approach, provide data-driven instruction, and ensure appropriate identification of students for participation. Monitoring and oversight of the agencies are also mandated, with a focus on reviewing documentation provided by the IEP Team. The pilot program requires participating local education agencies to limit student participation, ensure appropriate assessment selection, provide quality instruction, and review student data for assessment purposes. The IEP Team must examine various data to determine if a student is significantly below grade level in reading or math. They should administer appropriate assessments based on the student's instructional level and develop targeted interventions to address identified gaps. The IEP Team will develop targeted interventions to remediate identified gaps in a student's instructional knowledge. Data from instructional level assessments cannot be used to determine proficiency levels or school progress. Local education agencies will compile reports on student progress towards grade level proficiency. The pilot program will compile a report on student progress towards reaching grade level proficiency based on assessments. State education agencies will submit annual reports on pilot participation and progress. Data collected will inform a report to Congress on closing the gap between instructional and grade level proficiency. Authorization of funds is provided for the program. The pilot program will report on student progress towards grade level proficiency. State education agencies will submit annual reports on participation and progress. Data collected will inform Congress on closing the gap between instructional and grade level proficiency. $5,000,000 is authorized for grants in fiscal year 2008."
