Section 118(c)(7) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to prioritize programs and projects addressing key areas like toxic substances, invasive species, nearshore health, nonpoint source pollution, and habitat restoration. The Administrator collaborates with Federal partners to select programs and projects for Great Lakes protection and restoration, focusing on key areas like toxic substances, invasive species, nearshore health, nonpoint source pollution, and habitat restoration. The Administrator selects programs and projects for Great Lakes protection and restoration based on strategic environmental outcomes, feasibility of implementation, and opportunities for improved coordination and collaboration. The Administrator aims to improve coordination and collaboration among agencies, governments, and organizations to streamline efforts for Great Lakes protection and restoration. They consult with Great Lakes States, Indian tribes, and non-Federal stakeholders to select the best programs and projects. Additionally, a designated coordinator from a Federal partner will work with all stakeholders on projects and activities. The Initiative aims to strategically implement projects involving harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes, with funds allocated for Federal projects, coordination with various stakeholders, and operations and activities. The Administrator or head of a Federal agency may grant funds to non-Federal entities for projects related to harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes. The Administrator or head of a Federal agency may grant funds to qualified non-Federal entities for planning, research, monitoring, outreach, or implementation of projects related to the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. A qualified non-Federal entity may include a governmental entity, nonprofit organization, institution, or individual. Projects under the Initiative can be carried out on various levels, including locally, Great Lakes-wide, or Great Lakes basin-wide. No funds can be used for water infrastructure activities unless it is a green infrastructure project improving habitat in the Great Lakes. The Initiative allows projects at different levels, including locally or basin-wide in the Great Lakes region. Funding can be received from State water pollution control funds, State drinking water funds, or the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act. Federal agencies are required to maintain funding for Great Lakes activities. The relevant Federal department or agency must maintain funding for Great Lakes activities and identify new projects to support environmental goals. The Administrator and Great Lakes Interagency Task Force review and revise the Initiative Action Plan every 5 years to guide restoration and protection efforts for the Great Lakes system. The Administrator oversees the Initiative Action Plan for the Great Lakes system, consulting with stakeholders and reporting progress to the public and relevant committees. The Administrator oversees the Initiative Action Plan for the Great Lakes system, consulting with stakeholders and reporting progress to relevant committees annually. The Initiative Action Plan is a comprehensive, multi-year plan for the restoration of the Great Lakes, as defined in the legislation. Funding for the Initiative is provided through transfers to participating Federal departments and agencies. The Joint Explanatory Statement authorizes $300,000,000 annually for fiscal years 2017-2021 for the Administrator to implement programs under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The House of Representatives passed the bill on April 26, 2016."
