    "content": "Under the OCSLA, the DOI must create five-year programs for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters, balancing energy supply and environmental protection. The BOEM leads this process, which involves multiple drafts, economic and environmental analysis, and approval by the Secretary of the Interior and Congress. NEPA requirements are also followed in the planning process. The planning process for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters includes a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) as required by NEPA. Public comments are addressed in both the PEIS and the five-year program. The finalized program cannot be revised without restarting the process, but scheduled sales could potentially be canceled during implementation based on environmental review requirements. BOEM released the final version of its oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 on November 18, 2016. The final oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 was approved by former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell on January 17, 2017. The program includes 11 lease sales on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), with 10 in the Gulf of Mexico region and 1 in the Alaska region. Sales in the Atlantic and Pacific regions were not included in the final program. Congress plays an active role in the planning process for the five-year programs, although their review does not include approval or disapproval of the program. Congress plays an active role in the planning process for the five-year offshore oil and gas leasing programs. Members can influence the program by submitting public comments, evaluating the program in committee oversight hearings, and introducing legislation to set or alter program terms. The report discusses the history, legal framework, development process, and analysis of the program for 2017-2022. It also highlights the role of Congress in oversight and legislation related to the program. The report discusses the history and legal framework of offshore oil and gas leasing programs. In 1953, Congress enacted laws addressing jurisdiction and rights off the US coasts. The OCSLA aims for the orderly development of OCS resources while maintaining environmental safeguards and national needs. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) aims to expedite offshore development while ensuring environmental protection and competition. The 1978 amendments added provisions like Section 18, requiring the creation of five-year OCS leasing programs to meet national energy needs. These programs, starting in 1980, set schedules for lease auctions and guide oil and gas exploration and production on the OCS. The OCSLA, amended in 1978, established five-year leasing programs to meet energy needs. Congress has since enacted laws like the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 and the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to encourage offshore oil and gas exploration and production. Additional legislative actions have removed barriers to leasing in certain OCS regions. The OCSLA, amended in 1978, established five-year leasing programs to meet energy needs. Congress enacted laws like the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 and the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to encourage offshore oil and gas exploration. Legislative actions removed barriers to leasing in certain OCS regions, shaping subsequent five-year programs. The statutory framework governing BOEM's development of a leasing program includes OCSLA, NEPA, and CZMA. Section 18 of OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and revise an oil and gas leasing program considering economic, social, and environmental values of the OCS resources. The OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to manage the OCS in a way that considers economic, social, and environmental values. It directs the scheduling of oil and gas exploration based on various factors, including geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics. Leasing must ensure fair market value and include estimates on appropriations and staffing needs. The OCSLA requires the Secretary of the Interior to manage the OCS considering economic, social, and environmental values. Leasing under the five-year program must assure fair market value and include estimates on appropriations and staffing needs. Consultation with various agencies and states is mandatory, with the proposed program being submitted to affected state governors for comments before publication in the Federal Register. The OCSLA mandates that the Secretary of the Interior manage the OCS, ensuring economic, social, and environmental considerations. Leasing under the five-year program must guarantee fair market value and involve consultation with agencies and states. The proposed program must be submitted to affected state governors for comments before publication in the Federal Register. Additionally, the Secretary can revise the program at any time, with significant revisions requiring a similar approval process as the initial program. The Secretary of the Interior's responsibilities under the OCSLA are carried out by BOEM, which includes consultation requirements with affected states. BOEM must request input from governors on laws, goals, and policies for the five-year program. The preparation process also involves publication in the Federal Register. NEPA and CZMA are federal statutes that influence the program's formation, with NEPA requiring environmental impact statements for major federal actions. The BOEM prepares environmental impact statements for major federal actions affecting the environment, including programmatic EIS for five-year programs. States under the CZMA are encouraged to enact coastal zone management plans for habitat and resource protection. The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) encourages states to develop plans for protecting coastal habitats and resources. Approved state programs can receive federal assistance and must address water pollution sources. BOEM regulations require consideration of state coastal management programs in leasing decisions for oil and gas activities in the Outer Continental Shelf. The regulations require BOEM to request information on the relationship between a state's coastal zone management program and OCS oil and gas activity from governors and the Secretary of Commerce. The development of a five-year leasing program involves multiple drafts, public comment, and environmental review. Individual lease sales and exploration plans also undergo environmental review and public comment. The process from program development to oil and gas production involves consultation with state governors, federal agencies, Congress, and the President. The development of a five-year leasing program involves multiple drafts, public comment, and environmental review. The process includes a request for information, analysis of planning areas, and the removal of proposed sales at each stage without adding new ones. Step 1 - The process of developing a new five-year leasing program involves multiple steps, including a request for information and the publication of a draft proposed program.\n\nStep 2 - BOEM initiates the process by requesting information from interested parties regarding energy needs, leasing interests, and environmental concerns. This is followed by the publication of a draft proposed program based on analysis and public comments received.\n\nSummarized chunk: The process of developing a new five-year leasing program involves a request for information and the publication of a draft proposed program based on analysis and public comments. The Draft Proposed Program (DPP) represents the initial proposal for lease sales in the upcoming five-year period. It analyzes all OCS planning areas for leasing, identifies areas proposed for lease sales, and includes a preliminary schedule. BOEM published the DPP for 2017-2022 on January 29, 2015, receiving over 1 million comments. Following the DPP, BOEM issues a notice of intent (NOI) for a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) and seeks public input. Subsequently, a Proposed Program (PP) is published after further analysis and consideration of public comments. After analyzing the lease sale areas proposed in the DPP and considering public comments, BOEM publishes a Proposed Program (PP) for the five-year period. The PP refines locations and timing for OCS oil and gas lease sales. It is accompanied by a draft PEIS analyzing the identified leasing areas. The final document, the Proposed Final Program (PFP), is based on further analysis of OCSLA factors and public comments. The PFP is announced in the Federal Register and submitted to the President and Congress for review. The PFP for the 2017-2022 program, along with the final PEIS, was published by BOEM on November 18, 2016. The Secretary of the Interior approved the final program on January 17, 2017, after a 60-day review period by Congress. Former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell approved the final program for 2017-2022 on January 17, 2017. Since 1980, multiple five-year programs have been submitted to Congress, reflecting different presidential administrations' offshore oil and gas leasing policies. The 2012-2017 program, submitted by the Obama Administration under Secretary Ken Salazar, included 15 proposed lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. The 2007-2012 five-year program for offshore oil and gas leasing was prepared by the George W. Bush Administration and later revised by the Obama Administration. It included 21 sales initially, which was later reduced to 16 sales. The program expired in June 2012. The 2007-2012 offshore oil and gas leasing program consisted of 16 sales and was approved after a 60-day review period. The program expired in June 2012. The 2002-2007 program included 20 lease sales, with 15 held before expiring in June 2007. The 1997-2002 program had 16 sales, with 12 held before expiring in June 2002. The 1992-1997 program had 18 sales, with 12 held before expiring. The 1980-1982 program for domestic oil and gas leasing was presented to Congress in April 1980 under President Carter's direction. It consisted of 41 sales, with 23 held before the program expired in June 1987. The 1980-1982 domestic oil and gas leasing program, presented to Congress in April 1980 under President Carter's direction, consisted of 41 sales, with 23 held before the program expired in June 1987. Prior to 1980, federal government lease sales conveyed over 3,000 tracts from October 1954 to September 1980. In November 2016, BOEM released the final version of its offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022, scheduling 11 lease sales in specific regions of the OCS. The program includes four OCS regions: Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, Atlantic, and Pacific, with lease sales planned in two of these regions. The BOEM identifies four OCS regions with a total of 26 planning areas. The regions are Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, Atlantic, and Pacific. The 2017-2022 final program schedules lease sales in Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. U.S. offshore crude oil production accounted for 16% of total production in FY2015, a decline from FY2010. Offshore natural gas production also declined from FY2010 to FY2015. The surge in total U.S. crude oil and natural gas production is due to increased production of shale gas and shale oil in unconventional onshore formations. This has led to a reduction in imports, particularly from OPEC countries. Offshore natural gas production volumes decreased by nearly 50% between FY2010 and FY2015, while U.S. total annual natural gas production increased by over 30%. As of November 1, 2016, there were 917 producing offshore oil and natural gas leases on 4.5 million acres of the OCS, with the majority located in the Central Gulf of Mexico. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) anticipates lower domestic investment in oil and gas projects over the 2015-2020 period. Estimates by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) show a decline in bonus bid revenues from offshore leasing in the next five fiscal years. The Office of Management and Budget's crude oil price estimates have also decreased. The longer low oil prices persist, the more impact the decline will have on new investment. The Office of Management and Budget's crude oil price estimates decreased from $80-$90 per barrel in the FY2015 budget request to $50-$60 per barrel in the FY2017 budget request. Despite the impact of low oil prices on new investment, offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to reach record levels in 2017. Energy diversification and continued oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico are vital for meeting the country's energy needs. Oil and gas exploration and production involve stages that provide certainty about the volume of resources present. Oil and gas exploration and production involve stages that provide certainty about the volume of resources present. Reserves of oil and gas are measured within pools or fields via well penetration or other technology. The U.S. OCS has 4.3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 16 Tcf of dry gas, mostly located in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico. The U.S. OCS also contains estimated undiscovered technically recoverable resources of 89.9 billion barrels of oil. The U.S. OCS has 4.3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 16 Tcf of dry gas, with the majority in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico holds about 54% of the estimated undiscovered technically recoverable resources for oil and 43% for natural gas. Alaska's UTRR estimates are mainly in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. BOEM considers resource potential, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts when preparing five-year programs under the OCSLA. Some areas of the U.S. OCS were unavailable for leasing in the 2017-2022 program due to presidential withdrawals, congressional moratoriums, or protected status. The 2017-2022 five-year program excluded certain areas from oil and gas leasing due to presidential withdrawals, congressional moratoriums, or protected status. These areas included the Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico, Alaska Withdrawal Areas, and National Marine Sanctuaries and Marine Monuments. In December 2016, President Obama made withdrawals under the OCSLA, including much of the U.S. Arctic from leasing disposition for an indefinite time period. This included the Chukchi Sea planning area, Beaufort Sea planning area, and areas in the North Bering Sea. The withdrawals also affected certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean associated with major canyons and canyon complexes. These withdrawals did not impact the 2017-2022 program but would affect future leasing considerations. The withdrawals made under the OCSLA by President Obama in December 2016 did not directly impact the 2017-2022 program as none of the withdrawn areas overlapped with scheduled leasing areas. However, future leasing considerations would be affected. BOEM's leasing strategy evaluates each U.S. ocean region based on various criteria, resulting in 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions only, with no sales scheduled for the Atlantic and Pacific regions. The 2017-2022 program includes lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, which has the most oil and gas resources and industry interest. The majority of lease sales are scheduled in the Gulf region, with 10 out of 11 proposed sales. The region includes the Western Gulf, Central Gulf, and Eastern Gulf planning areas. The 2017-2022 program includes lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, with most sales scheduled in the Gulf region. The Eastern Gulf and a portion of the Central Gulf are closed to leasing. BOEM has replaced area-specific sales with region-wide sales to provide more flexibility to industry. The final program has fewer lease sales in the Gulf compared to previous programs. The 2017-2022 program schedules fewer lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico compared to previous programs, with a focus on better planning for resources straddling the U.S.-Mexico boundary. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region of the U.S. OCS has increased due to decreased summer polar ice extent and estimates of substantial undiscovered resources in Arctic waters. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region of the U.S. OCS has increased due to decreased summer polar ice extent and estimates of substantial undiscovered resources in Arctic waters. The Beaufort and Chukchi Seas are the only areas with existing federal leases, with the Beaufort Sea having producing wells. Stakeholders are divided on expanding offshore oil and gas activities in the Arctic, with concerns about oil spills and climate change. The Obama Administration supported expanding exploration while implementing safety regulations to prevent spills. The Obama Administration supported expanding offshore oil and gas exploration in the Arctic but also implemented safety regulations to prevent oil spills. Despite initial plans for lease sales in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, BOEM canceled them due to market conditions and low industry interest. Only the Cook Inlet lease sale remained in the final program for 2017-2022, with BOEM citing various factors for the decision. BOEM decided against lease sales in the Beaufort and Chukchi planning areas due to factors such as declining industry interest, low oil prices, and Shell Oil Company's unsuccessful drilling in the Chukchi Sea in 2015. Industry interest in the Arctic OCS has decreased significantly, with a decline of over 90% in active leases between February and November 2016. The agency noted that current market conditions and sufficient existing domestic energy sources also influenced their decision. BOEM decided against lease sales in the Beaufort and Chukchi planning areas due to declining industry interest and low oil prices. President Obama withdrew large portions of the Arctic OCS from future leasing consideration. The final program for 2017-2022 excludes a lease sale in the Atlantic region. The lack of offshore oil and gas activity in the Atlantic region for the past 30 years was due to congressional bans and presidential moratoria. Changes in legislation in 2009 allowed for potential lease sales in the Atlantic, but none have taken place. Certain parts of the Atlantic are currently under presidential moratorium, while other areas are available for leasing. BOEM analyzed various factors for the Atlantic region in the 2017-2022 program. BOEM analyzed factors for the Atlantic region in the 2017-2022 program, considering resource potential, ecological concerns, and state attitudes towards drilling. Initially, a lease sale was planned for a portion of the Mid- and South Atlantic areas in 2021, but it was later removed due to strong local opposition, conflicts with other ocean uses, market dynamics, and feedback from affected states. BOEM decided not to hold an Atlantic lease sale in the 2017-2022 period due to conflicts with existing ocean uses, concerns from stakeholders, and the strong domestic oil and gas production. The agency also noted that no lease sales were scheduled for the Pacific region in the same period. The 2017-2022 program does not include lease sales for the Pacific region, which has not had any federal oil and gas lease sales since 1984. Despite lifting leasing restrictions in FY2009, California, Oregon, and Washington governors still oppose offshore oil and gas leasing in the region. Congress can influence the five-year program through public comments, oversight hearings, and legislation. Members of Congress, along with other stakeholders, can influence the five-year program through public comments, oversight hearings, and legislation. The 114th Congress pursued various forms of influence on the proposed 2017-2022 program, with the 115th Congress also having the option to address the program through legislation. BOEM received comments from Members of Congress on the initial request for information, the Draft Proposed Program, and the Proposed Program, with some comments opposing certain regions' inclusion and others supporting it. Members of Congress and stakeholders can influence the five-year program through public comments, oversight hearings, and legislation. Comments from Members on the Draft Proposed Program (DPP) and the Proposed Program (PP) varied, with some opposing certain regions' inclusion and others supporting lease sales or seeking an expansion of lease areas. BOEM considers these comments when developing successive drafts, with the House holding oversight hearings to evaluate the program. After releasing the DPP for 2017-2022, a hearing was held on April 15, 2015. Members of Congress and stakeholders can influence the five-year oil and gas leasing program through public comments, oversight hearings, and legislation. Hearings held by the House and Senate addressed issues such as lease sales in the Atlantic and Arctic, seismic surveying, and targeted lease sales in Alaska. Congress may direct specific terms for the program or modify it through legislation, with the 114th Congress considering changes to the 2017-2022 program. The 114th Congress considered legislation that would have affected the 2017-2022 oil and gas leasing program. Bills like H.R. 1487 and S. 791 aimed to use an earlier-proposed program for 2010-2015 as the final program for FY2015-FY2020, with modifications to lease sales and requirements for BOEM to conduct sales in the Atlantic region. The bills also proposed regular lease sales every 270 days for areas with commercial interest. The bills proposed regular lease sales every 270 days for areas with commercial interest, including the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, and Bristol Bay in the Alaska region, previously leased areas off the coast of Virginia, and other OCS areas with significant oil or gas reserves. The bills also aimed to approve the FY2015-FY2020 program under NEPA without further environmental review, and included state revenue-sharing provisions. H.R. 3682 aimed to amend the OCSLA by requiring BOEM to make at least 50% of available unleased acreage in OCS planning areas with significant oil and gas resources available for leasing. It also aimed to increase oil and gas production by 3 million barrels and 10 billion cubic feet per day by 2032. Additionally, the bill would allow the Secretary to add additional areas to approved leasing programs and required BOEM to conduct lease sales in the Atlantic region, South Carolina, and Southern California. The bill H.R. 4749, along with S. 1276 and S. 2011, aimed to amend the OCSLA by directing BOEM to lease areas with significant oil and gas resources, including specific lease sales in the Atlantic region, South Carolina, Southern California, and North Carolina. Military protections and revenue sharing with coastal states were also included in the bill. Additionally, the bills sought to reduce the Eastern Gulf of Mexico leasing moratorium and add lease sales to the 2017-2022 program. The bills S. 1276, S. 2011, and S. 1278 aimed to amend the OCSLA by directing BOEM to lease areas with significant oil and gas resources, including specific lease sales in various regions. The bills also included provisions for military protections, revenue sharing with coastal states, and extending existing leases in certain areas. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held hearings on bills S. 1278, S. 1279, and S. 3203 in 2015 and 2016. These bills aimed to include various planning areas in lease sales, address conflicts with military operations, consult with state governors, and conduct geological surveys. S. 3203 also proposed increased revenue sharing with Alaska and changes to lease terms for the region. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 3203 in 2016, which proposed increased revenue sharing with Alaska and changes to lease terms for the region. In the past, Congress has introduced legislation to alter the five-year leasing program, such as H.R. 6082 in the 112th Congress, which aimed to replace the program with a plan containing additional lease sales in various regions. The House passed a bill to make changes to the lease sale schedule for the 2017-2022 program, including sales in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, Atlantic, and Pacific regions. Legislation to alter the program may be considered in the 115th Congress."
