    "content": "The Act titled \"Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2002\" amends the Public Health Service Act by adding a new section on Lifespan Respite Care. This section includes findings and purposes related to respite care services. Congress finds that millions of individuals in the United States provide care for family members with various health conditions, including children with chronic illnesses and disabilities, those living with relatives due to parental incapacity, individuals with developmental disabilities, and elders with multiple chronic conditions. Approximately 25% of the Nation's elders have multiple chronic disabling conditions, requiring assistance with daily needs. Around 600,000 Americans die at home each year, often relying on extensive family caregiving. 42% of individuals needing daily living assistance in the US are under 65. There is a lack of resources to replace family caregivers with paid workers, which would cost $200 billion annually. Family caregivers, who are mostly women, face emotional, physical, and financial hardships. Approximately 75 percent of family caregivers are women and often struggle to find information about available respite care. The existing programs are insufficient and primarily cater to lower-income populations and elderly caregivers, leaving many without adequate support. There is a limited number of respite care programs that have difficulty recruiting trained workers. The purposes of this title are to encourage the establishment of State and local lifespan respite care programs, improve information dissemination to caregivers, and enhance respite care services. The purpose of the program is to improve respite care services for family caregivers by promoting innovative approaches, supporting research on effective services, and disseminating information on respite care delivery. The program aims to promote the dissemination of results and information related to respite care delivery, family caregiver strain, recruitment and training of respite care workers and volunteers, and training programs for family caregivers. \"Definitions are outlined in section 2802.\" The term 'condition' includes various health and developmental issues, while an 'eligible recipient' refers to a State agency or other public entity capable of receiving assistance.
