    "content": "Some Members of Congress have long been interested in the rules governing patentable subject matter. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011 placed restrictions on patents involving human organisms and tax avoidance strategies. Courts and the USPTO have historically interpreted Section 101 broadly, but exceptions exist for laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. In recent years, Section 101 has been used more frequently to invalidate patents. In recent years, Section 101 has been more frequently invoked to invalidate patents and reject patent applications at the USPTO. The Supreme Court has issued four opinions since 2010 concluding that inventions were unpatentable under Section 101, leading to concerns about the U.S. patent system being in a \"state of crisis\" due to confusing legal standards. The U.S. patent system is facing a crisis due to confusing legal standards established by the Supreme Court, leading to concerns of \"total chaos\" and a departure from sensible patent policy. Observers believe these decisions may result in patents of appropriate scope, reduce abusive patent litigation, and encourage higher quality patents. This report reviews current patent law and legislative reform proposals, focusing on patentable subject matter and Supreme Court decisions. The report discusses Supreme Court decisions on the Patent Act, implications in IT and life sciences industries, and legislative reform options. Applicants must submit detailed applications to USPTO for patent protection. Examiners assess applications for novelty and nonobviousness. The patent acquisition process is known as \"prosecution.\" The examiner evaluates if the invention meets patentability criteria such as novelty, nonobviousness, and utility. The invention must not be fully anticipated by prior art and must not have been readily achievable by an artisan. Additionally, the invention must fall within a patentable subject matter category defined by Section 101 of the Patent Act. A patent may be obtained for a new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, subject to certain conditions. Process patents involve a series of steps to achieve a specific result, often related to methods of manufacture or use. The term \"machine\" includes mechanical devices, \"manufacture\" refers to producing articles from materials, and \"composition of matter\" involves new forms or combinations of materials. The term \"manufacture\" is defined as the production of articles from raw materials, while \"composition of matter\" includes all compositions of substances. Courts have set limits on patentable processes, excluding laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. This is to ensure that basic scientific and technological tools remain free for all to use. The USPTO allows patent applications that meet requirements to issue as granted patents, giving the patent holder exclusive rights for twenty years. This exclusivity allows inventors to profit from their inventions and monitor competitors for infringement. Inventors can profit from their inventions by obtaining patents, granting them exclusive rights for twenty years. Patent owners must monitor competitors for infringement and may need to litigate in federal courts to enforce their intellectual property rights. The Federal Circuit handles most patent appeals, with the Supreme Court having discretionary review authority. Recent Supreme Court decisions have addressed the patentability of genetically engineered microorganisms and processes involving computer technology. In its 1980 decision, the Court ruled that a genetically engineered microorganism could be patented, setting the stage for broad patentable subject matter in information technologies and life sciences. The Supreme Court later narrowed patent eligibility in a series of decisions from 2010 to 2014, impacting the patent system significantly. The 2010 decision in Bilski v. Kappos involved the patentability of a method for hedging risk in commodities trading. In its 2010 decision Bilski v. Kappos, the Supreme Court considered the patentability of a method for managing consumption risk costs in commodities trading, which had a significant impact on the patent system. The USPTO rejected the application as ineligible for patenting under Section 101, leading to a Federal Circuit appeal. The Federal Circuit rejected Bilski's patent application for a method that did not claim patentable subject matter under Section 101. The court determined that the process did not meet the requirements of being tied to a specific machine or apparatus, nor did it involve a physical transformation. The Federal Circuit rejected Bilski's patent application for a method that did not meet the requirements of being tied to a specific machine or involving a physical transformation. The USPTO decision was affirmed, and the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that Bilski's invention could not be patented based on the traditional rule that abstract ideas are not patentable subject matter. The Supreme Court rejected Bilski's patent application for a method that did not meet the machine-or-transformation test. Justice Kennedy reasoned that allowing patenting of risk hedging would grant a monopoly over an abstract idea. Justice Stevens concurred, stating that methods of doing business are not covered by the statute. Justice Breyer identified four points of agreement among all nine justices. In the case of Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Supreme Court focused on the life sciences, specifically on patents claiming methods for determining optimal dosages of thiopurine drugs used to treat autoimmune diseases. The Court emphasized that not everything achieving a \"useful, concrete, and tangible result\" qualifies as patentable subject matter. The Supreme Court case Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. focused on patents claiming methods for determining optimal dosages of thiopurine drugs for treating autoimmune diseases. The patents involve administering a drug and measuring its levels in red blood cells to adjust dosage for better treatment efficacy. Claim 1 of the patent specifies criteria for adjusting drug dosage based on metabolite levels in patients. The Supreme Court case Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. focused on patents for determining optimal dosages of thiopurine drugs for treating autoimmune diseases. The Court concluded that the claims were directed towards natural laws and were therefore unpatentable, as monopolizing basic tools through patents could impede innovation. The Supreme Court case Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. focused on patents for determining optimal dosages of thiopurine drugs for treating autoimmune diseases. The Court recognized that the claims involved natural laws but also included steps like \"administering\" the drug and \"determining\" metabolite levels. However, the Court ultimately ruled that these additional steps were not enough to make the inventions patent-eligible. The Supreme Court case Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. focused on patents for determining optimal dosages of thiopurine drugs for treating autoimmune diseases. The Court ruled that the additional steps like \"administering\" the drug and \"determining\" metabolite levels were not sufficient to make the inventions patent-eligible. Justice Breyer explained that simply limiting the use of a natural law to a particular technological environment cannot render the principle patentable. Conventional or obvious pre-solution activity did not convert an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application. The Court concluded that the three steps in the claim did not \"transform\" the natural law into patentable subject matter. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus ruled that simply advising individuals to use a law of nature does not make it patentable. The Court found that the three steps in the claim did not transform natural correlations into patentable applications. Justice Breyer argued that the transformation of human blood or the human body was not relevant to the patentability determination. The Supreme Court in Mayo v. Prometheus ruled that advising individuals to use a law of nature does not make it patentable. Justice Breyer argued that the transformation of the human body was not relevant to patentability. The Court also addressed concerns about discouraging diagnostic research and limiting physician access to scientific data. In a June 2013 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that genomic DNA was ineligible for patenting under the \"product of nature\" doctrine. While products of nature cannot be patented, they may be patentable if significant artificial changes are made, such as purifying or isolating a naturally occurring product. The USPTO had issued over 50,000 patents related to DNA, but some experts believed that patenting human genes was a misconstrued decision. The USPTO issued over 50,000 patents related to DNA, including isolated human genes like BRCA1 and BRCA2, associated with breast and ovarian cancers. The Supreme Court decision in Myriad reflected the view that isolated genes could not be patented under the \"product of nature\" doctrine. The lawsuit against USPTO, Myriad Genetics, and University of Utah Research Foundation challenged Myriad's patents on BRCA genes. The lawsuit against Myriad Genetics challenged the gene patent claims related to BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are associated with breast and ovarian cancers. The U.S. District Court initially ruled the gene patent claims invalid, but the Federal Circuit later reversed this decision, stating that isolated DNA is chemically manipulated and therefore patentable. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case but did not issue a ruling. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment in the Myriad case and remanded it back to the Federal Circuit. Myriad had discovered the genetic sequence of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes but did not create anything new according to Justice Thomas. The Court was unimpressed with Myriad's claims of isolated DNA as a non-naturally occurring molecule. The Supreme Court found that isolating a gene from its genetic material is not an act of invention. They were unimpressed with Myriad's claims of isolated DNA as a non-naturally occurring molecule. However, the Court viewed synthetic DNA, known as cDNA, more favorably as it is not considered a \"product of nature\" and can be patented. The case did not involve innovative gene manipulation methods or new gene applications. Justice Thomas and seven colleagues held that genes and the information they encode are not patent eligible simply because they have been isolated from surrounding genetic material. Justice Scalia concurred with the judgment but expressed reservations about the molecular biology details. He noted that isolated genomic DNA is identical to its natural state, while cDNA can be patented as a synthetic creation. In a recent Section 101 decision, the Supreme Court considered the patentability of a computer-implemented financial exchange system designed to mitigate settlement risk. The patents in question included method claims, computer system claims, and computer-readable media claims. The district court ruled the inventions unpatentable as they represented a basic business concept. The patent owner appealed to the Federal Court. The Supreme Court upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that the patents for a computer-implemented financial exchange system were directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. Justice Thomas explained the two-part test for identifying patents claiming laws of nature or abstract ideas. The Supreme Court upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that patents for a computer-implemented financial exchange system were directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. Justice Thomas outlined a two-part test to determine if a claim incorporates an \"inventive concept\" beyond applying a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea. The Court found that the method claims were drawn to the abstract idea of intermediated settlement and lacked an \"inventive concept\" to transform the idea into a patent-eligible application. The Supreme Court determined that patented claims involving a computer system amounted to implementing an abstract idea, which cannot be transformed into a patent-eligible invention simply by using generic computer hardware. The Court rejected the claims as they failed to provide an inventive concept beyond basic computer implementation, making them unpatentable under current law. The Supreme Court decisions in Bilski, Mayo v. Prometheus, Myriad, and Alice establish the current law on patent eligibility. The courts and USPTO use a two-part test to determine eligibility, considering whether a claim recites a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea, and if the claim includes additional inventive elements. The Court also analyzes if a claim preempts a field of activity and does not consider routine hardware to improve eligibility. The machine-or-transformation test does not solely govern patent eligibility. The Court does not consider routine hardware to improve Section 101 eligibility. The machine-or-transformation test is a useful guidepost in decision-making. Section 101 determinations can be resolved early in litigation without formal claim construction. Statistical analyses show a high rate of challenged patents being invalidated under Section 101 motions. The statistics show that challenged patents under \u00a7101 motions citing Alice resulted in 190 valid patents and 378 invalidated patents, with an average invalidation rate of 66.5%. The Federal Circuit upheld 3 patents and invalidated 34 patents, with an average invalidation rate of 91.9%. Over 36,000 published patent applications have been rejected under Alice, with over 5,000 abandoned. These numbers suggest that attorneys have a good chance of success when asserting a patent claim is invalid under existing patent law. The statistics also indicate that recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter has impacted patent validity in information technologies and life sciences. Recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter has influenced patent validity in information technologies. The courts have invalidated numerous patents on computer-related inventions following standards set in Bilski and Alice. Patent claims that lack specific solutions or improvements in technology are vulnerable to Section 101 challenges. Invalidated patents include those for generating menus, analyzing electric power grid data, and extracting data from hard copy documents. The curr_chunk discusses various patents invalidated in court, including a menu selection system, data analysis for electric power grids, data extraction from hard copy documents, life insurance policy tracking, and credit application processing over electronic networks. One patent involved a broadcast system for cellular phones to access content from a regional broadcaster. The Federal Circuit applied the Supreme Court's two-part test for patentable subject matter in their decision. The Federal Circuit invalidated a patent for a broadcast system allowing cellular phones to access regional content. The court deemed the concept abstract and not directed to implementation on a cellular phone, failing to satisfy patentable subject matter under Section 101. The Federal Circuit invalidated a patent for a broadcast system for cellular phones, deeming it abstract and not specific to cellular phone implementation. The court found that patents are more likely to survive Section 101 if they avoid broad functional language and specify discrete structures for specific results. Supreme Court decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics have had implications for the life sciences industry, particularly in the patenting of predictive diagnostic methods dependent on biomarkers. The Mayo v. Prometheus and Myriad cases have impacted the patentability of diagnostic methods and isolated bodily substances in the life sciences industry. The Federal Circuit's 2015 ruling in Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc. regarding a prenatal diagnostic method has sparked significant discussion in the patent community. Sequenom held a patent for detecting fetal DNA in maternal plasma or serum, but the Federal Circuit ruled it invalid as it was directed to a naturally occurring phenomenon and used conventional techniques. The Federal Circuit ruled Sequenom's patent invalid for detecting fetal DNA in maternal plasma or serum due to being directed to a naturally occurring phenomenon and using conventional techniques. Judge Linn expressed dissatisfaction with the decision, highlighting the breakthrough nature of the invention in prenatal diagnosis. Congress has the option to address the law of patentable subject matter through legislation, with industry associations suggesting modifications to Section 101. Industry associations have suggested modifications to Section 101 of the patent law, with the American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA) and the Intellectual Property Owners Association (IPO) proposing similar changes. The AIPLA's proposal aims to replace the existing Section 101 with clearer language on patentable inventions. The American Bar Association (ABA) Section of Intellectual Property Law has proposed an amendment to Section 101 of the patent law, focusing on conditions for patentability and eligible subject matter. The proposal aims to clarify the eligibility of claimed inventions without considering other patent requirements or the manner of invention. The American Bar Association's proposed amendment to Section 101 of patent law aims to clarify eligibility for patents based on inventions, without considering other patent requirements or the manner of invention. The AIPLA asserts that patent eligibility under Section 101 should not be denied based on preempting practical applications of laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas. The AIPLA and ABA Section on Intellectual Property argue against recent Supreme Court decisions that have injected ambiguity into patent eligibility under Section 101. The IPO criticizes the Court's analysis as contrary to congressional intent and too restrictive. Some believe legislative reform is unnecessary. The IPO criticizes the Supreme Court's analysis as contrary to congressional intent and too restrictive. Some argue against legislative reform, stating that more restrictive patent eligibility rules have not affected innovation or investment significantly. Proposed amendments could essentially eliminate limits to software patenting and subject matter eligibility. The AIPLA proposal may unintentionally eliminate common law patentability standards. Patents in software and life sciences have been controversial for years. The debate over patentable subject matter, particularly in software and life sciences, has intensified due to recent Supreme Court interest. Section 101 is seen as maintaining a balance between innovation and patent rights, but concerns exist about potential negative impacts on innovation and investment. These discussions may lead to further examination of what types of inventions should be eligible for patents."
