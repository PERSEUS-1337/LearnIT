The Congress finds that the value added by workers in the US and other countries is increasingly dependent on educational and training investments. There is a disparity in investment between the US and its trading partners, leading to declining educational performance in the US. This makes it challenging for US businesses to fund worker education compared to other countries. The current global workforce environment creates competitive pressures on domestic companies to utilize highly educated knowledge workers in other countries. It is in the interest of the United States government, national security, and the welfare of our Nation's workers to reverse this trend through public-private partnerships and maximizing the use of each sector's strength in training our workforce. The purpose of this Act is to encourage businesses and individuals to support the educational development of knowledge workers in the United States by providing incentives for information and communications technology education. This is crucial as the United States needs to train its workforce for high-paying technology jobs to support benefit programs for retiring baby boomers and help mature workers retrain for new jobs after retirement. The Act aims to incentivize businesses and individuals to support educational development for knowledge workers in the US, particularly in information and communications technology, engineering, and manufacturing fields. By encouraging employers to train workers in these areas, the US can better utilize training funds and enhance the skills of newly trained individuals. SEC. 30D.
