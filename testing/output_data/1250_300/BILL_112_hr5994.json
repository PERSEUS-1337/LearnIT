    "content": "The \"Choice in Healthcare Act\" is the short title of the Act. It focuses on Medicare and Medicaid choice. The \"Choice in Healthcare Act\" establishes a demonstration program for Medicare and Medicaid eligible beneficiaries to purchase qualifying health benefits coverage and access a Medi-Choice card for out-of-pocket health care expenditures. Qualifying health benefits coverage must be comprehensive for dual eligible beneficiaries. The \"Choice in Healthcare Act\" establishes a demonstration program for Medicare and Medicaid eligible beneficiaries to purchase comprehensive health benefits coverage. For dual eligible beneficiaries, the coverage must be as comprehensive as benefits provided under parts A, B, and D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act and the State Medicaid plan in California. The demonstration program for Medicare and Medicaid eligible beneficiaries in California offers guaranteed issue coverage without preexisting condition exclusions. Premiums are uniform and do not vary based on age, health status, or location. SEC. 3. MEDI-CHOICE CARD. The Secretary will contract with a credit card provider to issue Medi-Choice cards for purchasing health benefits coverage and covering out-of-pocket costs for eligible beneficiaries. Unused amounts on the card can be used for qualified medical expenses until expended. Unused amounts on a Medi-Choice card remain available until expended by an enrolled eligible beneficiary during the program. ELIGIBLE BENEFICIARIES. In this Act, an eligible beneficiary is a legal permanent resident of the United States eligible for medical assistance under specific programs, excluding those enrolled in disability programs, receiving benefits under certain codes, imprisoned, or non-lawful permanent residents. In this Act, a Medicare eligible beneficiary is defined as someone eligible for medical assistance under specific programs, while a Medicaid eligible beneficiary is also defined. Additionally, a dual eligible beneficiary is someone who qualifies for both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. SEC. 5. FUNDING OF MEDI-CHOICE CARDS. Under the demonstration program, the Secretary will provide funds through the Medi-Choice card to dual eligible beneficiaries and other Medicaid eligible beneficiaries. For dual eligible beneficiaries, the annual deposit amount is based on the average nominal dollar value of medical assistance and benefits under Medicare. For other Medicaid eligible beneficiaries, the annual deposit amount is determined separately. For Medicaid eligible beneficiaries who are not dual eligible, the annual deposit amount is based on the United States average nominal dollar value of medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act for 2012, with subsequent years adjusted for inflation. For Medicare eligible beneficiaries who are not dual eligible, the annual deposit amount is based on the United States average nominal dollar value of benefits under parts A, B, and D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act for 2012, with subsequent years adjusted accordingly. The payment amounts under subsection (a) for an individual are adjusted based on relative risk factors specified by the Secretary. Adjustments are made to ensure the total payments remain unchanged. The Social Security Act allows for adjustments in payment amounts based on income levels. Higher-income individuals may face reductions in their annual payments. An annual inflation adjustment is calculated based on consumer price index and medical care rate increases. Monthly deposits to Medi-Choice cards are credited on a prorated basis for partial months of program enrollment. The demonstration program in California will be conducted in specific counties for 10 years, starting June 1, 2013, with a limit of 100,000 beneficiaries at any time. Payment of costs is outlined in the following section. The Secretary is responsible for operating the demonstration program in California, including payments onto Medi-Choice cards. Costs attributable to Medicare or Medicaid eligible beneficiaries will be paid from the respective trust funds or appropriated amounts. No duplicate payments will be made for beneficiaries participating in the program. The Secretary maintains a toll-free phone number to assist beneficiaries with enrollment in the demonstration program. Amounts paid into a Medi-Choice card are not considered income for tax or eligibility purposes. Participants are not responsible for premium payments under Medicare or Medicaid but must use benefits for health coverage. Individuals in the program are not entitled to Medicaid payments. Individuals participating in the demonstration program are not entitled to Medicaid payments for benefits covered under the program. However, medical assistance under Medicaid will continue for services not covered by the program, such as dental, vision, or long-term care."
