The \"Urban Recovery and Growth Act\" extends the Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds by treating them as qualified bonds issued before January 1, 2011. Interest on these bonds is taxable, and the term \"economic development extension bond\" refers to specified bonds issued within a 1-year period for qualified purposes. The term \"specified bond\" refers to any obligation, excluding private activity bonds, where the interest would be tax-exempt under section 103. The issuer must designate the bond for qualified purposes, and the excess amounts in a reserve must be used accordingly. The term \"specified city\" refers to principal cities with high unemployment rates that qualify for certain economic development purposes and refinancing of existing debt. The specified city must meet specific criteria to qualify for economic development purposes and debt refinancing, including having an average unemployment rate at least 150% higher than the national average and a population loss of at least 20% between 2000 and 2010.
