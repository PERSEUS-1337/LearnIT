    "content": "The electric utility industry is a major source of air pollution, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. The EPA released an analysis comparing different approaches to controlling this pollution, with market-oriented mechanisms being more cost-effective. The Administration's \"Clear Skies\" proposal was compared to bills by Senators Jeffords and Carper, with the latter imposing stricter requirements. The Administration initially resisted conducting the study but relented after the Clear Skies bill failed to advance in the Senate committee. The Clear Skies bill (S. 131) failed to advance in the Senate committee due to concerns about a lack of analysis comparing its provisions to other bills. EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson promised to conduct a cost-benefit analysis, which has now been released. Electric utility generating facilities are a major source of air pollution, emitting gases that pose risks to human health and welfare. Electric utility generating facilities emit gases that pose risks to human health and welfare, including particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. Regulations under the Clean Air Act have led to declines in SO2 and NOx emissions, but unregulated CO2 emissions continue to rise. Fossil-fuel-fired electric generating plants are significant contributors to emissions, with Hg emissions from utility facilities being a major concern. Emissions from U.S. fossil-fuel electric generating plants, including CO2, NOx, SO2, and Hg, are a major concern due to their impact on air quality and health. The current administration has voluntary limits on CO2 emissions but rejected mandatory limits under the Kyoto Protocol. The Senate passed a resolution calling for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases in 2005. The air quality control regime is complex and evolving with additional controls being implemented. The Senate passed a resolution in 2005 calling for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases, including a \"multi-pollutant\" approach targeting SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 emissions from utility sources. This approach aims to balance environmental goals with industry stability, as seen in recent rules like CAIR, CAMR, and CAVR. The Clean Air Act amendments in 2005 introduced new rules to cap emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg from coal-fired power plants, with a focus on improving air quality and reducing mercury pollution in water bodies. Legislation addressing power plant pollution comprehensively is seen as a potential solution by industry, environmental groups, Congress, and the Administration. Legislation addressing power plant pollution comprehensively is seen as a potential solution by industry, environmental groups, Congress, and the Administration. In the 109th Congress, six bills have been introduced to impose multi-pollutant controls on utilities, including SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions. The proposed legislation, known as \"Clear Skies,\" aims to reduce emissions through a system of tradeable allowances, with some proposals including CO2 caps. Key questions in the debate include the stringency of caps, the timeline for reductions, and whether CO2 should be included in the emissions cap. All bills would eventually require a 70% to 80% reduction in NOx and SO2 emissions from 1998 levels. The proposed legislation aims to reduce emissions through tradeable allowances, with some proposals including CO2 caps. All bills would require a 70% to 80% reduction in NOx and SO2 emissions, with Clear Skies bill being the least stringent. Deadlines for reductions are set for 2018, but actual targets may not be met for a decade due to \"banking\" provisions allowing utilities to overcomply early on. The Administration promotes its approach by highlighting projected overcompliance, leading to delays in achieving emissions caps. EPA analysis shows full 70% emission reductions not expected until 2026 under the Clear Skies bill. Jeffords and Carper bills, with earlier and stricter caps, would result in compliance at least a decade sooner. Clear Skies does not address CO2 emissions, potentially impacting compliance strategies and market dynamics. EPA's cost-benefit analysis was released on October 27. The EPA's cost-benefit analysis, released on October 27, examined different compliance strategies for reducing CO2 emissions. The analysis compared options including the Administration's Clear Skies bill, Senator Carper's Clean Air Planning Act, and Senator Jeffords' Clean Power Act. The results showed little difference between the Clear Skies options, suggesting they can be simplified into three principal choices. EPA's Multi-Pollutant Regulatory Analysis assumes that without new legislation, emissions reductions would be delayed until 2026 under the Clear Skies bill. The EPA's Multi-Pollutant Regulatory Analysis, based on the Managers' Mark version, assumes no additional action on emissions control beyond rules finalized by mid-2004. EPA excluded three finalized rules on SO2, NOx, and Hg, designating them as a \"sixth proposal.\" This analysis serves as the baseline for current and future clean air regulation. The uncertainty surrounding clean air regulation rules, such as S. 843 introduced in the 108th Congress, highlights the evolving nature of legislation. EPA's cost analysis focuses on Electric Demand Price Elasticity and scenarios with varying demand response to electricity price changes. It is crucial to base analysis on updated baseline projections for controlling air pollution effectively. EPA's cost analysis emphasizes Electric Demand Price Elasticity and scenarios with varying demand response to electricity price changes. It also considers Short-term Construction Constraints and Assumed Electricity Demand Growth and Natural Gas Supply scenarios. The analysis includes assumptions on labor shortages, market responsiveness, electricity demand growth, and natural gas prices, with potential impacts from proposed legislation. Based on various assumptions and scenarios, EPA developed four scenarios with different combinations of assumptions regarding electricity demand growth and natural gas prices. The scenarios include different levels of price elasticity, construction constraints, and supply assumptions. This report focuses on EPA's Demand Response Scenario as the benchmark analysis. The Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario assumes zero price elasticity and short-term construction constraints. EPA's Demand Response Scenario is used as the benchmark analysis, incorporating short-term demand response functions. The choice is based on factors and lack of alternative combinations. The inclusion of short-term price elasticities in all scenarios is questioned, as EPA only included it in one scenario. Other assumptions in the Demand Response Scenario, such as boilermaker labor, are also debatable. The EPA's Demand Response Scenario includes assumptions about boilermaker labor availability, which has been questioned by the Institute of Clean Air Companies. They found no constraints on construction even if the deadline was moved to 2010. The air pollution control industry has shown the ability to install significant amounts of pollution control equipment in short periods of time. The air pollution control industry has demonstrated the ability to install significant amounts of pollution control equipment in short periods of time. Factors such as modular construction methods and non-union craft labor will reduce the demand for union boilermakers. Additional boilermaker labor can be sourced from Canadian boilermaker union, ship builders, and iron workers. There will be sufficient boilermaker capacity to carry out projected installations for 2010 and 2015. The Canadian boilermaker union, ship builders, and iron workers will provide sufficient capacity for the projected IAQR and control installation for 2010 and 2015. The assumption of limited boilermaker availability only affects certain scenarios, and it is more important to include a demand elasticity function in the analysis. Future natural gas supply is also an important issue. The analysis prioritizes including a demand elasticity function over removing a questionable feasibility constraint. The EPA's demand response scenario is chosen as the base case. Sensitivity analysis is crucial for understanding cost estimate robustness due to uncertainties in future natural gas supply. EPA's supply curves project more availability at lower prices compared to EIA's curves, which may be more representative of future supplies. However, the historic volatility of the natural gas market and the 15-year timeframe leave room for debate. This analysis uses the Demand Response Scenario despite concerns about feasibility constraints and market volatility. The analysis focuses on the Demand Response Scenario for discussing the Clear Skies bill, which has lower costs and benefits compared to other bills. Clear Skies aims to revamp the Clean Air Act with cost-effective measures, particularly lacking provisions for Hg and CO2. The Clear Skies bill aims to revamp the Clean Air Act with cost-effective measures, but lacks provisions for CO2. Compared to other bills, Clear Skies has lower benefits, with annual benefits of $6 billion in 2010, significantly less than the Carper and Jeffords bills which offer $51 billion and $83 billion respectively. The required pollution caps in Clear Skies are less stringent, leading to lower benefits compared to the other bills. The EPA analysis compares the effects of different bills on the Clean Air Act. Clear Skies has minimal additional costs when adjusted for current requirements, with benefits equal to 10% of newly promulgated rules in 2010 and 2% in 2020. Senator Jeffords' bill (S. 150) offers the greatest benefits, with $83 billion annually in 2010 and $66 billion in 2020, surpassing other bills significantly. The EPA analysis compares the effects of different bills on the Clean Air Act. Senator Jeffords' bill (S. 150) offers the greatest benefits, with $83 billion annually in 2010 and $66 billion in 2020, surpassing other bills significantly. The Jeffords bill would reduce coal production and coal-fired power plants may be forced to shut down due to a shortage of skilled labor for scrubber installation. The EPA analysis indicates that the Jeffords bill (S. 150) would lead to a significant reduction in coal production and coal-fired power plants due to a shortage of skilled labor for scrubber installation. The bill would require a shift to renewable energy sources, resulting in additional generation capacity from renewable sources and oil- and gas-fired capacity. The net benefits of S. 150 exceed those of other bills, including Clear Skies and S. 843 (Carper), with lower costs and higher emission reductions. S. 843 (Carper) aims to achieve substantial emission reductions beyond the Clean Air Act, with lower costs than S. 150 and higher costs than Clear Skies. The bill includes a phased-in schedule to mitigate short-term constraints and a flexible CO2 requirement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at a nominal cost. EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on key variables such as price elasticity, construction constraints, and electricity growth. The EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on key variables such as price elasticity, construction constraints, and electricity growth in relation to natural gas supply. Different scenarios were examined, including the No Construction Constraint Scenario, EPA Base Case Scenario, and Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario. These scenarios varied in assumptions regarding price elasticity, construction constraints, and electricity growth curves. The analysis indicated that the No Construction Constraint Scenario had minimal impact on S. 843 and the Managers' Mark. The analysis compared different assumptions regarding price elasticity and construction constraints. The removal of price elasticity had a significant impact on the cost of S. 150, increasing it by 36% in the short term and 157% in the long term. The EPA Base Case Scenario replaced the short-term price elasticity estimate with zero elasticity while maintaining construction constraints. The EPA Base Case Scenario replaces short-term price elasticity with zero elasticity, leading to significant cost increases for S. 150 and S. 843 in 2010 and 2020. Demand response and construction constraints heavily influence EPA's 2010 cost estimates for S. 843, while long-term costs are less affected. The Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario combines zero price elasticity with higher electricity growth assumptions. The Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario adds EIA's higher electricity growth assumptions and steeper natural gas supply curves to the EPA Base Case Scenario. This results in higher costs, particularly for S. 150, due to zero demand response and tighter natural gas supply. The impact is most pronounced for S. 150 in 2020, putting pressure on the assumption of zero demand price elasticity. The sensitivity analysis is limited, suggesting a need for a more comprehensive analysis of future natural gas availability. The impact of demand price elasticity on S. 843 is minimal compared to S. 150. EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity significantly affects the cost estimates for S. 150 in the short and long term, especially with higher electricity growth and natural gas assumptions. The effects on S. 843 decrease over time due to its less aggressive timeline. The Managers' Mark cost estimates are not significantly impacted by EPA's assumptions. The cost estimates for S. 843 are minimally impacted by EPA's assumptions, even with higher cost assumptions. The bill sets a less aggressive timeline for reducing carbon dioxide emissions compared to S. 150, resulting in significantly lower costs for CO2 allowances. The S. 843 bill sets a slower timeline for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, leading to lower costs for CO2 allowances compared to S. 150. The estimated costs range from $19 to $33 per metric ton in 2010 and 2020, aligning with current European Union market prices. EPA did not develop new data on control technologies for the study due to time constraints. The EPA did not develop new data on the cost or cost-effectiveness of control technologies for the study, relying on assumptions from 2005. The analysis may overstate the cost of emission controls for mercury significantly. The air pollution control industry states that the cost of activated carbon injection controls is now one-fourth of what it was in 2003. EPA's analysis shows benefits outweighing costs for both S. 150 and S. 843. The EPA's analysis of S. 150 and S. 843 shows benefits outweighing costs, particularly in reducing emissions of SO2 and fine particles, leading to reduced mortality. Environmental benefits such as reducing acid deposition from SO2 emissions were not monetized but are significant. Reductions in SO2 emissions could have significant environmental benefits, including harm to aquatic life, forest growth, and building materials. The analysis did not estimate the effects of regional haze or mercury deposition on fish consumption advisories. The omission of these environmental benefits has the greatest impact on S. 150 and S. 843, which have more aggressive control schemes for SO2, NOx, and Hg. Additionally, the analysis did not consider the health effects of mercury or the benefits of controlling CO2 emissions. The analysis did not estimate the benefits of controlling CO2 emissions, which may be a significant omission. The Jeffords bill is the most aggressive in this regard. EPA's analysis shows little cost and small benefits for Clear Skies legislation, while the Jeffords and Carper bills have benefits outweighing costs. The Jeffords and Carper bills propose more stringent standards than the promulgated rules, with benefits outweighing costs. Carbon dioxide reduction costs are nominal for S. 843 due to modest requirements and relaxed schedule. Mercury control costs depend on timely data, but EPA's analysis lacks current information. The analysis favors Clear Skies alternatives by overstating costs and penalizing short-term pollution reduction. The analysis of ClearSkies alternatives overstates costs and penalizes short-term pollution reduction schedules. It does not adequately consider natural gas price volatility and is based on outdated 2003 assumptions, limiting its relevance for current congressional debate."
