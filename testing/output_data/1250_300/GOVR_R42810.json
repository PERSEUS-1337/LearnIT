    "content": "The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 (H.R. 1627, P.L. 112-154) is an omnibus bill with provisions impacting various veterans programs. It reflects a compromise agreement by House and Senate Committees on Veterans Affairs on multiple bills reported during the 112th Congress. The Department of Veterans Affairs operates the nation's largest integrated health care system for veterans. Eligibility for VA medical care is based on factors like veteran status, disabilities, income, and exposures. The Veterans' Health Care, Training, and Small Business Loan Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-72) and P.L. 103-210 provided special authority for the VA to treat veterans for disorders possibly related to Agent Orange and ionizing radiation exposure, as well as health care for Persian Gulf War veterans with conditions possibly linked to toxic substances or environmental hazards during their service. Congress passed P.L. 112-154 to address the chemical exposure at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina by providing eligibility for VA health care services for certain veterans stationed there from 1957 to 1987. These veterans are eligible to receive medical care for fifteen specified illnesses or conditions related to the contaminated well water. The VA provides medical care for veterans exposed to contaminated well water at Camp Lejeune from 1957 to 1987 for fifteen specified illnesses. The State Veterans' Home program offers nursing home care facilities with eligibility criteria set by the VA and managed by state laws. The VA provides medical care for veterans exposed to contaminated well water at Camp Lejeune from 1957 to 1987 for specified illnesses. State Veterans' Homes have their own admission criteria governed by state laws. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 equalized the cost of nursing home care for veterans regardless of the setting, allowing higher per diem rates for care provided to veterans with a 70% service-connected disability. The Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-461) equalized nursing home care costs for veterans, with higher per diem rates for those with a 70% service-connected disability. Some state veterans' nursing homes reported smaller reimbursements after the VA implemented this new methodology. P.L. 112-154 requires the VA to contract with SVHs for care of veterans with service-connected conditions or a 70% disability rating, with reimbursement developed in consultation with SVHs. The VA is required to establish a comprehensive policy on reporting and tracking sexual assault and safety incidents at medical facilities, with a report due 60 days after implementation and annually thereafter. The Government Accountability Office found numerous sexual assault incidents reported to VA police, including rape and inappropriate touching, with many incidents not reported to VA leadership or the Inspector General due to a lack of centralized reporting system. The VA is mandated to create a policy for reporting and tracking sexual assault and safety incidents at medical facilities, with reports due 60 days after implementation and annually. The policy should consider the impact on veterans' mental health and substance abuse treatments. Additionally, TBI has become a prominent injury in OEF/OIF due to increased blast injuries from IEDs, RPGs, and land mines. The increase in traumatic brain injuries (TBI) among veterans is attributed to factors such as blast injuries from explosives, improved survival rates due to better medical care, and increased awareness among healthcare professionals. The total number of veterans with TBI is unknown, partly due to difficulties in identification and access to healthcare services. Concerns have been raised about the VA's interpretation of providing comprehensive care for TBI, potentially limiting rehabilitative services essential for physical and cognitive progress. The VA's interpretation of the statute regarding rehabilitative care for veterans with TBI has raised concerns about potential limitations on essential therapies. Section 107 of P.L. 112-154 mandates rehabilitative care to maximize independence and improve behavioral and mental health functioning. Telemedicine and telehealth are defined as electronic communication and information technologies used for medical purposes and long-distance clinical health care support. Telehealth, a broader concept than telemedicine, involves using electronic information and telecommunications technologies for long-distance clinical health care, patient education, and health administration. Telemental health refers to behavioral health services provided through communication technology, including assessments, therapy, and psychiatry. The VA has been involved in telehealth activities since 1977. The VA has been a national leader in telehealth development since 1977, providing mental health care to veterans in rural areas through telehealth technologies. Telehealth offers benefits as an alternative to in-person treatment and can be cost-effective within the VA health care system. VA facilities are required to offer teleconsultation programs for remote mental health assessments and training opportunities in telemedicine for medical residents. The VA offers remote mental health and TBI assessments in facilities without contract or fee-basis care. Veterans in the VA health care system do not pay copayments for service-connected conditions or illnesses. Those with 50% or more disability are not charged copayments for any condition. Additionally, veterans do not pay copayments for various outpatient services. The VA provides a range of services including counseling, telephone care, laboratory services, radiology, MST counseling, mental health services, and hospice care. Veterans may have copayments for non-service-connected conditions, but copayments can be waived for telehealth consultations. The VA is authorized to provide service dogs for hearing, mobility, and mental health issues. The VA is authorized to provide service dogs for veterans with mental illnesses, including PTSD. Research studies are being conducted to assess the benefits of using service dogs to treat veterans with physical or mental injuries. Additionally, a service dog trained by an accredited entity may have access to VA facilities. Congress mandated the establishment of an Office of Rural Health within the Veterans Health Administration to address disparities in service between rural and non-rural veterans. The VHA established the Office of Rural Health (ORH) in 2006 to address disparities in service between rural and non-rural veterans. Three Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers (VRHRCs) were opened in FY2009 to develop special practices for facilities nationwide. These Centers serve as field-based clinical laboratories experimenting with new outreach and care models. Section 110 of P.L. 112-154 mandates VRHRCs to improve understanding of challenges faced by rural veterans, identify disparities in healthcare availability, formulate programs to enhance healthcare delivery, and develop special practices. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) gave the VHA authority to bill veterans and insurers for nonservice-connected care to help defray costs. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) allowed the VHA to retain these funds in the VA's Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF). The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) allowed the VHA to retain third-party payments in the VA's Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) for providing medical services to veterans without fiscal year limitations. The Act also authorized changing billing basis from \"reasonable costs\" to \"reasonable charges\" to increase collections. In FY2004, the Administration requested consolidating various medical collections accounts into the MCCF. The VA was granted permanent authority to deposit funds from specific accounts into the MCCF for medical services for veterans. The VA is required to develop a plan to identify and collect billable third-party revenue to be deposited in the MCCF, including effective billing and collection procedures and employee training. The VA is required to develop policies and procedures for billing and collection of funds, set fee revenue goals, and implement a monitoring system. A three-year initiative is in place to assess treating Vet Centers as VA facilities for beneficiary travel reimbursement in highly rural areas. The VA Secretary must report to Congress on the initiative within 180 days of enactment. Eligible veterans and beneficiaries can receive mileage reimbursement for travel to Vet Centers. The VA is required to issue a report to Congress within 180 days on the beneficiaries of the initiative and an analysis of the initiative. VA provides eligible veterans and beneficiaries with mileage reimbursement, special mode transport, and common carrier transport for healthcare travel. Pre-authorization is required for ambulance and common carrier expenses, except in emergencies. VA proposed using local Medicare ambulance rates for reimbursement to save costs. In its FY2012 budget submission, VA proposed using local Medicare ambulance rates for reimbursement to save costs. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 allowed VA to pay the lesser of the actual amount charged by the ambulance provider or the applicable Medicare rate, but a technical correction was needed to authorize reimbursement at the lesser of the actual charge or the local Medicare rate. Section 704 of P.L. 112-154 authorizes VA to reimburse ambulance providers at the lesser of the actual charge or the local Medicare rate when no contract is in place. The new reimbursement method applies to all ambulance transportation except for unauthorized non-VA emergency care. Section 705 allows VA to use the veteran's household income from the most recent year for determining eligibility for health care based on income. P.L. 112-154 authorizes the VA to use the veteran's household income from the most recent year to determine eligibility for health care and make changes to the Specially Adapted Housing Program for veterans and servicemembers with certain disabilities. The program includes grants for mobility impairments and adaptations for blindness or loss of hand use. The dollar limit for mobility grants is higher than for adaptations grants. The \u00a72101(b) grant aids veterans who are blind or have lost hand use, and can be used to adapt a family member's home. The dollar limit for the \u00a72101(a) grant is higher, and both grants are available to veterans with severe burn injuries. Section 202 of P.L. 112-154 expands qualifying disabilities for \u00a72101(a) grants to cover veterans or servicemembers with lower extremity loss affecting balance and propulsion. Section 203 changes the \u00a72101(b) blindness measure to 20/200 vision in the better eye with corrective lens. The new law, P.L. 112-154, aligns the VA visual impairment standard with 20/200 vision in the better eye with corrective lens. It also increases the maximum assistance for grants to $63,780 for \u00a72101(a) and $12,756 for \u00a72101(b). The VA Secretary will adjust the award limits annually based on a cost-of-construction index. Additionally, veterans can use grants to modify family members' homes temporarily, known as the Temporary Residence Adaptation (TRA) grant. Section 205 of P.L. 112-154 outlines changes to the TRA grant. The Temporary Residence Adaptation (TRA) grant allows veterans to modify family members' homes temporarily. The TRA grant maximums have been increased to $28,000 for \u00a72101(a) and $5,000 for \u00a72101(b) under P.L. 112-154. The grants will be adjusted annually based on a cost-of-construction index, and the authority for TRA grants has been extended to December 31, 2022. Additionally, Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 provides an exception to grant funding limits for homes substantially damaged in a disaster. The VA Loan Guaranty Program allows eligible veterans to enter into mortgages with private lenders, with the VA guaranteeing to pay a portion of losses in case of borrower default. The program differs from the FHA loan insurance program as it guarantees only a portion of the loan. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 provides exceptions for cases where a previously-adapted home is substantially damaged in a disaster, allowing disabled veterans or servicemembers to receive funds to acquire another suitable home without affecting their maximum benefit. The VA Loan Guaranty Program allows eligible veterans to enter into mortgages with private lenders, with the VA guaranteeing to pay a portion of losses in case of borrower default. Veterans pay a one-time fee based on factors like down payment amount and military service history. Surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability are now included in the definition of veteran for loan guaranty eligibility. The VA Loan Guaranty Program now includes surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability. Spouses qualify for the loan guaranty if the disability was rated totally disabling for a certain duration. Amendments have been made to the housing occupancy requirement for loan eligibility. The VA Loan Guaranty Program now includes surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability. Amendments to the housing occupancy requirement allow veterans' dependent children to satisfy the requirement when the veteran is called away for active duty. Permanent programs for guaranteeing adjustable rate mortgages are established, and modifications are made to the law regarding when veterans with service-connected disabilities may have the loan guaranty fee waived. The new law streamlines disability compensation eligibility by allowing pre-discharge reviews of medical evidence. Section 702 of P.L. 112-154 addresses loan fees, maximum guaranty amounts, and loan sales securities for veterans. It extends current loan fees until October 1, 2017 and reinstates higher guaranty amounts for housing in high-cost areas. The VA's maximum guaranty amount for loans was temporarily increased through 2014 by P.L. 110-389 and P.L. 112-154. The guaranty amount is set at 25% of the higher of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit or 125% of the area median home price, not exceeding 175% of the Freddie Mac limit. In high-cost areas, the VA can guarantee loans up to $1,094,625. The VA's authority to guarantee loans up to $1,094,625 in high-cost areas was extended through December 31, 2014. Additionally, the VA's authority to bundle and sell vendee loans was extended through December 31, 2016. The VA previously used the Enhanced Use Lease process to lease unused property for VA-related purposes. The VA's Enhanced Use Lease program allows for in-kind payments such as goods and services to benefit VA facilities. EULs can now only be used for \"supportive housing\" for homeless or at-risk veterans. Leases entered into before January 1, 2012, are subject to previous laws, and consideration for EULs must be \"cash at fair value.\" The VA's Enhanced Use Lease program allows for in-kind payments to benefit VA facilities. EULs can only be used for supportive housing for homeless or at-risk veterans. Leases entered before January 1, 2012, are subject to previous laws, and consideration for EULs must be \"cash at fair value.\" The Grant and Per Diem program authorizes the VA to make grants for transitional housing and services for homeless veterans. The VA Grant and Per Diem program reimburses grant recipients for providing housing and services to homeless veterans, with a current per diem rate of $38.90 per day. Grants can be used for construction, acquisition, and rehabilitation of facilities, and can also be combined with Low Income Housing Tax Credits. Grantees may receive funds from other sources as long as the project is operated by a private nonprofit organization. Ownership structures like for-profit limited partnerships are included. The VA Grant and Per Diem program, authorized at $250 million for FY2013 and $150 million for subsequent years, targets homeless veterans with special needs. It now includes male veterans with dependent children, eliminates certain requirements for grantees, allows funds to be used for services to dependents, and extends the authorization level for Special Needs grants. The VA Grant and Per Diem program, authorized at $250 million for FY2013 and $150 million for subsequent years, targets homeless veterans with special needs. It allows funds to be used for services to dependents, extends the authorization level for Special Needs grants, and makes homeless veterans eligible for the Health Care for Homeless Veterans program. The HUD-VASH program provides housing vouchers for homeless veterans with case management and clinical services. The VA works with local Public Housing Authorities to distribute Section 8 vouchers for homeless veterans, while VA medical centers provide case management. The VA may contract with other entities to help veterans find housing and services. The HVRP and SSVF programs are extended to assist homeless veterans. The Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP) and Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) are extended to assist homeless veterans. HVRP helps veterans find employment, while SSVF aids low-income veterans transitioning from homelessness to housing. The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program (DEA) provides educational benefits to dependents of disabled or deceased servicemembers. DEA participants can receive up to 81 months of benefits by combining programs. The DEA program provides educational benefits to dependents of disabled or deceased servicemembers, allowing participants to receive up to 81 months of benefits by combining programs. The Post-9/11 GI Bill and MGIB-AD also offer educational assistance to eligible servicemembers and veterans. Reporting requirements for these programs are outlined in Section 402 of P.L. 112-154. Section 402 of P.L. 112-154 mandates annual reports to Congress on the Post-9/11 GI Bill and DEA programs. The Defense report must cover recruitment and retention impacts, cost coverage, necessity for recruitment, active duty eligibility, and recommendations. The VA report must include program usage, expenditures, student outcomes, and recommendations. This section also repeals biennial reporting requirements for the MGIB-AD. Section 402 of P.L. 112-154 mandates annual reports to Congress on the Post-9/11 GI Bill and DEA programs, including student outcome measures and recommendations. It also repeals biennial reporting requirements for the MGIB-AD. Additionally, under Section 501 of the same law, the process for submitting additional evidence in benefit claim appeals is streamlined, with the Board of Veterans' Appeals now able to provide initial review instead of waiting for the local VA office. Section 502 of P.L. 112-154 grants the VA authority to allow court-appointed representatives, caregivers, or attorneys to sign claim applications on behalf of claimants. Section 505 of the same law permits the VA to waive its duty to assist requirement when there is sufficient evidence for maximum benefit award. The VA is required to make \"reasonable efforts\" to gather authorized private medical records. Section 505 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to waive its duty to assist if there is enough evidence for maximum benefits. Section 507 clarifies that if a veteran dies, the surviving spouse is entitled to the benefits the veteran would have received. The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA; P.L. 106-475) requires the VA to notify claimants of evidence needed for their claims. Section 504 of P.L. 112-154 removes the requirement for the VCAA notice to be sent only after a claim is filed. Section 504 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to streamline the notification process for disability claims by removing certain requirements, such as sending the notice only after a claim is filed and allowing for electronic communication. The Fully Developed Claim (FDC) process was developed to expedite claim processing, with the effective date typically being the date the claim is received. The date of a claim is when the VA receives the application, and claims generally expire after one year if evidence is not provided. For FDC disability claims, the effective date can be up to one year before the claim application is received. Veterans can establish an effective date for their claim while developing evidence before submission. This change is only available for original FDC disability claims received before August 7, 2015. Joint application forms for VA survivor benefits and Social Security are required, and filing with either agency is considered an application for benefits with both. The joint application form filed with the VA or SSA is considered an application for survivor benefits with both agencies. Section 503 of P.L. 112-154 permits the development of a joint form for survivor benefits. The Improved Disability Pension program provides monthly cash benefits to low-income elderly or disabled veterans. Section 508 of P.L. 112-154 increases the maximum annual benefit for married couples requiring aid and attendance. The maximum annual benefit for married couples who are veterans and require regular aid and attendance has been increased to $32,433. Income received by the veteran or surviving spouse will reduce the maximum cash benefit amount for the Improved Disability Pension and the Improved Death Pension. Disabled veterans and servicemembers may be eligible for financial assistance from the VA to purchase an automobile or adaptive equipment, including a second automobile if certain criteria are met. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA Secretary to provide assistance to veterans for the purchase of a second automobile if the first one was destroyed due to a disaster and not compensated by insurance. The VR&E program offers employment services for disabled veterans, with provisions for independent living services in cases where employment is not feasible. This program also extends subsistence allowances for veterans enrolled in employment programs. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 extends subsistence allowances for veterans in the VR&E employment program for an additional two months after completion, totaling four months for those displaced by disasters. It also waives the annual limit on IL services for veterans affected by disasters. Additionally, P.L. 112-154 increases restrictions on public demonstrations at veterans' funerals. Section 601 of P.L. 112-154 increases time, place, and manner restrictions on demonstrations during funerals of servicemembers and veterans. Demonstrations are now restricted 120 minutes before and after a funeral, with increased minimum distance requirements. Violations can result in statutory damages ranging from $25,000 to $50,000. Section 602 codifies regulations prohibiting the reservation of gravesites at Arlington National Cemetery before an individual's death, with the President having the authority to waive this prohibition. Section 602 of P.L. 112-154 codifies regulations at Arlington National Cemetery, allowing the President to waive the prohibition on reserving gravesites before an individual's death. The Secretary of the Army can establish monuments to honor missing servicemembers, with a 25-year waiting period for individual or group monuments, which can be waived with notification. The Secretary of the Army can waive the 25-year waiting period for establishing monuments to honor missing servicemembers after public and congressional notification. A monument in Arlington National Cemetery sponsored by a nongovernmental entity must provide an independent study of other locations, consult with relevant committees, and receive congressional approval within 60 days to be placed. The VA can provide a certificate with the President's signature to eligible survivors of deceased veterans discharged under honorable conditions. Section 603 of P.L. 112-154 expands eligibility for the Presidential Memorial Certificate to include persons who die in active military, naval, or air service. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections for servicemembers in the event that their military service impedes their ability to meet financial obligations. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) suspends civil claims against servicemembers, protects them from default judgments, and includes provisions such as prohibiting eviction, capping interest rates, and protecting insurance policies. Amendments have been made to the SCRA, with recent changes extending protections related to mortgages and foreclosures until December 31, 2014. Section 710 of the SCRA extends protections for servicemembers related to mortgages and foreclosures until December 31, 2014. It prevents vendors from taking actions such as foreclosure or seizure of property during military service or one year after, unless authorized by a court order or agreement. Additionally, Section 701 requires a report to Congress on the protections under Section 303 of the SCRA. Section 703 of P.L. 112-154 mandates the VA Secretary to report on evaluating and training VBA employees processing disability claims. Section 502 of the Veterans Benefits Act grants special authority to the VA for competitions involving small businesses owned by veterans. Section 502 of the Veterans Benefits Act grants the VA special authority for competitions involving small businesses owned by veterans. Eligibility for contracting preferences is limited to firms listed in a VA database, and misrepresentation can lead to debarment from government contracting. Section 706 of P.L. 112-154 amends Section 502 of the Veterans Benefits Act to clarify that debarment is only imposed in cases of \"willful and intentional\" misrepresentation. Debarment period is now set at \"not less than five years\" and specific time frames are established for debarment actions to be commenced and completed. Additionally, principals of debarred firms are to be treated accordingly. Section 706 of P.L. 112-154 clarifies debarment criteria for firms that willfully and intentionally misrepresented their status. Debarment actions must begin within 30 days of determination and be completed within 90 days. Principals of debarred firms are also subject to a minimum five-year debarment. Additionally, Section 707 requires the VA Secretary to report on conferences costing $20,000 or more attended by 50 or more people. Federal contractors with contracts over $100,000 must report employment information to the Department of Labor annually. Under current law, federal contractors and subcontractors with contracts over $100,000 must report employment information annually to the Department of Labor. The DOL Secretary is required to establish a website for public disclosure of this information. Additionally, the VA Secretary is directed to establish the VetStar program to recognize businesses' contributions to veterans' employment."
