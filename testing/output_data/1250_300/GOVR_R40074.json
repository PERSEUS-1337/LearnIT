President Clinton organized the first Summit of the Americas in Miami in 1994, attended by all democratically elected leaders except Fidel Castro. The leaders approved a Plan of Action with initiatives focused on democracy, economic integration, poverty eradication, and sustainable development. The Miami Summit in 1994 focused on economic integration, free trade, poverty eradication, and sustainable development in the hemisphere. Subsequent Summits introduced new initiatives like the creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by 2005. Special Summits in Bolivia, Chile, and Canada furthered discussions on environmental issues, education, democracy, and the FTAA. The Summit of the Americas process, institutionalized by the Organization of American States (OAS), has seen various summits in different countries like Canada, Mexico, and Argentina. These summits have focused on democracy, economic integration, and trade agreements like the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela played a significant role in the discussions, particularly regarding the FTAA negotiations. In November 2005, the Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata, Argentina, focused on creating jobs, fighting poverty, and democratic governance. President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela led opposition to the Bush Administration's proposal to resume FTAA negotiations. Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay from Mercosur also opposed the talks, citing issues with U.S. agricultural subsidies and preferring to wait until after the WTO's Doha Development Round for a more balanced agreement. Despite consensus from most countries, dissenting nations' economic influence effectively ended the FTAA negotiations. The Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata, Argentina, focused on jobs, poverty, and governance. President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez opposed FTAA negotiations, leading to their end due to economic influence. The Inter-American Democratic Charter affirms democracy in the region and has been invoked during challenges. The Summits also led to economic initiatives like the Declaration of Nuevo Le\u00f3n committing to reducing barriers. The Summits of the Americas have resulted in significant political and economic changes, such as the removal of leaders like Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2002 and Lucio Guttierez in 2005. Economic initiatives include reducing remittance transfer costs by 50% by 2008, leading to a decrease from 15% to 5.6% between 2000 and 2006. The United States has played a key role in reducing costs by promoting competition and new technology. Social programs like providing anti-retroviral therapy to 600,000 people with HIV/AIDS were also established. The Summits of the Americas led to successful social programs, including providing anti-retroviral therapy to over 640,000 people with HIV/AIDS by 2005. Funding from various initiatives like PEPFAR and the Global Fund contributed to this achievement. The U.S. government also supported HIV testing for over 400,000 individuals and invested over $552 million in HIV/AIDS programs in the region between 2001 and 2007. Despite these accomplishments, the Summits faced criticism for lacking transparency and openness according to civil society and anti-globalization organizations. The Summits of the Americas have faced criticism for lacking transparency and openness, with civil society groups arguing that important discussions should not be held behind closed doors. Some believe the Summits promote corporate power over social welfare, environmental protection, and citizens' rights. Despite agreements for openness and transparency, little has been done to increase civil society participation. Critics also point out that the Summits produce ambitious documents without effectively implementing previous commitments, with over 600 initiatives introduced since the first Summit. The Summits of the Americas have been criticized for producing ambitious documents with new initiatives but lacking in implementation and enforcement mechanisms. Over 600 initiatives have been introduced since the first Summit, but many have not been met due to countries' lack of capacity, will, and resources. This has raised doubts about the effectiveness and credibility of the Summit process in achieving tangible results in the hemisphere. Some analysts question the worth of continuing the Summit of the Americas process. The Summit of the Americas process, initiated in 1994, is being questioned due to economic divisions among countries in the region. The rejection of neoliberal policies at the Mar del Plata Summit reflects a shift towards state-based development programs. Latin Americans show dissatisfaction with privatization and support more state solutions for societal problems. Some analysts suggest focusing on bilateral and multilateral agreements instead of the Summit agenda. The fifth Summit of the Americas was held in April 2009 in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, with all 34 democratically elected leaders attending. The theme was \"Securing our citizens' future by promoting human prosperity, energy security, and environmental sustainability.\" Cuba was the only country not invited due to its communist government. Some analysts suggest focusing on bilateral and multilateral agreements for free trade instead of the Summit agenda. The Port of Spain Summit in 2009 excluded Cuba due to its communist government. The United States faced isolation in the region with only 58% of Latin Americans having favorable opinions of the country. Venezuela and Bolivia expelled U.S. Ambassadors, and regional bodies like the Rio Group and UNASUR gained more influence while the OAS lost power. President Obama faced policy disagreements and confrontations from some regional leaders at the Summit, including President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela. President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela attended the Summit to defend integration of the Caribbean and Latin America, demanding the US lift its blockade of Cuba and condemning Israel. He also led a meeting of ALBA countries who refused to sign the Summit's Declaration of Commitment. Other regional leaders blamed the US for the global financial crisis and called for a new US policy towards Cuba, leading to low expectations for the Summit. Despite divisions and low expectations for the Summit, some analysts were optimistic due to the Port of Spain Draft Declaration of Commitment, which outlined specific targets and institutions for proposed initiatives. President Obama's attendance was seen as a potential opportunity to improve relations with Latin America. The Summit Implementation Review Group issued a Draft Declaration of Commitment for the Port of Spain Summit, which proposed 65 commitments under six themes. Negotiations continued, resulting in a final Declaration with 96 commitments but less measurable mandates. Some analysts praised the Draft for its focus on implementation, but the final Declaration was criticized as largely meaningless. The final Declaration at the Port of Spain Summit was criticized as largely meaningless, with some countries refusing to sign due to inadequate addressing of key issues. Prime Minister Patrick Manning of Trinidad and Tobago signed on behalf of all participating countries. The Declaration reaffirmed support for past commitments on human prosperity and introduced new goals, such as reducing business start-up times and incorporating non-communicable disease surveillance into national health information.
