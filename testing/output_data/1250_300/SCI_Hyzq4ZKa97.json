    "content": "In this study, a new metric called NetScore is introduced to evaluate deep neural networks for practical on-device edge usage. NetScore aims to provide a quantitative assessment of the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture complexity. The evaluation compares NetScore, top-1 accuracy, and information density metrics across 60 different deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ImageNet dataset. The study compared information density metrics across 60 deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ImageNet dataset. The results serve as a reference guide for practitioners in the field, highlighting the challenges in designing practical deep neural networks that balance accuracy and complexity. In designing practical deep neural networks, assessing the balance between accuracy and complexity is a key challenge. While information density metrics like NetScore attempt to measure this balance, they do not consider computational requirements for network inference. Therefore, there is a need for universal performance metrics that account for accuracy, architectural complexity, and computational complexity to improve network model search and design. The study evaluates deep convolutional neural networks like AlexNet BID22, setting \u03b2 = 0.5 and \u03b3 = 0.5 to assess accuracy, computational complexity, and network usability. The results can guide practitioners in designing practical networks."
