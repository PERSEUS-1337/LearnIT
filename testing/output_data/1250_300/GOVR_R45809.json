    "content": "Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 was the first policy guidance for critical infrastructure protection, framing the issue in terms of national vulnerability to attacks. It defined critical infrastructure as essential for national power and highlighted four key areas of policy concern for Congress. The directive PDD-63 outlined critical infrastructure as essential for national power, setting ambitious goals to eliminate vulnerabilities to cyber and physical attacks. However, establishing consistent criteria for assessing critical assets has proven challenging due to the complexity and interconnectedness of infrastructure systems. The U.S. and global economies complicate efforts to identify critical assets and systems, such as the electricity sub-sector with 7,000 power plants. The USA PATRIOT Act defines critical infrastructure as vital systems and assets crucial for national security and economic stability. Critical infrastructure policy has evolved to include essential services and public conveniences, expanding beyond physical foundations to address a wide range of threats. Critical infrastructure policy has evolved to include a wider range of threats, including asymmetric attacks by state and non-state adversaries using physical or cyber means. Natural disasters and other causes of damage have also become significant elements in critical infrastructure policy since 9/11. The USA PATRIOT Act's definition of critical infrastructure remains law, but policymakers have expanded the threshold of criticality. Critical infrastructure policy has evolved post-9/11 to include a wider range of threats, with a focus on infrastructure as an enabler of prosperity, public safety, and civic life. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan defines critical infrastructure as assets that underpin American society, considering impacts of various hazard events at different levels. Successive Administrations have expanded CI policy beyond national security, reflecting a global trend among developed countries. Successive Administrations since 1998 have expanded critical infrastructure policy to include sectors beyond national security, focusing on societal resilience at the system level. In January 2017, the Department of Homeland Security designated U.S. election systems as critical infrastructure, including physical locations and technology infrastructure. Currently, there are 16 critical infrastructure sectors outlined by Presidential directives. The critical infrastructure sectors, outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 21, play a vital role in supporting the nation's civic life. These sectors are organized through public-private partnerships, coordinated by DHS, with various federal agencies assigned as Sector-Specific Agencies. The expanding definitions of critical infrastructure highlight the diverse array of national economic and social activities. The private sector plays a crucial role in the diverse array of critical infrastructure sectors, each with its own unique characteristics and stakeholders. As these sectors evolve, new communities of interest emerge, leading to varied perspectives on what constitutes critical infrastructure. This diversity results in a lack of a consistent definition of critical infrastructure, despite the statutory definition remaining unchanged for nearly two decades. The diverse perspectives on critical infrastructure lead to varied definitions and priorities in identifying and protecting infrastructure assets. This reflects different organizational perspectives and requirements, with a focus on consequences of asset loss or system disruption. Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) focuses on identifying and safeguarding infrastructure assets based on their criticality, defined by the impact of their loss or disruption on essential functions of society, the economy, or government. Critical infrastructure resilience (CIR) involves investing in hazard mitigation and preparedness to ensure infrastructure functions during emergencies. National CI policy in the US and other developed countries combines elements of both CIP and CIR, shifting towards a focus on system resilience over asset protection. National CI policy in the United States and other developed countries reflects a hybrid approach that includes elements of both Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) and Critical Infrastructure Resilience (CIR). This approach aims to prioritize system resilience over asset protection, leading to complexities in defining criticality and identifying what is critical in specific contexts. The term \"critical infrastructure security\" is used in this report to discuss CI policy without favoring CIP or CIR. Legislation and government directives post-2001 have often required the creation of asset lists and databases to identify critical systems and assets needing higher levels of protection. However, the practical application of this logic introduces complexities, leading to ongoing challenges in asset identification and prioritization across all CI sectors. The application of logic in identifying critical infrastructure introduces complexities, leading to challenges in asset prioritization. Inventory requirements are the first step in risk management strategies for critical infrastructure protection. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets in 2003 directed the development of a methodology to identify critical facilities. The Department of Homeland Security began operations and developed a methodology to identify critical facilities, systems, and functions with national-level criticality. This led to the release of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 in 2003, which directed the protection of critical infrastructure to prevent deliberate harm. Despite claims of a comprehensive database in the 2006 NIPP, a DHS Inspector General report found shortcomings in the national database of critical infrastructure assets. The 2006 NIPP claimed to have a comprehensive database of critical infrastructure assets, but a 2006 DHS Inspector General report found shortcomings in the database. The report highlighted issues with the inclusion of non-critical assets and lack of standardized data collection procedures. Congress later included provisions for the National Asset Database in the 9-11 Commission Act of 2007. The National Asset Database was established as part of the 9-11 Commission Act of 2007, requiring a compilation of vital assets and a classified list of critical infrastructure. The Secretary determines assets with potential catastrophic effects if disrupted. Quality control procedures ensure asset nominations meet criticality thresholds. Despite improvements in asset identification processes, questions remain about reporting criteria and methodology according to a 2013 Government Accountability Office report. The 2013 GAO report highlighted ongoing questions about reporting criteria and methodology for identifying critical assets within the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) established by DHS. Methodological adjustments were made to assess the criticality of assets based on potential adverse consequences, such as fatalities, economic loss, mass evacuation length, and national security impacts. Unique characteristics of critical infrastructure were taken into account, like the potential second-order effects of disruptions to the U.S. financial system or election infrastructure. The 2013 GAO report raised concerns about the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) established by DHS, noting the lack of independent peer review for asset nomination vetting methods. It recommended a review to ensure the list identifies the nation's highest priority infrastructure. Being listed in the NCIPP elevates an asset's national significance, impacting government prioritization, risk assessments, regulatory regimes, grant programs, criminal prosecutions, and emergency preparedness. The exact number of nominated assets, numbering in the thousands, is classified. Despite the significant implications, some state governments were hesitant to participate in DHS data calls due to compliance burdens. The 2013 GAO report highlighted concerns with the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) established by DHS, noting issues with asset nomination vetting methods. Some state governments were reluctant to participate in DHS data calls due to compliance burdens. The NCIPP list, classified and numbering in the thousands, lacks documentation of compliance with statutory reporting requirements. Persistent difficulties exist in ensuring the completeness and currency of centralized inventories of critical infrastructure assets. The Critical Infrastructure Resilience (CIR) prioritizes adaptive use of critical capabilities for continuity of service during stress on infrastructure systems. The Critical Infrastructure Resilience (CIR) focuses on using critical capabilities to ensure continuity of service during stress on infrastructure systems. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database, managed by DHS, DOD, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and U.S. Geological Survey, collects data from public and private sector partners for emergency planning and contingency situations. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database, managed by DHS, DOD, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and U.S. Geological Survey, compiles data from public and private sector partners for emergency planning. It includes critical assets for homeland security functions and non-critical assets that may become important in specific emergencies. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services used HIFLD during the 2017 hurricane season to locate day care centers in impacted areas. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database, utilized by various government agencies, provides crucial infrastructure data for emergency planning and response. During the 2017 hurricane season, the Department of Health and Human Services used HIFLD to locate day care centers in affected areas, enabling them to ensure the safety of children in disaster zones. The HIFLD partnership model allows government agencies and private sector entities to access infrastructure data for real-world use cases, supporting preparedness and incident management activities. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database is widely used for emergency planning and incident management by federal and SLTT agencies. Despite declining state participation in NCIPP, CIP-based approaches to inventory of critical infrastructure assets remain relevant. Congress has mandated DHS to identify critical utilities and security assets at risk, while chemical manufacturing facilities are subject to regulatory enforcement under CFATS to protect against cyber and physical threats. The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) regulations require owner-operators to protect facilities against cyber and physical threats. Congress may need to consider policy implications for legacy programs like the NCIPP asset list. Stakeholder participation in NCIPP may require additional appropriations for data gathering and analysis. Updates to the National Asset Database requirements may be necessary to align with emerging CISA programs and priorities. Congress should also consider efforts to identify and prioritize critical infrastructure systems and assets. Efforts to identify and prioritize critical infrastructure systems and assets are crucial for understanding and assessing homeland security risks. Risk assessments inform planning, resource allocation decisions, and regulatory oversight. DHS defines risk as the potential for unwanted outcomes from incidents, considering threat, vulnerability, and consequence factors. DHS considers threat, vulnerability, and consequence as components of risk, with threat defined as potential harm from natural or man-made occurrences. Threat assessments involve data on human adversaries or natural hazards, while vulnerability is defined as a feature that makes an entity susceptible to exploitation. Vulnerability assessments provide information about characteristics of assets or systems that may leave them open to exploitation or damage from a threat or hazard. Assessments may contain recommendations for adoption of resilience measures to mitigate identified vulnerabilities. Consequence is defined as the effect of an event, incident, or occurrence, focusing on potential consequences of adverse events that disrupt or destroy infrastructure systems and assets. Various methodologies are used to inform infrastructure security investments and activities of federal agencies and SLTT jurisdictions. Since 2007, DHS has utilized risk elements of threat, vulnerability, and consequence in planning and budget activities. Critics question the formula's accuracy in assigning probabilities to rare events like terrorist attacks and the independence of its terms. Complex interactions between threat, vulnerability, and consequences challenge the formula's application in resource allocation. The DHS has recognized the need for a complete systemic risk picture for critical infrastructure (CI) and has proposed updates to risk assessment approaches. Legislative and executive branch initiatives in 2018-2019, such as the creation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), have elevated CI risk management as a policy focus. CISA has established the National Risk Management Center (NRMC) for planning, analysis, and collaboration. The creation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has elevated critical infrastructure (CI) risk management as a policy focus. CISA has established the National Risk Management Center (NRMC) to manage national CI risk through cross-sector analysis and capabilities-oriented approaches. Congress may request information on CISA's efforts to institutionalize new risk management methods and leverage expertise from various organizations for infrastructure risk assessment methodology. The Homeland Security Act outlines how the Secretary of Homeland Security can utilize organizational resources for homeland security activities. Congress determines funding priorities and program guidance for organizations supporting national critical infrastructure (CI) security goals. Federal organization addressing CI issues has evolved in response to threats, with three development periods: late 1990s policy initiatives, post-9/11 reorganization to counter terrorist threats, and the current transition to an all-hazards resilience framework for infrastructure security. Federal focus on CI policy increased in the 1990s due to concerns about technology's impact on physical infrastructure, leading to the establishment of the Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in 1996. In the 1990s, concerns about potential cyber threats led to the establishment of the Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in 1996. The Clinton Administration issued PDD-63 in response, requiring the government to address vulnerabilities within five years. The directive focused on interagency coordination and created the National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-Terrorism. Congress also chartered a commission in 1999 to assess terrorist threats. The Gilmore Commission, chartered by Congress in 1999, found that the implementation of PDD-63 was incomplete. The National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counterterrorism lacked program and budget authority, and there was no overall national Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) strategy in place. The Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) were still in early stages of development. The 9/11 attacks had a significant impact on homeland security policy and critical infrastructure protection. Prior to the attacks, there was a lack of national CIP strategy and the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) had not fully established its functions. The Gilmore Commission recommended reestablishing the Office of Homeland Security with additional budget authorities and oversight requirements. The Gilmore Commission recommended reestablishing the Office of Homeland Security with additional budget authorities and oversight requirements. Two legislative tracks were considered for improving interagency coordination to protect against terrorist attacks: one focused on leaving the existing federal government structure intact, while the other favored consolidating government counterterrorism functions under a single federal agency named the National Homeland Security Agency. Key supporters in Congress believed that consolidation would ensure clearer lines of executive authority and better interagency coordination. The Hart-Rudman Commission advocated for consolidation of counterterrorism functions to improve interagency coordination. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 reflected this approach by transferring infrastructure security functions to DHS. GAO designated the creation of DHS as high risk due to the management challenges of incorporating nearly three dozen federal agencies. DHS ultimately organized into four major directorates to address various homeland security concerns. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 prioritized homeland security missions, especially counterterrorism, over traditional agency missions. The Office of Management and Budget distinguished between counterterrorism and Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) efforts, focusing on combating terrorism in federal programs. The 2003 OMB report to Congress highlighted the increased focus on counterterrorism efforts post-9/11, with a significant budget increase for FY2004 to $12.1 billion, representing a 450% increase over pre-9/11 levels. This included infrastructure programs previously not seen as directly impacting counterterrorism, reflecting the newfound centrality of counterterrorism priorities across federal departments and agencies. The White House requested $12.1 billion for FY2004, a 450% increase over pre-9/11 levels, to fund various federal entities including the newly-created DHS. CIP was redefined as a counterterrorism mission, with the creation of DHS to institutionalize homeland security priorities. Despite the consolidation of functions, CIP remains a distributed enterprise competing for limited resources. Despite significant changes post-9/11, critical infrastructure protection (CIP) remains a highly distributed enterprise competing for limited resources across the federal government. While counterterrorism was a focal point for CIP, public perception of the terrorist threat softened after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The percentage of Americans naming terrorism as the most important problem dropped from 46% to 6%-8%, with periodic upticks due to high-profile incidents. Surveys in early 2019 did not list terrorism as a public concern. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, public perception of the terrorist threat softened, leading to a decrease in Americans naming terrorism as the most important problem. The failure of the levy system in New Orleans highlighted the vulnerability of critical systems to various hazards. The Critical Infrastructure Task Force argued in 2006 that government policies focused too much on protecting assets from terrorist attacks, rather than improving resilience against different threats. This defensive posture was deemed \"brittle\" as not all targets could be protected, leaving the nation vulnerable to consequences. The Task Force criticized the defensive posture of protecting assets against threats as \"brittle.\" Government policies were argued to focus too much on protection rather than resilience. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review highlighted the diversity of missions and stakeholders in addressing various challenges post-9/11. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review emphasized the diverse challenges faced post-9/11, including natural disasters, cyberattacks, transnational crime, and contagious diseases. It highlighted the decentralized nature of homeland security, with DHS playing a leadership role in managing risks to critical infrastructure. PPD-21 replaced HSPD-7 in 2013, focusing more on all-hazards critical infrastructure resilience rather than just protection against terrorist threats. The 2013 NIPP, influenced by PPD-21, shifted focus from solely protecting physical infrastructure against terrorism to emphasizing all-hazards resilience. The 2014 QHSR expanded critical infrastructure security to include issues like aging systems and neglect, framing them as homeland security concerns. However, DHS failed to submit a QHSR to Congress in 2017, leaving a gap in departmental strategic direction for infrastructure security and other homeland security goals. The Homeland Security Act does not currently provide a departmental-level statement specifying DHS strategic direction and priorities for infrastructure security. The boundaries of responsibility for critical infrastructure security are still being negotiated among various stakeholders, including Congress, executive branch departments, and private-sector entities. There have been transfers of facilities and functions between USDA and DHS, with concerns about potential terrorist threats to the nation's food and agriculture sector. Critical infrastructure security in the federal government has evolved over time, with a shift towards all-hazards resilience and addressing issues like aging systems. The federal government's critical infrastructure security has evolved into a distributed enterprise model emphasizing an all-hazards approach. Congress may need to determine the homeland security enterprise's role in infrastructure security versus other government responsibilities. The definition of homeland security is expanding beyond counterterrorism roots, and DHS has not submitted a top-level strategy to Congress since 2014. The evolving definition of homeland security goes beyond counterterrorism roots. DHS has not submitted a top-level strategy to Congress since 2014. Congressional interest in homeland security strategy is shown by the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019. The Department of Homeland Security has evolved from a centralized directorate structure to a more federated one, emphasizing operational components. The National Protection and Programs Directorate became an agency within DHS in 2018. Congress may consider the nature of organizational relationships within DHS to support critical infrastructure security. Privately owned critical infrastructure systems pose a risk to the public. The management of critical infrastructure (CI) risk presents enduring policy challenges due to the complex ownership and regulatory environment. Legislators and policymakers generally support a federated partnership model for CI security, emphasizing voluntary collaboration between the public and private sectors. This model places responsibility for assessing and mitigating risk on CI owner-operators at the enterprise level, while executive branch agencies are directed to manage risk at the national level. Infrastructure risk management involves a collaborative effort between the public and private sectors, focusing on incentives, information sharing, and voluntary investments in security. The management of critical infrastructure risk involves a collaborative effort between the public and private sectors, focusing on incentives, information sharing, and voluntary investments in security. While there is a shared interest in CI resilience, determining responsibility for upfront costs and regulatory oversight measures can be challenging at the policy level. The federal government relies on the private sector to develop risk management strategies and mitigation investments voluntarily. The federal government encourages voluntary investments in infrastructure resilience through public-private partnerships, with incentives including access to risk information, national-level risk analyses, and the opportunity to influence CI policy. Government efforts in this area have varied in effectiveness, especially for risks like major terrorist attacks or earthquakes. The federal government promotes voluntary investments in infrastructure resilience through public-private partnerships, offering access to risk information, national-level risk analyses, and opportunities to influence critical infrastructure policy. Legislation such as the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 facilitates information sharing while public-private coordination councils provide a platform for policy discussions. However, a 2019 OECD report highlighted the need for regulatory mandates in addition to voluntary partnerships to ensure sufficient investments in resilience. Regulatory mandates are favored for critical infrastructure sectors where incidents can have catastrophic impacts, such as nuclear meltdowns or terrorist attacks. Public-private partnerships are more common as risks become privatized. Policymakers aim to limit government regulation in critical infrastructure security, as seen in PDD-63 and the creation of DHS with broad responsibilities but narrow regulatory reach. The Homeland Security Act established DHS with broad responsibilities but limited regulatory mandates. Various agencies, including TSA, Coast Guard, and CISA, oversee specific aspects of infrastructure security. Other agencies like the NRC regulate civilian nuclear facilities to ensure safety and compliance. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates civilian nuclear facilities to enforce safety requirements, separate from DHS's focus on enhancing collaboration with infrastructure security partners through information sharing and training. The current security programs focus on enhancing collaboration with infrastructure security partners through information sharing, training, and coordination. The partnership structures are organized under the authority of PPD-21 and implemented through sector and cross-sector partnerships outlined in the 2013 NIPP. Each of the 16 CI sectors has its own Government Coordinating Council (GCC) and Sector Coordinating Council (SCC) to enable coordination on infrastructure issues. The Government Coordinating Council (GCC) and Sector Coordinating Council (SCC) facilitate interagency coordination on infrastructure issues. Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs), led by designated federal agencies like DHS, develop sector-specific infrastructure protection plans. These plans consider sector risks, interdependencies, and stakeholders to establish resilience goals. The Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) are composed of private-sector trade associations and CI owner-operators, recognized by the Government Coordinating Council (GCC) as representative of the sector. They have advisory, coordination, and information-sharing roles with the federal government and support Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) for sector-specific information sharing. The Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) work with ISACs to support private-sector participation in cybersecurity and infrastructure resilience. Four cross-sector councils represent key stakeholder groups and coordinate issues among CI sectors. The Federal Senior Leadership Council (FSLC) oversees cross-sector councils, forges policy consensus on CI risk management, and collaborates with international partners. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) provides legal exemption for NIPP coordinating councils and member organizations. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) was established in 2006 and its Charter was renewed in 2018. CIPAC provides legal exemption from FACA provisions for NIPP coordinating councils and member organizations to facilitate discussions on sensitive infrastructure security topics. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee (HSAC) advises the Secretary of Homeland Security on various homeland security matters, with members appointed from state and local government, first responders, private sector, and academia. Subcommittees may be established to focus on specific issues like cybersecurity and emerging technologies. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council, established in 2001, advises the President and SSAs on critical infrastructure policy. It serves as an intermediary between coordination councils, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the President, facilitating consultation between public and private sector representatives. The partnership structure is flat and includes symposia, research collaborations, working groups, and policy deliberations. The partnership structure in critical infrastructure involves various activities like symposia, research collaborations, and emergency preparedness. It includes governmental and non-governmental stakeholders from multiple sectors to promote system resilience. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) under DHS facilitates information sharing, training, and decision support for private sector partners. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) collects, analyzes, and shares threat information in real-time within the critical infrastructure partnership network. It provides decision support and training to private sector partners and is part of the DHS National Operations Center. The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) monitors cybersecurity incidents and performs related analytic functions. CISA administers both centers to promote industry investment in system-level resilience through information sharing and trust-building. Private sector participation in collaboration and information-sharing initiatives with federal departments is crucial for effective investments in programs to reduce public risk. Legislative remedies may be needed for broader risk reduction investments. Empirical analyses on collaboration effectiveness within the critical infrastructure enterprise are limited. A 2013 study found that less than half of CI sectors actively engaged in CIP issues through NIPP partnership structures, with stronger engagement in sectors with specific threats. Private sector engagement in critical infrastructure protection (CIP) issues through NIPP partnership structures is crucial, with stronger involvement in sectors facing specific threats. A 2011 study highlighted that private-sector risk mitigation investment is driven by cost-benefit analysis. Challenges in DHS partnership efforts include barriers to information sharing, sharing assessment results with stakeholders, and evaluating partnership performance. DHS lacks systematic data collection on industry participation in security surveys and the impact of security improvements. DHS's partnership efforts lack systematic data collection on industry participation in security surveys and the impact of security improvements. GAO emphasized the need for measures to assess program effectiveness and recommended data gathering and analysis initiatives for Congress to evaluate the effectiveness of the partnership system in incentivizing industry information sharing and risk reduction investments. CISA and its predecessors lack reliable data on the effectiveness of public-partnership programs in incentivizing information sharing and investments in national resilience. Congress may need to introduce reporting requirements and enhance regulatory authorities to meet resilience goals. An example is the FIRRMA, expanding CFIUS jurisdiction to prevent foreign adversaries from exploiting vulnerabilities. The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) expands CFIUS jurisdiction to prevent foreign adversaries from gaining control of critical infrastructure assets. Congress may need to adjust partnership structures to align with the federal risk management approach emphasizing resilience."
