Factors such as reduced teen sexual activity and increased use of contraceptives have contributed to this decline. Congress remains interested in the issue due to its social and economic costs, as well as disparities in teen birth rates among different groups. Disparities persist in teen birth rates among racial and ethnic subgroups and across states. The teen birth rate refers to the number of live births per 1,000 teen girls aged 15 through 19, while the teen pregnancy rate includes pregnancies per 1,000 teen girls aged 15 through 19. Birth data account for nearly every birth in the United States, while pregnancy data are based on estimates. The CDC and Guttmacher Institute publish teen pregnancy rates a year or two after birth data. The CDC and Guttmacher Institute publish annual teen pregnancy rates, typically a year or two after birth data is reported. In 2018, there were approximately 3.8 million births in the U.S., with 4.7% to teenagers aged 15-19. The teen birth rate declined by 72% from 1991 to 2018, with a historic low of 17.4 in 2018. The rate has been decreasing since the 1990s, with a significant 58% decline from 2007 to 2018. In 2018, the teen birth rate reached a historic low of 17.4, with a 58% decline from 2007. The birth rates for 15- to 17-year-olds and 18- to 19-year-olds were the lowest on record at 7.2 and 32.3 per 1,000 respectively. Repeat teen births have also decreased, with the largest declines seen among black teens. In 2018, the teen birth rate for unmarried teens aged 15 to 19 was 16.0 per 1,000, compared to 31.0 per 1,000 in 2010. The prevalence of repeat teen births was highest among Hispanic youth, followed by non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white youth. Despite an overall decline in the teen birth rate, rates for certain racial and ethnic groups remain relatively high. Teen birth rates in 2018 varied based on race and ethnicity, with Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens having more than double the rate of non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander teens. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by race and Hispanic origin. Rates declined for all groups from 1991 to 2018, with larger decreases for certain groups. In 2018, birth rates were highest for Hispanic and non-Hispanic black teens. State variations showed Massachusetts with the lowest rate (7.2) and Arkansas with the highest rate (30.4). In 2018, teen birth rates varied by state, with Massachusetts having the lowest rate (7.2) and Arkansas the highest rate (30.4). Rates ranged from less than 15 in 18 states to 25 or higher in 10 states. The territories had rates from 19.3 in Puerto Rico to 34.4 in Guam. Teen birth rates decreased in each state or territory by 19% to 67% from 2007 to 2018. The teen birth rate decreased in each state or territory by 19% to 67%. Rates have declined in rural areas but remain higher than urban areas. The U.S. teen birth rate is higher than most industrialized countries, such as the United Kingdom. Reasons for the high U.S. teen birth rate compared to other countries include economic conditions and contraceptive use. Research suggests multiple factors have driven down teen pregnancy rates, primarily improved contraceptive use. Research indicates that improved contraceptive use, including the use of condoms and long-acting reversible contraceptives, has driven down U.S. teen pregnancy rates from the 1990s to 2014. Factors such as increased use of multiple contraception methods and decreased sexual activity among younger teens have contributed to the decline. Economic and social variables also play a role in influencing teen behaviors towards abstinence or contraceptive use. Broad economic and social variables influence teen behaviors regarding sex and contraception. Factors like expanded opportunities for women, improvements in contraceptive technology, and the impact of the recession have contributed to the decline in teen birth rates. Social media and internet usage also play a role in teens' knowledge about sex and birth control, with shows like 16 and Pregnant potentially influencing behavior. The decline in teen birth rates is influenced by factors like social media, internet usage, and teen pregnancy prevention programs. Shows like 16 and Pregnant have been linked to changes in teen behavior, such as increased contraceptive use. Teen parents often face educational and financial challenges, with high costs for both families and society. Teen parents often face educational and financial challenges, with high costs for both families and society. Nearly one-third of teen girls who have dropped out of high school cite pregnancy or parenthood as a reason, and about 7 out of 10 teen mothers who have moved out of their family's household live below the poverty level. Additionally, more than 60% of teen mothers receive public benefits within the first year after their children are born. Lower levels of education reduce teen parents' potential for economic self-sufficiency, while being impoverished and having less education can increase the likelihood of teens becoming pregnant. Teen mothers often come from more disadvantaged backgrounds than their counterparts who have children at a later age, leading to poorer outcomes. Teen sexual activity, even without pregnancy, can lead to STIs with long-term health issues. Adolescents aged 15 to 19 have high STI rates. Teen childbearing affects offspring negatively, leading to chronic medical conditions, lower school readiness, poor academic performance, early pregnancies, and incarceration. Societal impacts include cost savings from avoiding unintended teen pregnancies. The Power to Decide conducted a simulation analysis to estimate the cost savings to public programs from avoiding unintended teen pregnancies. They found that a total of $4.4 billion was saved from 1991 to 2015 due to decreased teen fertility rates. This includes savings from Medicaid for labor and delivery, postpartum care, infant care, and benefits like TANF, SNAP, and WIC. Further research on the impacts of decreased teen pregnancy could benefit teen parents, their children, and society as a whole."
