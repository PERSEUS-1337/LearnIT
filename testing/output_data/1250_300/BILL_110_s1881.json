    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 intended to establish a clear prohibition of discrimination based on disability, but Supreme Court decisions have narrowed its protection. Congress recognized that individuals with disabilities have the right to fully participate in society, but prejudice often prevents them from doing so. Congress recognized that individuals with disabilities face barriers to full participation in society due to prejudice and antiquated attitudes. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 modeled its definition of disability on the broad conception of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which includes both actual and perceived limitations imposed by society. The Supreme Court's decision in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline highlighted the societal impact of myths and fears about disability. Congress, in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, recognized that adverse actions based on physical or mental impairments are often unrelated to the limitations caused by the impairment itself. However, the Supreme Court's ruling in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams interpreted the definition of disability strictly, creating a demanding standard for qualification. The Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams narrowed the definition of disability, eliminating coverage for individuals who have mitigated their impairments. The purpose of this Act is to restore the broad scope of protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The Act aims to restore broad protection against discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, responding to Supreme Court decisions that have narrowed the class of individuals protected. It clarifies that protection is available for all individuals facing adverse treatment based on an actual or perceived impairment. The Protection and Clarification Act of 2020 expands the scope of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 by ensuring protection for individuals facing adverse treatment due to actual or perceived impairments, prejudiced attitudes, societal barriers, and the failure to provide reasonable accommodations. The Protection and Clarification Act of 2020 expands the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to protect individuals from adverse treatment due to impairments, prejudiced attitudes, societal barriers, and lack of reasonable accommodations. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to emphasize that physical and mental disabilities are natural parts of human experience and should not hinder a person's right to fully participate in society. It also acknowledges the discrimination faced by individuals with disabilities and their history of unequal treatment and powerlessness in society.

Classifications and selection criteria excluding them should be strongly disfavored and only permitted for compelling reasons, not based on prejudice or stereotypes. SEC. 4. DISABILITY DEFINED.
