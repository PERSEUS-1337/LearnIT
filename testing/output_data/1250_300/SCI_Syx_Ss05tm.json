    "content": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in computer vision, where perturbations to images can cause the model to make mistakes. A new attack method reprograms the target model to perform a task chosen by the attacker without specifying the desired output for each input. This single perturbation can be added to all inputs to manipulate the model's behavior, even if it was not trained for that task. Adversarial reprogramming was demonstrated on ImageNet models for a counting task and classification tasks using MNIST and CIFAR-10 examples. Various methods have been proposed to construct and defend against adversarial attacks in classification models. These attacks aim to cause model prediction errors with small changes to the input, such as causing a self-driving car to react to a phantom stop sign or manipulating an insurance company's damage model. The majority of adversarial attacks are untargeted, degrading model performance without a specific output, or targeted, producing a specific output for a given input. In this work, a novel adversarial goal is considered: reprogramming a model to perform a task chosen by the attacker without needing to compute a specific desired output. This involves inducing the model to compute a different function for certain inputs, showcasing the potential for adversarial reprogramming. In this work, an adversary can reprogram a model to perform a different task by learning reprogramming functions that map between the tasks. The parameters of the adversarial program are adjusted to achieve the desired outcome. The inputs and outputs are converted between different domains to accomplish the adversarial task. Adversarial reprogramming involves repurposing a model to perform a new task by adjusting parameters to achieve the desired outcome. This attack does not need to be imperceptible and can have consequences such as theft of computational resources and abuse of machine learning services. The flexibility of neural networks allows for the possibility of repurposing the network to a new task with just an additive offset to its input. The flexibility of neural networks allows for repurposing the network to a new task with just an additive offset to its input, which can lead to risks discussed in Section 5.2. This flexibility is consistent with results on the expressive power of deep neural networks, showing that changes to a network's inputs can result in exponential increases in unique output patterns. Adversarial reprogramming involves adjusting parameters in a low dimensional subspace, presenting new instances of adversarial attacks. In this paper, the authors introduce adversarial reprogramming, which involves crafting adversarial programs to make a neural network perform a new task. They experimentally demonstrate adversarial programs that alter the function of convolutional neural networks from ImageNet classification to tasks like counting squares in an image and classifying different datasets. The study also explores the susceptibility of trained and untrained networks to adversarial reprogramming, showing that transfer learning does not fully explain the phenomenon. Additionally, the authors show the possibility of concealing adversarial programs and data. Adversarial reprogramming involves crafting adversarial programs to make a neural network perform a new task, demonstrating that transfer learning does not fully explain this phenomenon. Adversarial examples are intentionally designed inputs to cause model mistakes, with attacks being untargeted or targeted. Adversarial attacks have been proposed in various domains like malware detection and generative models. The network predicts ImageNet labels that map to adversarial task labels when presented with adversarial images. Adversarial reprogramming involves developing methods to produce specific functionality in neural networks, different from a specific hardcoded output. This extends previous work on adversarial attacks in domains like malware detection and generative models. Adversarial examples can be applied to many inputs to form adversarial programs, such as an \"adversarial patch\" that can switch model predictions to a specific class. Parasitic computing forces a system to solve complex tasks it wasn't designed for. Adversarial reprogramming manipulates neural networks to perform specific tasks beyond their original design, similar to parasitic computing and weird machines. Transfer learning and adversarial reprogramming aim to repurpose networks for new tasks by leveraging existing knowledge. Transfer learning and adversarial reprogramming repurpose neural networks for new tasks by leveraging existing knowledge. Transfer learning uses knowledge from one task as a base to learn another, while adversarial reprogramming changes model parameters for the new task. Adversarial reprogramming differs from transfer learning as it allows model parameter changes, while in adversarial settings, an attacker manipulates the input to achieve their goals. Adversarial reprogramming involves changing model parameters to perform a new task by crafting an adversarial program for the network input. The adversary aims to reprogram the model originally designed for ImageNet classification. The adversarial program is an additive contribution to the network input, not specific to a single image, and can be applied to all images. The adversarial program is an additive contribution to the network input, not specific to a single image, and can be applied to all images. It involves crafting an adversarial program for the network input, with parameters to be learned and a masking matrix. The adversarial image is generated based on the input image, and a hard-coded mapping function is used to map labels. The adversarial program involves crafting a program for the network input, with parameters to be learned and a masking matrix. It aims to maximize the probability of a set of ImageNet labels assigned to adversarial labels. The optimization problem includes a weight norm penalty and is solved using Adam optimization with hyperparameters provided in Appendix A. The adversarial program has minimal computation cost for the adversary, as it only requires computing the adversarial image and mapping the resulting ImageNet label to the correct class during inference. The adversarial program has minimal computation cost for the adversary, as it only requires computing X adv (Equation 2) and mapping the resulting ImageNet label to the correct class. Adversarial reprogramming exploits the nonlinear behavior of the target model, unlike traditional adversarial examples. Experiments were conducted on six architectures trained on ImageNet, reprogramming the network for tasks like counting squares, MNIST classification, and CIFAR-10 classification. The study explored adversarial training on various tasks like counting squares, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 classification. The models' weights were from TensorFlow-Slim, and resistance to adversarial reprogramming was examined. Reprogramming networks and concealing adversarial data were also investigated. Images with white squares were used for the counting task, embedded in an adversarial program to create X adv images. The study involved embedding images of squares on gridpoints in an adversarial program to create X adv images. Adversarial programs were trained per ImageNet model to count the number of squares in each image. Despite the unrelated ImageNet labels, the adversarial program successfully mastered the counting task for all networks, highlighting neural networks' vulnerability to reprogramming. The study demonstrated the vulnerability of neural networks to reprogramming by successfully reprogramming ImageNet networks to classify MNIST digits using an additive adversarial program. The reprogramming generalized well from training to test set, indicating it does not rely solely on memorization of training examples. The study successfully reprogrammed ImageNet models to classify CIFAR-10 images using adversarial programs, increasing accuracy from chance to moderate levels. The adversarial programs showed visual similarities to those used for MNIST classification, with minimal computation cost at inference time. The study reprogrammed an Inception V3 model trained on ImageNet data using adversarial training to classify MNIST digits. Results show that the model, despite being trained with adversarial examples, is still vulnerable to reprogramming with only a slight reduction in attack success. This suggests that standard approaches to adversarial defense have limited efficacy against adversarial reprogramming. Adversarial defense methods are ineffective against adversarial reprogramming due to differences in goals and magnitudes of attacks. Reprogramming attacks on models with random weights showed significant challenges in training and lower accuracy compared to trained models. This highlights the dependence of defense methods on the specifics of the model. Training random networks for adversarial reprogramming proved challenging, with lower accuracy compared to trained models. The appearance of adversarial programs differed from those obtained with pretrained networks, emphasizing the importance of the original task performed by neural networks. Randomly initialized networks may perform poorly due to factors like poor weight scaling, while trained weights are better conditioned. This suggests that the network may rely on similarities between original and adversarial data for adversarial reprogramming. The study explored adversarial reprogramming by randomizing pixels on MNIST digits to remove any resemblance to ImageNet images. Despite the lack of spatial structure, pretrained ImageNet networks were successfully reprogrammed to classify the shuffled MNIST digits. Similar results were obtained with shuffled CIFAR-10 images, although the accuracy decreased due to the convolutional structure not being useful for classification. The study demonstrated successful adversarial reprogramming of pretrained ImageNet networks to classify shuffled MNIST digits. Results also showed the possibility of reprogramming across tasks with unrelated datasets and domains, with limitations on program size and scale reducing visibility of perturbations. Adversarial reprogramming was still successful when limiting program size, but with lower accuracy. In a study, an Inception V3 model pretrained on ImageNet was adversarially reprogrammed to classify MNIST digits with limited program size. Results showed successful reprogramming with lower accuracy using small adversarial programs. Adversarial reprogramming remained successful even with nearly imperceptible programs. Additionally, the possibility of concealing adversarial tasks within normal images from ImageNet was tested by shuffling pixels and limiting program and data scale. The study successfully reprogrammed an Inception V3 model to classify MNIST digits using small adversarial programs. By concealing the adversarial task within normal images from ImageNet through pixel shuffling and limiting program and data scale, the network was effectively reprogrammed with lower accuracy. The study demonstrated successful adversarial reprogramming of a neural network by hiding the task within ImageNet images. Trained neural networks were more vulnerable to reprogramming than random networks, showing flexibility in repurposing trained weights for new tasks. This suggests the potential for more efficient and flexible machine learning systems with shared compute resources. The study showed successful adversarial reprogramming of neural networks, indicating potential for more efficient machine learning systems with shared resources. Future research could explore reprogramming across different domains like audio, video, and text. Reprogramming RNNs, especially those with attention or memory, could be particularly interesting. Reprogramming RNNs with attention or memory could lead to potential security risks, allowing attackers to manipulate the system to perform unauthorized tasks, such as computational theft or violating ethical codes. This could be achieved by finding inputs that induce the RNN to execute simple operations, enabling the reprogramming of the system for malicious purposes. The potential security risks of reprogramming RNNs with attention or memory include computational theft and violating ethical codes. Adversarial attacks aim to repurpose neural networks for novel tasks, highlighting their flexibility and vulnerability. Future research should focus on understanding and defending against adversarial reprogramming. Neural networks can be reprogrammed adversarially, even when the data is unrelated. Shuffled MNIST digits are combined with an adversarial program to create a reprogramming image that successfully alters the Inception V3 model's classification. This demonstrates the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks."
