Amendment to Title II of the National Housing Act to include a new section on 2-step single family mortgages. The Secretary has the authority to insure mortgages for properties with dwellings for 1 to 4 families, with fixed interest rates for at least the first 5 years and adjustments thereafter. The rate adjustment can be done through changes in monthly payments or outstanding balance. The effective rate of interest for insured mortgages can be adjusted through changes in monthly payments, outstanding balance, or mortgage term, but the total term cannot exceed 40 years. The rate adjustment is based on a specified national interest rate index approved by the Secretary. Adjustments in the interest rate for mortgages with periodic adjustments can also be made through changes in monthly payments, outstanding balance, or mortgage term. Adjustments in the interest rate for insured mortgages can be made through changes in monthly payments, outstanding balance, or mortgage term, with a maximum increase of 1 percent on the outstanding loan balance and 5 percentage points above the initial contract interest rate over the term of the mortgage. The Secretary may only insure mortgages after assessing the risk. The Secretary may insure mortgages with adjustments in interest rates, limited to a 1% increase on the outstanding balance and 5 percentage points above the initial rate. Regulations require mortgagees to explain 2-step mortgage features to borrowers at the loan application. The total number of insured mortgages in a fiscal year cannot exceed 10% of the previous year's total. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development will conduct a study on reducing upfront and annual premiums for mortgage insurance under the single-family home mortgage insurance program. The study will also assess the impact of these methods on the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund's financial stability. A report with findings and recommendations must be submitted to Congress within 18 months of the Act's enactment."
