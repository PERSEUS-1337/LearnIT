State infrastructure banks are created at the State or multi-State level to finance transportation projects. Congress grants consent to States to establish State infrastructure banks and enter into interstate compacts to promote regional investment in transportation infrastructure. State infrastructure banks can provide loans, issue debt, and offer assistance to public or private entities for eligible transportation projects. The banks can loan or provide assistance for the construction or capital costs of qualifying transportation projects. A State infrastructure bank can provide loans or assistance for qualifying transportation projects, including credit enhancements, capital reserves, bond financing costs, interest rate subsidies, and other approved leveraging tools. Participating States must maintain an investment grade rating on their debt issuances to qualify as a State infrastructure bank. To qualify as a State infrastructure bank, participating States must maintain an investment grade rating on their debt issuances or have sufficient bond insurance. Investment income generated by the bank must be credited to the bank and used for transportation projects. Repayment of loans must be ensured. The Secretary may provide interest to enhance leveraging of transportation projects, ensure repayment of loans to the State, set appropriate interest rates, start repayment within 5 years of project completion, limit loan amounts, and require annual reports from the bank. The Secretary administers the Act by ensuring consistent disbursements for capital reserves and establishing procedures for State infrastructure banks. States can transfer up to 15% of Federal funds to the bank, with corresponding obligational amounts. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 allows states to transfer up to 15% of Federal funds to a State infrastructure bank, with corresponding obligational amounts. The deposit of Federal apportionments into the bank does not create any commitment or obligation on the part of the United States. State infrastructure bank funds do not constitute a commitment from the United States. Federal funds used as a capital reserve are exempt from certain management regulations. States can contribute up to 2% of Federal funds for bank administration costs."
