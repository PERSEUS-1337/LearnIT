The United States addresses these concerns through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The United States addresses national security concerns related to foreign acquisitions through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

Close associations between firms and governments may blur the distinction between economic activities.

Foreign-owned manufacturing firms in the U.S. outperform U.S. firms with higher value added, shipments, plant size, wages, productivity, and output per worker. Foreign-owned firms also have higher capital intensity in more industries.

Interest rates staying low and price inflation in check may lead to an increase in foreign direct investment in the United States. Public concerns over globalization's impact on jobs and the economy play a significant role in evaluating foreign direct investment. Job losses from mergers and acquisitions, whether by foreign or U.S.-owned companies, are a key concern, but potential benefits such as capital inflow and job creation are also considered. Opposition to certain types of foreign direct investment is driven by worries about job security and the overall impact on the economy. Foreign direct investment in the United States is influenced by perceived benefits like capital inflow and job creation. Concerns about national security and economic impact exist, but the U.S. remains a top destination for foreign investment.
