    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2015\". The findings and sense of Congress are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that in 2014, the Department of Labor identified 136 goods from 74 countries made by forced labor and child labor. The United States, as the largest importer, faces increasing demands for information on human rights impacts of products. Courts have limited consumer actions under the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, resulting in few enforcement actions in the past 80 years to prevent forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking. The Federal law mechanisms to prevent and punish forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in supply chains imported by the United States have limited scope and lack available information. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 allow for the termination of Federal contracts with contractors engaging in trafficking or forced labor. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 allows US courts to prosecute Federal employees, contractors, or subcontractors involved in trafficking or forced labor. Executive Orders and laws prohibit Federal contractors from activities like charging recruitment fees and confiscating workers' documents. The Executive Order and Acts prohibit labor trafficking activities such as charging recruitment fees, confiscating passports, and using fraudulent practices. Federal contractors must have an anti-trafficking compliance plan to prevent subcontractors from engaging in trafficking. Congress recognizes forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking as severe forms of abuse for profit. Legislation is needed to prevent goods produced by forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor from entering the US market. Consumers should have access to information on products free from these abuses. Public disclosures can help businesses and consumers avoid supporting tainted supply chains. SEC. 3. Disclosure of information on efforts to combat forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to require covered issuers to disclose efforts to combat forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chains. Regulations will be promulgated to ensure annual reporting on measures taken to address these issues. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 now mandates covered issuers to disclose actions taken to address forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chains. This includes policies to identify and eliminate risks, prohibiting employees from engaging in commercial sex acts with minors, and reporting on measures implemented. The covered issuer must disclose policies prohibiting employees from engaging in commercial sex acts with minors and efforts to address risks of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in the supply chain. Disclosure should include identifying risks, measures taken to eliminate them, whether evaluation was done by a third party, and consultation with independent labor organizations. The disclosure requirements for covered issuers include consulting with independent labor organizations, workers' associations, or workers in the process and specifying the extent of coverage within the supply chain. The covered issuer must ensure audits of suppliers in the supply chain are conducted to investigate working conditions, labor practices, and risks of forced labor. They must also evaluate compliance with the issuer's policies or efforts in the absence of such policies. The covered issuer must audit suppliers in the supply chain to assess compliance with policies on forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. They should also maintain internal accountability standards and reporting procedures for non-compliant entities in the supply chain. The covered issuer must ensure compliance with standards on forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor within its supply chain. This includes training employees and management on mitigating risks and ensuring labor recruitment practices at suppliers align with the issuer's policies. The covered issuer must ensure that labor recruitment practices at suppliers comply with policies to eliminate exploitative labor practices contributing to forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. Efforts should be made to provide remedial action to victims identified within the supply chain, including support for prevention programs in the industry. The regulations require covered issuers to disclose information on their website labeled 'Global Supply Chain Transparency' and the Commission to list covered issuers taking measures to address forced labor conditions. The regulations mandate covered issuers with over $100,000,000 in annual global receipts to disclose efforts to combat forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chains. The Commission's website will list these issuers and compile the information submitted. The terms 'forced labor', 'slavery', and 'human trafficking' refer to labor practices violating national and international standards. 'Remedial action' is the response to non-compliance, and 'supply chain' pertains to a covered issuer's disclosure requirements. The term 'supply chain' for a covered issuer includes labor recruiters, suppliers, and raw materials used in manufacturing, regardless of direct relationships. 'The worst forms of child labor' refer to violations of national and international standards."
