    "content": "The Act titled \"Safety, Accountability, and Funding Efficiency for Transportation Act of 2007\" emphasizes the importance of conducting cost-benefit analysis before procuring transportation services from private contractors. This analysis helps determine the cost-effectiveness and public interest in using private contractors or government employees for such services. The Act defines key terms such as architectural, engineering, and related services, private contract, government agency, Secretary, and surface transportation project. The Act defines key terms related to surface transportation projects, including the Secretary of Transportation's role and the eligibility criteria for such projects under title 23, United States Code. SEC. 4. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. For fiscal year 2009 and onwards, Federal funds can be used for surface transportation projects to enter into private contracts over $100,000 for architectural, engineering, and related services, with a required cost-benefit analysis. The analysis must include a description of services, cost estimates for the private contract, and cost estimates for government agency performance. The cost analysis for private contracts over $100,000 for architectural, engineering, and related services includes estimating government agency costs, comparing procurement speed, determining equipment provision, and estimating employee benefits. The cost analysis for private contracts over $100,000 includes estimating equipment and materials, unemployment compensation for displaced employees, and the cost of resuming service by the government agency. SEC. 5. DISCLOSURE OF RESULTS OF COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS.\n\nGovernment agencies must disclose the results of cost-benefit analyses for private contracts deemed in the public interest.

USE OF QUALIFICATION-BASED SELECTION CRITERIA.\n\nWhen procuring architectural, engineering, and related services for surface transportation projects using Federal funds, government agencies must follow specific procedures outlined in title 40 of the United States Code or equivalent State qualifications-based requirements.\n\nSEC. 8.
