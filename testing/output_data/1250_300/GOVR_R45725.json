It protects U.S. shipyards, carriers, and sailors but is debated for increasing costs and limiting ship availability. Recent issues involving the Jones Act include Puerto Rico's economic challenges, the El Faro ship sinking, and discussions on domestic oil and gas transportation. National security goals and a congressional directive for a national maritime strategy have also brought attention to the law's effectiveness. The Jones Act of 1920 mandates that vessels transporting cargo domestically must be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. This law has been debated for its impact on costs and ship availability. Recent issues include Puerto Rico's economic challenges, the El Faro ship sinking, and discussions on domestic oil and gas transportation. The law's effectiveness in achieving national security goals has also been a subject of attention, with a congressional directive to develop a national maritime strategy. In May 2018, public comments were requested on modifying or repealing federal requirements to increase efficiency in the maritime sector. Laws favoring a U.S.-flag fleet over a foreign fleet have a long history, dating back to the First Congress in 1789. The First Congress in 1789 initiated laws favoring a U.S.-flag fleet over a foreign fleet by assessing lesser duties on domestically built vessels. Congress specified that only U.S.-built vessels owned by U.S. citizens could register as U.S. vessels. In 1817, a precursor to the Jones Act was enacted to disallow foreign-owned vessels from transporting domestic cargo between U.S. ports. The U.S. had a shipbuilding advantage in the 1800s but lost it as wooden sailing ships gave way to iron steamships. Congress debated how to respond to the decline in U.S. foreign trade carried by U.S. vessels. In response to the decline in U.S. foreign trade carried by U.S. vessels, Congress debated the \"free ship\" movement allowing foreign-built vessels to sail under the U.S. flag. Despite opposition citing higher costs of U.S. crews, a measure was enacted in 1912. The domestic build requirement has since applied mainly to vessels on domestic voyages, with Congress tightening regulations on coastwise transport in the late 1800s. In response to shippers' attempts to avoid high-cost U.S. vessels, Congress tightened regulations on coastwise transport in the late 1800s. Shippers found ways to use foreign-flag ships to transport goods, leading Congress to amend the coastwise law in 1893 and 1898 to prohibit routing cargo through foreign ports to avoid U.S. laws. Despite these amendments, U.S. shippers continued to use foreign-flag vessels in the Alaska trade. In 1893 and 1898, the coastwise law was amended to prevent shippers from using foreign ports to avoid U.S. laws. Despite this, U.S. shippers still used foreign-flag vessels in the Alaska trade. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 required Alaska-bound cargo to go through the Port of Seattle, making it law to ship between \"U.S. points.\" The debate over the cost of building ships in the U.S. versus foreign countries was a key factor in the passage of the Jones Act in 1920. The minority report to a 1919 House committee report on the Jones Act expressed the view that banning foreign-built ships would result in more costly domestically built ships, emphasizing the need for American merchants to acquire ships at the lowest possible price to compete globally. The cost of U.S.-built ships has consistently been higher than foreign-built ships, with the price differential increasing over the years. This cost disparity poses challenges for American shipbuilders and Department of Defense officials, impacting the affordability of domestically built ships. The cost differential between U.S.-built and foreign-built ships poses challenges for American shipbuilders and Department of Defense officials. U.S. crewing costs, insurance, and maintenance contribute to an estimated operating cost differential of over $6 million per ship per year compared to foreign-flag ships. This cost gap has been increasing, as highlighted in a 2011 study by the U.S. Maritime Administration. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 emphasized the sale of surplus government cargo ships from World War I and outlined maritime policy goals for the United States, including the need for a well-equipped merchant marine owned and operated by U.S. citizens. This reflected the country's emerging power status at the time. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 emphasized the need for a U.S. merchant marine to avoid dependency on other nations' ships. The Jones Act applies to domestic waterborne shipments, requiring U.S. citizen crewing and ownership for Jones Act ships. U.S. territories like the U.S. Virgin Islands are exempt from the Act. The Jones Act requires 75% of crew and stock of U.S. owned ships to be U.S. citizens. U.S. territories like U.S. Virgin Islands are exempt. Foreign-flag ships can transport cargo between exempt territories and other U.S. points. Coast Guard enforces U.S.-build, ownership, and crewing requirements. CBP determines maritime activity under the act. The Jones Act, also known as \"coastwise qualified,\" is enforced by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to regulate maritime transportation. It requires the use of U.S.-built vessels, defined by the Coast Guard as having major components fabricated and assembled in the United States. This regulation does not apply to other freight transportation modes. The \"superstructure\" of oceangoing ships, including the main deck and structural parts above it, is crucial for determining U.S.-build status. The Coast Guard allows foreign-made engines to be imported as they are considered separate components attached to the hull. Major components of the hull or superstructure can have up to 1.5% of their steel weight manufactured abroad, as long as they are attached in a U.S. shipyard. The Coast Guard's test for \"major components\" of the hull or superstructure is based on weight; up to 1.5% of the steel weight of hull and superstructure components can be manufactured abroad. The propeller, stern bulb, bulbous bow, some rudders, and watertight closures used in U.S.-built vessels are often imported, as long as they do not exceed the steel weight limit. Shipyards seek confirmation from the Coast Guard on incorporating foreign-built components, detailed in \"determination letters\" by the Coast Guard. In 2018, Congress directed the Coast Guard to publish \"determination letters\" detailing permissible foreign components in ship construction. Shipyard unions, known as \"kit ships,\" sued the Coast Guard in 2007 over their interpretation of the statute. The U.S. District Court sided with the Coast Guard, citing historical interpretations dating back to the late 1800s. This lawsuit stemmed from a partnership between a Philadelphia shipyard and a South Korean shipbuilder to build Jones Act tankers and container ships. Since 2004, a South Korean shipbuilder has partnered with American shipyards to build Jones Act tankers and container ships. General Dynamics NASSCO of San Diego also collaborated with Daewoo Shipbuilding of South Korea for vessel designs and materials. The use of foreign components in shipbuilding has raised concerns about undermining the Jones Act policy. Additionally, cruise ships serving U.S. ports are not required to be Jones Act-compliant if they have visited a distant foreign port. The largest cruise ship market in the US mostly uses foreign-flag cruise ships, exempt from Jones Act compliance if they visit distant foreign ports. This exemption was established in a 1910 Attorney General's opinion and a 1985 rule by the US Customs Service. Foreign cruise ships can make round trips from US ports, including visits to other US ports, as long as they also visit nearby foreign ports like Canada, Mexico, or Bermuda. Passenger vessels can make round trips from a U.S. port, visiting other U.S. ports along with nearby foreign ports like Canada, Mexico, or Bermuda. If the voyage's main purpose is not domestic transportation, the Jones Act is not violated. \"Voyages to nowhere\" involve visits to no other ports, staying within 3 miles of U.S. territorial waters to be Jones Act-compliant. If vessels journey beyond 3 miles into international waters, compliance is not required. CBP interprets the Jones Act to require vessels to be compliant within U.S. waters, but not beyond 3 miles from shore. However, charter fishing boats must still comply even in international waters. CBP defines a passenger as anyone aboard who is not crew or owner, including non-paying guests. The Jones Act applies to all individuals aboard a vessel who are not crew or owners, including guests. This includes scenarios such as entertaining clients on a yacht or transporting workers to a construction site. CBP's interpretations also impact operations like lightering and offshore supply vessels in U.S. territorial waters. In U.S. territorial waters, vessels must be Jones Act-compliant for lightering operations and servicing offshore oil rigs. Only oil rigs attached to the seabed are considered \"U.S. points,\" allowing foreign-flagged vessels to service them. However, Congress mandated that OSVs servicing certain types of oil rigs must be U.S.-owned and -crewed. In 2008, Congress required that OSVs servicing MODUs be U.S.-owned and -crewed, but need not be U.S.-built. The Jones Act compliance for OSVs depends on whether they are transporting supplies or workers to the oil rig or involved in installing equipment necessary for the rig's operation. Vessels laying cable or pipeline in U.S. waters do not need to be Jones Act-compliant, while OSVs transporting supplies and rig workers must be. Foreign-flagged vessels can be used for installing rig equipment, conducting geophysical surveying, diving inspections, and providing living quarters for construction workers. The Jones Act compliance for vessels involved in offshore activities can be unclear, with some questioning its application to wind farms beyond 3 miles from shore. The nonavailability of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs) is a hindrance to offshore wind farm development in the U.S., as developers either transport equipment from foreign countries or use Jones Act-compliant vessels. The Jones Act compliance for vessels in offshore activities is unclear, especially for wind farms beyond 3 miles from shore. In Europe, Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs) not only install towers but also transport equipment from shore to offshore sites. U.S. wind developers face challenges as there are no Jones Act-compliant TIVs, leading to the use of foreign vessels or a combination of Jones Act-compliant and non-compliant vessels for equipment transportation and installation. Additionally, a CBP interpretation allows for non-Jones Act-compliant vessels to transport merchandise that has been transformed at an intermediate foreign port. The Jones Act has provisions that tighten requirements and exempt certain maritime activities. In 1935, vessels sold to foreign owners cannot requalify as Jones Act-eligible, providing protection from competition. Foreign-flag tankers are allowed to ship gasoline from Texas to New York after blending with imported petroleum products at an intermediate foreign port. This interpretation is based on a 1964 Customs Service ruling involving California rice processed in the U.S. Virgin Islands before being shipped to Puerto Rico on foreign-flag ships. In 1935, the Jones Act forbade vessels sold to foreign owners from requalifying as Jones Act-eligible, providing protection from competition. Congress expanded the Act in 1940 to cover towing vessels and salvage vessels. In 1988, Congress specified that transporting valueless material requires a Jones Act-qualified vessel. Congress has enacted exemptions to the Jones Act when no qualified operator is available, such as in 1984 for passenger travel. Congress has enacted exemptions to the Jones Act when no qualified operator is available, such as in 1984 for passenger travel between Puerto Rico and other U.S. ports. Waivers have also been granted for foreign-flag cruise ships and LNG tankers due to a lack of Jones Act-qualified vessels. Additionally, exemptions have been made in response to sudden spikes in demand for Jones Act-qualified vessels, such as during the steelmaking surge in the 1940s and the bumper grain harvest in 1951. In response to vessel shortages, Congress enacted exemptions for iron ore on the Great Lakes during the 1940s and a bumper grain harvest in 1951. In 1996, an exemption was granted for vessels involved in oil spill cleanup operations when there are not enough Jones Act-qualified vessels available. Congress also waived the Jones Act for innovative vessel designs used in foreign trade, such as the Lighter Aboard Ship (LASH) technology and the movement of empty containers between U.S. ports for international shipments. In 1965, Congress exempted the movement of empty containers between U.S. ports from the Jones Act for international shipments, allowing foreign-flagged container carriers to reposition their equipment along U.S. coastlines. This exemption is restricted to containers used for international shipments, impacting the development of marine highways and short sea shipping routes. The Jones Act requires U.S.-built, -crewed, and -owned ships for transshipment of loaded international containers, leading to a lack of transshipment services in the United States. This increases demand for rail and road connections to ports, as smaller feeder container ships do not distribute international cargo among U.S. ports. Feeder container ships do not distribute international cargo among U.S. ports. Congress has granted exemptions to specific vessels from the Jones Act since 1989, with at least 133 waivers issued for vessels that are not commercially significant. Since 1989, Congress has granted exemptions to specific vessels from the Jones Act, with at least 133 waivers issued for vessels that are not commercially significant. These vessels, totaling 35, are typically not large cargo or passenger vessels and some are owned by nonprofit entities. Waivers are often needed due to technicalities in meeting Jones Act requirements, such as missing U.S.-citizen ownership records. Specific conditions are placed on vessel usage when waivers are granted, with historical waivers being issued during World War I, World War II, and the Korean War for national defense purposes. Waivers were also granted in 1991 and 2011 to expedite oil shipments. The executive branch has the authority to issue waivers for national defense purposes under the Jones Act. Waivers have been granted for expedited oil shipments during military conflicts and natural disasters. MARAD plays a role in checking vessel availability before granting waivers. Waivers have also been granted for lack of heavy-lift vessels in the Jones Act fleet. The lack of heavy-lift vessels in the Jones Act fleet has led to national defense waivers being issued for specific transportation needs, such as moving radar systems and oil rigs. Despite safety concerns raised by agencies like the Coast Guard, waivers for certain vessels have been denied by CBP, citing a high standard for national defense justifications. The Jones Act waiver created safety hazards for operators, with CBP stating that waivers would not be issued for economic reasons. In 1976, Members of Congress sought to extend the Jones Act to the U.S. Virgin Islands due to vulnerability of offshore supply lines. Northeast refineries considered seeking a waiver in 2014 to ship crude oil from Texas. In 2018, the U.S. exported between 40-80 million barrels of crude oil per month on foreign-flag tankers. In 2018, the United States exported between 40 million and 80 million barrels of crude oil per month on foreign-flag tankers, imported about 150 million barrels per month from overseas sources on foreign-flag tankers, and shipped about 15 million barrels per month domestically on Jones Act tankers. The United States has begun exporting substantial quantities of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by ship while continuing to import LNG by ship, but no LNG is shipped domestically. Puerto Rico is seeking a 10-year waiver of the Jones Act to receive bulk shipments of LNG from the U.S. mainland. Recent controversies over the Jones Act have concerned the oceangoing ship and offshore supply vessel sectors. The Jones Act covers various types of ships, including oceangoing vessels, tankers, dry cargo ships, and general-cargo vessels. As of March 2018, there were 99 oceangoing ships in the Jones Act-compliant fleet, with the largest category being tankers. The fleet also includes container ships, roll on/roll off vessels, and vessels designed for carrying bulk commodities. The Jones Act fleet consists of various types of ships, including oceangoing vessels, tankers, dry cargo ships, and general-cargo vessels. The fleet has shrunk significantly since 1950, with a drop in fleet size in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The U.S. merchant marine was criticized in a 1967 congressional hearing for being \"too small, too old, and too unproductive.\" The Lyndon B. Johnson Administration was the only one to call for the repeal of the Jones Act. The Jones Act fleet operates in domestic trade routes where overland modes are not an option, serving Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Despite economic advantages, domestic ships have lost market share to railroads and pipelines. The Jones Act has preserved a nucleus of the U.S. maritime industry but has not met the goal of sustaining a growing merchant marine. The Jones Act fleet operates in markets where shippers have limited alternatives, but it has not succeeded in sustaining a growing merchant marine as intended by Congress. The fleet does not meet the policy goals of providing shipping service on essential routes and having the best equipped vessels. Certain ship designs, like \"project cargo\" vessels, are not represented in the Jones Act fleet, limiting its effectiveness in certain transportation needs. The Jones Act fleet lacks \"project cargo\" vessels for moving oversized equipment to project sites. The Department of Defense uses waivers to move certain cargo on foreign-flag vessels due to the higher cost structure of Jones Act operators. The oceangoing Jones Act fleet has two inactive dry bulk ships, possibly due to their age, and an outdated chemical tanker. No LNG tankers are in the Jones Act fleet. The Jones Act fleet lacks LNG tankers despite new domestic markets from the shale gas boom. To address the high cost of U.S.-built ships, a unique vessel design called an articulated tug barge (ATB) has been developed, with over 150 operating in the Jones Act trades. ATBs are more capable than flatwater barges but less reliable and efficient over longer voyages compared to tanker ships. They sail closer to the coasts and could pose a higher risk. ATBs, or articulated tug barges, are less reliable and efficient over longer voyages compared to tanker ships. They sail closer to the coasts, posing a higher risk of grounding and providing less time to prevent spilled oil from reaching shorelines. ATB crews are not qualified to sail sealift ships. The El Faro, a Jones Act general cargo ship that sank in 2015, had open lifeboats due to being built in 1975. The Coast Guard expressed concern about the condition of the U.S.-flag fleet beyond the El Faro incident. The Coast Guard expressed concern about the condition of the U.S.-flag fleet beyond the El Faro incident, as findings indicate other vessels are in substandard condition. The Jones Act fleet has relatively young ships due to shipbuilding after the increase in shale oil production. The Jones Act oceangoing fleet has seen a decrease in the number of older ships, with just over one-third now being 21 years old or older. In contrast, the Great Lakes fleet consists of older dry bulk ships and large barges, with the largest ships built between 1972 and 1981. Ships operating in freshwater, like the Great Lakes, can have longer lives than oceangoing vessels. According to the U.S. Lake Carriers Association, ships on the Great Lakes have longer lives than oceangoing vessels. The Canadian Great Lakes fleet was impacted by import policies, with no new ships added during a 25% tariff period. Since the tariff was repealed in 2010, over 35 new dry bulk ships have been constructed for the Great Lakes. Thousands of tugs and barges transport dry and liquid bulk commodities on inland rivers. The U.S. Lake Carriers Association states that ships on the Great Lakes have longer lives than oceangoing vessels. The Canadian Great Lakes fleet was impacted by import policies, with no new ships added during a 25% tariff period. Since the tariff was repealed in 2010, over 35 new dry bulk ships have been constructed for the Great Lakes. Thousands of tugs and barges transport dry and liquid bulk commodities on inland rivers. Tonnage is dominated by the export of corn and soybeans and domestic movement of coal. Overall tonnage on the system has been flat or declining slightly since 1990. One of the two leading manufacturers of river barges ceased operation in April 2018 due to decreased demand for coal deliveries by barge. The Dredging Act of 1906 requires that vessels engaged in dredging in U.S. waters be U.S.-built, -operated, and -crewed. Congress amended the Jones Act in 1988 to include any valueless material as \"merchandise\" transported domestically by vessel. The Jones Act was amended in 1988 to include valueless material as \"merchandise\" transported domestically by vessel, requiring dredge spoil to be transported in U.S.-built vessels. The ban on foreign-built dredgers and operators has raised the cost of dredging U.S. harbors significantly. Despite increased federal spending on navigation dredging, there has not been a larger volume of material dredged due to factors such as limited supply of dredging vessels, cost increases in fuel, steel, and labor, and more stringent environmental requirements. The U.S. privately owned fleet is older and smaller compared to leading European dredging firms. The U.S. privately owned fleet is much older and smaller compared to leading European dredging firms. European firms have a larger fleet of hopper dredges with three to four times the capacity of the entire U.S. hopper fleet. When the Army Corps bids harbor work requiring a hopper dredge, one of the four U.S. firms is the sole bidder over a third of the time. Mobilization and demobilization of equipment in the U.S. market can amount to more than one-third of total project costs. Foreign firms use heavy-lift vessels to transport their dredge fleets to the next project. The offshore supply vessel (OSV) fleet in the U.S. market consists of about 1,800 vessels, mainly operating in the Gulf of Mexico. Foreign-built vessels are essential for construction in deeper waters due to the lack of heavy-lift vessels in the Jones Act fleet. These vessels require dynamic positioning propulsion systems for stability. The Jones Act fleet also faces challenges in serving as a naval auxiliary during times of war or national emergency. The Jones Act fleet faces challenges in serving as a naval auxiliary during times of war or national emergency. Congress has enacted programs to designate other fleets for sealift support, but Jones Act mariners are still identified as potential crew for the sealift fleet. The shrinking U.S. mariner pool raises concerns about crewing a reserve sealift fleet. In 2014, Congress directed the Department of Transportation and Defense to develop a national sealift strategy, which is yet to be issued. Jones Act mariners could be called upon to support military sealift, with crews typically having six months of shore leave per year. Jones Act mariners, including those on shore leave, may be called upon to crew a reserve fleet of government-owned cargo ships for military sealift purposes. The Jones Act crew consists of about 3,380 merchant mariners, with additional mariners from the Maritime Security Program and Military Sealift Command fleets. While there is a sufficient commercial mariner pool for short surges, a prolonged sealift effort would require crew rotations and could result in a shortfall of about 1,800 mariners. MARAD estimates a shortfall of about 1,800 mariners for a prolonged sealift effort lasting up to 180 days. The mariner pool is barely sufficient for an immediate surge but inadequate for longer sealift operations, a consistent issue highlighted by sealift officials for decades. Despite the Jones Act's emphasis on a commercial fleet for military sealift, the establishment of the RRF, MSC, and MSP fleets has been crucial for military sealift purposes. The Jones Act emphasizes a commercial fleet for military sealift, but the RRF, MSC, and MSP fleets have been established for military sealift purposes. The RRF consists of 46 ships on standby with a skeleton crew of 600 mariners, needing an additional 1,200 mariners when activated. The MSC fleet carries military cargoes with civilian mariners, while the MSP fleet receives an operating subsidy for American crews and relies on government cargoes. The military sealift fleet, including the RRF, MSC, and MSP fleets, receive operating subsidies for American crews and government cargoes. Jones Act operators face higher costs for U.S.-built ships, while the sealift fleet primarily uses foreign-built ships. There is a proposal to require the sealift fleet to be built domestically, which would increase costs but make coastwise ships more price-competitive and expand the mariner pool for sealift support. The military sealift fleet is considering building ships domestically to increase cost competitiveness and expand the mariner pool. The fleet seeks cargo ships with flexible capabilities, such as ramps for unloading cargo at underdeveloped ports and the ability to carry a variety of cargo types. This preference for versatility conflicts with the commercial fleet's trend towards specialized and larger ships driven by cost considerations. The military's preference for versatile cargo ships conflicts with the commercial fleet's trend towards specialized and larger ships driven by cost considerations. General cargo and break-bulk ships have been largely replaced by container ships without onboard cranes, leading to potential challenges for commercial mariners in foreign ports. The largest container ships require more depth than many ports can provide, and cost pressures have led to engines that prioritize fuel efficiency over speed, which may not be ideal for military purposes. Cost pressures have led commercial carriers to install fuel-efficient engines that operate at lower speeds, not ideal for military sealift ships. Stringent sulfur emission regulations have prompted the use of LNG-fueled engines or scrubbers, impacting cargo space. Licensing of engine crews is specific to engine type, creating a disparity in crew skill sets. The Jones Act aims to preserve a shipyard industrial base for shipbuilding and repair, but U.S. shipyards lack economies of scale due to low production rates. The objective of U.S. maritime policy is to have a merchant marine supplemented by efficient facilities for building and repairing vessels. U.S. shipyards typically build only a few oceangoing ships per year, with gaps between orders. Demand has been enough to sustain one shipyard building commercial ships, but employment has fallen below 100 people with no vessels under construction. Smaller vessels like tour boats and ferries are also built, but lack dry docks for large ship repairs. The government-owned sealift fleet is aging and in need of repair. The government-owned sealift fleet, averaging 44 years old, lacks sufficient large dry docks for repairs, delaying readiness to sail. Some reserve fleet ships have failed safety inspections and are not seaworthy due to rust. The Navy plans to recapitalize by building new vessels, extending service life of current ships, and considering purchasing used foreign-built ships due to high costs and delays in repairs. The government-owned sealift fleet is facing high costs and delays in repairs, prompting consideration of purchasing used, foreign-built ships. The Tariff Act of 1930 imposes a 50% duty on nonemergency repairs on U.S. flag ships done in foreign shipyards, but many U.S.-flag international trading ships still opt for foreign repairs due to lower costs."
