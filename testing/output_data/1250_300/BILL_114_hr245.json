    "content": "The text chunk is about the codification of effective dates for claims under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The text chunk provides definitions related to claims for benefits under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, including terms like claimant, claim, formal claim, and informal claim. The text chunk outlines the requirements for submitting a claim for benefits under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, including the format, intent, identification of benefits sought, authorized representatives, and evidence of entitlement. It also defines a \"reasonably raised claim\" as evidence not explicitly raised in a claim but logically placed at issue. The text chunk discusses an entitlement to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary, not explicitly raised in a claim but logically placed at issue. It also includes a clerical amendment to the table of sections. The text amends sections related to informal claims and effective dates for benefit applications under the Secretary's administration. It outlines procedures for submitting formal claims and considers informal requests for claim increases or reopenings. The Secretary considers informal communications as filed applications for benefits if a formal application is submitted within 180 days. Failure to do so results in the application being considered filed on the date of submission. Additionally, the Secretary is required to address reasonably raised claims during the adjudication process. The Secretary is mandated to identify, address, and adjudicate reasonably raised claims that arise during the adjudication process, including evidence related to separate conditions not previously part of a formal claim. The amendments made by this Act regarding the treatment of reasonably raised claims will be effective on the date of enactment and apply to claims submitted on or after that date."
