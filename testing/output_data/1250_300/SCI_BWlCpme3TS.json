Character-level models offer a more memory-efficient and compact language representation, especially for multilingual translation. Self-attention models are suitable for character-level translation, offering a more memory-efficient representation. A novel convtransformer variant, using convolution for character interactions, outperforms the standard transformer. This approach is beneficial for bilingual and multilingual translation tasks. The convtransformer, a variant of the transformer model, utilizes convolution for character interactions, showing superior performance in character-level translation tasks compared to the standard transformer. This approach is effective for bilingual and multilingual translation, requiring fewer parameters and producing robust alignments. Lee et al. (2017) proposed a recurrent encoder-decoder model for translation, combining convolutional layers with max pooling and highway layers. Their approach showed promising results for multilingual translation, with performance improvements seen when training on multiple source languages. Multilingual training of character-level models is possible even for distant languages by mapping them to a common character-level representation. Cherry et al. (2018) conducted a comparison between different character and subword-level models, showing that given enough computational time and model adjustments, significant improvements can be achieved. The transformer model, known for its attention-driven encoder-decoder architecture, has shown state-of-the-art performance in NLP tasks. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of attention in character-level modeling, challenging the traditional view that attention is more suited for word-level tasks. Recent work has shown that attention can be effective for modeling characters, prompting investigation into character-level bilingual and multilingual translation using the transformer model. A modified architecture called the convtransformer is proposed, incorporating 1D convolutional layers in the encoder blocks to capture character interactions at different levels of granularity. In contrast to previous work, the convtransformer model maintains input resolution without compressing character sequences. Experiments are conducted on WMT15 DE\u2192EN and UN datasets for character-level translation, allowing for multilingual experiments due to the large number of parallel sentences in the UN corpus. The study uses the United Nations Parallel Corpus for multilingual experiments, sampling sentence pairs from different languages for translation to English. Bilingual datasets are combined and shuffled for training, with Chinese data latinized for character vocabulary consistency. Testing is done on original UN test sets. The study latinizes the Chinese dataset using the Wubi encoding method for bilingual and multilingual experiments. Model comparison shows character-level training is slower but comparable to subword-level training. The study uses character-level training with a vocabulary of 50k BPE tokens on Nvidia GTX 1080X GPUs. Character-level transformers outperform previous models and require fewer parameters. Multilingual experiments show the convtransformer model consistently outperforms the standard transformer, with up to 2.6 BLEU improvement on multilingual translation tasks. The study compares the performance of convtransformer and transformer models on multilingual translation tasks. Multilingual models trained on similar input languages show improved performance for both languages. Distant-language training can be effective but is most helpful when the input language is closer to the target translation language. The convtransformer is slower to train but reaches comparable performance in fewer epochs, leading to an overall training speedup. Character alignments learned by multilingual models are analyzed to gain a better understanding of their performance. To understand multilingual models, character alignments are analyzed through model attention probabilities. Bilingual models are compared to multilingual models to assess alignment quality. Multilingual models may have lower quality alignments due to architecture limitations or dissimilar languages. Alignments are quantified using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) on sampled sentences from UN testing datasets. In a study on multilingual models, alignment matrices were produced by analyzing encoder-decoder attention from different models. Results showed strong correlation for similar languages but a drop in correlation when introducing a distant language like ZH. The convtransformer model was found to be more robust than the transformer model in handling distant languages. The study investigated the effectiveness of self-attention models for character-level translation, comparing transformer and convolution-augmented transformer architectures. Results showed competitive performance with subword-level models, especially when training on multiple similar languages. However, performance dropped for distant languages. Future work includes analyzing more languages and improving training efficiency for character-level models. Model outputs are provided in Tables 3, 4, and 5. The study focused on improving training efficiency for character-level models and analyzing bilingual and multilingual translation outputs. Results showed differences in alignment patterns between transformer and convtransformer models, especially for distant languages like FR+ZH\u2192EN. The convtransformer model shows less noisy alignments and better preservation of word alignments for multilingual translation of distant languages like FR+ZH\u2192EN. This indicates that the convtransformer is more robust for such translations.
