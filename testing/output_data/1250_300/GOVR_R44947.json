    "content": "The Judiciary Act of 1789 created federal courts under Article III of the Constitution, including the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) to provide remedies for international law violations. The ATS was modified in 1873 and 1911 before its current version in 1948. The Supreme Court views the ATS as promoting international harmony by allowing foreign plaintiffs to seek redress in US courts. During the early years of the Republic, the United States struggled to address foreign affairs due to limited federal government powers under the Articles of Confederation. Only Connecticut passed laws to penalize violations of international law, while the Framers were concerned about the states' understanding of their obligations under international law. The Judiciary Act of 1789 established federal courts, including the Alien Tort Statute, to address international law violations and promote global harmony. The Framers and the First Congress provided jurisdiction to federal courts in various circumstances related to foreign relations concerns, including suits involving foreign diplomats, admiralty and maritime cases, and disputes between U.S. citizens and citizens of foreign nations. The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) was included to allow federal courts to hear claims for violations of international law that could impact U.S. foreign relations. In the 1780s, incidents involving foreign diplomats highlighted the need for a national judiciary to address conflicts in international relations under the Articles of Confederation. In 1784, French adventurer Julien de Longchamps assaulted diplomat Fran\u00e7ois Barb\u00e9-Marbois in Philadelphia. Longchamps was convicted and sentenced to two years in jail by a Pennsylvania court. The Confederation Congress apologized to Marbois for its limited ability to provide redress at the federal level. In a separate incident, a New York constable arrested a Dutch Ambassador's servant, leading to tensions with the Ambassador. The federal government faced challenges in providing judicial relief to foreign officials injured in the United States, leading to tensions with foreign diplomats. Incidents like the Marbois and Van Berckel cases highlighted the need for a mechanism to address violations of international law, potentially serving as an impetus for the Alien Tort Statute (ATS). The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) was initially intended to provide a judicial forum to protect the rights of foreign diplomats. However, it was rarely used for the first 190 years of its existence, with only two reported cases invoking it for jurisdiction. One case involved a French captain seeking to recover slaves, while the other dealt with forged passports in an international child custody dispute. The lack of usage led to the ATS being described as an old and underutilized statute. The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) was rarely used for nearly two centuries until it gained prominence in 1980 with the Fil\u00e1rtiga v. Pe\u00f1a-Irala case, where Paraguayan citizens sued a former Inspector General for human rights violations in New York under the ATS jurisdiction. The Fil\u00e1rtiga v. Pe\u00f1a-Irala case involved a Paraguayan citizen living in New York on an expired visa. The Second Circuit ruled that torture by a state official against its own citizen violates international human rights law, making it actionable under the ATS. This decision significantly increased the use of the ATS for civil claims in U.S. federal courts for human rights violations. The Fil\u00e1rtiga v. Pe\u00f1a-Irala case was a landmark decision that propelled the ATS into prominence for asserting civil claims in U.S. federal courts for human rights violations. However, subsequent cases like Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic raised questions about the jurisdiction and cause of action under the ATS. In Tel-Oren, the D.C. Circuit addressed the ATS requirements but did not resolve them. Israeli citizens and survivors of a terrorist attack brought an ATS claim against the Palestinian Liberation Organization. The three-judge panel unanimously dismissed the case, with different rationales. Judge Bork argued that the ATS is purely jurisdictional and does not create a cause of action for damages, while Judge Edwards believed the ATS itself creates a statutory cause of action. Both judges concurred in the dismissal for lack of official state action and insufficient recognition of terrorism as a violation of international law. Judge Edwards concurred in the dismissal of the case under the rationale that it lacked official state action and that terrorism was not sufficiently recognized as a violation of international law. Judge Robb found the case raised nonjusticiable political questions. The disagreement between Judge Bork and Judge Edwards over the cause-of-action question would later be addressed in the landmark Supreme Court decision, Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain. Congress later created the Torture Victim Protection Act, which allows for civil claims for torture and extrajudicial killing. The Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA) was signed into law in 1992 by President George H. W. Bush, creating a civil cause of action for damages against individuals who subject others to torture or extrajudicial killing. The TVPA differs from the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) as it expressly allows for civil actions for torture and extrajudicial killing, while the ATS only refers to federal court jurisdiction. The TVPA allows for actions to be brought by and against individuals, including both U.S. and foreign nationals, but excludes liability against corporations. The TVPA allows civil actions for torture and extrajudicial killing by and against individuals, excluding liability against corporations. It requires plaintiffs to exhaust all remedies where the conduct occurred. The relationship between the TVPA and the ATS is unclear, with some courts viewing the TVPA as supplementing the ATS, while others see it as occupying the field. Congress provided an express cause of action under the TVPA for claims previously argued under the ATS. The TVPA provides a cause of action for torture and extrajudicial killing claims, distinct from the ATS. The Supreme Court addressed the cause-of-action question in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, involving a Mexican doctor accused of torturing and murdering a DEA agent. After being seized and brought into U.S. custody, Alvarez's criminal indictment was dismissed for lack of evidence during trial. He then filed a civil case asserting ATS claims against the Mexican nationals responsible for his abduction, which reached the Supreme Court in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain. The Court clarified the ATS jurisdiction and cause of action for alleged violations of the law of nations. The Sosa Court clarified that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) is a jurisdictional statute creating no new causes of action, but was not intended to be \"stillborn\" and allows for a \"modest number of international law violations\" to be actionable without the need for a separate statute. The Sosa Court clarified that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) allows federal courts to recognize a narrow set of common law causes of action for international law violations without the need for a separate statute. It cited specific offenses from 18th-century English criminal law that would have been considered actionable under the ATS at the time of its enactment, such as violations of safe conducts, infringement on the rights of ambassadors, and piracy. Additionally, federal courts can recognize common law claims for violations of present-day international law, as long as they are based on norms accepted by the civilized world. Under Sosa, federal courts can recognize common law claims for violations of the \"present-day law of nations,\" but only if they are based on norms accepted by the civilized world and defined with specificity comparable to 18th-century paradigms of international law. The Court emphasized the need for judicial caution and restraint in identifying new causes of action. Alvarez's claim for arbitrary arrest and detention was dismissed as it did not meet the newly described requirements for an ATS claim. The Supreme Court has interpreted Sosa to establish a two-step framework for addressing questions related to the breadth of ATS liability. The Supreme Court has established a two-step framework for addressing questions related to the breadth of ATS liability. Courts must first determine if the claim is based on a violation of a specific, universal, and obligatory international law norm. If satisfied, courts should then decide if allowing the case to proceed is an appropriate exercise of judicial discretion. Despite warnings of caution from Sosa, the use of ATS to seek redress for human rights abuses continued largely unabated. However, the trend slowed after restrictions on the territorial reach of the ATS were recognized in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum in 2013. The Supreme Court established a two-step framework for ATS liability. In Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, the Court ruled that the ATS does not reach conduct that occurs entirely in the territory of a foreign nation due to the \"presumption against extraterritorial application.\" This decision aimed to prevent clashes between U.S. and foreign law. The Supreme Court's decision in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum established that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) does not apply to conduct that occurs entirely in a foreign nation. This is due to the \"presumption against extraterritoriality,\" which aims to prevent clashes between U.S. and foreign law. The ATS was not intended to have extraterritorial reach, as demonstrated by the events that gave rise to the statute. The Supreme Court's decision in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum established that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) does not apply to conduct that occurs entirely in a foreign nation. The presumption against extraterritoriality applies to the ATS, barring claims for violations of the law of nations in foreign territory. The \"touch and concern\" test may displace the presumption in future cases, but mere corporate presence is not sufficient. The Court did not provide further explanation, leading to divergent interpretations in lower courts. The Supreme Court's decision in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum established that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) does not apply to conduct that occurs entirely in a foreign nation. The Court did not provide further explanation on how an ATS claim could satisfy the \"touch and concern\" test, leading to divergent interpretations in lower courts. Justices Kennedy, Alito, and Breyer provided separate opinions on the matter. In Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, the Supreme Court established that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) does not apply to conduct in a foreign nation. Justice Breyer proposed limiting ATS jurisdiction to cases involving specific factors to prevent the US from becoming a safe harbor for wrongdoers. Justice Breyer's test in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum aimed to prevent the US from becoming a safe harbor for wrongdoers by limiting ATS jurisdiction to cases with ties to the United States. The Supreme Court's decision in Kiobel has restricted the ATS as a tool for addressing human rights abuses in US courts, particularly in \"foreign cubed\" cases. The Kiobel decision has created challenges for cases involving foreign defendants and injuries in foreign nations. Different circuits have varying interpretations of the \"touch and concern\" test under the ATS. Some circuits require the violation of law to occur in the US, while others consider extensive US contacts sufficient for jurisdiction. Different circuits have varying interpretations of the \"touch and concern\" test under the ATS. The Fourth Circuit requires extensive US contacts for jurisdiction, while the Eleventh Circuit focuses on relevant conduct occurring in the United States. The Eleventh Circuit considers factors like defendants' citizenship and potential US national interests triggered by their conduct. The Eleventh Circuit considers factors such as defendants' citizenship and potential US national interests triggered by their conduct in determining jurisdiction under the ATS. The Ninth Circuit also considers a defendant's US citizenship or corporate status as one factor in establishing a connection between an ATS claim and the territory of the United States. The circuits' interpretations of extraterritoriality in relation to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 vary, with some citing the Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. case as a precedent. The Supreme Court's decision in Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. established that the focus of Section 10(b) is on the purchase and sale of securities, not the deceptive conduct. This ruling may impact ATS cases, with differing interpretations among circuits on whether Morrison applies. The Ninth and Fourth Circuits believe Morrison's analysis should not control in ATS cases, while the Fifth and Second Circuits have adopted a bright line rule guided by Morrison's focus analysis. The Supreme Court's decision in Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. established that the focus of Section 10(b) is on the purchase and sale of securities. The Fifth and Second Circuits adopted a bright line rule in ATS cases, requiring conduct violating the law of nations to occur domestically. The Eleventh Circuit took a hybrid approach combining Kiobel's standards with Morrison's focus test. The Supreme Court's decision in RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community may help resolve the conflict by applying the presumption against extraterritoriality to civil provisions. The Supreme Court's two-step framework for analyzing extraterritoriality issues involves determining if a statute applies extraterritorially and then assessing if the case involves a domestic application of the statute based on its \"focus.\" There is debate on whether the \"focus\" analysis from Morrison applies in ATS cases, with different courts interpreting the Supreme Court's ruling in RJR Nabisco differently. It remains to be seen if RJR Nabisco will streamline lower courts' frameworks for analyzing extraterritoriality under the ATS. The Supreme Court's decision in RJR Nabisco may impact lower courts' interpretive frameworks for analyzing extraterritoriality under the ATS. There is a debate on whether the \"focus\" test from Morrison applies in ATS cases, with potential for disagreement on the ATS's focus. The Fifth Circuit's interpretation of RJR Nabisco may lead to a bright-line rule for ATS plaintiffs. The Supreme Court's decision in Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC may further restrict the use of the ATS for extraterritorial claims, particularly regarding corporate liability. In the recent ATS case Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to address the issue of corporate liability under the ATS. The case involved claims by foreign nationals injured by terrorist groups in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza, alleging that Arab Bank aided and abetted the organizations. The plaintiffs alleged that Arab Bank aided terrorist organizations in attacks in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza between 1995 and 2005. They claimed the bank maintained accounts for the organizations and played a role in compensating victims' families. The Second Circuit dismissed the ATS claims, citing no corporate liability. The Second Circuit dismissed ATS claims due to no corporate liability, despite a growing consensus among sister circuits. The Supreme Court in Jesner upheld the Second Circuit's approach but exempted foreign corporations from liability under the ATS, leaving open the possibility for U.S. corporations to face claims. Justice Kennedy, in a 5-4 majority, placed the decision in the context of the two-part inquiry from Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain for evaluating violations of international norms under the ATS. In Jesner, the Supreme Court upheld the Second Circuit's approach of dismissing ATS claims against foreign corporations. The Court emphasized judicial caution in extending liability to foreign entities, citing separation-of-powers and foreign affairs concerns. The majority reasoned that Congress is better positioned to determine if imposing ATS liability on foreign corporations serves the public interest, as these claims can impact U.S. foreign relations. The Jesner Court upheld the dismissal of ATS claims against foreign corporations, citing concerns about public interest and U.S. foreign relations. The Court noted that such claims had caused diplomatic tensions with Jordan. A bright-line rule was established that foreign corporations cannot be defendants in ATS suits, with Justices offering differing rationales for the decision. The Jesner Court upheld the dismissal of ATS claims against foreign corporations to avoid diplomatic strife. Justices Kennedy, Roberts, Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Thomas all provided differing rationales for the decision. Justice Gorsuch argued that separation-of-powers principles dictate against recognizing new ATS causes of action, while Justice Thomas agreed with the concurrences of Justices Alito and Gorsuch. Justice Thomas concurred with the majority opinion in Jesner, stating that it correctly applies the Court's precedents. Justice Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the corporate form itself does not raise foreign policy concerns that warrant immunity for foreign corporations under the ATS. The dissent suggested resolving tensions through other limitations on ATS jurisdiction. The debate over the ATS's viability continues following the Jesner decision. The dissenters in Jesner considered foreign policy implications of ATS suits, noting support for foreign corporate liability. Jesner has sparked debate on the ATS's future viability for human rights abuse lawsuits. Some believe very few cases will meet the Supreme Court's ATS jurisdiction requirements due to Jesner, Kiobel, and Sosa. However, the ATS may still hold significance as suits against U.S. corporations and individual employees of foreign companies are allowed. Some Justices expressed interest in revisiting Sosa's discretion for new causes of action under the ATS, potentially limiting ATS jurisdiction. The Supreme Court's potential limitation on ATS jurisdiction could restrict claims to piracy, interference with ambassadors' rights, and safe conduct violations, potentially relegating the statute to obscurity. Despite the ATS's emergence for human rights and terrorism-related litigation, the Supreme Court has placed significant limitations on viable ATS claims through decisions in Sosa, Kiobel, and others. The Supreme Court's rulings on ATS cases have placed significant limitations on viable claims, potentially signaling the end of the statute's era of importance. The Court emphasized the need for congressional action to expand ATS jurisdiction beyond its 18th-century roots, shifting the future of ATS litigation to the legislative branch."
