    "content": "This report analyzes recent laws and congressional proposals related to gun regulation in the District of Columbia. Key statutes and bills include federal provisions under the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Gun Control Act of 1968, the D.C. Firearms Control Regulation Act of 1976, the proposed Second Amendment Enforcement Act (H.R. 645), and the District's Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008. Congressional proposals often coincide with discussions on voting rights for the District, such as Title II of S. 160 from the 111th Congress and H.R. 645 from the 112th Congress. Title II of S. 160 from the 111th Congress aimed to amend the District's gun laws, similar to H.R. 645 from the 112th Congress. This report analyzes the differences between the two bills and their impact on DC firearms laws post the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, which affirmed an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense within the home. The Supreme Court's decision in Heller affirmed the unconstitutionality of three provisions of the District's Firearms Control Regulation Act, allowing for the registration and possession of handguns for self-defense within the home. The DC Council enacted emergency legislation to comply with the ruling while the Court did not address the District's license to carry requirement. After the Supreme Court's decision in Heller, the DC Council enacted emergency legislation to amend the city's gun laws. This attempt was met with criticism for not fully complying with the ruling. In response, H.R. 6691, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, was introduced in Congress but did not become law. In response to the Supreme Court's Heller decision, the DC Council enacted emergency legislation to amend gun laws, leading to the introduction of H.R. 6691, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act. H.R. 6691's content was adopted into H.R. 6842, which passed in the House but not the Senate. Senator John Ensign introduced S.Amdt. 575 to S. 160 in the 111th Congress, incorporating H.R. 6842 language. The Senate approved the amendment, but progress on the legislation stalled. DC Council passed the Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008, later transmitted to Congress. The Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 (FCAA) and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 (IPAA) were passed by the DC Council and transmitted to Congress in response to the Supreme Court's Heller decision. These acts amended firearms provisions in the DC Code and were challenged but upheld in court. The most recent congressional legislation, H.R. 645, also aims to amend DC's gun provisions, taking into account the FCAA and IPAA. H.R. 645 aims to amend DC's gun provisions by limiting the District's ability to regulate firearm possession and repealing registration schemes. Federal firearms laws set minimum standards, allowing states and territories to supplement with their own laws. The District of Columbia has the authority to create firearms laws under the Home Rule Act, but Congress can still impose limits on this authority. Congress can also amend laws passed by the District of Columbia government. The Home Rule Act grants the District of Columbia the authority to create firearms laws, but Congress can impose limits on this authority and amend laws passed by the District government. Title II- S. 160 limits the District of Columbia's authority to legislate on firearms, ensuring that individuals not prohibited by Federal law can acquire, possess, transport, and use firearms for lawful purposes without undue burden. The District cannot enact laws that discourage private ownership or use of firearms. The proposed language in H.R. 645 emphasizes that the Council in the District of Columbia would not have the authority to create laws related to firearms regulation. It would limit the District from imposing restrictions on firearms possession beyond current federal laws, except for carrying. This would align District firearms laws closely with federal laws under the NFA and GCA. The proposed language in H.R. 645 would align District firearms laws closely with federal laws under the NFA and GCA, limiting the District's ability to create stricter provisions. It would not prohibit the District from regulating the carrying of firearms, but would not explicitly empower it to prohibit individuals from carrying firearms altogether. The District could regulate concealed or open carry but may not be explicitly empowered to prohibit individuals from carrying firearms altogether. The DC Code's definition of \"machine gun\" included any semiautomatic weapon that could shoot more than 12 shots without manual reloading. Under the DC Code, a \"machine gun\" is defined as any firearm capable of shooting more than 12 shots without manual reloading. The definition was broad, encompassing pistols, rifles, and shotguns. The District later aligned its definition with the federal definition in the FCAA. The District of Columbia amended its definition of \"machine gun\" to align with the federal definition, allowing for the registration of semiautomatic firearms. However, H.R. 645 could potentially revert this change and restore the previous definition of \"machine gun.\" The pre- Heller provisions in the DC Code prohibited the registration of certain firearms, effectively acting as a ban on certain types of weapons. The FCAA in the District of Columbia now allows the registration of pistols for self-defense, including semiautomatic handguns, as long as the applicant meets requirements. There is an exemption for temporary possession of a registered firearm in another person's home for self-defense. Amendments have been made to the qualification and information requirements for firearm registration. The FCAA in the District of Columbia allows the registration of pistols for self-defense, with amendments to qualification requirements. Prohibited applicants include those with recent violent behavior or civil protection orders. Firearms training and ballistics identification are also required. H.R. 645 proposes changes to the firearms registration process in DC, including eliminating the registration requirement, licensing of gun owners, and the need for a registration certificate to purchase a firearm. The Chief of Police would still need to conduct ballistics identification on registered pistols, with limitations on the number of pistols that can be registered per person within a 30-day period. The bill would also repeal restrictions on sawed-off shotguns, short barreled rifles, and machine guns. H.R. 645 would eliminate the need for firearm registration, licensing of gun owners, and restrictions on the number of handguns that can be purchased per month in DC. It would also allow the transfer of ammunition to any person, including DC residents. Section 5 of H.R. 645 eliminates the need for ammunition certificates and tracking of ammunition sales by licensed dealers. It allows the transfer of ammunition to any person, including DC residents. H.R. 645 and Title II- S. 160 both permit interstate purchase of firearms, with different approaches. Title II- S. 160 carves out an exception for federal licensees in Maryland or Virginia to sell handguns to DC residents, while H.R. 645 amends the DC Code for interstate firearms transfer. H.R. 645 proposes amending the DC Code to allow federal licensees in Maryland or Virginia to sell handguns to District of Columbia residents, as long as legal conditions are met. The District's trigger lock requirement, previously declared unconstitutional, exceeded federal law by mandating firearm storage regulations. The District of Columbia's trigger lock requirement, previously declared unconstitutional, was amended under the FCAA to mandate that any firearm in lawful possession be unloaded and secured by a trigger lock. The FCAA also prohibits storing loaded firearms where minors can access them without permission. The FCAA mandates secure storage of firearms to prevent access by minors without permission, with penalties for violations. H.R. 645 creates penalties for allowing minors access to loaded firearms resulting in injury. The FCAA mandates secure storage of firearms to prevent access by minors without permission. Violations may result in fines and imprisonment, with exceptions for secure storage methods or specific circumstances like self-defense or supervised hunting. The FCAA mandates secure storage of firearms to prevent access by minors without permission, with exceptions for self-defense, supervised hunting, or law enforcement officers on duty. Violating the registration scheme in DC incurs fines up to $1,000 or imprisonment up to one year, with harsher penalties for repeat offenses. H.R. 645 aims to repeal this provision in the DC Code. H.R. 645 aims to repeal the provision in the DC Code for unregistered possession of firearms, removing criminal penalties and harmonizing definitions between Titles 7 and 22. The IPAA allows the District of Columbia to restrict firearm possession on its property. The IPAA amended DC law to allow the District of Columbia to prohibit or restrict firearms on its property. Private property owners in DC can also restrict firearms, except for law enforcement personnel. H.R. 645 addresses property owners' ability to restrict firearms on their premises, unlike existing DC law. The proposed language in Section 10 of H.R. 645 would further limit private landlords' ability to restrict tenants from possessing firearms on their premises. It would also give the District of Columbia the authority to restrict firearms in buildings or structures under its control with security measures, but it is unclear if this extends to regulating firearms on other real property under its control. The proposed language in H.R. 645 would give the District of Columbia authority to regulate firearms in buildings or structures under its control, but it is unclear if this extends to other real property under its control. The language does not specify which types of buildings the District can regulate, and it is uncertain if security measures are a requirement for regulation. The District of Columbia would regain authority to issue licenses for concealed carry under H.R. 645, repealing a provision from the IPAA. The bill also maintains restrictions on carrying rifles or shotguns in the District, with exceptions for law enforcement officers and state laws. Currently, individuals with valid firearm registrations can carry them within their homes or while in transit. H.R. 645 would allow individuals in the District of Columbia to carry firearms without a license in certain locations and for specific purposes, such as in their homes, places of business, or while engaged in lawful recreational activities. This bill would modify the restrictions imposed by the IPAA on carrying firearms, granting more freedom to gun owners in the District. H.R. 645 would allow individuals in the District of Columbia to carry firearms without a license in specific locations and for certain purposes, such as in their homes, places of business, or while engaged in lawful recreational activities. The bill would grant more freedom to gun owners in the District, including the ability to obtain a concealed carry license for carrying firearms outside of these specified circumstances. The IPAA made a technical change to the District Code by including toy and antique pistols as types of firearms that are prohibited from being used to commit a violent or dangerous crime, and violators are subject to certain criminal penalties. H.R. 645 would provide jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings to hear cases pertaining to the denial or revocation of firearms dealer licenses. The FCAA had provided such authority to the Office of Administrative Hearings, except that it went further to grant the Office of Administrative Hearings the authority to hear cases pertaining to the denial or revocation of firearms dealer licenses. H.R. 645 would provide jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings to hear cases regarding the denial or revocation of firearms dealer licenses. The FCAA previously granted this authority but also included jurisdiction over firearm registration certificates, which would be repealed under H.R. 645. The proposed bill would also repeal amendments to the DC Code made by the FCAA and IPAA, restoring previous laws related to dealer qualifications and firearm transfers. The FCAA governs qualifications for dealer's licenses and firearm transfers, requiring a registration certificate. H.R. 645 would repeal the registration scheme, allowing those not prohibited by law to apply for a dealer's license and engage in firearm transactions. Federal prohibitions on firearm possession are outlined, including restrictions on certain individuals. Reporting duties for firearms and ammunition inventory would also be repealed. The federal GCA prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of certain crimes, fugitives, drug users, and others. It is illegal to sell a firearm to someone who falls within these categories. Reporting duties for firearms and ammunition inventory would be repealed under H.R. 645. Under the federal GCA, it is illegal to sell a firearm to individuals convicted of certain crimes or falling within specific categories. H.R. 645 would maintain restrictions on licensed dealers transferring firearms to those prohibited by federal or DC law. Non-licensed individuals can only sell firearms to licensed dealers under DC law. The bill would impose new eligibility requirements for firearm transfers, aligning with federal regulations. Under H.R. 645, licensed dealers would still be prohibited from transferring firearms to individuals prohibited by federal or DC law. The bill would remove registration requirements under the DC Code, aligning with federal regulations. Additionally, the assault weapons ban created by the FCAA would be affected, expanding the definition of \"assault weapon\" to include specific firearms and characteristics. The FCAA expands the definition of assault weapons to include specific firearms and characteristics, allowing the Chief to designate certain firearms as assault weapons. This new definition also applies to the Assault Weapon Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990, holding manufacturers liable for damages caused by assault weapons. Additionally, the FCAA prohibits possession, sale, or transfer of large capacity ammunition feeding devices in the District of Columbia. The FCAA prohibits possession of large capacity ammunition feeding devices in the District of Columbia, including magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds. This restriction would be repealed by Section 14 of H.R. 645. Under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, licensed dealers must run a background check before transferring a firearm to a non-licensed person. If no response is received from the system after three business days, the transfer can proceed if the transferee's identity is verified. Non-licensed persons are not required to undergo a background check under federal law. The DC Code previously imposed a 48-hour waiting period for pistol or handgun transfers, but under the IPAA, the waiting period for firearm transfers is now 10 days. Under the IPAA, the waiting period for firearm transfers is now 10 days, applying to all firearms, not just pistols. If the IPAA is repealed, the waiting period for obtaining a handgun would revert back to 48 hours. The FCAA added provisions regarding microstamping and the sale of semiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011. The FCAA now requires that semiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011, must be microstamp-ready. This includes providing the Chief with the make, model, and serial number of the pistol when presented with a cartridge code from a legitimate law enforcement investigation. Additionally, pistols not on the California Roster of Handguns Certified for Sale are prohibited from being manufactured, sold, transferred, or imported into the District of Columbia after January 1, 2009, unless lawfully owned and registered prior to that date. The Firearms Control Amendment Act (FCAA) prohibits the ownership or possession of certain pistols in DC unless they were lawfully owned and registered before January 1, 2009. Residents can only sell or transfer these pistols through licensed firearms dealers. The Chief must review the California Roster annually for any changes and can revise the roster of handguns deemed not unsafe. The Illegal Possession of Ammunition Act (IPAA) requires a special permit for firearm discharge, except for self-defense, and allows the District to restrict firearms possession on its property. The Firearms Control Amendment Act in DC prohibits ownership of certain pistols unless registered before 2009. It allows the District to restrict firearms possession on its property, including private property, except for law enforcement personnel."
