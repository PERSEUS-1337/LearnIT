PBGC insures single-employer and multiemployer pension plans, maintaining separate reserve funds for each program. In FY2018, PBGC insured 25,000 DB pension plans covering 37 million people and paid benefits to 1.4 million individuals. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures about 25,000 DB pension plans covering 37 million people. It pays benefits to 1.4 million individuals and provides financial assistance to 78 multiemployer pensions. PBGC pays a maximum benefit to plan participants, with most receiving the full pension benefit they earned. PBGC is a government-owned corporation with a three-member board of directors chaired by the Secretary of Labor. The Director of PBGC is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Director of PBGC is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. ERISA also provides for a seven-member Advisory Committee, appointed by the President, for staggered three-year terms. The Advisory Committee advises PBGC on issues such as investment of funds and plan liquidations. MAP-21 altered some governance structures of PBGC, including setting the Director's term at five years and establishing a Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate. PBGC is self-supporting and receives no general revenue appropriations. Members of Congress are hesitant to provide financial assistance to PBGC. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is primarily funded through premiums paid by private-sector employers who sponsor DB pension plans, as well as assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from underfunded plans. PBGC's revenue is not supported by general government funds, and Congress sets the premiums that sponsors must pay. Premiums vary based on the type of pension plan, with additional fees for underfunded plans and terminated plans. PBGC's financial activities are included in federal budget totals as required by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980. Pension plans pay premiums based on underfunding and termination situations. Premiums for 2019 include flat-rate and variable-rate premiums for single-employer plans, as well as a termination premium. Multiemployer plans have a flat-rate premium. Premium rates history is provided in the appendix. The sponsors of multiemployer DB pension plans pay an annual premium of $29 per participant in 2019. PBGC covers only qualified DB plans under IRC Section 401, while DC plans like 401(k) and 403(b) plans are not insured. Meeting IRC requirements allows tax benefits for qualified pension plans, with contributions being tax-deductible for employers. Income from the plan is taxed as ordinary income for participants. Pension plans must be established as permanent arrangements, provide definite benefits, and not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. Pension plans must meet IRC requirements to qualify for PBGC insurance, excluding certain types of plans like governmental, church, and small professional plans. PBGC operates separate reserve funds for single-employer and multiemployer programs, with assets from one program not used for the other. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes trustee of terminated underfunded plans, with participants receiving benefits from PBGC. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes the trustee of terminated, underfunded DB pension plans. Participants receive benefits from PBGC. In the multiemployer program, PBGC provides loans to insolvent plans. Employers can terminate single-employer plans voluntarily. PBGC may involuntarily terminate underfunded plans. If a company ends its pension plan voluntarily, PBGC confirms termination requirements but does not pay benefits to participants. In cases of voluntary termination of pension plans, PBGC confirms termination requirements but does not pay benefits to participants. Benefit liabilities include all benefits earned by participants, vested and nonvested, early retirement supplements, and subsidies. Assets covering liabilities are used to distribute benefits, with excess assets potentially recovered by the employer through an asset reversion subject to an excise tax. Liabilities can be recovered by the employer through an asset reversion, subject to an excise tax. The tax rate is 20% if a qualified replacement plan is established, otherwise 50%. Underfunded plan terminations lead to PBGC receivership, where PBGC takes control of assets and liabilities. PBGC pays benefits from plan assets and employer recoveries, with any remaining guaranteed benefits covered by PBGC's funds. Distress terminations require meeting specific criteria. Distress terminations for underfunded plans require meeting specific criteria, including bankruptcy filings, court approval, PBGC determination of necessity, or avoiding burdensome pension costs. PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if the plan sponsor agrees or by federal court order, based on criteria such as not meeting funding standards, inability to pay benefits, substantial owner distributions, and unfunded vested benefits. These requirements were established by SEPPAA, modified by P.L. 100-203 and RPA, to ensure employer responsibility for underfunded plan liabilities unless genuine financial need is proven. If a pension plan does not meet minimum funding standards, has a substantial owner receiving over $10,000, or has unfunded vested benefits, PBGC may terminate the plan. A federal court can also order termination to protect participants' interests or avoid financial deterioration. PBGC has become trustee of 4,769 plans since 1974, with only a small fraction resulting in claims against PBGC. Most terminations are standard. In FY2016, PBGC became trustee of 4,769 single-employer DB pension plans. Following distress or involuntary termination, the plan sponsor and controlled group members are jointly liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall, payable in cash or negotiable securities. Failure to pay may result in a lien on the employer's property. If the sponsor is in bankruptcy, PBGC cannot create a lien. When a plan undergoing distress termination is sponsored by a company in bankruptcy, PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited as it has the same legal standing as other creditors. PBGC guarantees nonforfeitable retirement benefits up to statutory limits, excluding benefits solely due to termination, and certain death, survivor, or disability benefits. Monthly installment retirement benefits are typically guaranteed. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) guarantees monthly installment retirement benefits up to statutory limits, excluding certain benefits. The maximum pension guarantee for workers aged 65 in plans terminating in 2019 is $67,295 annually, adjusted for national wage growth. This amount decreases if benefits are received before age 65. The maximum pension guarantee by PBGC is $67,295 annually for workers aged 65 in plans terminating in 2019, adjusted for wage growth. The benefit amount is adjusted based on the age at which benefits are received, with reductions for early retirement and increases for later retirement. The PBGC guarantees reduced benefits based on age and type of benefit. Only basic and vested benefits are insured, with an average monthly benefit of $606 in FY2015. Over 80% of recipients in single-employer plans receive full benefits, with an average reduction of 28% for those whose benefits are reduced. Terminated plan assets are allocated to pay benefits according to a priority schedule. Assets of a terminated plan are allocated to pay benefits according to a priority schedule established by statute. Nonguaranteed benefits are payable before certain guaranteed benefits, with participants receiving pension payments for over three years having priority. PBGC also pays a portion of unfunded, nonguaranteed benefits based on recovered assets. In the case of multiemployer plans, PBGC insures plan insolvency rather than termination, providing financial assistance when available resources are insufficient to cover benefits. PBGC provides additional resources as loans to multiemployer plans when available resources are insufficient to pay benefits. Loans are rarely repaid, and repayment terms apply if the plan recovers from insolvency. PBGC guarantees benefits to multiemployer plans with a different guarantee ceiling based on a formula tied to years of service. Only one multiemployer plan has repaid any financial assistance. The benefit guarantee limit for participants in multiemployer plans is tied to years of service, with a formula that calculates the guaranteed limit based on a participant's years of service. PBGC estimated that 79% of participants in plans receiving financial assistance received their full benefit, but only 49% would receive full benefits in plans needing assistance in the future. Participants in plans receiving PBGC assistance are likely to see benefit reductions due to the maximum guarantee level. The average benefit in ongoing plans is almost twice as large as in terminated plans, indicating potential benefit reductions for participants in plans needing future assistance. The PBGC's net financial position at the end of FY2018 was -$51.4 billion, with assets of $112.3 billion and liabilities of $163.7 billion. The trust fund and revolving funds are PBGC's main assets, while its main liabilities are future benefit payments and financial assistance. Table 4 provides information on PBGC's net financial position from FY1999 through FY2018. The PBGC's main liabilities are the estimated present values of future benefits payments in the single-employer program and future financial assistance to insolvent plans in the multiemployer program. PBGC has had an end of fiscal year deficit each year since FY2002, with the single-employer program showing a surplus in FY2018 for the first time since FY2001. The multiemployer program is projected to become insolvent in FY2025. Both programs are on the Government Accountability Office's list of high-risk government programs. In FY2015, approximately 825,000 participants received monthly payments from PBGC, with an average monthly payment of $536. The single-employer program showed a surplus of $2.44 billion in FY2018, marking an improvement in its financial condition. In FY2018, PBGC's single-employer program had a surplus of $2.44 billion, attributed to factors like investment income and increased premium income. The multiemployer program, however, saw its deficit rise from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $42.4 billion in FY2018. The deficit in the multiemployer insurance program increased from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $65.1 billion in FY2017, decreasing to $53.8 billion in FY2018. The large increase in the deficit in FY2014 was due to the likelihood of insolvency of several large multiemployer pension plans. PBGC's budgetary cash flows are based on premium income, interest income, benefit outlays, and trust and revolving funds interactions. Trust funds contain pension plan assets, while revolving funds contain premiums and transfers for participant benefits. When PBGC becomes trustee of a single-employer pension plan, assets are transferred to a nonbudgetary trust fund. PBGC manages assets of terminated pension plans in a nonbudgetary trust fund, with investments in U.S. Treasury securities. The trust fund, totaling $70.2 billion in FY2018, is managed by private-sector money managers. PBGC also has revolving funds funded by premiums and transfers from the trust fund to pay benefits. Only three of the authorized seven revolving funds are used by PBGC. The PBGC manages revolving funds funded by premiums and transfers from the trust fund to pay benefits. The revolving funds' assets at the end of FY2018 were $33.2 billion, invested exclusively in U.S. Treasury securities. Increases in premiums paid by pension plan sponsors are considered federal revenue, but some stakeholders criticize recent premium increases for not addressing PBGC's financial condition. Some stakeholders and policymakers criticize recent PBGC premium increases, feeling they are used to offset federal spending rather than addressing PBGC's financial condition. PBGC's FY2017 Projections Report estimated a deficit shrink for the single-employer program and projected the multiemployer program to run out of money by FY2025. The single-employer program was expected to emerge from deficit by FY2018 with a projected $26 billion surplus in 10 years. The multiemployer program faces a 90% chance of insolvency before FY2025 and a 99% chance by 2026 due to the likely insolvency of large pension plans, with a probable exposure of $53.8 billion for future financial assistance. Premium levels are a concern. The multiemployer program is projected to be insolvent by 2026 due to the likely insolvency of large pension plans, with a probable exposure of $53.8 billion for future financial assistance. Once resources are exhausted, insolvent plans would need to reduce benefits to sustainable levels through premium collections only, as per the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014. This would reduce the need for financial assistance from PBGC and improve its financial situation. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created a committee to improve the solvency of multiemployer pension plans and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Despite increasing concerns, the committee did not release recommendations by the deadline. The committee established by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 did not meet the deadline to provide recommendations for improving the solvency of multiemployer pension plans and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Historical data on single-employer and multiemployer program premium levels is provided in tables A-1 and A-2."
