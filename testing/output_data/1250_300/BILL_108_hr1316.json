The Congress finds that Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension research must be expanded to find a cure or effective treatment. Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare lung disorder with a poor survival rate, affecting men and women of all ages and ethnicities. PPH can affect men and women of all ages and ethnicities. It is difficult to study due to its low prevalence and lack of a good animal model. In advanced stages, patients have limited activity and may become bedridden. Diagnosis is challenging and often confused with other heart and lung conditions. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first PPH patient registry in 1981. In 1981, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first PPH patient registry, following 194 people with PPH for up to 7.5 years. Research is focused on immunologic and genetic factors, agents causing narrowing of pulmonary blood vessels, and factors leading to smooth muscle growth and scar tissue formation. Anorexic drugs taken by almost 6,000,000 Americans from January 1996 to December 1997 can cause PPH in some individuals, leading to terminal stages or death. Almost 6,000,000 Americans took anorexic drugs from January 1996 to December 1997, leading to cases of PPH. SPH has known causes such as emphysema, bronchitis, and other diseases like scleroderma and congenital heart defects. Other causes include chronic pulmonary thromboembolism, HIV infection, liver disease, and certain diet drugs. The Public Health Service Act is amended to expand research on pulmonary hypertension under the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The Director of the Institute will expand research activities on pulmonary hypertension and coordinate with other national research institutes. Centers of Excellence will be established for research, training, and education on pulmonary hypertension. The establishment of centers for research, training, and education on pulmonary hypertension includes conducting basic and clinical research, training programs for scientists and health professionals, providing information to healthcare professionals, and disseminating information to the public. Stipends may be provided for the training of health professionals. The Director coordinates information among centers, ensures regular communication, requires reports on center activities, and specifies organization requirements. Each center uses facilities of a single institution or a consortium of cooperating institutions. The Director determines the number of centers and duration of support based on available funds. The Director establishes and oversees centers for pulmonary hypertension research, with support lasting up to 5 years and possible extensions. A data system is set up for collecting and analyzing patient data. The Director of the Institute establishes a data system for collecting, storing, analyzing, and disseminating data on pulmonary hypertension in patient populations. An information clearinghouse is also created to enhance understanding of the condition. Public input is encouraged, and biennial reports on activities are prepared. The Director of the Institute establishes a data system for collecting, storing, analyzing, and disseminating data on pulmonary hypertension in patient populations. Biennial reports on activities are prepared, and public comments are welcomed. Authorization of appropriations up to $25,000,000 for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 is granted."
