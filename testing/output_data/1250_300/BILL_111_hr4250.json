The Medicaid DSH Integrity Act, also known as the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, ensures that DSH funds are used to assist hospitals serving low-income individuals. Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting regulations have been implemented to narrow the scope of DSH payments for many States. The Medicaid DSH Integrity Act implemented reporting and auditing requirements that narrowed the scope of DSH payments for many States. These changes resulted in significant reductions in DSH payments to safety net providers approved by CMS. SEC. 2. REVISION OF MEDICAID DSH AUDITING AND REPORTING REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with States and disproportionate share hospitals, will not enforce policy changes related to the calculation of limits under the Social Security Act. An interim final rule will be published to revise the Medicaid DSH auditing and reporting regulations as necessary. The new interim final rule will include regulatory changes such as allowing hospitals to include all costs related to services provided to uninsured patients, even if they have insurance for other services. States will be permitted to use the definition of allowable costs as outlined in prior CMS guidance. The CMS will allow states to use their definition of allowable costs in Medicaid plans for auditing purposes, as long as they do not exceed Medicare principles. The audit requirement for hospital services will be interpreted consistently with existing regulations, and the General DSH Audit Protocol will be revised as needed. CMS will revise the General DSH Audit Protocol to allow for alternative cost methodologies and trending forward costs from prior years. The Social Security Act will be amended to change the initiation requirements, and CMS is defined as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-173) defines key terms related to Medicaid DSH program and auditing regulations, including CMS and the Secretary of Health and Human Services."
