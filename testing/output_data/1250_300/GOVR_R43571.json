    "content": "Federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been in existence since the National Defense Education Act of 1958. These programs offer borrowers the opportunity to have their student loan debt forgiven or repaid in exchange for service in specific professions or fields. Over 50 such programs are authorized, with around 30 operational as of October 1, 2017. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are authorized by the federal government, with around 30 operational as of October 1, 2017. These programs forgive or repay a portion of student loan debt in exchange for service in specific professions or fields. Benefits are often tied to employment in public service or high-need occupations, and are increasingly offered in income-driven repayment plans. The goal is to provide financial incentives for individuals to enter or remain in certain professions and provide debt relief. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs provide incentives for individuals to enter public service or specific professions by offering debt relief. These programs aim to encourage individuals to remain employed in high-need occupations or locations. Additionally, debt relief options are available for borrowers facing unfortunate circumstances such as disability or school closure. The report discusses various loan discharge options for federal student loans, including forgiveness for disability, death, school closure, false certification, unauthorized loans, unpaid refunds, defense to repayment, and bankruptcy. The NDSL program, established in response to the Soviet Union's Sputnik launch in 1957, was one of the earliest loan forgiveness programs. Congress funded education improvements to address national security concerns. The NDSL program was established by Congress to address national security concerns and provide low-interest loans to college students. It included a student loan forgiveness component aimed at increasing the number and quality of teachers in U.S. schools. Eligible students teaching full-time in public schools could have up to half of their student loans cancelled. Over time, the forgiveness provisions were expanded to include teachers in schools with low-income or disabled students, as well as individuals serving in Head Start programs or areas of hostility. The NDSL program, established to provide low-interest loans to college students, included a student loan forgiveness component for teachers in public schools. Loan forgiveness benefits were expanded to include teachers in schools with low-income or disabled students, individuals in Head Start programs, and those in areas of hostility. Borrowers could have a portion of their loans canceled based on years of public service completed. The Health Professions Student Loan Program (HPSLP) in 1965 incorporated a loan forgiveness component for borrowers practicing medicine in high-need areas. Over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs currently exist, providing policymakers with general information on their purpose and design. Comprehensive details can be found in federal statutes, regulations, and agency guidance. Currently, there are over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized under federal law. These programs aim to provide relief to borrowers through various means such as specified service, employment in certain professions, serving in specific locations, or repaying loans based on income-driven plans. Each program has unique characteristics, eligibility criteria, benefit amounts, and funding sources. The overview identifies parameters to broadly characterize the programs. The overview identifies parameters to broadly characterize various federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Borrowers may qualify for benefits by working in specific functions, professions, or locations for a specified period, or by repaying loans based on income-driven plans. At the end of the term, some or all of the qualifying student loan debt is forgiven or repaid. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer benefits to borrowers who meet specific criteria, such as working in certain fields or repaying loans based on income. Qualifying student loan debt is forgiven or repaid at the end of a specified term, relieving the individual of repayment responsibility. Loan forgiveness programs are entitlements outlined in loan documents, while loan repayment programs are discretionary and subject to fund availability. Loan forgiveness benefits are outlined in loan documents and are entitlements for qualified borrowers. These benefits are funded through mandatory appropriations and fall under federal student loan subsidy costs. There are two main categories of loan forgiveness: for public service employment and following income-driven repayment. Loan repayment programs offer debt relief for specific service in fields, professions, or locations, with the entity either repaying the borrower's debt directly or providing funding to another entity. Loan repayment programs provide debt relief by directly repaying some or all of a qualified borrower's student loan debt or funding a separate entity to do so. These programs are separate from federal student loan programs and are designed to address employment needs or shortages, recruit and retain qualified employees, and serve as additional compensation. Availability of loan repayment benefits is limited and discretionary, subject to fund appropriations. The types of debt relief programs examined in this report have varying tax implications. Forgiveness under employment-focused programs is tax-exempt, while forgiveness under income-driven repayment or public service employment may incur federal income tax liability. Borrowers are responsible for paying the tax associated with the latter programs. The three categories of debt relief programs examined in this report include loan forgiveness for public service employment, loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment, and loan repayment for public service employment. Eligible loans for federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs include federal student loans made through Title IV of the Higher Education Act, student loans made through Title VII and Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act, and private education loans. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) oversees federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs, which include federal student loans made through HEA or PHSA programs. Some programs also accept private education loans. Federal student loans were previously made through the Direct Loan program, the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, and the Federal Perkins Loan program. Federal student loans were previously made through the Direct Loan program, the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, and the Federal Perkins Loan program. Loans in the Direct Loan program are made by the government with federal capital, while loans in the FFEL program were made by nonfederal lenders. Differences between the two programs included the availability of loan forgiveness benefits. The Perkins Loan program involved loans made by institutions of higher education with a mix of federal and institutional capital. Institutions acted as lenders, responsible for loan origination, servicing, and processing loan cancelation benefits. Direct Subsidized Loans in the Direct Loan program were available to undergraduate students with financial need, with the government subsidizing interest charges while enrolled at least half-time. Direct Subsidized Loans are available to undergraduate students with financial need, with the government subsidizing interest charges while enrolled at least half-time. Borrowing limits restrict the amounts that students may borrow, and in FY2017, 6.2 million Direct Subsidized Loans were made. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students without the need to demonstrate financial need. Loan proceeds can be used to finance portions of a student's cost of attendance, with the borrower responsible for paying all accrued interest. Direct PLUS Loans are available to parents of undergraduate students and graduate/professional students. These non-need-based loans can cover expenses not met by the student's EFC. Borrowing limits are not explicitly defined, but are based on the COA minus estimated financial assistance. In FY2017, 8.1 million Direct Unsubsidized Loans totaling $49.8 billion were issued. In FY2017, Direct PLUS Loans totaling $12.5 billion were made to parents of undergraduate students and $9.9 billion to graduate and professional students. Direct Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine federal student loans into a single loan. In FY2017, Direct Consolidation Loans totaling $48.8 billion were made, allowing borrowers to combine different types of federal student loans into a single fixed-rate loan based on the weighted average interest rate of the loans being consolidated. Perkins Loans were also available to undergraduate and graduate students. In FY2017, Perkins Loans were available to undergraduate and graduate students with a fixed interest rate of 5% per year. Approximately 253,000 Perkins Loans, totaling $782.23 million, were made. HRSA offers low-interest loans to health professions students, making 20,849 loans for a total of $162.8 million in academic year 2016-2017. The HRSA offers low-interest loans to health professions students in various fields such as dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, veterinary medicine, allopathic, and osteopathic medicine. Loan recipients must be U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents and financially needy. Recipients of primary care loans must complete a residency in a primary care field and practice in that field for 10 years. The HRSA offers low-interest loans to health professions students in various fields such as dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, veterinary medicine, allopathic, and osteopathic medicine. Recipients must be U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents and financially needy. Primary care loan recipients must complete a residency in a primary care field and practice for 10 years. Loan recipients failing to meet service requirements must repay loans at a higher interest rate. For the academic year 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making 252 loans totaling $17.8 million for primary care fields and 1,619 loans totaling $21.7 million for other health professions. The HRSA offers low-interest loans to health professions students in various fields. For academic year 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making loans totaling $21.7 million for nursing studies leading to degrees. Nursing schools administer the program for citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents. Additionally, loans are provided to registered nurses pursuing graduate studies to become qualified nursing school faculty. Nursing schools select participants for loans and may offer loan forgiveness. The Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL) program, authorized in Title VII, Part A-I of the PHSA, no longer makes new loans. For academic year 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making 1,998 loans totaling $27.3 million. The HEAL program, authorized in Title VII, Part A-I of the PHSA, no longer makes new loans but continues to administer outstanding loans for various health professions. Borrowers of HEAL program loans are still responsible for making payments. Additionally, student loans are also made by nonfederal entities such as private financial institutions and state-supported loan programs. Private student loans are made by nonfederal entities like banks, credit unions, and state-supported programs. These loans have specific terms set by the lender. While not part of federal programs, some federal repayment programs offer benefits to borrowers. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs aim to provide debt relief to eligible borrowers, each with unique features. The report outlines categories of debt relief programs, including loan forgiveness and repayment programs, with specific qualifying criteria and program components. It presents the primary categories of debt relief programs in order of potential availability to borrowers, starting with loan forgiveness entitlement programs. Loan forgiveness entitlement programs are presented first, followed by programs providing loan forgiveness for public service and income-driven repayment plans. Programs offering loan repayment for public service or employment needs are then discussed, with a focus on government employment. These programs provide debt relief to qualified borrowers in specific occupations or public service roles. The curr_chunk discusses loan forgiveness programs for qualified borrowers in specific occupations or public service roles, with benefits written into federal student loan terms. Table 1 summarizes various forgiveness programs based on employer and occupation requirements, income eligibility, and program status. The curr_chunk highlights borrower eligibility based on economic circumstances during repayment for loan forgiveness programs. Programs vary in size and require specific criteria such as completing service or entering certain occupations. These programs are available to teachers and individuals in public service roles, including law enforcement and government agencies. Loan forgiveness programs, such as Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness, are available to individuals employed in public service, including government agencies and certain nonprofits. Borrowers must serve for a minimum period, with service commitments lasting between 1 to 10 years. These programs provide debt relief to borrowers who repay their federal student loans based on their income for an extended period. These benefits are entitlements for qualified borrowers and are distinct from programs targeting public service employment. Table 2 summarizes various loan forgiveness programs available to borrowers following income-driven repayment. Unlike programs targeting public service employment, these programs are widely available to qualified borrowers based on income qualifications. The table organizes programs by the date borrowers became eligible, showing that they are open-ended and not limited by specific service commitments. Loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment is available to a potentially unlimited number of borrowers who meet income-driven qualifications. There are no employer-specific or occupational requirements for these programs. Borrowers must make monthly payments towards their federal student loans for 20-25 years, capped at a percentage of their discretionary income. At the end of the repayment period, the remaining loan balance is forgiven. Loan repayment for public service employment offers debt relief benefits to specific occupations or employers in public service. Loan repayment for public service employment provides debt relief benefits to borrowers employed in specific occupations or employers in public service. These programs are not entitlements and are subject to limited availability and program funds. Loan forgiveness programs following income-driven repayment are available to a potentially unlimited number of borrowers based on income qualifications. Loan repayment programs for public service employment offer debt relief benefits to qualified borrowers. These programs are smaller in scale compared to loan forgiveness programs and are subject to funding availability. Table 3 summarizes various repayment programs based on employment and occupational requirements, as well as economic circumstances. Programs are organized by operational status and administering department or agency. Unlike loan forgiveness programs, these programs do not have a specific scope limitation. Table 3 displays 19 loan repayment programs targeting various employment needs, with a focus on health-related occupations. These programs aim to address health care provider shortages, health care faculty needs, legal occupations, and large animal veterinarians providing emergency services. Borrowers are not required to fulfill service obligations with a single employer in most programs. Loan repayment programs for employment needs include legal occupations and large animal veterinarians providing emergency services. Borrowers may work for multiple employers within the same class, with some programs requiring service in underserved rural or disadvantaged areas. Service commitments typically last between one and five years. Federal government employee loan repayment programs are narrowly targeted to meet agency-specific needs and are potentially smaller in scale compared to other forgiveness programs. The Office of Personnel Management reports on various loan repayment programs offered by federal agencies for recruiting and retaining qualified employees. The programs may have specific eligibility criteria based on employment, occupation, and economic circumstances. The table summarizes the operational status of each program. Table 4 displays federal agencies' loan repayment programs for recruiting and retaining qualified employees, with 25 programs outlined. 8 programs target Armed Forces members, while others vary in availability to agency employees based on occupation. Loan repayment programs at federal agencies vary in availability to employees based on specific occupations or fields designated as hard-to-fill. Borrowers must serve for a minimum period of one to five years, with eligibility often based on economic circumstances. Some programs consider economic circumstances at the time of borrowing, while others use it as a criterion for benefits qualification. Loan repayment programs vary in availability based on specific occupations or fields designated as hard-to-fill. Borrowers must serve for a minimum period, with eligibility often based on economic circumstances. Individuals may qualify for benefits based on their economic circumstances at the time of borrowing or during the repayment period. Borrowers from disadvantaged backgrounds or with high expected monthly loan payments relative to income may be eligible for program benefits. Programs provide loan forgiveness or repayment benefits based on specific criteria, with three primary methods used to determine eligibility and timing of benefits. Several loan repayment programs offer benefits to qualified borrowers, including forgiveness of the outstanding balance, repayment of a flat dollar amount, or a percentage of the outstanding loan. Borrowers may be required to make a certain number of payments before the remaining balance is forgiven. Employers may also provide repayment benefits in the form of a flat dollar amount or varying flat rates based on the type of service performed. Some programs pay a percentage of the borrower's outstanding loans. Many loan forgiveness and repayment programs have restrictions, such as ineligibility for defaulted loans and limitations on receiving benefits from multiple programs. Some programs require U.S. citizenship and may penalize borrowers for not completing their service term. In some loan forgiveness and repayment programs, borrowers must be U.S. citizens to qualify for benefits. Financial penalties may apply if the service term is not completed. Restrictions exist on benefiting from multiple programs for the same service. Some programs require participants to be U.S. citizens, nationals, or legal permanent residents. Some loan forgiveness and repayment programs may require participants to be U.S. citizens, nationals, or legal permanent residents. The availability of benefits is often restricted based on the type of loan obtained and the borrower's citizenship and immigration status. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits may also be limited for borrowers who have defaulted on their loans. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits may be restricted for borrowers who have defaulted on their loans. In some programs, eligibility for benefits on defaulted loans depends on certain characteristics of the loans. For example, in the Direct Loan Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program, borrowers may be ineligible for teacher loan forgiveness on defaulted loans, but forgiveness may be granted if satisfactory repayment arrangements are made. In the Perkins Loan Cancellation program, borrowers of defaulted loans may qualify for forgiveness under certain conditions. Recipients may be required to repay benefits if they fail to complete their service obligations. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits may include clawback provisions, requiring repayment if service obligations are not met. Participants may have to repay the unearned portion of benefits or the full amount plus interest. Some programs also impose punitive fees. Exceptions for repayment may apply in cases of disability or death. Forgiveness of student loan debt is considered taxable income. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits, including student loan debt, may be excluded from gross income for federal income taxation purposes under certain conditions. Authorizing statutes may specify exclusion for certain programs, while others may qualify under IRC Section 108(f) if loans were borrowed for education and contain cancellation terms for work in specific professions. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits for student loans may be excluded from gross income for federal income taxation purposes under certain conditions. The loan must have been borrowed for education and contain cancellation terms for work in specific professions. IRC Section 108(f)(4) provides exclusions for certain programs, and individuals may be responsible for paying income tax liability if requirements are not met. However, some loan forgiveness programs offer supplemental funds to offset tax liability. Several loan forgiveness and repayment programs provide supplemental funds to borrowers to offset tax liability from discharged loans. Recipients can avoid significant taxation by excluding benefits from gross income. However, debates arise on the effectiveness of these programs in encouraging borrowers to enter specific fields or government service. Key issues include whether individuals would enter these fields without loan benefits, if student debt is the main barrier, and if debt relief motivates participation. The effectiveness of loan forgiveness and repayment programs in influencing individuals' employment choices and the cost to the federal government are key considerations. Factors include whether individuals would enter certain fields without loan benefits, if student debt is the main barrier, and if debt relief motivates participation. The cost-benefit analysis of these programs is crucial in evaluating their impact. The influence of loan forgiveness and repayment programs on individuals' employment choices is a key consideration. Evaluating the impact of these programs involves comparing the career paths of recipients with those without access to such benefits. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) studied the career trajectories of loan repayment recipients in its Intramural Research Program (IRP) to encourage medical research participation. The NIH's loan repayment program aims to encourage individuals to pursue medical research careers. A study found that recipients were more likely to continue in medical research roles. However, other factors may also influence career choices, potentially making the program unnecessary for some individuals. The loan repayment program may not always be necessary as individuals may have entered certain fields or positions for reasons other than loan repayments. While the program can be an effective incentive in certain situations, such as when job opportunities are plentiful, it may not be needed when opportunities are limited. Some individuals may have taken a job even without loan repayment benefits, suggesting that the program may not always be essential. The NIH found that loan repayment programs can be a crucial recruitment and retention tool, especially for physicians with competing job offers. While federal agencies have seen success with these programs, funding cuts can undermine their effectiveness. Loan repayment programs can be crucial for recruitment and retention, especially for physicians with competing job offers. Funding cuts can undermine their effectiveness, as the availability of benefits may be uncertain. The amount of loan repayment awards may not be a sufficient incentive for individuals to enter or remain in certain professions. Success of these programs depends on meaningful financial benefits offsetting education costs, and program design elements like tax responsibilities can affect attractiveness. The Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program (GESLRP) requires participants to pay federal income taxes on the loan repayment amount, making the benefit less attractive. Short-term nature of programs may lead to turnover as individuals may leave after realizing the full benefit. Service obligations can result in shorter tenures in a position. Some researchers have found that service obligations can lead to shorter tenures in a position. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs assume student loan debt heavily influences career choices, but other factors also play a role. For example, the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program offers benefits to physicians in specific areas, but lower compensation is not the only deterrent for entering primary care medicine. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer benefits to physicians entering primary care in specific areas. Factors like lower compensation, preference for specialty focus, and debt levels influence career decisions. Despite financial incentives, the amount received may not bridge the overall lifetime earnings gap. One study estimated that over a lifetime, the average primary care physician earns $3.5 million less than a specialty physician, impacting job choices due to high levels of debt. Loan repayments cannot fully compensate for the lower lifetime earnings from entering primary care, leading individuals to opt for higher paying jobs to manage debt. Students with higher debt levels tend to choose higher salary jobs over lower-paying options like education-related fields, government agencies, or nonprofit organizations. Law school debt may not heavily influence career choices, with demographic factors playing a larger role. Loan repayment programs may not significantly impact career decisions for law school graduates. There is a concern that debt relief programs could lead students to rely more on student loans for education expenses. Loan repayment or forgiveness programs encourage students to finance more of their education with loans, potentially leading to over-borrowing. Monthly payments are based on income, not debt, and forgiveness is possible after a set period. This approach may make the size of the debt less relevant to borrowers and could incentivize excessive borrowing. Some argue that tying monthly payments to income and not debt may make the size of the debt irrelevant to borrowers and encourage over-borrowing. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs incur costs to the federal government, including loan subsidy costs, appropriated program costs, and administrative costs. Loan forgiveness programs are part of federal student loan programs, which include federal direct loans and federal loan guarantees. Loan subsidy costs for these programs are funded through mandatory indefinite appropriations. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 requires that the budgetary costs of direct loans and loan guarantees be measured on a net present value basis. The federal budget reflects the unreimbursed costs of making or guaranteeing loans. The federal budget reflects the costs of providing loan subsidies, including the subsidy cost of loans and administrative costs. The loan subsidy cost is the estimated present value of cash flows from the government, less the cash flows to the government, discounted to the time of loan disbursement. Positive subsidy costs indicate a cost to the government, while negative costs mean the government earns a return. Loan forgiveness benefits alter expected cash flows of loan programs. The availability of loan forgiveness benefits in direct loan or guaranteed loan programs increases loan subsidy costs. For example, Stafford Loan Forgiveness to Teachers discharges a portion of borrowers' loan balance, reducing cash flows to the government. This results in an increase in loan subsidy costs. Loan forgiveness benefits are accounted for in the fiscal year when the loan was made, such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The estimated cost of loan forgiveness benefits is included in loan subsidy costs for the fiscal year when the loan was made. Programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness and income-based repayment plans fund borrower benefits through appropriations for the year. Funding for these programs may be discretionary or mandatory, with benefits available only when funds are allocated. Funding for loan forgiveness programs can be discretionary or mandatory, with benefits available based on appropriations. Examples include the GESLR, JRJ, and NHSCLRP programs. Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits are unique, specified in loan terms, and granted by the loan institution. Unlike federal credit programs, Perkins Loans do not operate under federal credit programs. The Perkins Loan program offers loan forgiveness to eligible borrowers, but it is not a federal credit program. Institutions absorb the costs of loan cancellation without reimbursement from the government. Funding for Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits was last appropriated in FY2009, but qualified borrowers continue to have their loans canceled. The Education Department keeps a record of reimbursement amounts for institutions if funding is allocated. The costs of administering loan forgiveness and repayment programs are funded separately from programmatic costs. Administrative costs for federal credit programs are accounted for separately and funded through annual appropriations. Limited information is available on the actual costs to the government of these programs. Limited information is available on the actual costs to the government of loan forgiveness and loan repayment programs. Cost estimates for loan forgiveness programs are often based on projected future benefits, while data on the amount of debt relief provided and the number of recipients is available for some programs. In Appendix A, the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program estimated a cost of $1.5 billion over FY2008-FY2012, with $1.2 billion linked to loans before FY2008. Estimates for REPAYE plan indicated 6 million eligible borrowers from 1994-2025, costing $15.4 billion. PAYE plan estimated a $2.1 billion cost over 10 years. The availability of the REPAYE plan would cost approximately $15.4 billion, with an estimated 2 million borrowers choosing to enroll. The Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) repayment plan was estimated to cost $2.1 billion over 10 years, with approximately 1.67 million borrowers opting for this plan. Around 400,000 borrowers were projected to receive loan forgiveness through public service loan forgiveness or after 20 years of repayment under the PAYE plan. The average original loan balance of borrowers receiving forgiveness was estimated to be $39,500, with an average of $41,000 in loans forgiven due to many borrowers paying only interest. Additionally, approximately 1 million borrowers from the 2014-2021 cohorts were expected to choose the IBR plan, but forgiveness estimations were not provided. The Department of Education estimated that a significant number of borrowers would choose income-driven repayment plans, such as IBR and PAYE, leading to potential loan forgiveness benefits. Estimates were provided for the number of borrowers expected to enroll in these plans and the projected amount of loan forgiveness. However, due to the newness of these forgiveness programs and the variability in borrower repayment behavior, it is challenging to accurately predict the total amount of loan forgiveness that may occur. Congress may need to evaluate the effectiveness of existing federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Questions may arise regarding the availability of multiple programs offering similar benefits, the potential for borrowers to receive financial windfalls, and the overall impact of these programs. Overlapping programs with similar goals and activities could lead to duplication of benefits for borrowers. Student loan forgiveness and repayment programs may overlap if they have the same goals and activities. This can result in recipients receiving benefits from multiple programs for the same service. Without restrictions, individuals could qualify for benefits under multiple programs, potentially leading to duplication of benefits. Without limitations, recipients may receive benefits from multiple sources for the same service. For example, an individual working in a federal agency could qualify for loan repayment benefits under the GESLRP and loan forgiveness under the PSLF. This could result in receiving benefits from two programs for the same government service. Additionally, overlapping programs may serve the same group of individuals, leading to potential duplication of benefits. The federal government may be funding administrative costs for two separate programs, the Nursing Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) and the Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP), which serve the same group of individuals. Both programs aim to increase the number of qualified nursing faculty and are administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. The NFLRP grants money to nursing schools to establish their own loan repayment programs, creating an administrative burden on the HRSA. Congress may need to consider combining, altering, or abolishing these programs to avoid duplication of benefits. The HRSA administers both the NELRP and NFLRP, which target the same group for loan forgiveness. Congress may need to consider combining or abolishing programs to prevent duplication of benefits. Loan forgiveness programs aim to incentivize individuals to enter specific fields, but some may receive windfalls. Certain programs have no limits on forgiveness amounts, like the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Some concerns have been raised about the large amounts that individuals may borrow under certain loan forgiveness programs, particularly non-need-based PLUS Loans for graduate and professional students. Congress may need to consider establishing limits on forgiven amounts to prevent individuals from borrowing excessively with the expectation of loan forgiveness. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs may not always immediately place individuals in specified occupations or attract highly skilled employees if they are already seeking employment in those fields. However, these programs can be somewhat effective in creating career pipelines or retaining skilled employees. To improve effectiveness, Congress could implement more specific funding controls or direct fund usage through appropriations measures. Limited data is available on federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs, making it difficult to assess their effectiveness. For example, in the PSLF program, borrowers must work in public service for 10 years before becoming eligible for forgiveness benefits. Data on actual benefits received is scarce due to the program's recent implementation. Future participation projections are also challenging. Limited data is available on federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs, such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. Borrowers first became eligible for forgiveness benefits on October 1, 2017, but little is known about the actual forgiveness benefits received. Borrowers may not be required to document their employment in public service jobs, making it difficult to project future participation. Loan forgiveness is also available for borrowers who repay according to income-driven repayment plans for extended periods, but longitudinal data on participants is limited. Longitudinal data collection for program administration is limited, making it challenging to assess program effects and design changes. There is variation in types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for debt relief across different programs. Some programs have specific limitations on loan types and amounts eligible for relief, while others offer more flexibility. Improved data collection and reporting may be necessary to determine program effects and effectiveness. Some student loan forgiveness and repayment programs have specific limitations on eligible loan types and amounts, while others offer more flexibility. Concerns have been raised about the potential for over-borrowing due to the availability of these programs. Consideration should be given to imposing additional limitations on the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for forgiveness and repayment. Some federal agencies offer student loan repayment programs with varying selection criteria. In 2016, 34 agencies provided loan repayment benefits under the GESLRP, requiring participants to serve for at least three years. Concerns have been raised about over-borrowing and the need for limitations on qualifying loan types and amounts for forgiveness and repayment. Some federal agencies offer loan repayment benefits under the GESLRP, with participants required to serve for at least three years. Agencies have flexibility in determining eligibility criteria, with variations in program requirements making it challenging for participants to understand. The Department of Defense uses the program to recruit employees in specific fields, while the Department of State provides benefits to individuals with a loan balance of at least $5,000. The GESLRP offers loan repayment benefits with varying eligibility criteria across different government agencies, making it difficult for participants to understand. Appendix A provides program-specific details for each agency, including statutory citations, program purpose, types of eligible loans, qualifying service requirements, benefit amounts, and eligibility restrictions. The program descriptions in this report include details such as qualifying service requirements, maximum benefit amounts, eligibility restrictions, post-benefit requirements, tax treatment, budget classification, appropriations from FY2013-FY2017, loan discharges, beneficiaries, and additional resources. The information is sourced from statutes, regulations, and authoritative sources, with abbreviations like FFEL used throughout. The appendix provides information on various federal loan forgiveness programs for public service employment, including details on qualifying service requirements, maximum benefit amounts, eligibility restrictions, and post-benefit requirements. The programs are entitlements written into the terms of federal student loans and are potentially available to an open-ended number of qualified borrowers. Abbreviations like FFEL are used throughout the appendix. The Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program offers student loan forgiveness for borrowers who have made 120 full monthly payments while employed full-time in public service. Eligible loan types include Subsidized Loans, Unsubsidized Loans, Graduate PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans. The Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program offers student loan forgiveness for borrowers employed full-time in public service. Eligible loan types include Subsidized Loans, Unsubsidized Loans, Graduate PLUS Loans, and Consolidation Loans. Borrowers must work in public service organizations or AmeriCorps/Peace Corps. Maximum benefit amount varies based on public service provided. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program offers loan forgiveness for borrowers in public service. Eligible loans include Subsidized, Unsubsidized, Graduate PLUS, and Consolidation Loans. Borrowers must make 120 qualifying monthly payments on time under specific repayment plans while employed full-time in public service. The maximum forgiveness amount is the remaining loan balance after 120 payments. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program requires borrowers to make 120 qualifying monthly payments while employed full-time in public service. Borrowers must not be in default, and religious activities do not count as public service. Loan forgiveness amount is excluded from gross income, and the program is mandatory with no specific funding allocated. Borrowers first became eligible for loan forgiveness in October 2017. The Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program encourages individuals to enter and continue in the teaching profession by offering loan repayment benefits for serving as a full-time teacher for at least five consecutive academic years in a designated public nonprofit school. Eligible loan types include Subsidized Loans, Unsubsidized Loans, and Consolidation Loans used to repay a Subsidized or Unsubsidized Loan. To qualify for loan repayment benefits, a borrower must serve as a full-time teacher for at least five consecutive academic years in a designated public nonprofit school, private nonprofit school, or public education service agency (ESA) serving low-income families. Maximum benefit amount is up to $5,000, or up to $17,500 for special education, math, or science teachers. Loan payments may be deferred during the service period. Repayment benefits are available to borrowers with no outstanding federal loan balance. Loan forgiveness and repayment benefits are available for special education teachers and secondary school teachers of mathematics or science who serve for at least five consecutive academic years in designated schools. Borrowers must have no outstanding balance on federal student loans made through Title IV of the HEA. Loan forgiveness is not provided for the same service used to qualify for other forgiveness programs. The forgiven amount is excluded from gross income. Funding for loan forgiveness is mandatory. Loan amounts forgiven for FFEL program loans were $179.6 million in FY2013, $177.6 million in FY2014, and $154.8 million in FY2015.
