    "content": "President Trump proposes to resume development of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada, with a budget request of $120 million for the Department of Energy and $47.7 million for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in FY2019. The House passed a bill with $100 million more funding for Yucca Mountain, but the Senate version does not include any funding for the project. The Senate version of the bill passed in June 25, 2018, does not include funding for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. Despite the Obama Administration's decision to halt funding for the project in 2010, Yucca Mountain remains the sole candidate site for a national high-level radioactive waste repository under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended developing a new nuclear waste policy after the termination of the Yucca Mountain project. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended establishing a new nuclear waste policy, including a \"consent-based\" process for siting and regulating facilities. The DOE issued a strategy for managing and disposing of nuclear waste, calling for a new entity to develop storage and disposal sites. A pilot interim spent fuel storage facility was planned to open by 2021 under this strategy. The DOE called for a new nuclear waste management entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites, with plans for a pilot interim storage facility by 2021 and a larger-scale facility by 2025. A geologic disposal facility was set to open by 2048, following public meetings in 2016. The House approved a bill in 2018 to withdraw the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste storage. The Safety Evaluation Report (SER) was completed by the NRC in response to a court order for the Yucca Mountain repository licensing process. The SER concluded that the repository design met safety and environmental standards, but construction was not authorized until all requirements were met. Additional funding of $330 million was needed to complete the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on numerous issues raised by the State. The NRC Chairman requested $330 million for licensing activities for Yucca Mountain, including adjudicatory hearings on 300 issues. The Trump Administration is seeking $47.7 million for NRC licensing and $120 million for DOE to defend its license application. The Obama Administration proposed a separate underground repository for defense waste, reversing a 1985 decision to dispose of defense and civilian waste together. Moniz proposed a defense-only nuclear waste repository, stating it could be easier to site, license, and construct compared to a combined defense-civilian repository. The Department of Energy (DOE) suggested that a defense-only repository could proceed without amending the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. However, the repository would still need to be licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and comply with NWPA requirements. The disposal of defense waste could potentially begin around 22 years after a consent-based siting process. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) criticized DOE's analysis of a defense-only nuclear waste repository, stating it excluded major costs and had an overly optimistic schedule. Republican leaders criticized DOE's plan as a way to avoid progress on Yucca Mountain. Legislation has been introduced to block development of a defense-only repository until a licensing decision is made on Yucca Mountain. Provisions for consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel were included in the FY2019 appropriations bill. The FY2019 appropriations bill includes provisions for DOE to develop consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel. Priority for storage would be given to fuel from closed nuclear plant sites, and selection of a site would require consent from the governor, local jurisdictions, and affected Indian tribes. DOE must report to Congress on compensation for host jurisdictions and a mechanism to ensure timely transfer to a permanent repository. Similar provisions have been included in previous funding bills but were not enacted. The Senate Appropriations Committee has included provisions for a consent-based pilot program for interim storage of nuclear waste in previous Energy and Water Development funding bills. The House has not included similar provisions in its bills. A nuclear waste bill passed by the House authorizes the Department of Energy to store spent nuclear fuel at interim storage facilities with consent from the governor, local government, and affected Indian tribes. Legislation introduced in the 114th Congress aimed to implement recommendations for nuclear waste storage but was not enacted. The Waste Administration Act of 2015 (S. 854) was introduced but not enacted. It aimed to establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration for nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. Holtec International filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico. The facility would hold 10,000 canisters of spent fuel in below-grade concrete silos, developed in 20 phases over 20 years. Waste Control Specialists also filed an application for an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. The waste management company Waste Control Specialists (WCS) filed an application for an NRC license to develop an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. WCS later formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners and submitted a renewed application for the Texas facility. The proposed WCS spent fuel storage facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX, with plans to complete construction as early as 2022. Under the WCS proposal, DOE would take title to spent fuel at nuclear plant sites, ship it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. Under the Waste Control Specialists (WCS) proposal, the Department of Energy (DOE) would take title to spent fuel at nuclear plant sites, transport it to a storage facility in Texas, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. WCS argues that a privately developed storage facility would not be bound by restrictions that prohibit DOE from building a storage facility without progress on Yucca Mountain. Legislation has been introduced to authorize DOE to enter into contracts with non-federal interim storage facilities for spent fuel. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request included funding for Yucca Mountain, but it was not approved by Congress. For FY2019, the Administration is seeking $110 million for DOE to seek an NRC license for the repository, $47.7 million for NRC to consider the application, and $10 million for interim nuclear waste storage facilities. The total funding of $120 million would come from two appropriations accounts. The DOE funding for Yucca Mountain in FY2019 includes $90 million for Nuclear Waste Disposal and $30 million for Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal. The House passed a bill with $100 million more than requested for Yucca Mountain, while the Senate version had no funding for it. DOE stopped collecting nuclear waste fees in 2014 due to a court ruling, leading to uncertainty about the future of the nuclear waste program. The U.S. Court of Appeals ordered the DOE to stop collecting fees for nuclear waste disposal due to uncertainty about the program's future. The fees, totaling about $750 million per year, were deemed too vague to estimate accurately. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program and conduct a new cost assessment for determining the waste fee. NRC approved a final rule on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel. The NRC approved a final rule on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, replacing the earlier \"waste confidence\" rule. The court ruled that NRC must conduct an environmental review before issuing waste confidence findings. NRC halted licensing of new facilities generating nuclear waste after the rule was struck down. The NRC approved a final rule on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, replacing the earlier \"waste confidence\" rule. After the court struck down the waste confidence rule, NRC halted licensing of new facilities that would generate radioactive waste. In August 2014, NRC approved the continued storage rule, ending the suspension of final licensing decisions for new reactors and spent fuel storage facilities. A consolidated lawsuit challenging the rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals in June 2016. NRC proposed modifications to low-level waste disposal regulations in March 2015, with final revisions issued in September 2017. The NRC staff submitted final regulations for commission approval on September 15, 2016, with further revisions issued on September 8, 2017. The regulations aim to establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites to protect the general population. Nuclear waste disposal remains a significant issue, with the focus on Yucca Mountain, NV, as a repository for spent nuclear fuel and highly radioactive waste, despite strong opposition from the State of Nevada. The DOE is required to focus on Yucca Mountain, NV, as a deep underground repository for nuclear waste despite strong opposition from Nevada. The Obama Administration decided not to open the repository due to continued opposition, reversing previous plans for licensing. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain repository in FY2011, leading to the closure of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. President Trump aims to restart the licensing process, requesting $120 million in his FY2019 budget for Yucca Mountain and interim waste storage. Under the FY2019 request, DOE would receive $110 million for an NRC license for the Yucca Mountain repository, with an additional $47.7 million for NRC to consider the application. DOE also allocated $10 million for interim nuclear waste storage facilities. Despite the Obama Administration's attempt to withdraw the license application in 2010, the motion was denied by the ASLB, citing the NWPA's prohibition on withdrawal. The ASLB denied DOE's license withdrawal motion in 2010, ruling that the NWPA prohibits withdrawal until NRC determines the repository's acceptability. NRC commissioners upheld the decision in 2011, but halted further consideration due to budget constraints. Lawsuits led to a court ruling in 2013 that NRC must continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding is available. NRC directed staff to complete the Yucca Mountain safety evaluation report in 2013, with Volume 3 issued in 2014. NRC directed staff to complete the Yucca Mountain safety evaluation report in 2013, issuing Volume 3 in 2014, concluding the repository design would comply with safety standards for 1 million years. Additional funding of $330 million was needed to complete the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on 300 issues raised by Nevada. The Obama Administration halted the Yucca Mountain project in 2010 and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to develop alternative waste disposal strategies. The Commission recommended creating a new organization for developing nuclear waste repositories using a consent-based process. In response, the DOE issued a strategy in 2013 for managing and disposing of nuclear waste, calling for a new nuclear waste management entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal facilities. DOE issued a strategy in 2013 for managing nuclear waste, calling for a new entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. The strategy included plans for opening interim storage facilities by 2021 and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. Public input was sought to develop a consent-based siting process, leading to the issuance of a draft process in 2017. The DOE issued a draft consent-based siting process in January 2017, outlining five phases for community involvement in selecting storage and disposal sites. Phase 1 involves initiation and outreach, Phase 2 includes preliminary site assessment, Phase 3 detailed site assessment, and Phase 4 negotiation of a siting agreement. Phase 4 involves negotiating a siting agreement between the potential host community and the waste management agency, approved by all required parties. Phase 5 includes licensing, construction, operation, and closure, with estimated timelines of up to 5 years for an interim storage facility and 15 years for a repository. The Trump Administration's proposal includes funding for the Yucca Mountain project and interim storage planning. The nuclear power industry supports completion of NRC's licensing review of Yucca Mountain and alternative storage options. Geologic disposal of nuclear waste is considered safe, with a consensus on geologic isolation as the best long-term solution. The industry aims for a repository site to be operational within 20 years of a consolidated storage site opening. The National Research Council recommends geologic isolation as the safest option for high-level nuclear waste. However, proposed waste sites have faced challenges like water intrusion and earthquake vulnerability. Predicting waste site performance for 1 million years is uncertain, leading to public controversy over transportation routes. Research is ongoing to reduce waste volume and toxicity. The Obama Administration focused on long-term research to reduce nuclear waste volume and toxicity, moving away from reprocessing facilities. The Trump Administration's budget reduced funding for spent fuel reprocessing but emphasized a science-based approach. President Bush recommended the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste disposal, facing opposition from Nevada Governor Guinn's state veto. President Bush recommended the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste disposal, despite opposition from Nevada Governor Guinn's state veto. Other types of civilian radioactive waste, such as low-level waste, are currently disposed of in various states, with restrictions on acceptance from outside regions. The South Carolina site is only available to members of the Atlantic disposal compact. A Utah facility accepts class A low-level radioactive waste from across the U.S. Threats to close disposal facilities led to the authorization of regional compacts in 1985. The first new disposal site under the compact system opened in Texas in 2011. The Texas Legislature approved legislation to allow states outside the Texas Compact to use up to 30% of the facility's capacity. NWPA Section 302 authorized DOE to enter into contracts for nuclear waste disposal. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act required nuclear reactors to have a waste disposal contract with the DOE. DOE missed the deadline to dispose of nuclear waste, leading to lawsuits from utilities for additional storage costs. A settlement with PECO Energy allowed them to keep $80 million in waste fee revenues, but other utilities sued to block it. The court ruled that compensation for missed deadlines must come from sources other than the waste fund. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that compensation for missed nuclear waste disposal deadlines must come from sources other than the waste fund. Utilities have received $6.9 billion in compensation from the U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund for delay-related storage costs. Utilities submit reimbursement claims to the DOE annually, with unresolved claims going to arbitration. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims handles disputes over nuclear waste storage costs incurred by utilities due to delays in the waste disposal program. DOE estimates potential liabilities of up to $34.1 billion, including $6.9 billion already paid in settlements. Delays could result in environmental enforcement actions against DOE for noncompliant waste storage. The Department of Energy (DOE) faces potential fines for noncompliant waste storage, with disputes over nuclear waste fees leading to lawsuits by the nuclear industry and state utility regulators. The fees, totaling about $750 million per year, were suspended in 2014 after the Yucca Mountain project was halted. Petitions to end the fees were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2010. The nuclear industry and state utility regulators filed lawsuits against the DOE over nuclear waste fees totaling $750 million per year. DOE argued that the fees must continue to cover future disposal costs, but a court ruled in 2012 that a more thorough study of the fee was needed. The court noted that the fees were based on costs projected for the now terminated Yucca Mountain site. The court ordered DOE to stop collecting nuclear waste fees due to uncertainty in cost estimates and the termination of the Yucca Mountain site. DOE's assessment showed varying scenarios with costs exceeding revenues by $2 trillion to a surplus of $5 trillion, leading to the conclusion that fee adjustments were not immediately necessary. The court found DOE's waste plans too vague for accurate cost estimation, resulting in the suspension of fee collection. The court ordered DOE to stop collecting nuclear waste fees due to uncertainty in cost estimates and the termination of the Yucca Mountain site. DOE's $7 trillion uncertainty range for the program's cost was deemed too vague for accurate estimation. As a result, DOE ceased collecting fees from nuclear power generators in May 2014. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program and conduct a new fee adequacy assessment based on previous cost estimates until new information is available. Additionally, DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application \"with prejudice\" in 2010, stating that a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain was not a feasible option for long-term nuclear waste disposal. The Obama Administration decided to terminate the licensing process for a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain due to opposition from Nevada and a desire for a waste solution with greater public acceptance. The DOE's motion to withdraw the license application was denied by the ASLB in 2010, citing that the NWPA prohibits DOE from unilaterally terminating the Yucca Mountain review process. The DOE argued that it had the authority to discontinue the Yucca Mountain project and withdraw the license application, but the NRC commissioners upheld the denial of the withdrawal in a tie vote. NRC stopped further consideration of the application due to budget constraints, leading to a petition from plaintiffs, including Nye County, NV, to continue the licensing proceedings. The Court of Appeals ordered NRC to continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application due to budget constraints. NRC completed the Safety Evaluation Report and a supplemental EIS with available funds. Additional funding of $330 million is needed to complete the licensing review, with DOE estimating costs of $1.9 billion. The Trump Administration plans to resume consideration of the NRC license, pending before the ASLB. DOE's FY2018 budget request includes $110 million for this purpose. The Trump Administration proposes to resume consideration of the NRC license for the Yucca Mountain program, with estimated costs of $1.9 billion. DOE's FY2018 budget request includes $110 million for a program office and legal support, while NRC requests an additional $30 million to restart the adjudicatory proceeding. NRC must ensure safe disposal of nuclear waste before issuing licenses, with a 1979 court decision requiring a permanent repository by 2007-2009. The DOE initially planned to meet the NWPA repository deadline of 1998, but delays pushed the availability of a nuclear waste repository to the first quarter of the 21st century. The Yucca Mountain repository was further delayed and suspended by the Obama Administration, leading to a 2010 waste confidence rule allowing waste storage at reactor sites for at least 60 years after shutdown. Lawsuits were filed against this rule, resulting in a court ruling in 2012 that NRC must conduct an environmental review under NEPA. The court ruled on June 8, 2012, that NRC must conduct an environmental review of the Waste Confidence Decision under NEPA. Two major flaws were found in NRC's rulemaking process: failure to calculate environmental effects of not securing permanent storage and inadequate examination of future dangers and consequences of storing spent fuel on-site for sixty years after a plant's license expires. NRC approved a final rule on August 26, 2014, for continued storage of spent nuclear fuel to replace the struck-down waste confidence rule. The new rule describes potential environmental effects of various periods of waste storage. The new continued storage rule, issued in response to a court requirement for NEPA review, analyzed the environmental effects of three potential time periods of storage before a permanent repository would become available. The rule assumed active management of spent fuel with minimal environmental impact in almost all categories. The environmental impact of three potential time periods of storage before a permanent repository was judged to be minimal. A consolidated lawsuit to overturn NRC's storage rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The termination of work on the Yucca Mountain repository by the Obama Administration sparked congressional controversy. President Trump's proposal to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process has changed the dynamics of the nuclear waste debate in Congress. The 115th Congress has not provided new funding for Yucca Mountain. In FY2018 and FY2019, House approved funds for Yucca Mountain project, while Senate did not. Concerns about nuclear waste were raised during confirmation hearing for former Texas Governor Rick Perry. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada expressed opposition to Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste site. Governor Perry and Senator Masto oppose Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste site. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 aims to increase the capacity limit at Yucca Mountain and authorize DOE to store spent fuel at an interim storage facility. The House-passed bill includes changes from the Energy and Commerce Committee's version, eliminating mandatory funding provisions. The House-passed bill in 2017 made substantial changes to H.R. 3053, including the elimination of mandatory funding provisions for the Nuclear Waste Fund. It proposed using Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel before disposal in a permanent repository. DOE would be authorized to site, construct, and operate MRS facilities for this purpose. The House-passed bill in 2017 proposed using Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. The bill would authorize the Secretary of Energy to site, construct, and operate MRS facilities, either federally or through agreements with nonfederal entities. Nonfederal MRS facilities would require approval from NRC, state governors, local governments, and Indian tribes. Priority would be given to nonfederal MRS facilities, unless a federal facility could be built more quickly and cost-effectively. The House-passed bill in 2017 proposed using Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. The bill would authorize the Secretary of Energy to site, construct, and operate MRS facilities, either federally or through agreements with nonfederal entities. Spent fuel currently stored at closed reactors would have priority for shipment to an MRS. Appropriations for an MRS would be authorized from the general fund rather than the Nuclear Waste Fund. The proposed Yucca Mountain repository would be located on federal land in Nevada. The proposed Yucca Mountain repository on federal land in Nevada would be permanently withdrawn for nuclear waste storage. The site transfer to the Secretary of Energy would allow for the development of a permanent underground repository. The repository would not be subject to certain waste disposal regulations, and a construction authorization decision would be required within 30 months. Before the decision, infrastructure activities like site preparation and rail line construction could be conducted. The Yucca Mountain repository would require authorization within 30 months after enactment. Before construction authorization, DOE could conduct infrastructure activities at the site. The limit on spent nuclear fuel disposal would increase to 110,000 metric tons. Planning a separate repository for defense-related waste is prohibited until NRC decides on Yucca Mountain. Collection of nuclear waste fees would resume after NRC's decision, with limitations on total collections. Fees collected would offset costs. The bill proposes to allocate 90% of DOE nuclear waste program appropriations annually, with any uncollected fees to be paid when deemed necessary. Fees collected post-enactment would offset program appropriations, ensuring a net zero impact on discretionary funding allocations. The Nuclear Waste Fund balance would remain available without offsets, and there would be no effect on direct spending or mandatory offsets under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act. Additionally, the Secretary of Energy could enter a benefits agreement with Nevada for annual payments before fuel receipt at Yucca Mountain. The bill proposes increased annual payments to Nevada and local governments for hosting the Yucca Mountain repository. The Secretary of Energy can enter benefits agreements with Nevada and local governments, with payments subject to congressional appropriation. The Director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management would oversee these functions and serve up to two five-year terms. The OCRWM Director, established by NWPA, would oversee nuclear waste management functions and serve up to two five-year terms. Senator Heller and Representative Titus introduced the Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act, requiring consent from State and local governments before using funds for a repository. Representative Joe Wilson introduced the Sensible Nuclear Act. The legislation introduced by Representative Joe Wilson, known as the Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act (H.R. 433), aims to implement a consent-based approach for siting nuclear waste repositories. It would prevent the Department of Energy (DOE) from developing a repository for defense nuclear waste until the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issues a final decision on the Yucca Mountain repository. Additionally, there are proposals in Texas and New Mexico for private-sector interim storage facilities for commercial spent nuclear fuel, with a bill (H.R. 474) introduced to authorize DOE to enter into contracts with these facilities. The Storage Act of 2017, similar to previous legislation, would have DOE take title to spent nuclear fuel for private storage. Annual interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund could be used by DOE for storage costs. Other related bills include the Removing Nuclear Waste from our Communities Act and legislation to assist communities with stored nuclear waste. Senator Duckworth and Representative Schneider introduced bills (S. 1903 and H.R. 3970) to provide assistance to communities with stored spent fuel at closed reactor sites. The bills would offer financial support, revive a tax credit for homebuyers in affected areas, and establish a task force to streamline the process for communities seeking government aid. Additionally, the bills would require the DOE to explore alternative options for hosting decommissioned nuclear waste and study potential economic uses for closed reactor sites. Various concerns have been raised in Congress regarding the risks of spent fuel storage pools, leading to proposals like the Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018 (H.R. 4891) to transfer spent fuel to safer storage casks. In the 115th Congress, the Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018 (H.R. 4891) was introduced to reduce risks posed by spent fuel storage pools in nuclear power plants. The bill requires nuclear power plants to develop NRC-approved plans for transferring spent fuel to dry storage facilities within seven years. Emergency planning zones would be expanded, and NRC could use interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund to provide grants for this purpose. Similar legislation was introduced in previous Congresses. In the 114th Congress, legislation similar to H.R. 4891 was introduced to establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) for nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. The bill aimed to open a pilot storage facility by 2021 for priority waste and a permanent repository by 2048, with consent required from affected state, local, and tribal governments. The Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) was proposed to establish storage and disposal facilities for nuclear waste. A pilot storage facility for priority waste was to open by 2021, with a permanent repository by 2048. NWA could issue requests for proposals for nonpriority waste storage facilities only after funds were obligated for a permanent repository. Financial compensation and incentives were to be offered for hosting facilities, with preference given to sites with both storage and a repository. Defense waste could be placed in defense-only facilities, and nuclear waste fees collected would be held in a fund. President Obama authorized the pursuit of a defense-only repository for nuclear waste in 2015 under S. 854. The bill established a Working Capital Fund for nuclear waste fees collected post-enactment. The disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the first repository under NWPA would have been repealed. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 1240 in 2013, receiving positive feedback from Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz and NARUC Electricity Committee Chairman David C. Boyd. Boyd emphasized the need for continued licensing action on the Yucca Mountain repository. The bill S. 1240 was considered a step in the right direction but was criticized for not requiring continued licensing action on the Yucca Mountain repository. Opposition to the bill included concerns about opening temporary waste storage facilities without progress on a permanent repository and inadequate state authority to regulate repository safety. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved initial funding for DOE to develop a pilot spent fuel interim storage facility in the FY2017 Energy and Water bill. The Senate bill included an authorization and $10.0 million for DOE to develop a consent-based waste storage pilot facility. The debate on nuclear waste policy was influenced by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011 disabled cooling systems at the plant's spent fuel pools, raising concerns about fuel damage and radioactive releases. A bill introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer in 2015 aimed to maintain safety at closed reactors until spent fuel was moved to dry storage, but was not enacted. NRC's study in 2013 suggested that expedited transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage would provide limited safety benefits. Radioactive waste varies in radioactivity levels and decay rates, with some types requiring long-term storage. Radioactive waste comes in varying levels of radioactivity and decay rates. Spent nuclear fuel is the most radioactive type, containing short-lived fission products and long-lived radionuclides like plutonium. High-level waste is highly radioactive residue from spent fuel reprocessing. High-level waste is highly radioactive residue created by spent fuel reprocessing, containing radioactive fission products and long-lived radionuclides like plutonium. Transuranic waste is low-activity waste with long-lived elements heavier than uranium, primarily plutonium, requiring radiation shielding for handling. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, is the nation's only permanent repository for TRU waste. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, is the nation's only permanent repository for TRU waste, which requires long-term isolation due to plutonium. Low-level waste, including uranium mill tailings, is also managed with specific NRC regulations for disposal. Uranium mill tailings are sand-like residues from uranium ore processing with low radioactivity but large volumes that can pose hazards like radon emissions and groundwater contamination. Mixed waste includes chemically hazardous waste with radioactive material, regulated by DOE or NRC for radioactive parts and EPA for nonradioactive elements. Spent nuclear fuel, removed from reactors after years of power production, is highly radioactive and thermally hot in the form of fuel assemblies containing metal-clad fuel rods. Spent nuclear fuel from reactors is highly radioactive and thermally hot, stored in fuel assemblies of metal-clad fuel rods. After nuclear fission, U-235 nuclei split into radioactive fission products, and some U-238 nuclei become radioactive plutonium. Spent fuel is stored in deep water pools near reactors to prevent overheating and protect workers from radiation. Older fuel is transferred to dry storage facilities after cooling for 7-10 years. The NRC requires spent fuel to cool for 7-10 years before transferring it to dry storage. Currently, there are 59 operating nuclear plant sites, 15 shutdown plant sites, and the Idaho National Laboratory storing spent fuel. The U.S. nuclear power industry discharges about 2,200 metric tons of spent fuel annually. A recent report estimates that 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel were stored at U.S. nuclear plants in 2017, exceeding the 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain. The amount of stored spent fuel will continue to grow until an interim storage facility or permanent repository is established. The DOE has 7,000 metric tons of spent fuel and high-level waste planned for disposal at a repository. The total amount of spent fuel from existing U.S. reactors that may need disposal is estimated to be between 105,000 to 130,000 metric tons. New storage capacity will be needed if waste cannot be accepted into the disposal system. Concerns about the vulnerability of stored spent fuel were heightened after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, raised concerns about the vulnerability of stored spent fuel. Reports by NRC and NAS highlighted the risk of overheating and potential fires in spent fuel pools. Recommendations include interspersing hotter and cooler fuel assemblies, installing spray systems, and transferring fuel to dry cask storage. The nuclear industry argues that there is ample time for alternative cooling measures. NRC's 2013 report found minor safety benefits in expedited actions. The nuclear industry argues that there is ample time for alternative cooling measures from pools to dry cask storage. NRC's 2013 report found minor safety benefits in expedited transfers. NRC task force recommended improved safety measures for spent fuel pools after the Fukushima accident. NRC also approved an order in 2012 for improved water-level monitoring equipment at spent fuel pools. About 5.1 million cubic feet of low-level waste with 57,179 curies of radioactivity was shipped to disposal sites in 2017. In 2017, 5.1 million cubic feet of low-level waste with 57,179 curies of radioactivity was shipped to commercial disposal sites. The volume and radioactivity of low-level waste can vary yearly based on nuclear decommissioning projects and cleanup activities. Low-level radioactive waste is classified into Class A, B, and C for handling and disposal, with most of the radioactivity found in classes B and C. The disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste is a federal responsibility, while states can develop disposal facilities for commercial low-level waste. The Yucca Mountain repository was halted by the Obama Administration after FY2010, despite being the sole candidate site for civilian highly radioactive waste. The Obama Administration halted development of the Yucca Mountain repository for highly radioactive waste disposal after FY2010. The Trump Administration is proposing to revive the program in FY2019 with funding for Yucca Mountain and interim nuclear waste storage. DOE issued an alternative waste management strategy in 2013 for spent fuel storage and a new repository. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for nuclear waste disposal. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for the permanent disposal of nuclear waste. DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management was created to carry out the program, funded by the Nuclear Waste Fund. The act was modified in 1987 to designate Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the only candidate site for a high-level waste repository. The 1987 amendments to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act designated Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the only candidate site for a permanent high-level waste repository. The amendments also authorized the construction of a monitored retrievable storage facility, but DOE cannot select a site for it until recommending the construction of the permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain project and transferred its functions to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future was established to develop a new waste management strategy. The Obama Administration terminated OCRWM in FY2010 and transferred its functions to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, emphasizing negotiations with affected states, tribes, and local governments for legally binding agreements. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a new waste management program with legally binding agreements on roles of affected parties. It suggested establishing a congressionally chartered federal corporation for this purpose. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended establishing a federal corporation for nuclear waste management, with changes to the Nuclear Waste Fund. The commission called for the development of interim storage facilities and a permanent disposal site to prevent interim sites from becoming permanent repositories. DOE issued a strategy for managing nuclear waste, including opening a pilot interim storage facility by 2021. The DOE strategy for managing nuclear waste includes opening a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021, followed by a larger-scale interim storage facility by 2025. A geologic disposal facility is planned to open by 2048, with a site to be selected by 2016 and studies completed by 2042. The strategy aims to prevent the storage facility from becoming a de facto repository and recommends not overly restricting progress on storage facilities. The DOE strategy aims to open a geologic disposal facility by 2048, with site selection by 2016 and completion of studies by 2042. The proposed waste program includes a \"consent based\" process for selecting storage and disposal sites, with details to be determined through consultation with Congress and interest groups. The Obama Administration's plan involves a new nuclear waste management entity, but specifics are not provided in the strategy. A bill introduced in the 114th Congress by Senator Alexander (S. 854) aimed to modify the waste program in line with the Obama Administration's strategy. Privatization of waste management services has also been proposed. DOE recommended testing a consent-based approach by developing a separate repository for defense and research waste, separate from civilian waste. This would expedite the process compared to a single repository for all highly radioactive waste. President Obama authorized the Department of Energy (DOE) to plan a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste from nuclear defense activities. However, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) criticized DOE's analysis of the defense-only repository in January 2017, leading to bills being introduced to delay the plan. President Obama also blocked DOE's preferred rail route to Yucca Mountain in 2015, but other potential routes were still available. Waste Control Specialists (WCS) applied for an NRC license in 2016 to develop a consolidated interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. The waste management company Waste Control Specialists (WCS) filed an application for an NRC license to develop a consolidated interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. WCS formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners and submitted a renewed application for the Texas facility. The proposed facility would be built at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX, with a total capacity of 40,000 metric tons of spent fuel in dry casks on concrete pads. The Department of Energy (DOE) would take title to the spent fuel, ship it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. The Waste Control Specialists (WCS) proposed a consolidated interim storage facility in Texas with a capacity of 40,000 metric tons of spent fuel. The Department of Energy (DOE) would take title to the spent fuel, ship it to the Texas site, and pay WCS for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. Additionally, a privately developed spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico was proposed by Holtec International near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The Eddy-Lea Energy Alliance (ELEA) is supported by local officials near the WIPP facility for additional waste facilities. New Mexico officials discussed conditions for accepting high-level waste at the site, with Governor Susana Martinez expressing support. However, state senators oppose an interim storage facility without a plan for permanent disposal. Public support in New Mexico may be affected by a 2014 radioactive release from WIPP. Interest in hosting nuclear waste sites has also been shown in Mississippi and Loving County, Texas. Interest in hosting nuclear waste sites has been expressed in Mississippi and Loving County, Texas. Legislation has been introduced to authorize the Department of Energy to enter into contracts with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities. The bill would allow DOE to take title to spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors delivered to private storage facilities, with funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund used for private interim storage. A bill including provisions for a private-sector MRS facility has been approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. A bill (H.R. 3053) approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee includes provisions for a private spent fuel storage facility. An earlier attempt to develop a storage facility on tribal land was rejected by the Department of the Interior in 2006 due to concerns about the risk of waste remaining indefinitely at the site. The Bureau of Land Management disapproved a proposed lease of tribal trust lands to PFS due to concerns about waste remaining indefinitely. A federal lawsuit was filed to overturn Interior decisions, leading to a court order for reconsideration. PFS later requested termination of its license. The Obama Administration attempted to redirect the nuclear waste program, but current law still focuses on Yucca Mountain. NWPA requires high-level waste repositories to be licensed by NRC according to EPA standards. EPA was required to write specific repository standards for Yucca Mountain under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The NRC licenses waste repositories according to EPA standards. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated specific standards for Yucca Mountain. NWPA requires compliance with DOE siting guidelines and NRC regulations for waste transportation. NRC's licensing requirements for Yucca Mountain include EPA standards and a performance confirmation program by DOE. The NRC issues a construction authorization for the Yucca Mountain repository, with specific standards required to meet EPA guidelines. The standards limit radiation dose to the public and are based on a National Academy of Sciences study. The EPA proposed radiation protection standards for the Yucca Mountain repository, limiting annual radiation doses for individuals and groundwater exposure for the first 10,000 years of operation. The nuclear industry criticized the proposal as overly strict, while environmental groups argued that the 10,000-year standard was too short considering projected radioactive releases would peak after about 400,000 years. The EPA issued final Yucca Mountain standards on June 6, 2001, including a 15 millirem overall exposure limit and a 4 millirem groundwater limit. Despite DOE's opposition, the site was found to meet the standards. NRC revised its regulations to align with EPA standards in September 2001. A U.S. Court of Appeals panel in July 2004 overturned the 10,000-year compliance period, citing inconsistency with the NAS study. The court found that the NAS study rejected a 10,000-year compliance period for Yucca Mountain regulations. EPA proposed new standards in 2005, keeping dose limits for the first 10,000 years but allowing a higher annual dose afterwards. Nevada officials criticized the proposed standards as too lenient. EPA's final rule in 2008 reduced the annual dose limit for the period of 10,000 through 1 million years to 100 millirems. The EPA issued a final rule in 2008 amending Yucca Mountain standards, reducing the annual dose limit to 100 millirems for the period of 10,000 through 1 million years. Compliance with post-10,000-year standard will be based on the mean of projected doses. NRC revised licensing regulations to align with EPA standards in 2009. DOE's FSEIS estimated a maximum mean annual individual dose after 10,000 years to be 2 millirems, a significant reduction from previous estimates. The FSEIS calculated peak doses at 150 millirems after 400,000 years, attributing the reduction to changes in DOE's computer model. The Fuel Cycle R&D Program conducts research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel, including Obama and Trump Administration budget allocations. The FY2018 budget included funding for nuclear waste processing but eliminated support for the integrated waste strategy. The FY2019 request includes funds for waste disposal R&D but none for integrated waste management. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget includes $63.9 million for generic nuclear waste R&D and $22.5 million for integrated waste management activities. The focus of the Fuel Cycle R&D program is on technology for reprocessing spent fuel. Nuclear utilities had paid fees to cover disposal costs until halted in 2014. The Waste Fund balance is $37.2 billion. $7.41 billion had been disbursed for the Yucca Mountain project before it was halted. DOE's most recent update on the Total System Life Cycle Cost was in 2008. The Waste Fund balance is $37.2 billion, with $7.41 billion disbursed for the Yucca Mountain project. States select disposal sites for low-level radioactive waste under the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. Most states have joined interstate compacts for disposal. Two commercial low-level waste disposal facilities remain operational in Barnwell, SC, and Hanford, WA. After 1992, waste disposal sites in Barnwell, SC, and Hanford, WA, began refusing waste from outside their regional compacts. A new disposal facility near Andrews, TX, opened in 2012 to handle Class A, B, and C low-level waste, primarily for Texas and Vermont. Up to 30% of its capacity may be used for waste from other states. Legislation for the Texas compact was signed in 1998, but a proposed site near Sierra Blanca, TX, was rejected. The Texas compact, originally including Maine and Vermont, was signed by President Clinton in 1998. A proposed disposal site near Sierra Blanca, TX, was rejected, leading to Maine's withdrawal. Texas Governor Rick Perry authorized the licensing of disposal facilities in 2003. Waste Control Specialists LLC filed an application to build the Andrews County disposal facility in 2004. The Barnwell, SC, disposal facility is currently accepting low-level waste from the Atlantic Compact. South Carolina can limit the use of the facility to compact members. South Carolina joined the Atlantic Compact in 2000, limiting Barnwell facility use to compact members. A state law phased out noncompact waste acceptance by 2008. South Carolina previously tried to open Barnwell to non-compact waste but was rejected. North Carolina withdrew from the Southeast Compact in 1999. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that North Carolina's withdrawal did not subject them to sanctions. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that North Carolina's withdrawal from the Southeast Compact did not lead to sanctions. Hanford, WA is the only other facility for low-level waste disposal. NRC regulates licensing for low-level waste facilities under the Atomic Energy Act, with transportation jointly regulated by NRC and the Department of Transportation. NRC proposed modifications to its disposal regulations in 2015, with final revisions issued in 2017. The NRC proposed modifications to its low-level waste disposal regulations in 2015, with final revisions issued in 2017. The regulations would establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites to ensure protection of the general population, including a 1,000-year compliance period for sites without significant quantities of long-lived radioactive material, and a 10,000-year compliance period for sites with significant quantities. A post-10,000-year analysis and protection for inadvertent intruders would also be required. The NRC's current low-level waste regulations were adopted in 1982, and disposal of radioactive waste is a key issue in the nuclear power debate. Spent fuel from nuclear power plants must be stored on-site indefinitely without a national waste management system, raising public concern near proposed reactor sites. Concern about spent fuel storage safety has increased since the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster in 2011. The federal government's nuclear waste disposal policy is focused on the Yucca Mountain site, but President Obama's actions to terminate the project have halted most activities in the DOE waste program. Congress is debating the project's future, with the NRC staff finding in 2014 that the Yucca Mountain site would meet NRC standards after the repository was filled and sealed. The Trump Administration's proposal to restart Yucca Mountain licensing and the retirement of Senator Reid may affect legislative action on nuclear waste in the 115th Congress. The request for $120 million in FY2018 for Yucca Mountain licensing and spent fuel storage was not approved, but the Administration has repeated the request for FY2019. Owners of existing reactors may seek damages from the federal government if disposal delays continue. The nuclear industry faces potential liabilities for waste program delays, with owners of existing reactors seeking damages from the federal government. The DOE estimates liabilities could reach $34.1 billion, including settlements with utilities like Exelon. Lack of a disposal system could impact licensing of new nuclear plants and compliance deadlines for defense waste disposal. The Blue Ribbon Commission suggested options like centralized interim storage and reprocessing to address delays. The Blue Ribbon Commission addressed problems caused by nuclear waste disposal delays in its final report in January 2012. Major options include centralized interim storage, continued storage at existing nuclear sites, reprocessing, waste treatment technology, and development of alternative repository sites. The commission recommended establishing a congressionally chartered corporation for siting new waste storage and disposal facilities. The \"consent based\" nuclear waste siting process has attracted serious interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas. The success of any renewed \"consent based\" siting effort for nuclear waste disposal is likely to depend on the cooperation of states. Previous voluntary siting efforts faced challenges from potential host states. Serious interest has been shown by localities in New Mexico and Texas.
