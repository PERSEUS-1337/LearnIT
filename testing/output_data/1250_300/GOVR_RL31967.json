    "content": "The statutory debt limit applies to federal debt held by the public and government accounts, including trust funds like Social Security. Changes in debt held by the public are determined by government surpluses or deficits. Increases or decreases in debt held by government accounts result from net financial flows. Since the late 1950s, the federal government has mostly increased borrowing from the public, except for a few years. The federal government has consistently increased borrowing from the public since the late 1950s, except for a few years. This has led to the accumulation of debt held by the government, including trust funds like Social Security. The government's income and outlays fluctuate throughout the year, resulting in monthly surpluses and deficits that impact the level of debt. Congress has periodically raised the debt limit to accommodate the growth in federal debt. The U.S. Department of the Treasury's ability to meet government obligations can be hindered when federal debt nears its legal limit. Monthly surpluses and deficits affect the level of debt, even for trust fund accounts. Borrowing is crucial for Treasury's cash management during fluctuations in revenues and outlays. If the debt limit restricts borrowing, the government may struggle to meet all legal obligations in a timely manner. The government may face challenges meeting legal obligations if the debt limit prevents issuing new debt. This could lead to delays in payments and hinder the Treasury's ability to borrow on favorable terms. Defaulting on interest payments could have serious repercussions for the economy and financial markets globally. Delaying interest payments on Treasury securities could lead to default, impacting economies and financial markets globally. This could be avoided by delaying other federal payments, incurring interest penalties. Concerns have been raised by credit agencies and banks about the consequences of the U.S. Treasury being unable to fund obligations, potentially affecting global capital markets. Many economists and financial institutions warn of significant global market effects if the U.S. Treasury defaults on federal obligations. Past Treasury Secretaries have used special strategies to manage debt during debt ceiling constraints, including suspending debt sales and withholding certain receipts. The Treasury Secretary has the authority to use strategies like a \"debt issuance suspension period\" to manage funds from the Civil Service Retirement Fund and the Thrift Savings Fund. Actions taken during the 2007 credit crunch expanded options for the Treasury Secretary, but would have minimal impact on delaying reaching the federal debt limit. The U.S. Treasury responded to the credit crunch by selling off mortgage-backed securities to expand options for the Treasury Secretary. However, the pace of sales was limited to minimize market disruptions. Despite eliminating the MBS portfolio, other asset sales are unlikely to sustain debt management operations without increasing the debt limit. Some suggest using the Fourteenth Amendment to ignore the debt limit constraints. Some propose using the Fourteenth Amendment to bypass debt limit constraints, but President Obama and legal analysts reject this idea. The debt limit can complicate Treasury's financial management, requiring extraordinary measures when near the limit. While it hasn't led to default, it causes inconvenience and uncertainty. Congress uses the debt limit to control spending and enforce fiscal accountability. The debt limit allows Congress to control federal spending and enforce fiscal accountability. Some argue for its elimination, but it may provide a unique leverage not covered by other budget controls. The Obama Administration has proposed a system of allowing debt limit increases subject to congressional disapproval. The debt limit gives Congress leverage to control federal spending and enforce fiscal accountability. It provides a unique tool for individual Members to influence fiscal policy, separate from the budget process. Congress has historically placed restrictions on federal debt to assert its constitutional powers. Between World War I and World War II, statutory restrictions on federal debt evolved into an aggregate limit that applied to nearly all federal debt outstanding. Congress historically authorized borrowing for specific purposes before World War I, often specifying details of debt instruments Treasury could employ. Concerns about granting the Treasury Secretary authority to issue debt affecting monetary policies became moot after the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. After the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913, concerns about monetary issues were addressed through settlements in 1878 and 1890. The War Revenue Act of 1898 allowed the Treasury to use certificates of indebtedness for short-term borrowing and cash management. The act granted the Treasury Secretary authority to issue $100 million in short-term certificates and $400 million in longer-term notes and bonds. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 further expanded the Treasury Secretary's administrative leeway in financing World War I. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 expanded the Treasury Secretary's administrative leeway in financing World War I by dropping certain limits on bond maturity and redemption. Subsequent borrowing measures were made as amendments to this act until 1982, reflecting changes in legislative drafting practices. Congress provided additional leeway to Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon in the 1920s to replace expensive federal debt with cheaper new issues. In the 1920s and 1930s, Congress granted the Treasury Secretary more flexibility in managing federal debt by allowing the issuance of notes and savings certificates, as well as removing arbitrary limitations on bond issuance. Treasury Secretary Mellon and later Secretary Henry advocated for greater freedom in determining the type of securities to be issued. In 1931, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury greater flexibility in issuing bonds. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau called for replacing limits on bond issuance with a more flexible approach. Congress established a $20 billion limit on shorter-term debt and a $25 billion limit on outstanding bonds. In 1939, President Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau asked Congress to eliminate separate limits on bonds and other debt types. The law enacted in July 1939 created an aggregate limit of $45 billion covering nearly all public debt. The law enacted in July 1939 created an aggregate limit of $45 billion covering nearly all public debt, allowing the Treasury to manage federal debt more effectively by issuing debt instruments with maturities that reduce interest costs and minimize financial risks. In 1941, legislation increased the aggregate limit to $65 billion, giving the Treasury greater independence of action on the eve of the United States' entry into World War II. The debt limit was raised to accommodate costs for World War II, reaching $300 billion in 1945. After the war, it was reduced to $275 billion. The limit remained at $275 billion until 1954 due to financing the Korean War on a pay-as-you-go basis. Congress declined to raise the limit until a temporary increase in August 1954. In the 1953 State of the Union address, the Administration requested an increase in the debt limit, but Congress declined until a temporary increase in August 1954. The debt limit reached $300 billion in March 1962, its level at the end of World War II. Since then, Congress has enacted 78 measures altering the limit. Recent increases in the debt limit have been significant, such as the $1.9 trillion increase in February 2010. Since FY2001, debt held by the public has grown due to persistent budget deficits. Since FY1998-FY2001, government ran surpluses, with federal debt held by intergovernmental accounts growing by $855 billion and debt held by the public falling by almost $450 billion. However, since FY2001, debt held by the public has grown due to persistent budget deficits. Debt held in government accounts has also increased, largely due to excess Social Security payroll taxes. Federal debt held by government accounts has steadily grown since 1982, influenced by increases in Social Security taxes and the baby boom generation entering peak earnings years. The 1983 Greenspan Commission led to surpluses in the late 1990s, reducing debt held by the public. However, deficits returned in the early 2000s, increasing debt as a share of GDP. By FY2002, debt subject to limit was nearing the $5,950 billion debt limit. In FY2002, debt subject to limit increased by $405 billion, nearing the $5,950 billion debt limit. The Administration requested Congress to raise the limit to $6,700 billion due to a deteriorating budget outlook. Treasury suspended reinvestment of government securities in April 2002 to keep debt below the limit. In April 2002, the Treasury avoided default by suspending reinvestment of government securities in the G-Fund of the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan to issue new debt. Debt subject to limit was just $25 million below the limit, but tax revenues allowed the Treasury to restore the G-Fund. By the end of April, debt fell $35 billion below the limit, only to rise again by mid-May. The Treasury's financing problems persisted without an increase in the debt limit. The Treasury, for the second time in 2002, used its statutory authority to avoid default by asking Congress to raise the debt limit or enact other changes allowing the issuance of new debt. The Treasury reduced federal debt held by trust funds and replaced it with non-debt instruments to meet government obligations. These actions were expected to last until June 28, 2002, after which further measures would be needed to prevent breaching the debt ceiling. The Treasury took extraordinary actions to issue new debt to meet government obligations until June 28, 2002. Without a debt limit increase by that date, the Treasury would need to take further actions to avoid breaching the ceiling. Congress took steps to increase the debt limit, with the House passing a bill including language for a potential increase, while the Senate showed reluctance to include a debt limit increase in the bill. The Senate's supplemental appropriations bill (S. 2551) omitted debt-limit-increasing language, leading to a separate bill (S. 2578) being adopted to raise the debt limit by $450 billion. The House narrowly passed the increase on June 27, which was signed into law on June 28, ending the 2002 debt limit crisis. In late February 2003, the Treasury requested an unspecified increase in the debt limit as the $6,400 billion limit was approaching. The 108th Congress did not immediately respond, leading to ongoing discussions into the spring. In late February 2003, the Treasury requested an increase in the debt limit as it was nearing the $6,400 billion limit. The 108th Congress did not immediately respond, leading to ongoing discussions into the spring. Treasury used measures to manage debt holdings and avoid reaching the limit, allowing for additional debt issuance. The adoption of the FY2004 budget resolution triggered the \"Gephardt rule\" in April 2003. In April 2003, the adoption of the FY2004 budget resolution triggered the \"Gephardt rule\" in the House, leading to the passing of legislation raising the debt limit to $7,384 billion in May 2003 (P.L. 108-24, 117 Stat. 710). Treasury warned of imminent default, prompting the Senate to act and avoid disruptions to government finances. In June 2004, the Treasury requested Congress to raise the debt limit to avoid financial disruptions. By October 14, the debt was just $25 million below the limit. Secretary of the Treasury John Snow warned that measures to avoid breaching the limit would be exhausted by mid-November, risking the government's reputation in capital markets. The House passed a budget resolution for FY2005 but did not reach a final agreement with the Senate. Without an increase in the debt limit, the Treasury would be unable to meet all government obligations. The House passed a budget resolution for FY2005 in 2004 but did not reach a final agreement with the Senate. Without a budget resolution, no measure to raise the debt limit could be passed automatically. The House added an amendment to the FY2005 Transportation-Treasury appropriations to remove the Treasury's flexibility in financing the government as federal debt approached the limit. Senator Frist introduced legislation to raise the debt limit by $800 billion, which was approved by the Senate in November 2004. After the House passed a budget resolution for FY2005 in 2004, Senator Frist introduced legislation to raise the debt limit by $800 billion. The Senate approved the increase on November 17, 2004, followed by the House on November 18. The President signed the legislation into law on November 19, 2004. The increase allowed the Treasury to reschedule a debt auction and cancel a \"debt limit suspension period.\" Subsequent debt limit increases in 2005, 2006, and 2007 were less dramatic. In 2005, Congress included three reconciliation instructions in the FY2006 budget resolution, directing committees to report bills raising the debt limit. Despite this, no bill was reported, triggering the Gephardt rule to automatically raise the debt limit by $781 billion. By the end of 2005, the Senate had not considered the resolution, and no reconciliation bill was passed to raise the debt limit as called for in the budget resolution. In early 2006, Secretary of the Treasury Snow warned Congress that the debt limit would be reached soon, requesting an increase. Despite measures taken to avoid reaching the limit, by mid-March 2006, the government was close to being unable to meet its obligations. The Senate passed a debt limit increase on March 16, 2006, and the President signed it into law on March 20, raising the debt limit to $8,965 billion. During the week of March 13, the Senate passed a debt limit increase (P.L. 109-182) to $8,965 billion. In mid-May 2007, Congress passed a budget resolution raising the debt limit to $9,815 billion. In September 2007, the Senate approved a resolution (H.J.Res. 43) without changes to raise the debt limit. In September 2007, the Senate approved a resolution (H.J.Res. 43) to raise the debt limit. This led to federal actions to stabilize the housing and financial markets due to the financial crisis and recession that started in mid-2007. The recession lasted until 2009, resulting in large deficits and debt limit increases. The recession led to large deficits and debt limit increases, with federal deficit spending spiking to 9.8% of GDP. Falling asset prices reduced federal revenues, while unemployment led to increased federal spending. Deficit spending can provide a fiscal stimulus to boost the economy if output levels are below potential. The recession caused large deficits and debt limit increases, with federal deficit spending spiking to 9.8% of GDP. Boosting the economy through deficit spending provides a fiscal stimulus if output levels are below potential. The number of households eligible for means-tested benefits rises, increasing federal spending. Deficit spending can accelerate inflation if output levels are near potential, exacerbating long-term fiscal challenges. The federal debt limit was raised multiple times in 2008 and 2009 due to economic conditions and government actions to bring the economy out of recession. The House and Senate Concurrent Resolutions on the Budget recommended policies resulting in significant debt levels in FY2009. In 2009, the House and Senate recommended policies that would lead to a significant increase in the federal debt limit. The House passed a budget resolution that included a debt limit increase to $10,615 billion, but the Senate did not take up the legislation, so the debt limit remained at $9,815 billion. Subsequently, the House passed a bill that included a debt limit increase to $10,615 billion. The House passed an amended version of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (H.R. 3221) with a debt limit increase to $10,615 billion. The Senate then passed the measure, and the President signed the bill (P.L. 110-289) on July 30, 2008. The act also created the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to extend a line of credit to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. On September 7, 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed in conservatorship by the FHFA, giving full control to the agency. The government took steps to stabilize financial markets by proposing the purchase of mortgage-related assets, raising the debt limit to $11,315 billion. Representative Barney Frank proposed an amendment for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. The Treasury proposed purchasing mortgage-related assets and raising the debt limit to $11,315 billion to stabilize financial markets. Representative Barney Frank's amendment for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act was rejected by the House, but a different version was passed by the Senate and signed into law, increasing the debt limit. Congress considered the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which includes tax cuts and spending increases to stimulate the economy. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included tax cuts and spending increases to stimulate the economy. It raised the debt limit to $12,104 billion and proposed policies leading to a debt subject to limit of $13,233 billion in FY2010. The budget resolution in FY2009 raised the debt limit to $13,029 billion through House Joint Resolution 45. Treasury postponed reaching the debt limit by reducing loans available through the Supplemental Financing Program. The Obama Administration considered scaling back the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The Obama Administration considered scaling back the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to lower federal debt subject to the statutory limit. Repayments of TARP funds by financial institutions could also reduce the debt subject to the limit. Other measures, such as those taken in 2003 during a \"debt issuance suspension period,\" could extend the U.S. Treasury's ability to operate within the debt limit. In mid-December, senior Members of the House opted for a smaller increase in the debt limit over a larger one. In mid-December, senior Members of the House chose a smaller increase in the debt limit to allow normal debt management operations. H.R. 4314 raised the debt limit to $12,394 billion, passed by the House and Senate, signed by the President. The Senate later passed H.J.Res. 45 to raise the debt ceiling to $14,294 billion with PAYGO restrictions. Some Members called for a national commission to address federal debt linked to the debt limit increase. The House approved H.J.Res. 45 on a 233-187 vote on February 4, forwarding the measure to the President. President Obama signed the measure (P.L. 111-139) on February 12, 2010, after a failed attempt to establish a \"Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action.\" The 2011 debt limit episode was longer and more contentious, resolved by the passage of a national commission to address federal debt. The 2011 debt limit episode was resolved by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which reinstated statutory caps on discretionary spending and created other means of constraining federal spending. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner announced on May 16, 2011, that the federal debt had reached its limit, leading to a debt issuance suspension period. The extraordinary measures used may provide limited time due to the large federal deficit projected for FY2011. The FY2011 federal deficit is projected to reach $1,399 billion, leading to limited time before the federal government cannot meet its financial obligations. Cutting spending to slow debt growth was suggested, but the scale of required reductions would equal total discretionary spending for the last five months of FY2011. The U.S. Treasury suspended reinvestment in the Exchange Stabilization Fund, indicating less headroom for cash management than anticipated. The U.S. Treasury may have less headroom for cash management than previously anticipated, with funding federal operations becoming increasingly complicated without a debt limit increase. An independent analysis projects a cash shortfall from August 3 to the end of the month, with uncertainties in cash flow projections. Treasury estimates on the debt limit and extraordinary measures have shifted since January 6, 2011. Higher individual income tax revenues and sales of mortgage-backed securities have provided some additional headroom. Revenues and sales of mortgage-backed securities helped expand headroom between federal debt and its limit in late April. Estimates of when Treasury would reach the debt limit and how long extraordinary measures would extend federal borrowing capacity have been close to Treasury's estimates. The Treasury Secretary indicated a potential debt issuance suspension period on May 16, unless Congress acted beforehand, allowing certain measures to extend borrowing capacity until early August 2011. Measures like the draw-down of the Supplementary Financing Program have already taken place to provide additional headroom under the limit. The Supplementary Financing Program (SFP) has been drawn down from $200 billion to $5 billion to manage monetary policy. New issuances of State and Local Government Series (SLGS) Treasury securities were suspended on May 6, 2011. Treasury Secretary Geithner requested an increase in the debt limit in January 2011, predicting it would be reached between March 31 and May 16, 2011. Despite efforts to raise the debt limit to $16,700 billion, a bill was defeated in a House vote on May 31, 2011. The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011 was passed by the House on July 19, 2011. A bill to raise the debt limit to $16,700 billion was defeated in a House vote on May 31, 2011. The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011 was passed by the House on July 19, 2011, but was later tabled by the Senate. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law on August 2, 2011, eliminating the need for further increases in the debt limit until early 2013. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law on August 2, 2011, with provisions for deficit reduction and debt limit increases up to $2.4 trillion. It included discretionary spending caps, automatic spending reductions (sequester), a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, and a procedure for raising the debt ceiling. The debt limit was raised in two steps, first by $400 billion and then by $500 billion. The debt limit was raised by $400 billion to $14,694 billion on August 2, 2011, and then by an additional $500 billion on September 22, 2011. The second increase was subject to a joint resolution of disapproval, but the Senate rejected it. In late December 2011, a third increase of $1.2 trillion was triggered, which the President delayed to allow Congress to consider a disapproval measure. The debt limit was raised by $400 billion to $14,694 billion on August 2, 2011, and then by an additional $500 billion on September 22, 2011. A third increase of $1.2 trillion was triggered in late December 2011, subject to a joint resolution of disapproval. The increase could have been triggered in other ways, such as through a balanced budget amendment or recommendations from the Super Committee, but those options did not apply. After the debt limit was raised by $400 billion to $14,694 billion in August 2011, it was raised by an additional $500 billion in September 2011. A third increase of $1.2 trillion was triggered in late December 2011, matching budget reductions slated for FY2013-FY2021. The debt limit was suspended until May 19, 2013, allowing the U.S. Treasury to replenish funds. The debt limit was suspended until May 19, 2013, allowing the U.S. Treasury to replenish funds. The new debt limit was set at $16,699 billion, $305 billion above the previous limit. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared a new debt issuance suspension period on May 20, 2013, triggering extraordinary measures due to stronger revenue collections. The U.S. Treasury's borrowing capacity was expected to be exhausted by October 17, 2013, but Congress passed a resolution to suspend the debt limit until February 8, 2014. After the suspension ended, the debt limit was reset to $17,212 billion, and extraordinary measures were used. Congress later approved a measure to suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2014. After Congress quickly addressed the debt limit issue, the House approved a measure to suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2015. The Senate and President also approved the measure. Once the suspension expired, the debt limit was reestablished at $18,113 billion, and extraordinary measures were employed until July 30, 2015. Treasury Secretary Lew later invoked extraordinary powers until the end of October to meet federal financial obligations. On October 15, 2015, Secretary Lew announced that extraordinary measures would be exhausted by November 3, 2015, with a small cash reserve of less than $30 billion remaining. Lower tax collections and higher trust fund investments reduced Treasury's headroom more than expected. Independent analysts initially projected the measures to last until November or early December 2015, but more recent estimates in September 2015 suggested mid-November 2015. The \"Bipartisan Budget Agreement\" released on October 26, 2015, addressed fiscal issues, including resetting the debt limit on March 16, 2017. On October 26, 2015, a \"Bipartisan Budget Agreement\" was released addressing fiscal issues, including resetting the debt limit on March 16, 2017. The agreement also increased statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2016 and FY2017. The House concurred with Senate amendments to H.R. 1314 on October 28, 2015, leading to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 being signed into law (P.L. 114-74) on November 2, 2015. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-74) was signed into law by the President on November 2, 2015. The federal government had budget surpluses from FY1998 to FY2001, reducing its debt. However, deficits increased due to higher military and security spending after 9/11, rising nondefense outlays, tax reductions, and the financial crisis of 2007-2009. This led to the need for multiple debt limit increases. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 and subsequent recession caused large federal deficits, leading to increased total debt and the need for debt limit increases. The direct costs of bailing out financial institutions were overshadowed by reduced tax revenues and increased social safety net benefits. While fiscal concerns were prominent during the 2011 debt limit episode, federal deficits have since decreased as the economy recovered. However, without significant policy changes, persistent deficits could significantly raise federal debt, potentially slowing economic growth in the long run. The federal debt has been increasing since the financial crisis of 2007-2009, leading to the need for debt limit increases. Total federal debt has risen significantly, with debt held by government accounts and the public also increasing. Without policy changes, the growing debt could impact economic growth in the long run. Since FY2001, federal debt has increased by $12,380 billion, with debt held in government accounts up by $2,566 billion and debt held by the public rising by $9,813 billion. Debt measures fluctuated monthly due to uneven federal receipts and outlays."
