Reimbursement for adoption expenses may include legal fees, counseling fees, medical expenses, foster-care charges, and transportation expenses. Agency employees adopting a child can be reimbursed for these expenses under specific regulations. The reimbursement is provided after the adoption is finalized, the child is under 18 years old and unmarried, and a written application is submitted on time. Reimbursement for adoption expenses is available for employees if the child is under 18 years old, unmarried, and a written application is submitted on time.

The guidelines for reimbursement under this section include restrictions on payment amounts to adoptive parents to prevent exceeding total adoption expenses or $5,000. The Office of Personnel Management can issue necessary guidelines for uniform administration. Application denial based on marital status is prohibited.
