    "content": "The Act titled \"Capitalizing Workforce Development Act of 2012\" establishes a Job Training Resources Grant Program. The \"Capitalizing Workforce Development Act of 2012\" establishes a Job Training Resources Grant Program under Section 403(a) of the Social Security Act. This program provides grants for the purchase, renovation, construction, or lease of real property for qualified self-sustaining job programs that offer job training and employment services to individuals with employment challenges. The Job Training Resources Grant Program prioritizes applicants with successful experience in establishing self-sustaining job programs. Applicants are not prohibited from participating in other federal programs. The eligible applicants for the Job Training Resources Grant Program include national organizations, State or political subdivisions, and Indian tribes or tribal organizations. Grant recipients must meet job placement performance goals. The Job Training Resources Grant Program requires grant recipients to establish job placement performance goals for each qualified job program funded by the grant. Performance assessment dates will be set by the Secretary to measure the achievement of these goals. The grant recipient must establish job placement performance goals for each funded program, with assessment dates set by the Secretary. The Secretary will ensure the protection of federal interest in real property purchased or improved with grant funds. Funds must be distributed to local organizations for the purposes described in the grant program. The funds allocated for grants under this paragraph will be distributed among local member organizations to support qualified self-sustaining job programs. An appropriation of $200,000,000 is made for fiscal year 2013, with funds available through fiscal year 2016. A penalty will be imposed if a recipient fails to meet job placement performance goals of the program. If a recipient of funds under section 403(a)(6) fails to meet job placement performance goals, the Secretary will require repayment in proportion to the degree of failure. Repayment will be made over a 10-year period without accruing interest. Alternatively, with the Secretary's consent, the recipient may choose to comply with the performance goals. The recipient of funds under section 403(a)(6) may elect to comply with job placement goals with the Secretary's consent. Failure to meet goals may result in a penalty, reducing future grant payments over a 10-year period. State penalty limitations do not apply in this case. The penalty under this paragraph is not subject to state penalty limitations. Section 409(b)(2) of the Social Security Act is amended to exclude penalties under (17) from the state reasonable cause exception. Offset to ensure PAYGO compliance."
