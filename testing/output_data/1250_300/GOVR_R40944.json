    "content": "Copyright is the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, and exploit an \"original work of authorship.\" Protection is automatic when the work is created. Registration with the U.S. Copyright Office offers advantages, such as the ability to file infringement suits and potentially receive statutory damages and attorney's fees. In the 2001 Supreme Court case New York Times Co. v. Tasini, freelance authors sued publishers for licensing their work to electronic databases without permission. In the case of New York Times Co. v. Tasini, freelance authors sued publishers for licensing their work to electronic databases without permission. The Supreme Court ruled that publishers cannot reproduce freelance works electronically without specific authorization, requiring them to obtain a separate license from the author. This decision led to many freelance works being removed from electronic databases. The court activated and consolidated three preexisting class action infringement suits in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, along with a fourth coordinated action. These claims, including Reed Elsevier v. Muchnick, involve a class action lawsuit where individual authors and trade groups are suing publishers for freelance work. Litigation can only proceed after the court certifies the class, and settlement proposals require court approval. The plaintiffs in Reed Elsevier, individual authors and trade groups, sued publishers for copyright infringement of their freelance works. After mediation, the parties reached an agreement categorizing claims for compensation: Category A for statutory damages and attorney's fees, Category B for actual damages, and Category C for other claims. The settlement in the Reed Elsevier case categorized plaintiffs' claims into three groups for compensation: Category A for statutory damages and attorney's fees, Category B for actual damages, and Category C for unregistered copyrights. Each category had a specific damages formula, with Category C claimants potentially receiving zero compensation if total costs exceeded $18 million. This feature was known as the \"C-reduction.\" In exchange for financial compensation, the plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against the defendants. The settlement in the Reed Elsevier case included three categories of plaintiffs' claims: Category A for statutory damages and attorney's fees, Category B for actual damages, and Category C for unregistered copyrights. Category C claimants faced potential reduction to zero if total costs exceeded $18 million, known as the \"C-reduction.\" Plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against defendants in exchange for compensation. The district court considered class certification and settlement approval, with objections raised about inadequate treatment of Category C claimants and concerns about representation of absent class members with unregistered copyrights. The defendants argued that Category C claimants, with unregistered copyrights, were fairly represented in the settlement. The district court granted final class certification and settlement approval in September 2005. Objectors appealed, questioning the fairness of the settlement and the adequacy of representation. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals raised jurisdictional concerns regarding claims of infringement on unregistered copyrights. Both plaintiffs and defendants argued that the Copyright Act's registration requirement is not jurisdictional. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed with the argument that the Copyright Act's registration requirement is not jurisdictional. They stated that district courts derive jurisdiction in copyright actions from specific sections of Title 28 of the U.S. Code, and Congress has supplemented these grants with \u00a7411(a) of the Copyright Act, which limits a district court's subject-matter jurisdiction. The appellate court ruled that the district court lacked jurisdiction to certify a class and approve a settlement in a copyright infringement case due to unregistered copyrights, as \u00a7411(a) of the Copyright Act limits subject-matter jurisdiction to claims arising from registered copyrights only. This jurisdictional defect also precluded supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a). The appellate court ruled that the district court lacked jurisdiction to certify a class and approve a settlement in a copyright infringement case due to unregistered copyrights. Judge Walker dissented, arguing that the copyright registration requirement should be re-evaluated. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to review whether 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) restricts federal courts' jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review whether 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) restricts federal courts' jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions by requiring copyright registration as a prerequisite to filing a lawsuit. Petitioners argued that the registration requirement under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) is not a jurisdictional issue but a mandatory prerequisite to filing a lawsuit. They contended that even if it is jurisdictional, it only applies to initiating actions, not settling them, as courts can approve settlements for claims they lacked authority to try. They warned that the Second Circuit's interpretation could hinder parties from resolving disputes involving unregistered works. The Second Circuit's interpretation of \u00a7411(a) as a jurisdictional issue could hinder parties from settling disputes involving unregistered works, according to respondents. They argued that \u00a7411(a) is a claim-processing rule, not a bar to jurisdiction, and cited cases where the jurisdiction requirement was waived. The United States also supported vacatur of the Second Circuit's judgment. The United States, as amicus curiae, supported vacatur of the Second Circuit's judgment, arguing that \u00a7411(a) is a mandatory prerequisite to suit that should be strictly enforced. Both petitioners and respondents advocated for the Supreme Court to overturn the Second Circuit's ruling, creating an unusual situation where no party argued for affirming the judgment below. Professor Deborah Jones Merritt, appointed as amicus curiae, argued that \u00a7411(a) restricts federal courts' subject-matter jurisdiction and serves vital public purposes. She also stated that parties cannot waive \u00a7411(a) as it is essential for the integrity of the judicial process. The integrity of the judicial process precludes parties from waiving \u00a7411(a) as it is crucial for fairness in settlements. Professor Merritt argued that the registration requirement is necessary to protect Internet service providers from copyright claims. The Computer and Communications Industry Association supported the Second Circuit's judgment, emphasizing the importance of the registration requirement in reducing technology companies' exposure to copyright infringement claims. The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) supported the Second Circuit's decision in Reed Elsevier, stating that the registration requirement reduces technology companies' exposure to copyright claims. CCIA argued that the Supreme Court should dismiss the petitioners' writ of certiorari due to lack of a case or controversy and absence of a circuit split on \u00a7411(a) jurisdiction. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Second Circuit's judgment on March 2, 2010, ruling that while registration is required for copyright claims, it does not limit federal court jurisdiction. The Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit's judgment, ruling that the Copyright Act's registration requirement is not a jurisdictional limit for federal courts to adjudicate copyright infringement claims. The Court held that the district court had the authority to certify the class and approve the settlement between freelance authors, publishers, and electronic databases. The Supreme Court clarified that certain limitations in statutes should be treated as nonjurisdictional claim-processing rules rather than true jurisdictional conditions. In a previous case, Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., the Court established that if Congress does not explicitly label a limitation as jurisdictional, it should be considered nonjurisdictional. This distinction was made in the context of a sexual harassment case under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, where the numerical qualification for the definition of \"employer\" was deemed a substantive element of the claim, not affecting federal court jurisdiction. The Arbaugh Court clarified that the employee numerosity requirement in Title VII is a substantive element of the claim, not affecting federal court jurisdiction. This precedent was found to be controlling in the Reed Elsevier case regarding the registration requirement in the Copyright Act. The Court rejected the argument that the registration requirement was jurisdictional based on the presence of the word \"jurisdiction\" in the statute. The Court clarified that the registration requirement in the Copyright Act is not jurisdictional, as argued by Professor Merritt. The presence of the word \"jurisdiction\" in the statute does not indicate Congress' intent to rank it as jurisdictional. The Court emphasized that federal courts have adjudicatory authority over the issue of registrability, regardless of registration status, and noted exceptions to the registration requirement in Title 17 of the U.S. Code. The Court clarified that the registration requirement in the Copyright Act is not jurisdictional. Exceptions to the requirement include cases involving non-U.S. works, rights of attribution and integrity, or refused registration. The Court distinguished this from a previous case involving a 30-day appeal deadline. The Reed Elsevier Court distinguished its decision from Bowles v. Russell, stating that the registration requirement in the Copyright Act is not jurisdictional. The Court emphasized that context is relevant in determining whether a statute ranks a requirement as jurisdictional. The Court rejected the argument that the registration requirement should be construed as jurisdictional to promote policy goals and congressional objectives. The Court rejected Professor Merritt's argument that \u00a7411(a) should be construed as jurisdictional to promote policy goals and congressional objectives. The Court also declined to affirm on estoppel grounds the appellate court's judgment, as Professor Merritt had urged. The parties' assertion that \u00a7411(a) was jurisdictional in defending or negotiating the settlement agreement followed existing precedent in the Second Circuit. The District Court did not adopt petitioners' interpretation of \u00a7 411(a) as jurisdictional. The Second Circuit rejected the argument that \u00a7411(a) did not restrict the district court's subject-matter jurisdiction. The Supreme Court did not express an opinion on the fairness of the settlement and declined to decide if \u00a7411(a) is a mandatory precondition for copyright infringement suits. Justice Ginsburg concurred that \u00a7411(a) should be treated as a precondition for filing a copyright infringement claim. Justice Ginsburg concurred with the Court's judgment that \u00a7411(a) should be treated as a precondition for filing a copyright infringement claim. She highlighted the tension between the Arbaugh and Bowles precedents, offering her interpretation to reconcile the rulings. The Arbaugh Court established a rule that statutory conditions are jurisdictional only if Congress explicitly states so, while the Bowles Court considered the time limit for filing a notice of appeal as jurisdictional based on longstanding decisions. Justice Ginsburg concurred with the Court's judgment that \u00a7411(a) should be treated as a precondition for filing a copyright infringement claim. She reconciled the tension between the Arbaugh and Bowles precedents by arguing that \u00a7411(a) is nonjurisdictional, as it does not speak in jurisdictional terms. The Reed Elsevier case is now remanded to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for further consideration. The Second Circuit is urged to review the settlement and objections. If approved, freelance authors will be compensated, and databases can restore publications. Concerns raised about the damages formula and potential favoritism towards certain claim holders. Implications of the Reed Elsevier case extend beyond this settlement. The Reed Elsevier case has implications for copyright holders in future infringement cases, allowing participation in settlements and class action lawsuits even without registered works. District courts may dismiss claims involving unregistered works, but federal courts can approve class action settlements for both registered and unregistered works. The case also clarifies federal courts' subject-matter jurisdiction. Reed Elsevier case clarifies federal courts' subject-matter jurisdiction, reaffirming the clear statement rule for statutory limitations. The concurrence seeks to limit Bowles to situations historically treated as jurisdictional by the Supreme Court."
