Prior reports and determinations are required before such rules can be promulgated. Before finalizing any energy-related rule costing over $1 billion, the EPA must report to Congress with details on the rule, total costs, benefits, and data reliability. Before finalizing any energy-related rule costing over $1 billion, the EPA must report to Congress with details on the rule, total costs, benefits, data reliability, estimates of energy price increases, and employment effects. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with relevant agencies, will analyze the employment effects, energy price increases, fuel diversity, electric reliability, and adverse impacts on energy supply resulting from the implementation of the rule. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other agencies, will assess any adverse effects on energy supply, distribution, or use due to the economic or technical infeasibility of implementing the rule. If adverse effects are determined, a subsequent evaluation will be conducted to determine significant adverse effects on the economy, considering the costs and benefits of the rule. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other agencies, will assess adverse effects on energy supply, distribution, or use due to the economic or technical infeasibility of implementing the rule. A subsequent evaluation will determine significant adverse effects on the economy, considering costs and benefits, and publish the results in the Federal Register. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms such as \"direct costs\" and \"indirect costs\" according to EPA guidelines. It also clarifies what constitutes an \"energy-related rule that is estimated to cost more than $1 billion\" and the definition of a \"rule\" as per section 551 of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 5 prohibits the use of the social cost of carbon in cost-benefit analysis for energy-related rules costing over $1 billion without specific authorization by Federal law. The social cost of carbon is defined as the monetized damages from increased carbon dioxide emissions. The House of Representatives passed a bill on August 1, 2013, related to monetized damages from an increase in carbon dioxide emissions."
