    "content": "The Act titled \"District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act of 2003\" amends Section 446 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to address the enactment of the local budget. The Council must adopt the annual budget for the District of Columbia government within 50 days of receiving the proposal from the Mayor. Budget supplements must also be adopted after a public hearing. During control years, the Mayor submits the budget to the President for transmission to Congress after completing budget procedures outlined in the Act. Unauthorized obligations and expenditures by District of Columbia government officials are prohibited, except in specific circumstances. In the District of Columbia government, no funds can be spent without approval by the Council or Congress. Reprogramming of budget amounts requires approval by the Mayor and Council, with any additional spending offset by reductions elsewhere. Control years have specific budget procedures outlined in the Act. The Council approves reprogramming requests with offsetting expenditures. Control year defined in the Act. Congressional review period for budget acts amended. The Act will take effect after a 30-day period unless a joint resolution disapproving it is enacted within that time.

Upon passing both Houses of Congress and being transmitted to the President, a resolution will repeal the Act after a specified period. Various sections of the Act are amended to reflect these changes.
