The Act defines key terms such as \"Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material,\" \"design-basis threat,\" \"formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material,\" and \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\" The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, signed in 1968 and enforced in 1970, defines a nuclear weapon as a device using atomic energy for weapon purposes. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. Congress finds that the threat of terrorists acquiring and using a nuclear weapon is urgent and poses a significant risk to national and global security. Efforts to secure nuclear stockpiles and prevent nuclear smuggling have made progress, but further actions are necessary to minimize the risk of nuclear terrorism. The White House's National Strategy for Combating Terrorism highlights the grave threat of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan warns that a nuclear terror attack would have devastating consequences on a global scale. UN Security Council Resolution 1540 emphasizes the importance of combating this threat through all available means. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) emphasizes the need for all countries to adopt and enforce laws prohibiting non-state actors from acquiring and using nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons for terrorist purposes. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency warns of the urgent race against time to prevent a terrorist attack using a nuclear weapon. Sense of Congress on the prevention of nuclear terrorism. The sense of Congress is that the threat of nuclear terror is the most horrific the US faces. A comprehensive approach is needed to reduce this danger, including efforts to eliminate terrorist groups seeking nuclear weapons, secure nuclear weapons worldwide, and prevent terrorist efforts to manufacture or transport nuclear explosives. The prevention of a nuclear terrorist attack on the US should be a top priority for the President. The President should prioritize preventing a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States and accelerate programs to combat nuclear terrorism, secure nuclear materials, and prevent nuclear smuggling. The International Atomic Energy Agency should be adequately funded to coordinate international efforts in protecting nuclear materials. Legislation by Senators Lugar, Domenici, and Nunn has led to groundbreaking programs to prevent nuclear weapons from falling into the hands of terrorists.
