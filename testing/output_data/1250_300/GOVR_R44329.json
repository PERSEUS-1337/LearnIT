    "content": "In FY2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) obligated over $280 billion for federal contracts, surpassing all other federal agencies combined. DOD's spending accounted for 8% of federal spending. Analysts and officials believe that utilizing data for acquisition decisions could lead to significant cost savings, resource allocation improvements, and enhanced military operations effectiveness. The National Defense Industrial Association emphasized the importance of data as a critical step in enhancing defense acquisitions. Congress has taken steps to improve DOD's efficiency, including mandating auditability, acquisition reform provisions in National Defense Authorization Acts, and conducting hearings on agency operations and acquisition reform. Improved data analysis could potentially lead to more effective decision-making, prompting Congress to consider enhancing oversight and enabling DOD to conduct better operations. The report examines the effectiveness of DOD in using data for decision-making, focusing on defense acquisitions. Congress may enhance oversight and enable DOD to conduct better data analysis. The use of data analysis is crucial for making well-informed policy decisions and managing government programs. Lack of data can lead to incorrect conclusions, resulting in wasted resources and undermining the effectiveness of government programs or military operations. Access to data and analytical tools is essential for effective reviews, as highlighted in a 2015 GAO report. The 2015 GAO report highlighted that officials lacked access to data and analytical tools for effective reviews. Inspector General reports in 2015 and 2014 found issues with tracking spare parts data and unreliable data in the Army's audit readiness. A 2013 GAO report noted that DOD's supply chain management in Afghanistan was hindered by a lack of data. Additionally, a 2011 report highlighted the absence of comprehensive databases for tracking spending in Afghanistan. Despite the lack of a consolidated database tracking spending in Afghanistan, government officials and analysts agree that the Department of Defense (DOD) does not effectively use data in decision-making. Major policy decisions are often made without substantive data, leading to reliance on assumptions. Retired Air Force General Norman Schwartz emphasized the importance of data-driven decisions, a concept that Congress has also sought to promote through legislation like the DATA Act of 2014. In recent years, Congress has emphasized the importance of data in government operations through legislation like the DATA Act of 2014. The Act aims to improve tracking of Federal spending, establish data standards, and hold agencies accountable for data accuracy. Lack of basic data hinders management of the Department of Defense, as highlighted by former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates highlighted the management problems within the Department of Defense due to a lack of essential data. This hinders the effectiveness of the department and our national security. The inability to access accurate information impairs decision-making on national security policies, military priorities, and tradeoffs. Analysts and officials suggest that improving information systems, data accuracy, and data utilization are crucial for the DOD to address these challenges. Analysts and officials emphasize the importance of having information systems, accurate data, and using data for decision-making within the Department of Defense. The lack of sound systems can lead to manual processes, time-consuming tasks, and errors in managing multibillion-dollar programs. It is crucial to have comprehensive and authoritative data sources to prevent conflicting information and fully exploit program information. The Department of Defense faces challenges with flawed financial management systems and processes, hindering its ability to improve budgetary accounting. Efforts to enhance financial management systems are ongoing, with completion expected by 2017. Multiple IT systems and databases within DOD contain similar information, leading to concerns about data consistency and analysis. The Department of Defense has multiple IT systems and databases with similar information, causing concerns about data consistency. Calls have been made to improve data system architecture for collecting and analyzing DOD acquisition data. Existing systems may lack reliable or complete information, leading to challenges with data reliability and sufficiency. The FPDS database is crucial for understanding government spending, but concerns have been raised about the accuracy and reliability of the data. Efforts are being made to improve data quality, but analysts still rely on it mainly for identifying broad trends. The General Services Administration (GSA) is overhauling data systems, including FPDS, to improve reliability and usefulness. Stakeholder feedback is being sought to enhance data quality. DOD's tracking of Operations and Support (O&S) costs was found to be inconsistent and unreliable by GAO in 2012. In 2017 or 2018, GAO found DOD's tracking of Operations and Support (O&S) costs to be inconsistent and unreliable, limiting oversight. DOD lacked comprehensive data to analyze cost growth, identify drivers, and manage costs effectively. The Under Secretary of Defense for AT&L is now requiring more consistent use of units for cost calculations, but building a data bank for analysis will take years. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics is working on improving the consistency of Operations and Support (O&S) cost calculations in DOD. However, there are challenges in accessing reliable and complete data for decision-making processes, leading to policies and acquisition decisions being driven by perceptions or anecdotal evidence. Institutional and cultural barriers hinder data sharing within the organization, such as a stovepiped structure limiting visibility. According to a recent RAND report, institutional and cultural barriers within the DoD hinder data sharing. Decisionmakers struggle to use existing data effectively due to a lack of skilled personnel and understanding of data usage. Ensuring data accuracy and relevance is crucial, as unchecked statistics and slick presentations can lead to decisions based on unsubstantiated assumptions. Some government officials and analysts emphasize the importance of understanding data limitations in decision-making. Concerns include avoiding data collection without a clear purpose and spending too much time on data calls that lack analytical value. Some DOD officials caution against excessive focus on data collection and analysis that may not serve a useful analytical purpose or outweigh the costs involved. They argue that decision-makers should prioritize having sufficient data for reasonable conclusions rather than striving for perfection. Observers emphasize that data do not need to be perfect to be useful. Decision-makers should prioritize having sufficient data for reasonable conclusions rather than striving for perfection. Critical questions to ask when working with data include what useful analysis can be developed now, how to model correctly, and understanding the uncertainty bounds of the data. Imperfect data can still be useful, and even perfect data may not yield perfect analysis. Cost estimating, such as for large programs like those in Afghanistan, is inherently imprecise but can aid in understanding risks and resource allocation. From FY2007 to FY2013, DOD spent over $80 billion on contracts in Afghanistan but struggled to track data accurately. Lack of reliable information hindered strategic contracting decisions, supply chain management, and distribution of supplies. DOD lacked IT systems to track relevant contract data, leading to operational limitations in Afghanistan. The inability to effectively manage the supply chain in Afghanistan hindered distribution of supplies and equipment to the warfighter, affecting operations and limiting DOD's oversight. Multiple conflicting IT systems in Afghanistan led to wasteful spending and poor data sharing. Data reliability issues persisted, with incomplete and unreliable information not flowing to the central database. Data management in Afghanistan was questionable, with data often kept at the local level and not flowing up to the central database. Only about 10% of all data records were eventually put into the central database, with an error rate of approximately 50%. Data accuracy varied, with some areas like IED attack reports being tracked consistently, while others like the Commanders Emergency Response Program data were not accurately tracked until 2009. Officials were often unaware of existing data due to inexperienced personnel assigned to tasks. Officials in Afghanistan were often unaware of existing data, leading to a low rate of data flow to the central database. Despite data shortcomings, the Department of Defense has made progress in identifying necessary data for better contract decisions and improving data reliability. Leveraging data systems from operations in Afghanistan may benefit future operations. The Department of Defense (DOD) needs to improve its use of data for decision-making, with significant gaps in data availability and reliability. Efforts are underway to enhance IT systems and gather data for policy decisions. Analysts emphasize the importance of integrating data analysis into DOD's culture and routines, with leadership playing a key role in driving this cultural shift. Leadership support is crucial for integrating data analysis into the culture of the Department of Defense (DOD). Senior officials have emphasized the need for a data-informed decision-making process, evident in initiatives like the annual report on the Defense Acquisitions System. This shift towards data-driven analyses is seen as essential for improving decision-making within DOD. The Department of Defense (DOD) is investing in data-driven processes for supply chain management and acquisitions. Senior leadership is promoting this shift, but some argue that more action is needed. DOD is investing in information technology systems and tools to support data-based decision-making. Efforts are also being made to improve the quality of data systems, including FPDS. An analytics center was established in 2013 to measure the effectiveness of acquisitions and policy-making using data analysis. The Department of Defense is investing in data-driven processes for supply chain management and acquisitions. In 2013, an analytics center was established to measure the effectiveness of acquisitions and policy-making using data analysis. The Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation office is working on the CADE project to consolidate historical acquisition data for better decision-making. The military services are also integrating data into decision-making processes, with the Navy reevaluating IT systems to determine data needs and justifying investments for data analysis. The Air Force is reevaluating IT systems to determine data needs, justify investments for data analysis, and identify cost savings. Congressional actions, like The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act, have helped improve the use of data in decision-making processes within the Department of Defense. The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act improved data-based decision-making in the Department of Defense by strengthening cost estimates, requiring root cause analysis of cost growth, and mandating audit readiness for financial statements. Despite efforts to enhance efficiency, success is not guaranteed. Despite past challenges, the Department of Defense is working towards improving data-based decision-making to enhance efficiency and resource deployment. Success is not guaranteed, but there have been examples of both successes and failures in the past. It will take time to implement and improve data systems, and build a robust historical database to truly understand performance. To truly understand how our acquisition system is performing, a robust historical database is needed. Congressional action could support building necessary systems and workforce for data analysis. The success of promoting data use in decision-making within the Department of Defense depends on such actions. Congress may need to consider investing in IT systems and increasing the capacity of relevant offices within DOD to improve defense acquisitions. Key questions include whether DOD has a clear strategy for data analysis, the steps needed to execute this strategy, and the in-house capability for robust data analysis. To effectively use data in decision-making, DOD needs a culture that values data and integrates data analysis into routine processes. Congress could consider legislation to promote data use and should examine DOD's culture, incentives, and strategies for data analytics in acquisitions. The recent RAND report found inefficiencies in access to acquisition data within DOD, with personnel often not receiving their preferred data in a timely manner. Balancing data-sharing for efficiency with information security concerns is a challenge that Congress may need to address."
