Congress finds that the economic health of the United States relies on a strong automotive industry, historically accounting for 20% of retail spending. Automotive sales peaked in 2006-2008 but have since declined, with annual rates below 10,000,000 units. The automotive new vehicle dealers industry in the United States made significant contributions to the national economy in 2008. With approximately 20,000 dealers, the industry generated $576 billion in total sales, accounting for 14.6% of total retail sales. Employing over 1 million people, dealerships had an average of 53 employees per dealership, with an average annual salary of $48,963. This resulted in a national payroll of over $52 billion and millions in tax revenue for State and local governments. The new-vehicle dealer industry contributes significantly to the national economy by generating billions in sales, employing over a million people, and providing millions in tax revenue. Preserving the viability of dealerships is crucial for the success of automobile manufacturers, consumer confidence, and the automotive manufacturing industry.
