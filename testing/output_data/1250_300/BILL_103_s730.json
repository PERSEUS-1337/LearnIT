    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that Canadian grain exports under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement have caused financial losses to American farmers and increased the costs of domestic farmer support programs. The agreement did not address the issue of Canadian grain exports exceeding the capacity of the US market, leading to ongoing damage to US farmers. The United States has not made progress on consultations with Canada regarding the price setting policy of the Canadian Wheat Board and the exclusion of agricultural goods from transport rates established under Canada's Western Grain Transportation Act. The United States has failed to make progress on consultations with Canada regarding the price setting policy of the Canadian Wheat Board and the exclusion of agricultural goods from transport rates under Canada's Western Grain Transportation Act. This has led to a flawed binational panel decision that undermines the Article 701(3) of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. TITLE I--GRAIN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS\n\nSEC. 101. PRICE TRANSPARENCY.\n\nThe President must negotiate with Canada to determine the price of agricultural goods sold by the Canadian Wheat Board to the US. If negotiations fail within 120 days, Canada will be considered in violation of the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, leading to a suspension of Canadian grain imports until successful negotiations are completed.\n\nSEC. 102. RAIL TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDY. SEC. 102. RAIL TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDY. The President must negotiate with Canada to exclude agricultural goods shipped via east coast ports for consumption in the US from Canada's Western Grain Transportation Act rates. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain benefiting from these rates will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. SEC. 103. ACQUISITION PRICE OF GRAIN. The President must negotiate with Canada to clarify the meaning of \"acquisition price\" in the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement to include transportation subsidies, payments by the Canadian Wheat Board, and other related costs. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. SEC. 104. Federal agencies must provide technical assistance to petitioners in countervailing duty cases regarding Canadian subsidies for wheat and barley exports to the US. TITLE II--AGRICULTURAL TRADE PROGRAMS SEC. 201. Export Enhancement Program to promote grain exports. Section 301(b) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to promote grain exports from the United States by allowing exporters to compete effectively with Canadian grain producers, considering transportation subsidies and pricing strategies. The amendment to Section 301(b) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 aims to counteract the sale of wheat by the Canadian Wheat Board at a price lower than the full acquisition cost, until an agreement is reached with the Government of Canada to ensure fair pricing practices. The amendment aims to prevent the Canadian Wheat Board from selling wheat below full acquisition cost until an agreement is reached with the Government of Canada for fair pricing. SEC. 202. AGRICULTURAL EXPORT PROGRAM PROTECTION. Amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 by adding a new subtitle for Agricultural Export Program Protection, including definitions. The term 'agricultural trade program' refers to various export promotion and international food aid programs administered by the Commodity Credit Corporation, excluding specific programs under different acts. The Assistance Act of 1954, the Agricultural Act of 1949, and the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act are referenced. The term 'covered foreign commodity' includes wheat, feed grains, or soybeans imported into the US. 'Entry' refers to the import or withdrawal from warehouse. 'Person' includes exporters and participants in agricultural trade programs. The 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. 'United States agricultural commodity' is defined as per the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978. SEC. 1582. Monitoring of domestic uses of certain foreign commodities. SEC. 1582 requires an end-use certificate for covered foreign commodities and quarterly reports from consignees certifying usage and purpose. The end-use certificate and quarterly report must include the importer and consignee's name and address, country of origin of the commodity, and any other information required by the Secretary. The end-use certificate and quarterly report must include the consignee's name and address, country of origin of the commodity, class, quantity, purpose of use, and transporter information. The quarterly report also requires information on end-use certificates held by the consignee and the quantity of the commodity for each certificate. The quarterly report must include the consignee's name, address, country of origin, quantity, purpose of use, and transporter information. It should also detail the end-use certificates held by the consignee, quantity used, exports, commingling with US commodities, transfers to subsequent consignees, and changes in end-use. The Secretary may require reporting of sales price for enforcement purposes. Confidentiality of purchasers must be ensured. Entry of foreign commodities requires presentation of an end-use certificate. The Commissioner of Customs requires an end-use certificate for the entry of covered foreign commodities. Penalties for violations include customs penalties and civil penalties up to $10,000. The Secretary will establish necessary regulations for enforcement, including quarterly reports. SEC. 1583. Compliance provisions under the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 apply to programs authorized in this subtitle. SEC. 1584. Suspension or debarment for using foreign agricultural commodities in certain trade programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation must offer a hearing before suspending or debarring a person from participating in an agricultural trade program for using a foreign agricultural commodity in violation of program terms. The Corporation may waive suspension or debarment if the person proves the use was unintentional and the quantity used was less than 1% of the total commodity involved. The Commodity Credit Corporation may waive suspension or debarment for using a foreign agricultural commodity in violation of program terms if the quantity used was less than 1% of the total commodity involved. Any waiver of suspension or debarment will not affect the person's liability for other penalties imposed under an agricultural trade program. This section and the amendment made by this section will become effective 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act. The Commodity Credit Corporation may waive suspension or debarment for using a foreign agricultural commodity in violation of program terms if the quantity used was less than 1% of the total commodity involved. Any waiver of suspension or debarment will not affect liability for other penalties imposed under an agricultural trade program."
