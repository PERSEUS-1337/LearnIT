    "content": "The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" aims to expedite wildfire prevention projects on Federal lands to reduce the risk of wildfires and protect endangered species. It provides efficiency tools to streamline projects and includes provisions for public review and environmental analysis. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines terms like \"at-risk community\" and \"at-risk forest\" to identify areas with high wildfire risk on Federal lands. It also outlines the definition of an \"authorized wildfire prevention project\" to expedite measures for wildfire prevention. The term \"authorized wildfire prevention project\" refers to measures developed for hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, restoration, watershed protection, and endangered species habitat on Federal lands. This project may include activities like livestock grazing and timber harvest for these purposes. The term \"authorized wildfire prevention project\" refers to measures developed for hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, restoration, watershed protection, and endangered species habitat on Federal lands. It excludes land where vegetation removal is prohibited by Federal law unless it is in an inventoried roadless area or wilderness study area. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land and the Secretary of the Interior for public lands. \"Threatened and endangered species habitat\" refers to Federal land with identified natural fire regimes. The term \"threatened and endangered species habitat\" on Federal lands refers to areas important for endangered or threatened species, identified in species recovery plans or Federal Register notices. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZED WILDFIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. Authorized wildfire prevention projects will be implemented in at-risk forests and on threatened and endangered species habitat to reduce surface, ladder, and canopy fuels. Projects on endangered species habitat aim to enhance protection from wildfires and comply with species recovery plan guidelines. Projects in at-risk forests focus on prevention activities. In authorized wildfire prevention projects, activities such as timber harvesting, thinning, and domestic livestock grazing are utilized to reduce fuel loads and prevent wildfires. These projects aim to move Federal land towards better condition classes and do not require revisions to existing land management plans. The Secretary is not required to revise land management plans for wildfire prevention projects. Public petitions for land designation must be reviewed within 60 days. SEC. 5. PUBLIC REVIEW AND ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. The Secretary must publish a notice of proposed wildfire prevention projects in the Federal Register, allowing the public to submit written comments within 30 days. Within 60 days of the notice, the final project will be designated after considering any received comments, with another 30-day comment period for the final designated project. The Secretary must comply with environmental laws for wildfire prevention projects, including the National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act. Special rules apply if projects involve timber harvesting or grazing, requiring an environmental assessment within 30 days of publishing the notice. The Secretary must comply with environmental laws for wildfire prevention projects, including the National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act. For projects involving timber harvesting or grazing, an environmental assessment must be prepared within 30 days of publishing the notice. Failure to meet the deadline deems the project compliant with all NEPA requirements. Project lengths are specified for grazing (10 years) and timber harvest (20 years), and there is no requirement to study alternatives for the proposed agency action. Compliance with this section deems projects compliant with various environmental laws, including NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, and others, for a minimum of 20 years. No requirement to study alternatives for proposed agency actions. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW. Administrative review follows special process under Healthy Forests Restoration Act. Judicial review follows specific section of the Act. SEC. 7. THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES DESIGNATIONS. Secretary must assess impact on forest fuel loads before listing species under Endangered Species Act. Recovery plans must include wildfire risk assessment."
