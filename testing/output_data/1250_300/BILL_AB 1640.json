    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code is amended to apply to all state and local public retirement systems and their participating employers, including various specific systems and individual retirement plans offered by public employers. The administration of these requirements must comply with the Internal Revenue Code and the California Constitution. The article exempts certain entities and public employees from its application based on specific criteria, such as being described in certain sections of the California Constitution or having their interests protected under federal law. Retirement plans approved before January 1, 2013, by excluded entities are not affected by the article. The article exempts certain public employers from its application if they participate in a multiemployer plan authorized by the federal Taft-Hartley Act before January 1, 2013, and regulated by ERISA. The benefit plan applies to new public employees as defined in Section 7522.04. Individuals who switched public employers after January 1, 2013, are subject to the retirement plan available to employees hired before December 31, 2012. An individual who changed employment positions before January 1, 2013, and became subject to a different defined benefit plan in a different public retirement system offered by their employer shall be subject to that defined benefit plan as it would have been available to employees first employed on or before December 31, 2012. If a public employer offered a lower cost defined benefit pension plan before January 1, 2013, they can continue to offer it instead of the required formula. Any new defined benefit formula adopted after January 1, 2013, must meet certain requirements or be approved by the retirement system's chief actuary, retirement board, and the Legislature. New members can only participate in the lower cost formula or an approved one. If a public employer offers a defined contribution plan before January 1, 2013, they can continue to do so instead of the required defined benefit pension plan. Any new defined benefit plan adopted after January 1, 2013, must meet specific requirements or be approved by the retirement system's chief actuary, retirement board, and the Legislature. New members can only join the existing defined contribution plan or an approved plan. If the Cities of Brea and Fullerton form a joint powers authority after January 1, 2013, they can provide employees with the same defined benefit plan they had before. Other cities in Orange County can join this authority by January 1, 2017, with a limit of three cities. On or before January 1, 2017, a city in Orange County contiguous to Brea or Fullerton may join a joint powers authority, with a limit of three cities. New members must participate in a defined benefit plan that complies with the requirements of the article. The Judges\u2019 Retirement Systems are exempt from certain benefit and compensation limitations. Public retirement systems must modify their plans to comply with the article's requirements by January 1, 2013."
