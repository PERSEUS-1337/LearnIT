    "content": "The \"Travel America Now Act of 2001\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. Congress finds that prior to September 11, 2001, the travel and tourism industry in the United States employed over 19 million Americans with a payroll of $171.5 billion. The industry generated over $582 billion in expenditures in 2000, contributing $99.6 billion in tax revenues. Additionally, the industry created a $14 billion trade surplus and is working to ensure safe travel post-9/11. Urgent measures are needed to support the industry and maintain traveler confidence. Increased consumer spending on travel and tourism is crucial for revitalizing the US economy by keeping people employed and generating cash flow. The public should be encouraged to travel for both personal and business reasons to stimulate economic recovery. SEC. 25C. PERSONAL TRAVEL CREDIT added to the Internal Revenue Code to encourage travel for economic recovery. The tax code allows individuals a credit for qualified personal travel expenses incurred between the enactment date and January 1, 2002. The maximum credit is $500 for individuals and $1,000 for joint filers. Qualified expenses include travel and lodging but exclude meals and entertainment. The tax code allows a credit for qualified personal travel expenses, excluding meals and entertainment. A qualifying personal trip involves travel within the US, at least 100 miles from home, with an overnight stay at a commercial lodging facility. The tax code allows a credit for qualified personal travel expenses, excluding meals and entertainment, in connection with a trade or business or activity for the production of income. Special rules include denial of credit to dependents and the requirement to substantiate expenses. No double benefit is allowed for expenses eligible for the credit. The term 'commercial lodging facility' includes hotels, motels, resorts, rooming houses, and campgrounds. The tax code denies double benefits for expenses eligible for a credit under subsection (c)(1). A conforming amendment is made to the table of sections in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. SEC. 25C: Personal travel credit effective for taxable years after enactment. SEC. 4: Temporary increase in deduction for business meals and entertainment to 100 percent until January 1, 2002. SEC. 5: Net operating loss carryback for travel and tourism industry. The amendment allows travel and tourism industry losses to be carried back as net operating losses for five years preceding the loss year. The new subsection (j) introduces rules for travel and tourism industry losses, defining \"travel or tourism loss\" and \"travel or tourism business\" for tax purposes. The new subsection (j) introduces rules for travel and tourism industry losses, including the operation of airports, travel agent services, convention facilities, and other specified services as determined by the Secretary. Taxpayers can elect a 5-year carryback without considering certain provisions. The new subsection (j) introduces rules for travel and tourism industry losses, allowing taxpayers to elect a 5-year carryback without considering certain provisions. The election must be made by the due date for filing the taxpayer's return and is irrevocable for the taxable year. Additionally, related taxpayers within a controlled group of corporations may credit the loss against taxable income earned during the 5-year carryback period. These amendments apply to taxable years ending before, on, or after the enactment of this Act. The Act is based on Congress's power to levy taxes as outlined in article I, section 8 of the US Constitution."
