    "content": "More than 53,000 commercial vessels travel the world's waters, regulated by international protocols and U.S. laws to prevent pollution. The maritime industry, including the cruise sector, faces challenges in enforcement and environmental impact scrutiny. Passenger ships make up 13% of the global shipping fleet, with the cruise industry contributing significantly to the U.S. economy. The cruise industry, comprising about 13% of the global shipping fleet, is a significant contributor to the U.S. economy. In 2010, cruises hosted 14.3 million passengers, with over 230 ships in the worldwide fleet. The majority of these ships are foreign-flagged, with Liberia and Panama being popular choices. The industry continues to grow, with new, larger, and more luxurious ships being added each year. The cruise industry has seen an increase in ship size over the past two decades, with vessels now exceeding 1,050 feet in length and weighing over 130,000 tons. These \"floating cities\" generate large amounts of sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, solid waste, and oily bilge water during a typical one-week voyage, posing risks to human health and the environment if not properly treated and disposed of. The cruise industry generates significant amounts of sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, solid waste, and oily bilge water during voyages, posing risks to human health and the environment. Environmental advocates have raised concerns about the adequacy of laws for managing these wastes, with weak enforcement noted. A 2000 GAO report highlighted issues of cruise vessel compliance with environmental requirements, revealing 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters between 1993 and 1998, primarily involving oil or oil-based products. The GAO report found that 72% of illegal discharges from cruise ships were accidental, 15% intentional, and 13% undetermined. Cruise ships accounted for 4% of all illegal discharge cases by foreign-flag ships. Environmental groups petitioned the EPA in 2000 to address pollution from cruise ships, leading to investigations and recommendations for waste management. In response to petitions from environmental groups, the EPA studied cruise ship discharges and waste management. A 2008 report summarized waste streams, data collection findings, and options to address ship discharges. The report highlighted the various types of waste streams and contaminants generated by cruise ships, as well as the complex body of international and domestic laws regulating pollution from cruise ships. The report discusses the various waste streams generated by cruise ships and the complex regulatory framework governing pollution from cruise ships. Environmental groups have pushed for stricter regulations, but legislation to control wastewater and other discharges has not been passed in Congress. Legislation introduced in the 111th Congress (Clean Cruise Ship Act, H.R. 3888 and S. 1820) did not progress. Cruise ships produce various waste streams, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, oily bilge water, ballast water, and solid waste, which can harm the marine environment. While cruise ships are a small part of the shipping industry, their waste can pose risks to human health and aquatic life. Sewage, graywater, and solid waste are of particular concern due to the large number of passengers and crew on board. Cruise ships pose a significant environmental concern due to the large volumes of sewage they generate, which can contain harmful bacteria and nutrients. Discharges of untreated sewage can contaminate fisheries and shellfish beds, leading to public health risks. Additionally, nutrients in sewage can promote excessive algal growth, depleting oxygen in the water and causing harm to aquatic life. Cruise ships generate significant amounts of sewage and graywater, which can contain harmful pollutants like fecal coliform bacteria, detergents, and oil. Untreated graywater from cruise ships can have higher levels of pollutants compared to domestic wastewater. This pollution can lead to adverse environmental effects, including excessive algal growth and harm to aquatic life. Graywater on cruise ships, approximately 67 gallons/day/person, poses environmental risks due to nutrient concentrations. It accounts for 90%-95% of liquid waste. Solid waste includes glass, paper, aluminum, and plastics, which can harm marine life if not properly managed. Up to 75% of solid waste is incinerated on board, with ash discharged at sea. Marine organisms are at risk from entanglement with plastics and other waste. Cruise ships generate a significant amount of solid waste, with each passenger producing two pounds of non-hazardous waste per day. Large cruise ships can generate up to 8 tons of solid waste during a one-week cruise, contributing to 24% of the solid waste generated by vessels worldwide. Most cruise ship garbage is treated on board and discharged overboard, putting a strain on port reception facilities. Additionally, hazardous wastes are produced from various on-board activities. Cruise ships produce hazardous wastes from various on-board activities, including photo processing, dry-cleaning, and equipment cleaning. These wastes contain substances such as hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and chemicals that can be toxic to marine organisms if not managed carefully. Oil leaks from engine spaces can mix with water in the bilge, posing environmental risks. Oil leaks from engine and machinery spaces on ships mix with water in the bilge, containing harmful substances like oil, gasoline, and byproducts from petroleum breakdown. These substances can harm marine life and pose health risks if ingested. Bilge water also contains solid wastes, pollutants, and toxic chemicals from engine cleaning activities. Large vessels may have additional waste streams with sludge and oily water mixtures that can enter the bilge. A typical large cruise ship generates eight metric tons of oily bilge water every 24 hours. Large cruise ships generate an average of eight metric tons of oily bilge water daily, which needs to be extracted and treated before discharge. If untreated, oily bilge water can harm marine life when discharged into the ocean, making it a common source of oil pollution from cruise ships according to the EPA. Several cruise lines have faced environmental violations related to this issue. Ballast water is crucial for stabilizing ships, especially cargo ships, by compensating for changes in weight. However, the discharge of ballast water often contains harmful biological materials, including invasive species that can cause ecological and economic damage. This poses public health and environmental risks, as well as significant economic costs to industries such as water and power utilities, commercial and recreational fisheries. Ballast water discharges are the main source of invasive species in U.S. marine waters, leading to public health, environmental, and economic risks for industries like water and power utilities, fisheries, agriculture, and tourism. The economic cost of pest mollusk introduction alone is estimated at $2.2 billion annually. Cruise ships contribute to air pollution through diesel engines burning high sulfur fuel, emitting harmful pollutants classified as human carcinogens by the EPA. Further research is needed to understand the role of cruise ships in introducing non-native species. Marine diesel engines emit harmful pollutants like carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides, contributing to air pollution and climate change. EPA classifies diesel exhaust as a likely human carcinogen. Ocean-going vessels are significant sources of nitrogen oxide, particulate, and sulfur dioxide emissions in the United States. International shipping is estimated to contribute 2.7% of global carbon dioxide emissions. States and localities are increasingly concerned about the impact of commercial marine vessels on regional air quality. Vessels emit black carbon and nitrogen oxides, contributing to climate change. Environmental pressures on maritime vessels come from states and localities assessing their impact on regional air quality. Cruise ship emissions can have significant local impacts in coastal areas. Shipboard incinerators burn waste, producing ash and toxic emissions. Waste streams on cruise ships are governed by international protocols and U.S. laws, with overlaps and gaps in coverage. Cruise ship waste streams are regulated by international protocols and U.S. laws, with overlaps and gaps in coverage. The International Maritime Organization sets standards for vessel safety and pollution prevention. Cruise ships flagged under MARPOL signatory countries must adhere to its requirements. The International Maritime Organization's Annexes of the Convention cover various sources of pollution from ships, including regulations for oil, noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage, garbage, and emissions. Compliance with these Annexes is voluntary and requires ratification by sovereign states for binding standards. The International Maritime Organization's Annexes set limits on emissions from marine vessels and prohibit deliberate emissions of ozone-depleting substances. Compliance with the Annexes is voluntary and requires ratification by member countries. The United States has ratified several Annexes, with the flag state responsible for certifying compliance with pollution prevention standards. IMO has established conventions for issues like ballast water management and passenger safety. The United States implements MARPOL pollution prevention standards through domestic laws, including the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS). In 2006, the Senate ratified Annex VI, regulating air pollution, and in 2008, Congress approved legislation for EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard to implement the standards. The U.S. also participated in international negotiations to strengthen MARPOL Annex VI. Legislation (P.L. 110-280) was enacted to implement MARPOL Annex VI standards through regulations by EPA in consultation with the U.S. Coast Guard. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) applies to all U.S.-flagged and foreign-flagged vessels in U.S. waters. The Coast Guard is responsible for enforcing regulations under APPS, which is separate from other environmental laws. Implementation challenges arise from the international nature of maritime shipping, allowing countries to verify compliance and detain non-compliant ships. The U.S. can also enforce MARPOL standards directly. The United States can enforce MARPOL standards directly against foreign-flagged ships for pollution discharge incidents within its jurisdiction. Coordination between agencies is required for enforcement, with the Coast Guard, State Department, and flag states involved. No single agency oversees all functions related to cruise ships in U.S. waters, with the Coast Guard, EPA, and Department of Justice playing key roles. The U.S. government agencies responsible for regulating cruise ship discharges include the Coast Guard, EPA, Department of Justice, Department of State, NOAA, and APHIS. The Clean Water Act is the main law governing pollution in U.S. waters. States and localities also have some responsibilities in this area. The Clean Water Act is the principal U.S. law for limiting polluting activity in water bodies. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program controls pollutant discharges, including from vessels. Sewage discharges from cruise ships are exempt from NPDES permits but are prohibited from being dumped untreated into U.S. navigable waters within 3 miles of shore under Section 312 of the Clean Water Act, enforced by EPA and the Coast Guard. Under Section 312 of the Clean Water Act, vessels are prohibited from discharging untreated sewage into U.S. navigable waters within 3 miles of shore. This includes cruise ships, which must have marine sanitation devices (MSDs) to prevent untreated sewage discharge. The EPA sets performance standards for MSDs, while the Coast Guard regulates MSD design and operation. Large vessels, like cruise ships, use Type II or Type III MSDs. Type II MSDs treat waste before discharge, meeting specific limits, while Type III MSDs store waste for later disposal. Beyond 3 miles, raw sewage can be discharged. The regulations for marine sanitation devices (MSDs) require treated waste discharge within specific limits. Type III MSDs store waste for later treatment, while Type I MSDs disinfect sewage before discharge. Critics highlight deficiencies in the regulations, as they only cover bacterial contaminants and suspended solids, neglecting other pollutants like chemicals and heavy metals released by cruise ships. The NPDES permit program regulates a wider range of pollutants from point sources, including chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals, oil, and grease, in addition to bacterial contaminants and suspended solids. Coast Guard enforcement of MSD rules has been criticized for lacking thorough inspections of sewage treatment equipment on cruise ships. The Coast Guard faces challenges in detecting environmental violations on cruise ships due to focus on safety, large ship size, limited time and staff, and lack of surprise in inspections. Resources have shifted towards homeland security post-9/11, reducing time for vessel inspections. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from ships, requiring sewage treatment plants, comminuting systems, or holding tanks on cruise ships. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from vessels, requiring sewage treatment systems or holding tanks. The requirements are minimal, with no specific performance standards prescribed. Vessels must treat sewage within three miles of shore with a certified system, and between three and 12 miles with maceration or chlorination. Discharges beyond 12 miles are unrestricted, with the option to meet less stringent requirements in certain jurisdictions. In U.S. waters, cruise ships and other vessels must comply with regulations implementing Section 312 of the Clean Water Act. Some cruise ships use Advanced Wastewater Treatment (AWT) systems for sewage treatment, which are effective in removing various substances. Section 312 also establishes no-discharge zones for vessel sewage to protect the environment. No-discharge zones (NDZs) can be established by states to prohibit the discharge of sewage from vessels into certain waters to protect the environment. States must apply to the EPA under three categories for NDZ designation, based on environmental protection needs and the availability of pumpout facilities. NDZs have been designated in 26 states, including inland states, for various reasons such as protecting environmentally sensitive areas like shellfish beds or coral reefs. No-discharge zones (NDZs) can be established by states to prohibit sewage discharge from vessels into specific waters for environmental protection. EPA identified options to address sewage from cruise ships in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report, including revising discharge standards and requiring sampling of wastewater treatment equipment. Graywater is not defined as a pollutant under current federal law, and there are no separate effluent standards for graywater discharges. Under current federal law, graywater is not defined as a pollutant, and there are no separate effluent standards for graywater discharges. However, in Alaska, graywater must be treated before discharge into state waters. EPA issued a general permit for large commercial vessels, including cruise ships, with restrictions on graywater discharges. National Marine Sanctuaries Act allows NOAA to restrict graywater discharges in designated areas to protect sensitive ecosystems. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act authorizes NOAA to designate areas where graywater discharges may be restricted to protect sensitive ecosystems. EPA identified options for addressing graywater discharges, such as establishing standards, geographic restrictions, monitoring, and penalties for non-compliance. Cruise ship discharges of solid waste are governed by the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act. The Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) regulates the disposal of materials at sea for cruise ships and other vessels. It prohibits the transportation of garbage for dumping without a permit and dumping materials into U.S. territorial seas or ocean waters. EPA issues permits for sea disposal, excluding dredged material handled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Cruise ships are not required to have an MPRSA permit for solid waste discharge beyond U.S. jurisdiction. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) also applies, prohibiting garbage discharge within certain distances from shore and plastic discharge anywhere. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) prohibits garbage discharge within specific distances from shore and plastic discharge anywhere, applying to all vessels in U.S. navigable waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The Coast Guard administers APPS, conducting inspection programs to ensure port facilities can handle offloaded solid waste. EPA has reported discharges of solid waste and plastic from cruise ships, prompting potential amendments to MARPOL Annex V. Options to address solid waste from cruise ships include enhancing on-board garbage handling technologies, implementing stronger waste management plans, and expanding port reception facilities. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) governs hazardous waste management, imposing requirements on generators, transporters, and facilities. Hazardous waste is defined by its characteristics or appearance on specific lists. Treatment facilities must have permits and comply with EPA regulations. Cruise ship owners may be generators or transporters of hazardous waste. The cruise ship industry must comply with RCRA regulations for hazardous waste management, including proper identification, storage, and disposal of hazardous wastes generated onboard. Activities such as cleaning, painting, and passenger services can result in the generation of hazardous wastes that must be offloaded for recycling or disposal in accordance with RCRA. Cruise ships must comply with RCRA regulations for managing hazardous waste generated onboard, including from activities like cleaning, painting, and passenger services. It is unclear how these regulations apply to cruise ships, as they may fall into different categories based on the amount of hazardous waste generated. Some argue for a third category with less stringent requirements. A release of hazardous substances could trigger environmental response measures. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) requires immediate notification of hazardous substance releases from vessels to the National Response Center. EPA has identified 500 hazardous substances with reportable quantities as small as 1 pound. CERCLA authorizes the President to act in response to such releases. The EPA has identified 500 hazardous wastes and issued rules on reportable quantities as small as 1 pound. CERCLA authorizes the President to take action on releases, including hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships under the Clean Water Act. The 2008 Discharge Assessment Report outlined options for addressing hazardous wastes on cruise ships. The EPA is taking steps to address hazardous waste discharge from cruise ships by prohibiting the discharge of hazardous materials into U.S. waters up to the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone. Coast Guard regulations also prohibit oil discharge within 12 miles from shore, with specific requirements for oil content and record-keeping. These measures are in addition to existing Clean Water Act regulations on oil and hazardous substance discharge from cruise ships. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) implements MARPOL Annex I concerning oil pollution, applying to all U.S. flagged ships and foreign flagged vessels in U.S. waters. Coast Guard regulations prohibit oil discharge within 12 nautical miles of land, with limited applicability to cruise ship operations. Most cruise lines restrict discharges of machinery space waste within three miles from shore. EPA identified options for addressing oily bilge water from cruise ships in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. In the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report, EPA suggested options for addressing oily bilge water from cruise ships, including establishing standards, researching alternative lubricants, treating effluents to meet specified standards, and imposing penalties for noncompliance. Conservation groups petitioned EPA in 1999 to regulate ballast water discharge due to the introduction of invasive species into U.S. waters. In January 1999, conservation organizations, fishing groups, Native American tribes, and water agencies petitioned EPA to repeal its 1973 regulation exempting ballast water discharge under the Clean Water Act. EPA rejected the petition in September 2003, citing long-standing policy and ongoing federal activities for controlling invasive species in ballast water. Environmental groups then filed a lawsuit to force EPA to rescind the regulation exempting ballast water discharges from the Clean Water Act. In response to environmental groups' lawsuit, a federal court ruled in 2005 to rescind EPA's regulation exempting ballast water discharges from Clean Water Act permitting. The court's mandate also applied to other vessel discharges like graywater and bilge water. EPA issued the Vessel General Permit in December 2008, covering around 69,000 large recreational and commercial vessels. In December 2008, EPA issued the Vessel General Permit (VGP) in response to a court order, applying to around 69,000 large recreational and commercial vessels, including tankers, freighters, barges, and cruise ships. The permit covers pollutant discharges incidental to normal operations from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length, and ballast water discharges from commercial vessels under 79 feet and commercial fishing vessels. It applies to discharges into U.S. waters in all states and territories, addressing various waste streams and pollutant discharges. The Vessel General Permit (VGP) covers pollutant discharges from large recreational and commercial vessels, including tankers, freighters, barges, and cruise ships. It includes controls for various types of pollutants such as aquatic nuisance species, nutrients, pathogens, oil and grease, metals, and toxic pollutants. Best management practices (BMPs) are used to control most waste streams, with specific requirements for ballast water and bilge water discharges. Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting are also required. Sewage discharges and toxic wastes from passenger services on cruise ships are regulated separately. The VGP regulates pollutant discharges from large vessels, including cruise ships. It includes detailed requirements for graywater and pool water discharges, with BMPs and numeric limits for fecal coliform and chlorine. Operational limits are set for nutrient-impaired waters. Legislation was considered for a national approach to ballast water discharge issues. The Clean Air Act is the main federal law addressing air quality concerns, setting health-based standards for ambient air quality and national emission standards for air pollution sources. Cruise ship emissions were unregulated until 2003 when EPA established emission standards for new marine diesel. The EPA established emission standards for new marine diesel engines on large vessels in 2003, including cruise ships, following a settlement with the environmental group Bluewater Network. The standards are equivalent to internationally negotiated standards and are part of several EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act. The EPA established emission standards for new marine diesel engines on large vessels in 2003, including cruise ships, as part of regulations under the Clean Air Act. The rule aimed to regulate emissions from large marine vessel engines and facilitate international efforts through the IMO. Environmental groups criticized the exclusion of foreign-flagged vessels from the rules, but the rules were upheld in federal court in June 2004. EPA stated it would consider including foreign vessels in future rulemaking. The EPA faced criticism for excluding foreign-flagged vessels from marine diesel engine rules, which were upheld in federal court in June 2004. EPA mentioned considering including foreign vessels in future rulemaking. In October 2008, the IMO adopted amendments to establish new global nitrogen oxide and fuel sulfur standards. In December 2009, EPA made changes to the 2003 CAA rules for Category 3 marine engines to align with IMO requirements. The EPA rule establishes emissions standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide for Category 3 marine engines, aligning with amended IMO requirements. It applies to newly built engines on U.S.-flagged vessels. Foreign vessels are subject to nitrogen oxide limits under MARPOL Annex VI. The IMO approved designating U.S. Caribbean waters as an ECA, with more stringent emission limitations for sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter starting in 2014. Laws and regulations vary by geographic area, such as the Clean Water Act's treatment of navigable waters. The Clean Water Act defines navigable waters as the waters of the United States, including territorial seas extending 3 miles seaward from the baseline. President Reagan's proclamation extended the territorial sea to 12 nautical miles, but it did not affect the Act's geographic reach. The contiguous zone extends from the baseline to not beyond 12 miles according to the Convention of the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone. The United States established a contiguous zone extending from the baseline to 12 miles under the Convention of the Territorial Sea. President Clinton's proclamation in 1999 expanded enforcement rights at sea to 24 nautical miles. The Clean Water Act defines the territorial sea as 3 miles wide and the contiguous zone from 3 to 12 miles. The United States laws define jurisdictional limits for ocean waters, including the territorial seas and contiguous zone. These limits determine where specific laws, such as the Clean Water Act and the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, apply to discharges of oil, hazardous substances, and sewage from vessels into navigable waters. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) addresses discharges of oil or hazardous substances into navigable waters. The MPRSA regulates ocean dumping within 12 nautical miles from the baseline. Jurisdictional considerations are complicated by differences in distance measurements between acts. In Alaska, cruise ship pollution has raised concerns due to a significant increase in passengers during the 1990s. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines faced penalties for knowingly discharging oil and hazardous substances in Alaska and other locations. The Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines admitted to discharging oil-contaminated bilge water in Alaska and other locations, leading to penalties as part of an $18 million federal plea agreement for environmental violations. Public concern prompted a program to identify cruise ship waste streams, revealing that waste treatment systems on most ships did not meet U.S. Coast Guard standards. Legislation was passed in December 2000 in response to the Alaska issues. Federal legislation passed in December 2000 established standards for cruise ships in Alaska, prohibiting discharge of untreated sewage and graywater in navigable waters. EPA was authorized to regulate sewage and graywater discharges, with temporary regulations allowing treated sewage discharge at specific conditions. The federal legislation passed in December 2000 established standards for cruise ships in Alaska, prohibiting discharge of untreated sewage and graywater in navigable waters. Vessels with systems that can treat sewage and graywater to a stricter standard are allowed to discharge treated sewage and graywater within one mile from shore and at speeds less than 6 knots. The legislation requires sampling, data collection, and recordkeeping by vessel operators for Coast Guard oversight and enforcement. Coast Guard regulations were issued in 2001 to implement the law, stipulating minimum sampling and testing procedures and providing for penalties for violations. EPA conducted a multi-year project to evaluate treatment systems for sewage and graywater discharges from large vessels. EPA conducted a multi-year project to evaluate treatment systems for sewage and graywater discharges from large cruise ships in Alaska. Sampling efforts showed that advanced wastewater treatment systems are effective in treating pathogens. EPA collaborated with the state of Alaska on various studies and distributed a survey questionnaire on the effectiveness, costs, and impacts of sewage and graywater treatment devices for large cruise vessels. The state of Alaska enacted its own law in 2001 to set standards and sampling requirements for the discharge of blackwater and graywater from cruise ships. Effluent standards for blackwater discharges by large cruise ships took effect in 2001, while standards for graywater discharges by large vessels took effect in 2003. The state of Alaska enacted laws in 2001 setting standards for cruise ship wastewater discharge. Large ships had to comply with effluent standards for blackwater in 2001 and graywater in 2003. Small ships had three years to meet all effluent standards. A scientific panel was established to assess the law's impact. Large ships either installed advanced wastewater treatment systems or held wastewater for discharge outside Alaskan waters. By 2006, 23 of 28 large cruise ships in Alaskan waters had advanced systems, improving wastewater quality. Small ships had not made similar upgrades. As of 2006, large cruise ships in Alaskan waters have improved wastewater quality with advanced treatment systems. Small ships, however, have not upgraded their systems, leading to pollutants exceeding state standards. Alaska voters approved a $50 head tax per passenger for cruise lines, along with fines for violations and new environmental regulations. Alaska voters approved a $50 head tax per passenger for cruise lines, increasing fines for wastewater violations, and mandating new environmental regulations for cruise ships. Revenues from the taxes will go to local communities affected by tourism and into public services and facilities used by cruise ships. Supporters argue that the cruise industry does not pay enough in taxes to compensate for its environmental harm, while opponents fear it will hurt Alaska's competitiveness for tourism. Two cruise ship lines have reportedly stopped operating in Alaskan waters due to the initiative. In 2009, Alaska enacted legislation giving more time to implement stringent wastewater treatment standards. In April 2004, Maine enacted legislation regulating cruise ship discharges into coastal waters. The law applies to large cruise ships and requires advanced wastewater treatment systems, compliance with federal discharge laws, and permits from the state Department of Environmental Protection. Maine also applied for No Discharge Zones to prohibit blackwater discharges. EPA approved the NDZ request for Casco Bay in June. Maine enacted legislation in 2004 to regulate cruise ship discharges, requiring advanced wastewater treatment systems and permits. EPA approved the state's No Discharge Zone request for Casco Bay. California also passed laws in 2004 and 2006 to prohibit various types of ship discharges, including graywater, sewage sludge, oil bilge water, hazardous wastes, and invasive species in ballast water. California S.B. 497 in 2006 mandated ballast water performance standards by January 2008, requiring ship operators to remove invasive species by 2020. States like Florida, Washington, and Hawaii have agreements with the cruise industry for waste management practices. For example, Florida requires cruise lines to eliminate wastewater discharges within 4 nautical miles, report hazardous waste annually, and undergo environmental inspections by the U.S. Coast Guard. Washington also signed a memorandum allowing cruise ships to discharge treated wastewater. In April 2004, the Washington Department of Ecology, Northwest Cruise Ship Association, and Port of Seattle signed a memorandum allowing cruise ships to discharge wastewater treated with advanced systems into state waters. Environmental advocates criticize voluntary agreements for lacking enforcement, but states argue they can have more rigorous requirements. The Department of Ecology reported in June 2009 that cruise ships mostly complied with the MOU to stop discharging untreated wastewater during the 2008 sailing season. The cruise ship industry has adopted waste management practices to protect water quality, including guidelines for discharging graywater and blackwater only while underway and at least 4 miles from shore. Members of the Cruise Lines International Association have implemented Safety Management System plans for enhanced wastewater systems. The cruise ship industry has adopted waste management practices to protect water quality, including guidelines for discharging hazardous wastes at least 4 miles from shore. CLIA's cruise line companies have implemented Safety Management System plans for enhanced wastewater systems and increased auditing oversight. The industry is also working on developing technologies for lower emission turbine engines and ballast water management. Environmental groups commend the industry for improved management practices but prefer enforceable standards over voluntary ones. The industry has partnered with Conservation International to form the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance to work on conservation efforts in coastal areas. In December 2003, the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance announced conservation efforts in four areas to protect biodiversity in coastal regions, including improving technology for wastewater management on cruise ships and educating vendors to reduce environmental impacts. In 2006, CLIA and CI collaborated on a project to integrate sensitive marine areas into cruise line navigational charts to protect critical ecosystems. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. committed to retrofitting its fleet with advanced wastewater treatment technology in 2004, following efforts by Oceana to promote ocean protection measures. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. committed to retrofitting all vessels in its 29-ship fleet with advanced wastewater treatment technology in 2004, becoming the first cruise line to do so completely. The company's efforts were influenced by environmental group Oceana and past federal enforcement actions for environmental violations. Concerns about cruise ship pollution raise issues for Congress in areas such as laws and regulations, research needs, and oversight. More assessment is needed to determine if current measures are adequate, and bringing these issues to national priority for resources is a challenge. The challenge lies in prioritizing national resources to address cruise ship pollution issues. Existing laws and regulations may not adequately manage all waste streams, such as graywater, which has been found to be contaminated with fecal coliform, bacteria, heavy metals, and plastics. Calls for legislative changes to fill gaps and strengthen requirements have been made, including by the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy in 2004. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended clear, uniform requirements for controlling wastewater discharge from large passenger vessels. The Clean Cruise Ship Act proposed legislative changes to prohibit cruise vessels from discharging sewage, graywater, or bilge. No legislative action occurred on the bills introduced in Congress. The Clean Cruise Ship Act, introduced in the 111th Congress, aimed to amend the Clean Water Act to prohibit cruise vessels from discharging sewage, graywater, or bilge water into U.S. waters. It would require wastewater treatment on cruise ships and impose passenger fees for enforcement. Environmental advocates supported the legislation, while industry groups argued against targeting a small percentage of ships. The Clean Cruise Ship Act proposed banning cruise vessels from discharging sewage, graywater, or bilge water into U.S. waters. Environmental advocates backed the legislation, while industry groups argued against targeting a small percentage of ships. Some states have passed laws regulating cruise ship discharges, potentially prompting federal legislation to harmonize state approaches. Congress is also considering EPA's efforts to manage cruise ship waste, with the agency collecting information but not yet proposing rules. The EPA has been collecting information on cruise ship waste streams and assessing the need for additional standards. In December 2008, they released a report examining sewage, graywater, oily bilge water, solid waste, and hazardous waste from cruise ships. The report discusses current actions by the federal government but states that EPA has not determined necessary options or legal authority to implement them. Other issues include harmonizing U.S. laws on cruise ship jurisdiction and defining \"cruise ship\" consistently across federal and state laws. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy highlighted the need for research to understand the impact of waste generated by cruise ships and the effectiveness of control technologies. Research directions include studying pollutant transport in the marine environment and assessing the impacts of vessel pollution. Research directions for the Coast Guard, EPA, NOAA, and other entities on vessel pollution include studying pollutant transport in the marine environment, small passenger vessel practices, disposal options for concentrated sludge, cumulative impacts on sensitive ecosystems, impacts of vessel air emissions, and possible research options identified in the 2008 Cruise Ship Assessment Report. Increasing studies on human health and environmental effects of cruise ship discharges, focusing on geographic areas impacted by these discharges and potential cumulative impacts. Existing laws and regulations may not be adequately enforced, leading to the need for monitoring discharges to evaluate current standards. Increased federal oversight by the Coast Guard and other agencies is necessary for maintenance and operation of pollution prevention equipment, prevention of falsifying oil record books, and proper off-loading of garbage and oily sludge. Coast Guard has primary enforcement responsibility for federal programs on cruise ship pollution. The Coast Guard is responsible for enforcing federal programs on cruise ship pollution, including verifying off-loading of garbage and oily sludge. There are concerns about the adequacy of Coast Guard resources for homeland security missions. Possible enforcement options include improving monitoring, rewarding passengers for detecting illegal activities, and charging a fee for onboard marine engineers to observe waste treatment practices. Referral processes for cruise ship violations to other countries may need improvement. In its 2000 report, the GAO found issues with the referral process for cruise ship violations to other countries, recommending that the Coast Guard collaborate with the IMO to ensure member countries respond to pollution cases. The Coast Guard was also advised to follow up on alleged pollution cases occurring outside U.S. jurisdiction."
