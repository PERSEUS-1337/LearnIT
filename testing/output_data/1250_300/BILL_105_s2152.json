    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Microcredit for Self-Sufficiency Act of 1998\". It includes findings and purposes. Congress finds that over 1 billion people in the developing world live in severe poverty, with high child mortality rates and preventable deaths from malnutrition and disease. Women in poverty face greater workloads and fewer opportunities than men, but aiding the poorest, especially women, can positively impact family incomes, child nutrition, health, and education. Many women in the developing world lack stable employment and turn to self-employment for livelihood. The poor in the developing world, especially women, lack stable employment and social safety nets, leading many to rely on self-employment for income. However, they struggle to access credit at reasonable rates, often resorting to high-interest loans. An international Microcredit Summit aimed to expand credit access to 100 million of the world's poorest families, particularly women, by 2005, benefiting nearly half of the world's 1 billion absolute poor. The Microcredit Summit aimed to provide credit access to 100 million of the world's poorest families, especially women, by 2005. This goal would benefit nearly half of the world's 1 billion absolute poor by allowing them to expand their incomes and businesses through self-sustaining microcredit programs. Organizations like the Grameen Bank have been successful in lending directly to the very poor, with repayment rates averaging 95 percent or higher. Microcredit institutions not only reduce poverty but also decrease dependency on foreign assistance. Microcredit institutions reduce poverty and dependency on foreign assistance by leveraging resources and providing credit and training. AID's Microenterprise Initiative in 1994 aimed to expand funding for microenterprise programs, with a goal to support credit programs by the end of fiscal year 1996. AID's microenterprise programs received $137,000,000 in funding for fiscal year 1994, with a goal to allocate half of resources for loans under $300 by fiscal year 1996. However, in fiscal year 1996, funding decreased to $111,000,000, with only 39 percent benefiting the poorest. Increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the poorest is crucial to achieving the Microcredit Summit's goal. AID's funding for microenterprise activities should be expanded to $160,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 to align with the growing capacity of microcredit institutions in the developing world. Providing the United States share of global investment for the Microcredit Summit will require a modest increase in funding for international microcredit programs. To achieve the Microcredit Summit's goal, the United States needs to increase funding for microcredit programs, focusing on institutions serving the poorest. Assistance is needed to expand successful microcredit institutions and develop their capacity. PVOs and NGOs have shown competence in developing networks of local microcredit institutions for the very poor. AID should prioritize investing in these organizations. To achieve the Microcredit Summit's goal, the United States needs to increase funding for microcredit programs, focusing on institutions serving the poorest. AID should prioritize investing in PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations to expand successful microcredit institutions and develop a global infrastructure for providing financial services to the world's poorest families. AID can provide leadership in supporting microenterprise for the poorest and improve coordination efforts to promote best practices in providing financial services to the poor. The purposes of this Act are to continue and expand AID's commitment to develop microcredit institutions. The Act aims to develop microcredit institutions, make microenterprise development a key economic growth strategy, support US PVOs and international NGOs in providing financial services to microentrepreneurs, and increase assistance for access to credit for the poorest, especially women in developing countries. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"AID\" refers to the United States Agency for International Development. The terms \"microcredit\", \"microenterprise\", \"poverty lending portion of mixed programs\", and \"mixed programs\" are defined under the 1994 Microenterprise Initiative of AID. The term \"PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations\" includes private voluntary organizations and international, regional, or national nongovernmental organizations active in the region or country where the project is located, with the capacity to develop and implement microenterprise programs for the poor, especially women. The President, through the Administrator of AID, is authorized to establish programs providing credit for microenterprises in developing countries. Programs will be carried out by US PVOs and other organizations, including credit unions and private financial intermediaries. Eligibility criteria will be set by the Administrator based on lack of access to formal financial sector and poverty levels of recipients. The entity providing credit focuses on recipients with limited access to formal financial services, targeting the poorest individuals, especially women. They aim to achieve financial self-reliance by charging realistic interest rates. Funding of $160,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 is allocated for microenterprise assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act. In addition to funds allocated for microenterprise activities in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, there are specific requirements for poverty lending, support of NGOs, and a matching grant program. The funds allocated for microenterprise activities in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe include specific requirements for poverty lending, support of NGOs, and a matching grant program. At least $10,000,000 is designated for the private voluntary organizations matching grant program of AID to support United States PVOs in poverty lending. The entity described in subsection (a)(2) engages in making small loans to the poorest 50% living below the poverty line in a foreign country. SEC. 5. PROGRAM PERFORMANCE CRITERIA. The Administrator of AID is required to strengthen mechanisms for microenterprise programs and develop mechanisms for targeting microcredit to the poorest population. Additionally, a monitoring system must be established to set performance goals, measure project success, and make recommendations for adjustments to benefit the very poor, especially women. The Administrator of AID must monitor microenterprise credit amounts and loans to the poverty target population. They should also track funding allocated for loans under $300 to the poverty target population and report progress annually to Congress on implementing AID's plan of action. The Administrator of AID is required to monitor microenterprise credit amounts and loans to the poverty target population, report annually to Congress on progress in implementing AID's plan of action to expand access to credit, and include a summary of information collected in AID's annual presentation to Congress."
