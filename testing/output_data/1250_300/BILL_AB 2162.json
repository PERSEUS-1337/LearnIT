The Oak Woodlands Protection Act (Chapter 6.3) is added to the Fish and Game Code to conserve oak woodlands, enhance scenic beauty, increase property values, promote ecological balance, and provide habitat for wildlife and plant species. It also helps reduce soil erosion, sustain healthy watersheds, moderate climate change, and improve the health and welfare of California residents. The Oak Woodlands Protection Act aims to conserve oak woodlands in California to maintain habitat for wildlife species and ecological balance. The state recognizes the threat of habitat loss due to pathogens and parasites, emphasizing the need for immediate conservation efforts to preserve oak ecosystem continuity. The Oak Woodlands Protection Act aims to conserve oak woodland ecological attributes in California, provide habitat for wildlife species, ensure land use decisions are based on scientific information, and restore the state's biologically diverse natural resource for future generations. Canopy cover is defined as the area under the live branches of an oak tree, and oak removal is causing an oak tree to die or be removed by human activity. The Oak Woodlands Protection Act defines terms related to oak removal, including oak removal permit, oak removal plan, oak tree, oak woodland, and parcel.

The fee collected will cover the department's costs for administering and enforcing the Act, with funds deposited into the Oak Woodlands Protection Act Fund for this purpose. An oak removal plan is required for an oak removal permit, including details like parcel use, canopy cover percentages, oak species to be removed, and habitat mitigation measures. The director's approval of the permit is subject to the California Environmental Quality Act, and certain criteria must be met for approval. The director may seek certification for the oak removal program from the Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency. The director must not approve an oak removal permit if the application or plan does not comply with regulations, findings cannot be made, more than 10% of oak canopy would be removed, trees are within 50 feet of water, information is incorrect or incomplete, applicant lacks property interest, or if the plan violates any law. The applicant may appeal the director's denial of an oak removal permit to the commission within 15 days. The commission will hear the appeal within 60 days unless a later date is agreed upon.

Projects eligible for grants under the Oak Woodlands Conservation Act include affordable housing in urban areas, conversion of oak woodlands on agricultural land, and projects under specific sections of the Public Resources Code. Compliance with oak conservation measures exempts lead agencies and projects from certain divisions of the law. This section does not limit a public agency's ability to comply with environmental regulations. This section clarifies that Section 21081 can still apply to a project and does not limit a public agency's power to comply with environmental laws.
