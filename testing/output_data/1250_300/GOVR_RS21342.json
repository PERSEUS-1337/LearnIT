    "content": "The diversity visa lottery encourages legal immigration from countries other than major sending countries to the US. It allocates 55,000 visas annually to countries with lower immigrant admissions over the past five years. The program aims to stimulate new and varied migration from around the world. The Diversity Visa Lottery program allocates 55,000 visas annually based on specific criteria, with countries limited to 7% of the visa limit. Recipients become legal permanent residents of the United States. The Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act temporarily reduces the annual ceiling by up to 5,000 visas. In FY1999, the diversity ceiling became 50,000 to offset immigrant visa numbers for certain asylum seekers. In FY2002, 42,829 persons were admitted or adjusted as LPRs with diversity visas, representing 4% of all LPRs. The top five countries were Albania, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Poland, and Ukraine. Albania consistently ranked as the top sending country for diversity visas. Albania has been the top sending country for diversity visas in the mid-1990s, followed by Nigeria. Russia and Ukraine's numbers may be understated due to nationals qualifying from post-Soviet nations reporting they were born in the Soviet Union. Diversity visa recipients from Europe and Africa were higher compared to family-based and employment-based immigrants. To be eligible for a diversity visa, an alien must have a high school education. To be eligible for a diversity visa, an alien must have a high school education or two years of relevant work experience. The alien or their spouse must be from a qualifying country listed for the diversity visa lottery. Winners undergo reviews by Department of State consular officers and DHS inspectors to ensure they meet visa requirements. Exclusion criteria include health, criminal history, security concerns, public charge, illegal entry, and immigration violations. The State Department announced the FY2005 diversity visa lottery on August 19, 2003, with a 60-day application period from November 1 to December 30, 2003. Applications had to be submitted electronically, and entrants from countries with high immigration rates were usually ineligible. Ineligible countries for FY2005 included Canada, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam. Applicants had to follow State Department instructions precisely. In the FY2003 diversity visa lottery, over 2 million applications out of 8.7 million were disqualified for not following State Department instructions. Husbands and wives can submit separate entries, but derivative beneficiaries must be listed on the petition initially. If a lottery winner dies before obtaining LPR status, the visa is revoked, and derivative beneficiaries lose their eligibility. Winners are selected randomly by computer once all acceptable applications are received. In the FY2005 diversity visa lottery, winners are selected randomly by computer. The State Department notifies winners by mail between May and July 2004, with visas issued between October 1, 2004, and September 30, 2005. Winning the lottery does not guarantee a visa, as more applications are received than visas available. Applicants must act quickly to demonstrate admissibility as LPRs before September 30, 2005. Interviews are expected to begin in October 2004. Some question the continuation of the diversity visa lottery due to long wait times for family members to immigrate to the United States. In the FY2005 diversity visa lottery, winners are selected randomly by computer. The State Department notifies winners by mail between May and July 2004, with visas issued between October 1, 2004, and September 30, 2005. Aliens must complete the process before September 30, 2005 to receive visas. In-person interviews are expected to begin in October 2004. There are debates about the continuation of the diversity visa lottery, with some suggesting using the visas for backlog reduction in other categories. Critics propose amending the INA to prevent nationals from terrorism-sponsoring countries from participating in the lottery. Supporters of current law argue that LPRs from nations sponsoring terrorism should not be restricted in other visa categories. The issue of who should bear the costs of operating the diversity visa lottery has also been raised. Critics highlight concerns about fraud and misuse, but the State Department is working to address these issues."
