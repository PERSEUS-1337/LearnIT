    "content": "After years of experience in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations, analysts emphasize the importance of establishing a secure environment for sustainable peace. Military forces are crucial for initial security, but civilian police (CivPol) are increasingly recognized as more suitable for law and order tasks. Members of Congress are exploring tools for effective security in unstable regions like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Haiti. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recognizes the importance of United Nations peacekeeping operations and the deployment of civil police forces in promoting stability in post-conflict situations. Policymakers are addressing issues with the use of civilian police and considering improvements to the existing system and building new U.S. and international CivPol capabilities. Advocates propose facilitating recruitment and deployment of qualified personnel for post-conflict missions and ensuring appropriate training for handling law enforcement situations. Reforms are being considered for the existing system. The proposals aim to improve existing CivPol systems and address issues with U.N. peacekeeping operations. Key documents like PDD-71 and the Brahimi Panel report recommend mechanisms for enhancing CivPol forces and addressing recruitment, training, and deployment challenges. The Clinton Administration's directives were not fully implemented, but the Bush Administration has started taking measures. The United Nations is also working on reforms for the civilian police system. The Brahimi Panel report made recommendations to address issues with the U.N. civilian police system, including creating a reserve CivPol force, diversifying international police forces, and establishing more robust civilian response mechanisms. These proposals aim to improve existing CivPol systems and enhance U.N. peacekeeping operations. The report discusses proposals for improving international police mechanisms in peacekeeping operations, aiming to reduce reliance on U.S. military forces. It includes a synopsis of past operations and current U.N., U.S., and European CivPol systems, along with recommendations for enhancements and implementation status. Options for resolving ongoing issues and suggestions for U.S. Congress improvements are also provided. The report evaluates proposals to enhance international police mechanisms in peacekeeping operations, aiming to lessen dependence on U.S. military forces. It reviews past operations, current U.N., U.S., and European CivPol systems, and suggests improvements for implementation. Additionally, it provides options for addressing persistent issues and offers recommendations for U.S. Congress to enhance the system further. Several nations, including the United States, provide bilateral assistance, especially training, to indigenous police forces in post-conflict situations. Analysts suggest deploying international civilian police to countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Haiti. U.S. assistance for law enforcement abroad is governed by Section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, with exceptions for post-conflict situations. International civilian police forces have been used for various purposes since the late 19th century, providing support for human rights, monitoring, advising, reporting, and training local forces. In some cases, these forces are armed and granted arrest powers. Assistance in post-conflict situations is arranged on a case-by-case basis due to the lack of specific statutory authority. During the past decade, policing in peacekeeping operations has evolved through five phases, involving expansion of U.N. activities, addition of training components, and development of mandates for police reform and restructuring. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations has gone through five phases, including the addition of constabulary units for hostile situations and the expansion of mandates to give international police executive authority. This evolution reflects the international community's increasing awareness of security needs and the assistance required by local police forces in peace operations. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations has progressed through five phases, reflecting the international community's awareness of security needs and assistance required by local police forces. Policymakers and analysts are focusing on improving mechanisms for implementing peacekeeping mandates, identifying system gaps that need to be addressed for ensuring public security. The first problem area in peacekeeping operations is the deficiency in recruitment and training mechanisms, particularly for the United Nations. Despite efforts to weed out unfit personnel, challenges persist in recruiting well-trained and professional policemen with all necessary skills. The United Nations has faced challenges in recruiting well-trained personnel for peacekeeping missions, leading to deficiencies in deployment and training systems. These gaps can hinder the establishment of law and order in post-conflict situations, especially where criminal networks are present or local authority has been replaced by international intervention. Additional training is needed to enhance policing skills and promote professionalism among personnel. The deployment gap refers to the delay or inadequacy in deploying police forces for international missions, as seen in instances like the U.S. intervention in Panama and UNCIVPOL missions in Cambodia and Somalia. The enforcement gap highlights the challenge of ensuring sufficient security levels with deployed police forces. The U.N. faces challenges in deploying personnel with specialized skills, enforcing security with police forces lacking necessary skills, and dealing with gaps in indigenous law enforcement systems. The international community, including the United Nations, provides assistance to indigenous law enforcement systems in post-conflict situations by deploying international police officers. These officers help fill the institution gap by supporting judicial and penal systems that lack resources and personnel. As of February 29, 2004, 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations were serving in eight U.N. missions. The international civilian police system provides assistance in multilateral operations with 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations serving in eight U.N. missions. Jordan is the largest contributor with 553 officers, followed by the United States with 476. Kosovo has the largest UNCIVPOL mission with over 75% of officers, while other missions are in Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Georgia, and Afghanistan. Many nations also offer training and reform assistance individually. Many nations, including the United States and European Union member states, have provided police assistance and training individually or as part of multilateral efforts. The United States, for example, has offered police assistance in Somalia and Haiti under U.N. authority and developed training programs in Somalia through ICITAP. The OSCE and EU have also taken the lead in specific missions, such as in Kosovo where the OSCE has provided CivPols for police training. The OSCE and EU have led specific missions in Kosovo and other countries, providing police training and support. The EU took over the police mission in Bosnia from the UN in 2003 and launched the PROXIMA mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. U.N. Member States contribute police personnel voluntarily for peacekeeping operations, following international standards for democratic community policing and human rights. The U.N. philosophy of CivPol is based on international standards for democratic community policing and human rights. The Civilian Police Division (CPD) within the U.N. Headquarters provides policy and planning for civilian policing activities, overseeing recruitment, selection, deployment, and rotation of international civilian police officers. Training activities are handled by the UNDPKO training unit due to budget constraints. The Civilian Police Division (CPD) at the U.N. Headquarters oversees recruitment, selection, deployment, and rotation of international civilian police officers. The UNCIVPOL personnel are under the command of the UNCIVPOL Police Commissioner in the field. The Brahimi Panel report identified problems with recruitment, training, and deployment of police personnel, recommending actions to strengthen the U.N.'s capacity for effective police missions. The UN Civilian Police Division oversees recruitment, deployment, and rotation of international civilian police officers. Recommendations were made to address problems with recruitment, training, and deployment of police personnel to strengthen the UN's capacity for effective police missions. This included establishing a \"ready roster\" of deployable CivPols, developing an on-call list of experts, forming regional partnerships for joint police training, and appointing national points of contact on CivPol matters. Conferences were held to review UN policing operations and propose solutions, leading to consensus on addressing recruitment, training, deployment, and related issues. Recommendations also included incorporating CivPol personnel under the UN standby arrangement system and improving training measures. The UNDPKO seminar proposals called for incorporating CivPol personnel under the U.N. standby arrangement system and improving training. Recommendations also included pre-positioning of equipment for rapid deployment and addressing procedural and organizational impediments. Some reforms have been implemented, but analysts note significant problems with the UNCIVPOL system. Constraints on reform implementation in recruitment, training, and deployment areas are discussed, along with progress in operational and internal management reforms within UNDPKO. The Brahimi Panel report highlighted the need for a new approach in UNCIVPOL operations, emphasizing reform and restructuring over monitoring and training activities. This shift required better-trained law enforcement personnel to work alongside rule of law professionals to strengthen all rule of law institutions. The Brahimi Panel report emphasized the need for law enforcement personnel to integrate with rule of law experts to strengthen institutions. Some analysts see challenges in implementing this approach within the UN CivPol system, citing limited resources and concerns about sovereignty. Despite this, the United Nations is moving towards utilizing a full range of rule of law experts in peacekeeping operations. The United Nations is working towards greater use of rule of law experts in peacekeeping operations, but progress is seen as \"lagging\" according to a recent report. The recruitment of civilian police from various nations faces challenges in meeting minimum standards and experience requirements. The United Nations faces challenges in recruiting civilian police officers with specialized skills and lacks a comprehensive civilian police strategy, hindering the determination of mission needs and appropriate personnel recruitment. The United Nations requires civilian police officers to meet basic criteria for missions, including age, service experience, language proficiency, driver's license, and medical standards. Some officers lack necessary skills like language, driving, and firearms experience despite U.N. efforts to improve recruitment quality. Selection Assistance Teams have been sent since 1996 to guide Member States in recruiting suitable personnel. Despite U.N. efforts to improve recruitment quality, some civilian police personnel still lack basic skills like language, driving, and firearms. Selection Assistance Teams have been sent since 1996 to guide Member States in selecting suitable candidates. Retraining and retesting of basic requirements continue in missions, leading to high repatriation costs and deployment delays. Recruitment for specialized skills remains challenging, with better success in general skills than in advance recruiting for specialists in various areas. Specialists are often recruited from within missions after initial deployment. Recruiting for specialized skills like training, investigations, organized crime, forensics, drug trafficking, and police intelligence has been challenging. Recommendations have been made for advance recruitment of personnel to improve quality and speed deployment. The Brahimi Panel Report suggested establishing a national \"ready roster\" of pre-selected CivPol personnel under the U.N. System of Standby Arrangements. The report recommended the creation of national pools of police officers for international operations, enhancing the UNSAS with an effective ready roster of international police personnel, and increasing the number of participating countries. The lack of individual candidates was identified as a major weakness, with a suggestion to replace 'bidding for slots' with experienced candidates familiar with UN rules and procedures. The Brahimi Panel Report recommended creating national pools of police officers for international operations and replacing 'bidding for slots' with experienced candidates familiar with UN rules and procedures. The United Nations established an on-call list of 100 police officers and related experts for advance mission planning and early deployment. Training exercises have been held to improve the efficiency of the on-call system, and efforts have been made to recruit specialists since spring 2003. The United Nations has made efforts to improve recruitment for specialists by including substantive skills in selection criteria since spring 2003. Analysts have identified shortcomings in U.N. procedures, such as the absence of standardized criteria for determining the number of civilian police needed for missions. The United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) expanded criteria to include local crime statistics, police strength, and population. The audit criticized UNDPKO for not consistently matching skills to missions, leading to civilian police performing non-policing functions. A significant percentage of civilian police in missions were assigned to headquarters for administrative tasks, impacting policing functions. Training for police-contributing Member States varied, affecting mission effectiveness. Mission-preparedness training for police-contributing Member States varies and is often considered inadequate, leading to a lack of uniformity in experience and standardized training. This can undermine the effectiveness of UNCIVPOL missions, as officers from up to 40 countries may have little relevant training or mission-specific briefings. Member States are responsible for providing pre-deployment training, but experts cite a lack of adequate police trainers as a key reason for inadequate training. Experts have identified three main reasons for inadequate pre-deployment training for police-contributing Member States: lack of experienced trainers, insufficient resources for training programs, and wide variations in national training programs. Recommendations from the Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO include developing regional partnerships for joint police training exercises and using UN educational materials for pre-training personnel. However, there is limited evidence of member states moving towards regional training partnerships, except for the European Union. The UNDPKO Training Unit has made efforts to improve pre-deployment training by developing and distributing educational materials. The UNDPKO Training Unit has developed common training standards and generic training modules to enhance the competence of deployed peacekeepers, including police. PDD-71 recognized the importance of training in increasing the capabilities of nations for CivPol operations, while emphasizing that training remains a national responsibility. PDD-71 emphasizes the importance of training for CivPol operations, stating that while national responsibility remains key, international organizations may need to supplement training. The State Department's INL office is tasked with providing tailored training packages to U.S. and international CIVPOL when requested, with appropriate funding. Additionally, a new State Department CivPol program aims to invite foreign police officers to train with the U.S. contingent, although specific arrangements have not been finalized. Deployment of UNCIVPOL is a complex process involving mission definition and rapid action. The deployment of UNCIVPOL is a complex process involving defining mission needs, recruiting qualified personnel, and procuring equipment from various nations. Historically, deployment times have ranged from six to eighteen months due to resource limitations. Recommendations have been made to address issues such as the lack of a reserve corps of mission leadership, unreliable standby arrangements, and insufficient equipment supply for rapid deployment within four to 12 weeks. The Brahimi Panel recommended rapid deployment of peacekeeping missions within 30 days for traditional missions and within 90 days for complex emergencies. However, there are constraints such as the UN's inability to handle concurrent missions, limited civilian standby capacity, and the need for contributing states to deploy quickly. The United Nations is working on reforming its System for Standby Arrangements to enable faster deployment in the future. They are developing a roster of civilian police personnel for rapid deployment and improving procurement and management of deployment stocks. However, there is currently no program in place to prepare civilian police for rapid deployment. Many UN Member States have generic rapid deployment programs but lack the capability to deploy quickly. The United Nations is reforming its System for Standby Arrangements to enable faster deployment in the future. Currently, there is no program to prepare civilian police for rapid deployment. The U.S. CivPol program is managed by the Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, which recruits civilian police personnel on a case-by-case basis for each mission. As of April 1, 2004, the State Department will implement a new arrangement for civilian police personnel. Companies like DynCorp, Civilian Police International LLC, and a joint venture by PAE Government Services, Inc. and HomeLand Security Corporation will maintain rosters of up to 2,000 personnel for deployment. The U.S. CivPol program is funded through State Department regional bureaus and officers receive salaries ranging from $50,000-100,000, with additional allowances for those in U.N. missions. The State Department funds the U.S. CivPol program, with officers receiving salaries ranging from $50,000-100,000. Those in U.N. missions also get a subsistence allowance of $75-95 per day, along with danger pay. The total cost per officer varies by mission, from $100,000 in Kosovo to $150,000-$175,000 in Iraq, covering salary, equipment, transportation, and other support. The United Nations has estimated the incremental cost per troop for postings in Iraq, ranging from $179,000 to $206,000. As of March 27, 2004, there were 1,016 U.S. CivPol and support personnel participating in international missions, with deployments in Kosovo, Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The United States has deployed 408 police officers and support personnel to Afghanistan and Iraq as unilateral contributions. Policymakers have recognized recruitment and deployment issues with qualified CivPol personnel, leading to the implementation of PDD-71 to enhance response capacities and operational activities. This policy aims to improve the recruitment, training, management, and deployment of U.S. CivPol personnel, as well as enhance the capacity of foreign police to participate in peace operations. The U.S. CivPol system aims to improve recruitment, training, and deployment of police personnel for peace operations. A reserve cadre of up to 2,000 law enforcement personnel has been established to facilitate rapid deployment. The contractor is responsible for recruitment, training, and procurement services. The State Department established a reserve cadre of well-qualified CivPols for rapid deployment. The contractor was tasked with recruitment, training, and procurement services. Multiple companies were awarded contracts for the program, raising concerns about potential delays in the process. Technical advisors were also to be identified to assist in establishing institutional capabilities in police, judicial, and corrections systems. The recruitment program for CivPols has raised concerns about delays and costs. DynCorp recruits police officers from state and local agencies, but experts disagree on its utility. The system draws from overextended sources. Some analysts suggest that the United States could recruit a more professional and qualified police force for international missions by providing compensation to state and municipal governments for detailing officers. This would require new legal arrangements as current systems face challenges with staffing due to military call-ups and reluctance from local departments to allow valuable officers to take extended leaves. Some argue that the recruitment of individual U.S. police officers for international missions lacks cohesion and does not accurately reflect mission requirements. Selection criteria include U.S. citizenship, eight years of work experience as a sworn civilian law enforcement officer, an unblemished record, valid driver's license, and good health. The Department of State requires individuals to have specific qualifications for international police missions, including being a sworn civilian law enforcement officer with an unblemished record, a valid driver's license, good health, and the ability to communicate in English. They also need to pass physical, agility, and psychological tests, have a valid U.S. passport, and be able to drive a standard transmission 4x4 vehicle. Additionally, there is a focus on recruiting specialists with two years of experience in a specialized area for missions in Kosovo, East Timor, and Iraq. The State Department is making efforts to address the recruitment of high-quality and specialized personnel through the CivPol cadre program. The State Department's CivPol cadre program bid solicitation emphasizes that specialists will make up nearly 55% of the cadre, with specific qualifications required for police officers. Training in essential policing skills is offered annually to incentivize high-quality officers to join the program. However, the availability of funding for training all members of the program is uncertain. The training program for U.S. CivPols is complicated by varying levels of skills among police officers recruited from different departments. The current pre-deployment training includes topics like UN operations, mission overview, human rights, and defensive tactics. Some experts find the training insufficient for the potential 6,000 members in the new program. The new State Department CivPol cadre program includes training on various topics such as U.S. military involvement in peace operations, team building, lifestyle in the mission, human rights, and contractor logistical support. The training curriculum aims to meet Police Officer Standards and Training (POST) certification requirements and international principles of democratic policing. Additional annual training is also planned, potentially increasing costs under the new three-contractor cadre system. The new CivPol cadre program includes annual training and potential cost increases due to additional trainees and facilities. There are concerns about maintaining deployment capability within 15 days as proposed in legislation. The contractor will maintain a database of commercial sources for equipment. The new CivPol cadre program includes annual training and potential cost increases. Concerns about maintaining deployment capability within 15 days are raised. The contractor would maintain a database of commercial sources for equipment and develop a logistics support team for advanced support in missions. Deployment time could be decreased with standby arrangements. Deployment procedures under the new system and potential delays from new bidding rounds are unclear. European countries typically deploy police from their national forces to international CivPol operations. Most European countries deploy police from their national forces to international CivPol operations. European governments have recognized the need to reform their deployment systems to improve international CivPol capabilities. The EU has set goals to enhance the quality and timeliness of European contributions to police missions, including developing a 5,000 civilian reserve police force by 2003. This initiative is part of the European Security and Defense Policy adopted in 1999. The EU aims to develop a 5,000 civilian reserve police force for peace operations by 2003, with 1,400 officers deployable within 30 days. Member States have committed up to 5,000 police officers for crisis management operations, with 13 rapidly deployable police units and four headquarters units offered. The EU aims to develop a 5,000 civilian reserve police force for peace operations by 2003, with 1,400 officers deployable within 30 days. Member States have committed up to 13 rapidly deployable, integrated police units, with two headquarters units offered for police missions. The EU launched its first ESDP mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina in January 2003, with almost 500 police officers and 70 civilian experts from 33 states. The mission aims to establish sustainable policing arrangements in accordance with European and international best practices. The EU launched its second police mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with a budget of US$18.6 million. EU Member States have met their goals for police officers but some analysts doubt the effectiveness of EU crisis management. The OSCE is also enhancing its operational capabilities for rapid deployment of CivPols and civilian experts. The OSCE is enhancing its operational capabilities for rapid deployment of CivPols and other civilian experts. Currently, there are 160 CivPols conducting policing activities in eight countries. The REACT program allows for the identification, selection, and deployment of experts in conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict missions. Policing activities focus on training, reform, and development of local police. The REACT program enables participating States to establish databases of qualified civilian experts for security promotion. Personnel can be deployed within two to eight weeks for specific missions. OSCE and its 55 participating States have implemented and improved the program since April 2001. National websites are created for recruitment, and some States have provided commitments in expertise fields. States prefer not to nominate specific individuals to the OSCE availability list until field requirements are known. Some participating States have provided numerical commitments in expertise fields. The OSCE has developed standards for educational and experience requirements, as well as a staffing matrix to assist in recruiting qualified candidates. Through REACT, the OSCE recruits CivPols with specific skills and experience. Minimum requirements for civilian police include graduation from a police training school, active police experience, English communication skills, negotiation skills, mapping skills, and first aid experience. Desired skills include liaison experience with non-law enforcement organizations and the ability to operate police radio equipment. The OSCE recruits CivPols with specific skills and experience, including communication in English, negotiation skills, mapping skills, and first aid experience. Desired skills include liaison experience with non-law enforcement organizations and the ability to operate police radio equipment. Additionally, there are proposals in Congress to strengthen U.S. and international capabilities for CivPol missions and other rule of law missions. S. 2127 aims to enhance U.S. civilian capabilities for crisis response, building on previous international efforts. H.R. 1414 proposes reforms to improve the effectiveness and deployment of UNCIVPOL, including the establishment of a professional United Nations civilian police corps. The bill proposes the establishment of a professional United Nations civilian police corps, emphasizing rapid deployment, appropriate training, and resources for peace operations. The bill proposes the establishment of a United Nations civilian police corps with appropriate resources and training, aiming to address deployment and enforcement gaps in peace missions. The bill proposes the creation of a professional U.N. police corps to enhance the United Nations' ability to maintain a secure environment, reduce the need for combat soldiers in civilian police tasks, and improve the standards of UNCIVPOL personnel. Opponents are concerned about the cost and sustainability of establishing a standing corps funded through mandatory assessments or voluntary contributions. Many analysts fear that a permanent UNCPC funded through voluntary contributions may not be sustainable. Concerns also exist about the United Nations' limited management capacity and potential infringement on national sovereignty. H.R. 2616 proposes mechanisms to enhance U.S. and NATO capabilities for reconstruction assistance in post-conflict situations, including the establishment of a U.S. civilian police reserve. The bill proposes the establishment of a U.S. civilian police reserve and a new NATO mechanism to provide security in post-conflict situations. The U.S. civilian police reserve would serve as an interim police force and train indigenous civilian police forces. Congress would call upon the President to establish a task force to develop the reserve. NATO would be asked to train and equip selected units to provide security in reconstruction situations. The bill proposes a U.S. civilian police reserve and a new NATO mechanism to provide security in post-conflict situations. It calls for NATO to train and equip selected units to provide security in reconstruction situations, including constabulary skills and policing tasks. The proposed legislation aims to establish a U.S. civilian police reserve to support international capabilities for post-conflict reconstruction. Proponents argue that this reserve would help bridge deployment gaps and expedite the deployment of civilian police officers. There is debate over whether the reserve should follow a private contractor model or a new government reserve force model. Opponents of the private contractor model raise concerns about limitations in military operations. Opponents of the government-sponsored reserve argue that limitations in military operations may also apply to policing operations, as commercial contractors may lack dedication in unpredictable situations. Proponents of a government-created model believe a government reserve symbolizes U.S. commitment better, is more responsive to policy, and fosters a more cohesive and accountable force. Government reserve is seen as a potent symbol of U.S. commitment, more responsive to policy, and potentially more cohesive than a privately-contracted force. Proponents argue that a government agency could ensure better quality recruits through stricter screening mechanisms and easier recruitment from local and state police departments. Pre-deployment training and coordination with military forces could make a government-sponsored reserve more effective and reliable than the current ad hoc model. The NATO constabulary capability could bridge enforcement gaps by providing necessary skills in post-conflict situations, but some question if a military organization like NATO is the right venue for policing functions. Critics argue that using military forces for policing may send inappropriate signals and duplicate existing structures. Additional provisions on equipment are suggested for the bill. Some critics argue that creating a reserve within NATO may duplicate EU structures and strain US-European relations. They suggest additional provisions for equipment, training, and coordination with the military to avoid delays in deployment and ensure standardized training. Skeptics question the need for police reserves and the commitment of US officers, fearing it may deplete existing resources. S. 2127, introduced by Senators Lugar and Biden, aims to reorganize government structures to enhance civilian foreign affairs agencies' ability to respond to overseas crises. The bill would allocate $80 million to hire personnel for a Response Readiness Corps and maintain a Response Readiness Reserve roster consisting of federal and non-government personnel. Critics question the need for police reserves and the potential strain on existing resources. The bill introduced by Senators Lugar and Biden aims to create a Response Readiness Corps and Reserve roster for civilian foreign affairs agencies. The roster would include federal employees and non-government personnel trained for crisis response missions. The bill also emphasizes the need for improved training and professionalization of personnel, especially in basic functions. The need for improved training and professionalization of CivPol personnel is emphasized to bridge the deployment gap. Training adjustments in missions like Bosnia, Kosovo, and East Timor were made on a case-by-case basis, highlighting the importance of adequate training. PDD-71 proposed tailored training packages for CivPol when requested, with some analysts recommending increased funding for police training. Increased police training is recommended to address deployment gaps, with a proposal for U.S. training of foreign police personnel pending decision. Funding availability will determine the program's content and scope. Another option is to enhance international constabulary capabilities in select nations and establish new capabilities in others. H.R. 2616 suggests integrating a constabulary unit within NATO for tasks requiring more force than routine law enforcement. Constabulary police, as defined by PDD-71, perform tasks requiring less force than combat but more than routine law enforcement. They regulate movements for safety, intervene in civil violence, deter looting and riots, and disperse violent demonstrations. Trained in military and policing skills, constabulary forces are essential in post-conflict areas. Equipped with communication and logistical support, they deploy rapidly as formed units. Deploying a constabulary unit within NATO, as proposed in H.R. 2616, enhances international constabulary capabilities for tasks needing more force than routine law enforcement. Constabulary police are essential in post-conflict areas, performing tasks requiring less force than combat but more than routine law enforcement. Equipped with communication and logistical support, they deploy rapidly as formed units. Some analysts suggest establishing specialized paramilitary units for peacekeeping operations. Several countries already have national police forces or specialized paramilitary police units trained as constabulary forces. These resources can be strained by high deployment rates in numerous U.N. peacekeeping operations. The U.S. army is considering developing its own active duty constabulary force to address shortages in military police capabilities during high peacekeeping deployment rates. Army leaders have historically resisted structuring the service for peacekeeping missions, but analysts question the effectiveness of military forces that do not establish conditions for durable peace. Some military personnel believe that constabulary forces can be an intermediary security force for peace operations, reducing reliance on combat soldiers for policing activities. Analysts are uncertain if other countries would be willing to enhance their constabulary capabilities for deployment abroad. Some analysts suggest developing rapidly deployable units of law enforcement and rule of law personnel to address the institution gap in peace operations. The United States currently deploys personnel with experience in justice and corrections systems through Department of Justice contracts. The State Department's INL CivPol program contracts Department of Justice for personnel. Analysts propose creating a U.S. stability force integrating military and civilian personnel for post-conflict intervention. Robert S. Perito advocates for this approach to address security gaps and impunity. The proposed U.S. stability force for post-conflict intervention includes robust military forces, civilian constabulary units, civilian police, and rule of law professionals. This model aims to bridge deployment, enforcement, and institution gaps by deploying all elements concurrently. Military forces shift to providing perimeter security after major combat operations, while constabulary units handle internal security and civilian police address lawlessness and civil disorder. The proposed U.S. stability force for post-conflict intervention includes military forces, civilian constabulary units, civilian police, and rule of law professionals. The model aims to deploy all elements concurrently, with military forces transitioning to perimeter security, constabulary units handling internal security, and civilian police addressing lawlessness and civil disorder. Over time, personnel shift from military to civilian control, similar to the organization in Kosovo. Recommendations include the deployment of civilian personnel with combat forces to expedite nation-building responsibilities transfer. The report recommends the creation of a standing interagency stabilization and reconstruction team within the government, and the development of an \"on-call\" civilian crisis management corps of medical, legal, language, and law enforcement personnel from state and local governments and the private sector. A March 2004 report of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) suggests the establishment of an Agency for Stability Operations reporting directly to the Secretary of State, responsible for preparing for operations and managing a Civilian Stability Operations Corps of 200-300 U.S. government civilians. The report recommends the creation of a Civilian Stability Operations Reserve of non-government civilians with expertise for rapid deployment. Proponents argue it enhances security, stability, and democracy in intervened countries. Changes in U.S. practices would be needed, including developing constabulary capabilities for the military and recruiting police personnel through a new federal agency. The report suggests creating a Civilian Stability Operations Reserve of non-government civilians for rapid deployment. A new federal agency would recruit constabulary and police personnel as temporary federal employees, which could be controversial. The model aims to establish security quickly in crisis countries, but deployment ease depends on recruitment methods. Perito prefers federalizing the CivPol component rather than using private contractors. Deploying personnel under a lengthy federal employment process may be slower than calling them up for missions. Perito suggests federalizing the CivPol component of the stability force for rapid deployment. Personnel recruited under a federal employment process may be less quickly deployable than those under a reserve system. The availability of personnel for rapid deployment depends on recruitment arrangements and benefits provided. Sources: Peacekeeping Fact Sheets from the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations website, EU Police fact sheet, OMIK information from the OSCE website, and The Blue Helmets by the United Nations. The curr_chunk provides information on various resources related to police in peace operations, including websites for EU Police, OMIK information, and books on the topic. It also mentions the historical background of international police missions dating back to the late 1800s. The chart excludes U.N. civilian police missions with fewer than 100 personnel. The use of international police forces in peacekeeping operations dates back to the late 1800s, with European nations sending units to various regions. The first U.N. civilian police mission occurred in 1960 during the U.N. Operation in the Congo, followed by other missions such as UNTEA in West New Guinea and UNFICYP in Cyprus. These missions aimed to assist local police forces in maintaining order. The U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) was the first operation to use the term UNCIVPOL and the first multilateral U.N. police force. UNFICYP CivPols assisted Cypriot police in maintaining order and providing security in sensitive areas to diffuse tensions. Post-cold war operations focused on monitoring local police performance, such as in Namibia and Western Sahara. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia monitored the electoral process leading to independence. The U.N. operations during the Cold War period focused on monitoring local police performance in post-cold war operations. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia set the model for future missions by accompanying local police, investigating public complaints, and supervising police investigations. MINURSO in Southwest Sahara aimed to carry out a referendum for the former Spanish colony's future status, facing opposition from Morocco. Other monitoring missions in Angola and Cambodia occurred in more challenging situations. The U.N. Transition Administration in Cambodia (UNTAC) was a large and ambitious peacekeeping operation with a strictly monitoring mandate for police. It faced challenges due to inadequate mandates and insufficient military forces, leading to escalation of armed conflict in the region. The U.N. Transition Administration in Cambodia (UNTAC) faced challenges due to slow deployment and inadequate mandates, leading to the need for CivPols to be given arrest powers and the establishment of an UNTAC jail. However, these actions were deemed too late to make the operation effective according to some analysts. Some analysts noted the slowness of deployment in Cambodia, taking 10 months to reach full strength due to raising a large force. UNTAC's task of ensuring law and order was hindered by inadequate police numbers, leading to a shift towards monitoring elections. Training for Cambodian police and judiciary was recognized as essential, with limited resources leading to makeshift training. The concept of an \"institution gap\" emerged from analyses of the UNTAC operation. Analysts recognized the need for police reform and training in Cambodia due to limited resources and the lack of an independent judicial system. The concept of deploying integrated \"justice packages\" emerged to address the enforcement gap. International efforts, such as the U.N. Observer Mission in El Salvador, played a pivotal role in putting security forces under civilian control and providing technical assistance to new police forces. The international community provided extensive support for police reform in El Salvador following the peace accords of January 1992. This included assistance in creating a new National Civilian Police force and overseeing the transition period. During a two-year transition period, ONUSAL assisted in creating a new police academy and overseeing the formation of the new police force in El Salvador. The UNDP managed international contributions for this effort, leading to the successful establishment of the new police force, which was crucial for the country's reconciliation and democratization processes. Despite encountering significant problems, the success of this police operation convinced contributing governments of the importance of civilian police deployment in peacekeeping operations. The success of the police operation in El Salvador convinced contributing governments of the importance of civilian police deployment in peacekeeping operations, despite high crime rates and military interference. Subsequent missions, like the one in Mozambique, also included training and reform mandates for the police force. The UN missions in Mozambique, Rwanda, Somalia, and Haiti involved training and reforming police forces, with international support continuing after formal UN operations. In Mozambique, ONUMOZ monitored police reorganization and training, while in Rwanda, UNAMIR included training in its mandate. In Somalia, the US-led UNITAF provided humanitarian assistance and restored order after the collapse of the dictatorship. The coalition in Somalia began efforts to provide humanitarian assistance and restore order after the collapse of the dictatorship. UNITAF established an interim Auxiliary Security Force (ASF) to enforce locally agreed upon laws and be controlled by the community, serving as a community police force in 17 cities and towns. The ASF aimed to reduce the need for UNITAF troops to serve as police, minimize casualties, and empower Somalis to deal with criminal activity. UNITAF supported the establishment of a Somali police force to reduce friction with the local population, handle criminal activity, create jobs, and provide income. The UNDP, along with Italian, Dutch, and German police experts, provided assistance in salaries, equipment, and refurbishing police stations. UNITAF also contributed surplus vehicles and radios. The UNDP, along with UNITAF and other organizations, supported the Somali police force with uniforms, training, weapons, and food rations. UNITAF military forces from various countries provided assistance in different sectors. Despite challenges from militant factions, the ASF was considered a credible police force. However, UN efforts to rebuild the Somali police, courts, and prisons faced obstacles due to staffing and funding issues. Farah Aidid challenged U.N. forces as efforts to reconstruct Somali police, courts, and prisons faced staffing and funding obstacles. UNCIVPOL arrived late and struggled with training and cultural differences. ICITAP's police courses collapsed amid escalating violence and insecurity, leading to ICITAP's withdrawal in June 1994 and UNCIVPOL's departure in March 1995. UNITAF ASF provided some success in offering protection to citizens. The need for police institution development and reform was recognized by the end of the 1990s. The Brahimi Panel Report in August 2000 recommended a shift in the use of civilian personnel in peace operations to focus on building local police capacity. UNOSOM II's lack of commitment to support UNCIVPOLs led to the concept of an \"enforcement gap\" in Somalia. The Somalia operation highlighted the need for military intervention to maintain law and order in post-conflict situations due to the absence of an effective police force and peace accord. Analysts also noted challenges with international civilian police forces, lack of suitable training for local police, and institutional gaps undermining police reform efforts. In Haiti, U.S. and U.N. police reform efforts faced challenges due to institutional gaps and lack of political settlement. The International Police Monitoring Force (IPM) was formed to train a new Haitian national police force, but faced issues with vetting former members of the armed forces. The subsequent UNCIVPOL under the U.N. Mission in Haiti also encountered difficulties in maintaining law and order. The IPM supervised a security force in Haiti, allowing members to carry arms and make arrests. The subsequent UNMIH took over monitoring and training functions, with follow-on missions sent over the next five years to professionalize the Haitian police. The military and civilian police coordinated to establish public security while the HNP was trained and deployed. The US adjusted rules of engagement to allow military forces to detain and shoot criminals when necessary. The interim public security force in Haiti was rapidly deployed to fill the gap before the planned deployment of the HNP. MNF military police conducted patrols and provided training to IPMs on patrolling and the use of force. UNMIH also played a role in bridging the law enforcement gap, providing back-up to UNCIVPOL and monitoring HNP performance. As the HNP deployed, UNCIVPOLs transitioned to a mentoring and monitoring role. Military patrols continued to deter crime and political violence. The UNMIH military forces monitored the performance of the interim public security force in Haiti, which was deployed to fill the gap before the planned deployment of the HNP. The institutional gap, including overcrowded prisons and a corrupt judicial system, hindered the establishment of public security. In Bosnia, the United Nations had full responsibility for international police assistance from 1995-2002, focusing on monitoring and training under the Dayton Accords. The 1995 Dayton Accords established a joint government in Bosnia overseen by the International Police Task Force (IPTF) to end the conflict. The UN's responsibilities included monitoring law enforcement activities, advising and training personnel, assessing threats to public order, and advising on organizing effective civilian law enforcement agencies. In 2003, the European Union took over police monitoring and training in Bosnia through the EU Police Mission. In January 2003, the European Union took over monitoring and training police in Bosnia through the EU Police Mission. The IPTF, with 1,721 unarmed CivPols lacking enforcement powers, struggled to maintain public order among hostile groups. Concerns about the IPTF's effectiveness were raised during the Dayton negotiations, with calls for a stronger mandate and a policing role for the NATO peacekeeping Implementation Force (IFOR). IFOR provided support to the IPTF during the early stages of deployment. In 1996, the transfer of control of certain areas of Sarajevo led to the relocation of residents, testing the IPTF and IFOR. IFOR assisted the IPTF in planning operations and compensating for slow deployment. Despite only one death during relocation, the lack of enforcement authority and resources led to dwellings being gutted, burned, and booby-trapped. This resulted in a flight of Bosnian Serbs from Sarajevo suburbs, highlighting a perceived U.N. failure and loss of credibility for the understaffed and under-resourced IPTF. In late 1996, the smaller NATO Stabilization Force (SFOR) replaced IFOR in Bosnia, providing backup for the understaffed and under-resourced IPTF. Specialized units within the IPTF, including paramilitary forces from foreign nations, were developed to handle exceptional law enforcement situations. In the early 1990s, police units from foreign nations like France, Italy, and Spain were integrated into international CivPols without special functions. By the late 1990s, their role in filling the gap between military capabilities and unarmed police monitors was recognized. The Multinational Specialized Unit (MSU) was formed in Bosnia in 1998 to protect officials and maintain public order. This success led to the formation of similar units in Kosovo and East Timor in 1999. In 1999, international civilian police in Kosovo and East Timor were given executive authority powers due to the absence of local authority. NATO and the UN took responsibility for stabilizing Kosovo through KFOR and UNMIK, while the OSCE oversaw and trained the Kosovo Police Service. In East Timor, UNTAET provided similar functions. In Kosovo and East Timor, international civilian police were granted executive authority powers in the absence of local authority. The UN and NATO were responsible for stabilizing Kosovo through KFOR and UNMIK, while the OSCE oversaw and trained the Kosovo Police Service. In East Timor, UNTAET provided a complete civil administration during its transition to independence. In situations where local police forces are deemed inadequate, decisions on using executive policing will be made on a case-by-case basis, considering limited international civilian police availability and sovereignty concerns."
