    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015\". It includes a section on WaterSense. The WaterSense program, established within the Environmental Protection Agency, promotes water efficient products, buildings, and landscapes to reduce water use, strain on infrastructure, conserve energy, and preserve water resources for future generations through voluntary labeling. The Administrator of the EPA is responsible for promoting WaterSense labeled products, enhancing public awareness, and educating the public on water recycling. The WaterSense program promotes water-efficient technologies and services to reduce water use and ensure product performance. It aims to enhance public awareness, establish performance standards, publicize proper installation of WaterSense products, preserve the label's integrity, and regularly review criteria for labeled products. The WaterSense program aims to preserve the label's integrity by regularly reviewing and updating criteria for labeled products. It also collects data on market shares and estimates water and energy savings annually. Interested parties and the public are invited to provide feedback before establishing or revising any criteria. The WaterSense program ensures transparency and stakeholder involvement in updating criteria for labeled products. It requires providing notice of changes, explaining them, and considering lead time for effective dates to accommodate manufacturing and distribution processes. Authorization of Appropriations: $7,500,000 for fiscal year 2016, $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2018, and $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2019 and beyond, adjusted for inflation, to support water efficiency initiatives in various sectors.
