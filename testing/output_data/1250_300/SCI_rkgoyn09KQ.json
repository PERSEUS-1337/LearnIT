    "content": "In this work, a neural autoregressive topic model is combined with a LSTM based language model to address challenges in probabilistic topic modelling. The approach, named ctx-DocNADE, aims to incorporate language structure and improve the estimation of word probabilities in a given context. The approach combines a topic model and a language model to improve word-topic mapping in short text or sparse document corpora. External knowledge is incorporated using word embeddings in a LSTM-LM to enhance the estimation of word probabilities. The extension of the proposed model is named ctx-DocNADEe. The novel neural autoregressive topic model variants, combined with neural language models and embeddings priors, outperform state-of-the-art generative topic models in generalization, interpretability, and applicability over long-text. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations of probabilistic topic models in capturing word order and language structure, emphasizing the need to extend these models for better semantic understanding. This is in contrast to the prev_chunk which highlights the superior performance of novel neural autoregressive topic model variants in various aspects. Traditional topic models do not consider language structure, such as word order and syntax, as they are based on \"bag-of-words\" (BoWs) only. In contrast, a deep contextualized LSTM-based language model (LSTM-LM) can capture different language concepts in a layer-wise fashion, with the lowest layer capturing syntax and the topmost layer capturing semantics. This highlights the limitations of topic models in capturing semantic understanding and the potential of LSTM-LMs in addressing these issues. Recent studies have integrated latent topics and neural language models to improve language models with global dependencies, but they still struggle to capture semantics at a document level. While some topic models can capture word order in short contexts, they fail to capture long term dependencies and language concepts. In contrast, DocNADE variants learn word occurrences across documents at a coarse granularity, but are based on bag-of-words. The proposed neural topic model, named ctx-DocNADE, integrates language structure into neural autoregressive topic models via LSTM-LM. It accounts for word ordering, language concepts, and long-range dependencies, offering accurate word prediction by combining joint word and latent topic learning. Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator (ctx-DocNADE) combines joint word and latent topic learning in a unified framework. It struggles with short texts due to limited context and training data, but word embeddings have shown promise in capturing semantic and syntactic relatedness. Word embeddings have proven to capture semantic and syntactic relatedness in words, enhancing performance in NLP tasks. Traditional topic models struggle with short texts, but incorporating word embeddings improves information extraction. Various models have integrated word embeddings into topic learning, outperforming traditional models in terms of perplexity and information retrieval. The curr_chunk introduces a new approach called ctx-DocNADEe, which combines pre-trained word embeddings with a neural autoregressive framework to improve topic learning and textual representations. This approach outperforms traditional models in terms of generalizability, interpretability, and applicability in tasks such as information retrieval and classification. The approach named ctx-DocNADEe improves textual representations through generalizability, interpretability, and applicability in tasks like information retrieval and classification. It outperforms state-of-the-art generative topic models on various datasets, showing gains in topic coherence, precision, and F1 for text classification. The proposed modeling approaches generate contextualized topic vectors called textTOvec, with code available at https://github.com/pgcool/textTOvec. Generative models like Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) BID9 and its variants are probabilistic undirected models of binary data. Generative models like RBM and its variants model complex dependencies in multidimensional data. NADE decomposes joint distribution into autoregressive conditional distributions for tractable gradients. DocNADE models collections of documents as bags of words, focusing on word representations of underlying topics. DocNADE is a generative model trained to learn word representations reflecting document topics, ignoring syntactical and semantic features. It computes word observations using a neural network and hidden units, providing the log-likelihood of any document. The DocNADE model is a generative model that learns word representations for document topics. It uses a neural network to compute word observations and hidden units to provide the log-likelihood of a document. Two extensions of the model are proposed: ctx-DocNADE, which incorporates language structure via LSTM-LM, and ctx-DocNADEe, which includes external knowledge through pre-trained word embeddings. These extensions account for word ordering, syntactical and semantic structures, long and short term dependencies, and external knowledge, overcoming limitations of BoW-based representations. The ctx-DocNADE model extends the DocNADE model by incorporating language structure through LSTM-LM. It utilizes hidden vectors and weight matrices to encode topic information and word representations, allowing for context-dependent word probabilities. The LSTM component's embedding layer represents column vectors, enhancing the model's ability to capture word ordering and language concepts. The ctx-DocNADE model extends DocNADE by incorporating language structure through LSTM-LM. It uses hidden vectors and weight matrices to encode topic information and word representations, allowing for context-dependent word probabilities. The embedding layer in the LSTM component is randomly initialized, and in ctx-DocNADEe, it is initialized by the sum of a pre-trained embedding matrix E and the weight matrix W. The computational complexity in ctx-DocNADE or ctx-DocNADEe is O(HD + N), where N is the total number of edges in the LSTM network. The computational complexity in ctx-DocNADE or ctx-DocNADEe is O(HD + N), where N is the total number of edges in the LSTM network. The deep version of ctx-DeepDNEe extends DocNADE and LSTM with multiple hidden layers for improved performance. The conditional probability is computed using the last layer in the deep feed-forward and LSTM networks. State-of-the-art comparison includes IR-precision and classification F1 for short texts. The text discusses the application of modeling approaches to short and long-text datasets for topic modeling evaluation. It includes comparisons with baselines using word representations like glove BID22. The evaluation measures include generalization, topic coherence, text retrieval, and categorization. See appendices for data description and examples. In comparing performance of models for topic modeling evaluation, the proposed models ctx-DocNADE and ctx-DocNADEe are compared with baselines using various word and document representations, including glove BID22, doc2vec, ProdLDA, SCHOLAR 1 BID3, DocNADE, NTM BID2, Gauss-LDA, glove-DMM, glove-LDA, TDLM, Topic-RNN, and TCNLM. Experimental setup involves training on reduced vocabulary (RV) or full text/vocabulary (FV) with 200-dimensional glove embeddings for fair comparison. The FV setting is used to compare DocNADE+FV and ctx-DocNADE variants with glove embeddings. Pre-training is done for ctx-DocNADEs with \u03bb set to 0. Evaluation tasks include log-probabilities for test documents and average held-out perplexity. The experimental setup and hyperparameters are detailed in the appendices. The generative performance of topic models is evaluated by estimating log-probabilities for test documents and computing average held-out perplexity per word. DocNADE computes log-probability using L DN (v) with \u03bb=0 to determine exact log-likelihood in ctx-DocNADE versions. Optimal \u03bb is determined based on the validation set. PPL scores show that ctx-DocNADE with \u03bb=0.01 achieves lower perplexity than baseline DocNADE for short and long texts. Topic coherence is assessed using a coherence measure that identifies context features for each topic word. Higher scores indicate more coherent topics. The coherence of topics in BID19 BID7 is assessed using a measure proposed by BID25. Gensim module is used to estimate coherence for 200 topics, showing higher scores in ctx-DocNADE compared to DocNADE. The introduction of embeddings in ctx-DocNADEe boosts topic coherence by 4.6% on average. The proposed models outperform baselines methods glove-DMM and glove-LDA. Additional comparisons are made with other approaches combining topic and language models.
