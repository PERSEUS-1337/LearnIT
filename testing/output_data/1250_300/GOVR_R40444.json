    "content": "Eligibility for health benefits under CHIP is available to different groups through various federal authorities and mechanisms. This includes children, pregnant women, parents, and childless adults who may be covered under the CHIP state plan or special waiver authority. Title XXI defines a targeted low-income child as someone under age 19 without health insurance and not eligible for Medicaid under pre-CHIP rules. States can set the income level for targeted low-income children up to 200% of the federal poverty level. States have the flexibility to expand eligibility for all children under 19 years of age. CHIPRA reduces federal payments for higher-income CHIP children, using the regular Medicaid matching rate for those with family incomes exceeding 300% of poverty. Federal CHIP payments for higher-income CHIP children will use the regular Medicaid matching rate for those with family incomes over 300% of poverty. States can cover these children under Medicaid or create a separate CHIP program. Medicaid rules apply for Medicaid coverage, while Title XXI rules apply for separate CHIP programs. Federal CHIP funds cover the program costs. Medicaid rules apply for Medicaid coverage, while Title XXI rules apply for separate CHIP programs. Federal CHIP funds cover the program costs, and states may cover targeted low-income children through Medicaid expansion or separate CHIP programs. Targeted low-income children covered under a CHIP-financed expansion of Medicaid are entitled to benefits under Medicaid law. States have the option to cover targeted low-income children under existing Medicaid eligibility pathways or establish a separate CHIP program. Eligibility factors include geography, age, income, resources, residency, disability status, access to other health insurance, and duration of CHIP eligibility. This strategy reduces administrative burden and allows states flexibility in determining eligibility criteria. Prior to CHIPRA, states had various ways to cover adult pregnant women, including through Section 1115 waivers or CHIP state plan amendments. As of October 2007, 17 states offered pregnancy-related services to adults using CHIP funds, with 6 states using waivers and 12 states extending coverage through state plan amendments. In FY2008, 12 states extended coverage to unborn children of adult pregnant women through CHIP state plan amendments, with most states also covering undocumented aliens. CHIPRA introduced a new option for states to cover pregnant women under CHIP, with specific eligibility conditions to meet. Pregnant women can be temporarily enrolled in CHIP for up to two months before formal eligibility determination. Benefits include prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care, with infants eligible for Medicaid or CHIP up to age one. States may continue coverage through waivers and offer postpartum services. Legal immigrants arriving after August 22, 1996, are also eligible. CHIPRA clarified that states can offer postpartum services to pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the United States and are otherwise eligible for Medicaid or CHIP coverage, waiving the five-year bar for legal immigrants. The law requires sponsors' income and resources to be considered for eligibility, ensuring they are financially responsible for the individual. CHIPRA allowed states to waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or CHIP coverage for pregnant women and children lawfully residing in the U.S. The provision ensures that sponsors are financially responsible for the individual, and states must redetermine eligibility annually for those whose legal residence documentation expires. Under current law, Section 1115 of the Social Security Act grants the Secretary of Health and Human Services broad authority to modify aspects of the CHIP program, including expanding eligibility. Some states have covered adults with CHIP funds through waivers, which are subject to renewal every three years. Since 2007, waiver renewals for adult coverage have not been approved in some states, leading to transitions out of CHIP coverage for adult populations. As of January 7, 2009, 4 states have CMS authority to use CHIP. Since 2007, waiver renewals for adult coverage under CHIP have not been approved in some states, leading to transitions out of coverage for adult populations. As of January 7, 2009, 4 states have CMS authority to use CHIP funds to extend coverage to certain adult populations, while 7 states have authority to cover parent populations. CHIPRA terminates coverage of nonpregnant childless adults by the end of 2009, with states allowed to apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage subject to budget neutrality standards. Coverage of parents is permitted for states with CHIP parent coverage waivers, with spending subject to set-aside amounts starting in 2012. Under CHIPRA, coverage of parents is allowed for states with CHIP parent coverage waivers, with spending subject to set-aside amounts starting in 2012. States must meet coverage benchmarks to receive enhanced FMAP for parents in FY2013. CHIPRA also authorizes outreach and enrollment grants for Medicaid and CHIP, with a portion allocated for a national enrollment campaign. CHIPRA authorizes $100 million in outreach and enrollment grants for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. Funds will be directed towards a national enrollment campaign, outreach for Native American children, and state and local governments for outreach campaigns in rural areas. Grant funds will target proposals addressing cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. CHIPRA also requires state plans to describe procedures to reduce administrative barriers to enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP. Additionally, CHIPRA allows states to rely on findings from \"Express Lane\" agencies for enrollment facilitation. CHIPRA creates a state option to rely on \"Express Lane\" agencies to determine eligibility for Medicaid or CHIP, allowing for automatic enrollment with family consent. States can use state income tax records for income verification and inform families of potential benefits under Medicaid. Under CHIPRA, states must inform families about potential benefits under Medicaid based on income verification through state tax records. The requirement for signatures on Medicaid or CHIP application forms under penalty of perjury was eliminated. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 required proof of citizenship and identity for Medicaid applicants. CHIPRA allows states to use Social Security Numbers verified by the SSA for citizenship documentation. Additionally, CHIPRA adds a requirement for citizenship documentation in CHIP. Table 1 displays each state's CHIP program type, upper-income eligibility, and enrollment data by population group. CHIPRA requires citizenship documentation in CHIP, with states using Social Security Numbers for verification. Table 1 shows each state's CHIP program type, upper-income eligibility, and enrollment data. The highest income limit is 350% of the FPL in New Jersey, with some states covering children above 250% FPL. CHIP enrollment in FY2008 was nearly 7.4 million children, with waivers used to expand coverage for adult populations. In FY2008, 2.1 million low-income children were enrolled in CHIP, with waivers used to expand coverage for adults. Approximately 335,000 adults were enrolled in CHIP, with most being parents. The number of CHIP-enrolled adults decreased from previous years due to waivers not being renewed. Some states reported more adult CHIP enrollees than children. States have the option to cover low-income children under Medicaid, create a separate CHIP program, or use a combination of both approaches. States have the option to cover low-income children under their Medicaid program, create a separate CHIP program, or use a combination of both approaches. Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs must provide mandatory Medicaid benefits and optional services. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows states to enroll children in new benchmark plans. EPSDT benefits must be provided to children under age 21, including well-child care and screenings. The EPSDT Program provides benefits to low-income children, including well-child care, immunizations, and necessary medical care. States can choose from three benefit options for separate CHIP programs: benchmark benefit package, benchmark equivalent coverage, or another approved health benefits plan. Benchmark-equivalent coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) must include basic benefits like hospital services, physician services, and well-child care, as well as 75% of the actuarial value for additional services like prescription drugs and vision/hearing services. States are encouraged to cover other services but abortions are not included. CHIP programs in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories provide coverage for additional services like prescription drugs, vision, and hearing. Abortions are only covered in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life. Different states use various approaches for their CHIP programs, with most plans based on state employees' health plans or modeled after Medicaid. CHIPRA brought changes to mental health and substance abuse coverage under CHIP, ensuring financial requirements are consistent for medical/surgical and mental health/substance abuse benefits. The new law under CHIP ensures that financial requirements and treatment limitations for mental health and substance abuse benefits must be no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. Dental services are now a required benefit under separate CHIP programs, including preventive care, restoration, and emergency treatment. Dental services are now a required benefit under separate CHIP programs, including preventive care, restoration, and emergency treatment. States have the option to provide dental services through benchmark dental benefit packages modeled after other healthcare plans. The new law also includes provisions for dental education for parents of newborns and dental services through federally qualified health centers. GAO will conduct a study on children's access to dental care under Medicaid and CHIP. The federal Insure Kids Now website and hotline will provide information on dental providers and covered services. A study by GAO will address children's access to dental care under Medicaid and CHIP, with recommendations for improving access. CHIPRA allows for dental-only supplemental coverage for children enrolled in employer coverage, with states setting income levels and coverage options. States may set upper income levels for new dental benchmark benefits plans under CHIP. Dental-only supplemental coverage is allowed under certain conditions, but must not offer more favorable coverage than full CHIP benefits. Waiting periods for children provided dental-only coverage are optional. States were previously allowed to pay a beneficiary's share of costs for employer-based group coverage. Under prior law, states could pay a beneficiary's share of costs for employer-based group coverage in CHIP if the plan was cost-effective. States may implement a premium assistance program under Medicaid if the employer plan is comprehensive and cost-effective. Under Medicaid, enrollment in an employer plan is considered cost-effective if the premiums and other costs are lower than the state's cost of providing Medicaid-covered services. States must offer \"wrap-around\" coverage for services not included in private plans. Many states use waivers to operate CHIP or Medicaid premium assistance programs. CHIPRA allows states to provide premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and parents. States have the option to offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and/or parents with access to employer-sponsored insurance. The premium assistance subsidy covers the price difference between the worker's out-of-pocket premium for the child(ren) and only covering the employee. A wrap-around is required for employer plans that do not meet CHIP benefit requirements. Individuals eligible for CHIP and employment-based coverage can choose regular CHIP over the premium assistance program. The premium assistance subsidy under CHIPRA covers the difference in out-of-pocket premiums for children versus only covering the employee. A wrap-around is required for employer plans that do not meet CHIP benefit requirements. No cost-effectiveness test is needed for child coverage using premium assistance. CHIPRA allows the subsidy to pay for the entire family's premium if it is more cost-effective than regular CHIP coverage for eligible individuals alone. States offering premium assistance must conduct outreach, and a premium assistance purchasing pool can be established for certain employers under CHIPRA. The CHIPRA law provides premium assistance for children in Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs and allows for a purchasing pool for employers with less than 250 employees who have CHIP-eligible individuals. It also streamlines coordination between public and private coverage, including making loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility a \"qualifying event\" for purchasing employer-sponsored coverage. Cost-sharing for beneficiaries may include premiums, deductibles, and copayments, with states permitted to impose cost-sharing for some beneficiaries and services under CHIP. The CHIPRA law allows for cost-sharing in Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs, with states able to impose fees for some services. Cost-sharing includes premiums, deductibles, and copayments, with different rules based on income levels. Premiums and service-related cost-sharing can be applied to targeted low-income children under CHIP Medicaid-expansion programs, with varying limits based on family income. The DRA allows for cost-sharing in Medicaid and CHIP programs, with premiums and service-related fees based on income levels. Cost-sharing cannot exceed 5% of family income, with exemptions for preventive services for children. Special rules apply to prescription drugs and emergency room copayments. States can impose premiums for CHIP programs, with limits based on family income. Providers may deny care for failure to pay cost-sharing. The state implements CHIP through a separate program with premiums or enrollment fees based on family income. Premiums for families under 150% FPL are limited by federal Medicaid regulations. Cost-sharing is allowed for higher-income families, with a 5% out-of-pocket limit. Preventive services are exempt from cost-sharing. States must inform families of limits and provide a way to stop payments once limits are reached. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) defines preventive services exempt from cost-sharing for all CHIP families, including newborn physician visits, physical exams, immunizations, dental services, and more. CHIPRA 2009 aimed to enhance data collection and reporting for CHIP and Medicaid, directing the development of child health quality measures and standardized reporting formats. The new law CHIPRA 2009 directs the Secretary of HHS to develop child health quality measures and reporting formats for CHIP and Medicaid. It adds reporting requirements to states' annual CHIP reports, including data on eligibility criteria and access to care. A study on children's access to care under Medicaid and CHIP will be conducted by GAO. CHIPRA also establishes the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC) to review policies affecting children's access to benefits and make recommendations for improvement. Reports to Congress under CHIPRA 2009 detail findings and recommendations for improving access and quality of care for children under Medicaid and CHIP. A new federal evaluation will assess 10 states with approved CHIP plans, examining outreach strategies, cost-sharing effects, disenrollment factors, and retention issues. Federal financing of CHIP includes appropriations for states' annual allotments, reallocation of funds, and factors like matching rates and administrative expense caps. The BBA 97 allocated approximately $40 billion for CHIP allotments from FY1998 to FY2007, with varying funding levels each year. The funding dropped to under $3.2 billion in FY2002-FY2004, known as the \"CHIP dip,\" due to budget constraints. The 110th Congress attempted to reauthorize CHIP with bills like H.R. 976 and H.R. 3963, but they were vetoed by President George W. Bush. The BBA 97 allocated funds for CHIP allotments from FY1998 to FY2007. Attempts to reauthorize CHIP with bills like H.R. 976 and H.R. 3963 were vetoed by President George W. Bush. CHIPRA provided a national appropriation for CHIP allotments totaling $68.9 billion from FY2009 to FY2013. The allotment of the annual federal CHIP appropriation among the states is determined by a formula set in law. The annual federal CHIP appropriation is determined by a formula set in law. Prior to CHIPRA, the national appropriation was divided among states based on survey estimates of low-income uninsured children. CHIP allotments are separate funding accounts for each state and territory, calculated to not exceed the national appropriation. The CHIP allotments for states and territories are separate funding accounts that do not exceed the national appropriation. These allotments are available for a certain period of time, with FY2009 allotments only available for two years. States can draw from the earliest active account until fully expended, then move to the next available allotment. The FY2009 federal CHIP allotments for states are determined by a formula based on growth factors and projections submitted to the Secretary of HHS. The FY2009 CHIP allotments for states and territories are determined by a formula based on growth factors and projections submitted to the Secretary of HHS. The largest of these amounts will be increased by 10% to serve as the state's federal CHIP allotment, with reductions if the national appropriation is insufficient. FY2010 allotments will be calculated based on various factors, including unspent funds from previous years and Contingency Fund payments. FY2011 and FY2013 allotments will be \"rebased\" on prior year spending, while FY2012 allotments will be based on the FY2011 allotment. For FY2012, state CHIP allotments will be \"rebased\" on prior year spending by multiplying the state's growth factor with the previous year's federal CHIP spending. Unspent allotments are redistributed to other states at the end of the period, with rules varying by fiscal year. In FY2006, additional funds were allocated to cover shortfalls in 12 states, with Illinois and Massachusetts experiencing higher spending than anticipated. In FY2006, Illinois and Massachusetts had higher CHIP spending than expected, leading to shortfalls totaling around $100 million, mostly from Illinois. A bill passed in the 109th Congress specified the redistribution of $147 million in unspent FY2004 allotments. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 required funds to be distributed to states facing monthly funding shortfalls in FY2007 to delay shortfalls until March 2007. Additionally, up to half of unspent FY2005 allotments could be redistributed to further delay shortfalls. The NIHRA provisions allowed for the redistribution of unspent FY2005 funds to delay shortfalls in federal CHIP funds until May 2007. P.L. 110-28 appropriated up to $650 million to cover shortfalls in 10 states for the remainder of FY2007. In FY2008, MMSEA redistributed unspent FY2005 allotments to states with shortfalls and appropriated up to $1.6 billion for remaining shortfalls. Actual funding totaled just under $1 billion. For FY2009, unspent FY2006 allotments were redistributed to states with projected shortfalls, with an additional $275 million appropriated for remaining shortfalls. CHIPRA increased FY2009 allotments to prevent federal funding shortfalls for the second half of the year. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund created under CHIPRA prevents federal funding shortfalls for states. It provides direct payments to shortfall states for CHIP children above a target enrollment level, capped at 20% of the national allotment amount. CHIP is a federal-state matching program similar to Medicaid, with the state's share determined by the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). The CHIP program is a federal-state matching program where the federal government matches state spending from CHIP accounts. The state's share of program spending for Medicaid is determined by the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). The enhanced FMAP (E-FMAP) for CHIP reduces a state's share of expenditures by 30% compared to the regular FMAP. The E-FMAP ranges from 65% to 83.09% for CHIP, with a ceiling of 85% and a floor of 65%. Federal spending for CHIP administrative expenses is capped at 10%. Under CHIPRA, federal CHIP bonus payments are available to states that increase Medicaid child enrollment and implement specific outreach and enrollment activities. The funding for these payments comes from an initial $3.225 billion appropriation in FY2009 and unspent national allotment and redistribution amounts."
