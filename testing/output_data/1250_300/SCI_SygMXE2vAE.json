Our work is motivated by Jain and Wallace BID15, who argue that attention may not always solve model issues. We propose evaluating hidden states and token representations instead, focusing on fine-tuned BERT models. By analyzing token vectors qualitatively and probing language abilities quantitatively, we track transformations of each token throughout the network. This allows us to understand the changes made to tokens' representations in every layer. The study focuses on analyzing token representations in fine-tuned BERT models by tracking transformations of each token throughout the network.

Probing tasks are used to analyze information stored within the transformed tokens after each layer, focusing on specific tasks and how language information is maintained or forgotten by the model. Tasks include Named Entity Labeling, Coreference Resolution, Relation Classification, Question Type Classification, and Supporting Fact Identification. The tasks analyzed in the study include Named Entity Recognition, Coreference Resolution, Relation Classification, and Question Type Classification. The tasks are based on various datasets and require the model to predict entity categories, coreference between mentions, relation types between entities, and question types. For the Edge Probing task, the Question Classification dataset includes 500 types of questions. The model predicts supporting facts for Question Answering tasks, testing the significance of token representations. HotpotQA and bAbI provide sentencewise supporting facts, while SQuAD focuses on single-hop reasoning.

A probing task is constructed for each dataset to assess their ability to recognize relevant information.

The curr_chunk discusses tuning hyperparameters and training modalities for Transformer models like BERT and GPT-2 in a probing setup. Input length is set at 384 tokens for experiments, with evaluations done every 1000 iterations. Different tasks like bAbI and HotpotQA are evaluated, including single-task and multitask models. Span prediction and Sequence Classification are compared for bAbI, while HotpotQA tasks are divided into Support Only (SP) and another task. The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation results of Transformer models like BERT and GPT-2 on tasks from HotpotQA and bAbI. The models perform well on SQuAD but struggle with more challenging tasks from HotpotQA. GPT-2 excels in bAbI tasks, while BERT struggles with tasks 17 and 19 in the multi-task setting. The evaluation results of Transformer models BERT and GPT-2 show that GPT-2 performs better on bAbi tasks, while BERT struggles with tasks 17 and 19. Qualitative analysis reveals recurring patterns in vector transformations, with results compared across different network layers. Results from different models of BERT are analyzed, including fine-tuned and non-fine-tuned versions. The PCA representations of tokens in various layers show multiple phases in answering questions across different QA tasks. The early layers group tokens into topical clusters, resembling embedding spaces from Word2Vec, but lack task-specific information. Later layers focus on connecting entities with mentions and attributes. In the middle layers of neural networks, entities are connected by their relation within a specific input context, forming task-specific clusters. These clusters help in answering questions by filtering question-relevant entities. For example, a cluster containing words like countries, schools, detention, and country names aids in answering a question about common punishments in the UK and Ireland. Another cluster highlights the relationship between entities like Emily and wolves, assisting in identifying relevant facts. These clusters are observed in the HotpotQA dataset. The highlighted cluster suggests that Emily is linked to wolves, with other mentions of Wolves. The HotpotQA model shows similar clusters with more coreferences. The model improves in recognizing entities, mentions, and relations in higher network layers. BERT models also exhibit these patterns. Identifying relevant context parts is crucial for Question Answering. Traditional models filter context based on question similarity. BERT models transform tokens to match question tokens onto relevant context tokens, with stronger ability in higher layers to distinguish relevant information. Performance increases over successive layers for SQuAD and bAbI, but fine-tuned HotpotQA model does not reach high accuracy. This inability explains why BERT struggles on this dataset. The BERT model struggles to identify correct Supporting Facts, affecting its performance on the dataset. Vector representations help in retracing decisions and making the model more transparent. The model's ability to separate correct answer tokens diminishes in the last network layers, leading to a performance drop in general NLP tasks. Fine-tuning on HotpotQA results in a loss of information in last-layer representations, impacting tasks like NEL and COREF.

Fine-tuning on HotpotQA leads to a loss of information in last-layer representations, impacting tasks like NEL and COREF. The model's ability to separate correct answer tokens diminishes in the last network layers, causing a drop in performance in general NLP tasks. Comparisons to human reasoning show similarities in phases of answering questions, but BERT can process all input parts simultaneously, allowing for concurrent phases depending on the task.

Fine-tuning on HotpotQA leads to a loss of information in last-layer representations, impacting tasks like NEL and COREF. Comparisons to human reasoning show similarities in phases of answering questions, but BERT can process all input parts simultaneously, allowing for concurrent phases depending on the task. In contrast, GPT-2 pays particular attention to the first token of a sequence, leading to a separation of clusters in its hidden states. This issue is present in all layers except for the Embedding Layer, the first Transformer block, and the last one. To address this, the first token is masked during dimensionality reduction. GPT-2, like BERT, separates relevant Supporting Facts and questions in the vector space, and also extracts additional sentences that are not Supporting Facts. Observations from GPT-2 suggest that its analysis extends beyond BERT, showing similarities in separating relevant information. Future work will involve more probing tasks to confirm these initial findings. The model can also reveal failure states and the difficulty of specific tasks through hidden state representations. The hidden state representations in the network can reveal insights into both correct and wrong predictions. Early layers can provide clues as to why a wrong candidate answer was chosen, such as selecting the wrong Supporting Fact or misresolution of coreferences. When network confidence is low, transformations may not follow the usual phases, resulting in little relevance to the prediction. The hidden state representations in the network can provide insights into correct and wrong predictions. Early layers can offer clues on why a wrong answer was chosen. Space is transformed in each layer, with tokens mostly kept in a single cluster. Fine-tuning has little impact on core NLP abilities, as the pretrained model already contains sufficient information. Positional embedding is crucial for Transformer network performance, addressing the lack of sequential information compared to RNNs. The positional embedding is crucial for Transformer network performance, maintaining its effects even in late layers. Visualizations show its importance in tasks like SQuAD. Fine-tuning on SQuAD improves question type resolution, while bAbI tasks lose this ability due to static structure. The model fine-tuned on bAbI tasks loses the ability to distinguish question types due to the static structure of the samples. In contrast, fine-tuning on HotpotQA does not improve performance. Transformer networks store interpretable information in hidden states, aiding in identifying misclassified examples and model weaknesses. The hidden states of Transformer models store interpretable information that can help identify misclassified examples and model weaknesses. It is suggested that lower layers may be more suitable for certain tasks in Transfer Learning, and that specific layers in Transformer networks seem to solve different problems, indicating a potential modularity that could be beneficial in training processes. Further research is needed to explore methods for processing this information and the potential advantages of skip connections between non-adjacent layers. Our work aims to reveal internal processes within Transformer-based models, suggesting further research to thoroughly understand state-of-the-art models and improve on them by exploring modularity in training processes."
