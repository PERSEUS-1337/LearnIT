    "content": "The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), enacted in 1990, provides one-time cash benefits to individuals exposed to ionizing radiation from atomic weapons testing or uranium industry work. Administered by the DOJ, over 30,000 claims totaling nearly $2 billion have been approved. Benefits are paid from general revenue and are considered mandatory spending. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) provides benefits related to atomic weapons testing, with applications required to be filed before July 10, 2022. The United States conducted 1,054 atomic weapons tests from 1945 to 1992, with the majority at the Nevada Test Site. The Nevada Test Site (NTS) conducted 928 atomic weapons tests, with 828 underground tests and 100 atmospheric tests. These atmospheric tests released radioactive material into the atmosphere. The largest atmospheric test at NTS was the Hood Test on July 5, 1957, with an energy yield equivalent to 74,000 tons of TNT. The RECA program provides benefits to onsite participants and downwinders of atomic weapons tests. The RECA program offers benefits to individuals exposed to radiation from atomic weapons testing or working in the uranium industry. Benefits include one-time lump sum payments of $75,000 for onsite participants, $50,000 for downwinders, and $100,000 for uranium workers. These payments are not adjusted for inflation and are not taxable, but may be reduced by other compensation received. No medical benefits are provided under the RECA program. The RECA program provides benefits to individuals exposed to radiation from atomic weapons testing or working in the uranium industry. Eligible uranium workers can receive an additional $50,000 in compensation and medical benefits under the EEOICPA. Benefits are paid to survivors in a specific order of precedence if the claimant is deceased. Onsite participants must meet exposure and disease requirements to qualify for RECA benefits. To be eligible for RECA benefits, an onsite participant must have been present during atmospheric atomic weapons testing conducted by the United States in specific geographic areas. If there are no survivors to a claimant, no benefit is paid. The RECA benefits eligibility criteria include being present during atmospheric atomic weapons testing in specific geographic areas, holding certain occupations, and performing designated activities during the testing period and up to six months after. Employees or contractors of various government agencies involved in nuclear testing activities, including decontamination, cloud tracking, maintenance on Enewetak atoll, or radiological safety monitoring, are eligible for RECA benefits. To be eligible for RECA benefits, individuals must have been involved in nuclear testing activities or as a downwinder near the Nevada Test Site. They must have contracted specific types of cancers after exposure to ionizing radiation. Uranium miners must also meet specific exposure and disease requirements to qualify for benefits. A downwinder must have contracted one of the types of cancers listed in Table 2 after exposure to ionizing radiation from an atmospheric atomic weapons test at NTS. To qualify for RECA benefits, a uranium miner must have worked in an above-ground or underground uranium mine for at least one year between 1942 and 1971, or have been exposed to at least 40 working-level months of radiation in specific states. The miner must have developed lung cancer or certain respiratory diseases after radiation exposure. A uranium miner or ore transporter may qualify for RECA benefits if they meet specific exposure and disease requirements. They must have worked in a uranium mill or transporting uranium ore from 1941 to 1971 and developed certain respiratory diseases or cancers after radiation exposure. The RECA program administered by the DOJ's Civil Division provides benefits for individuals with specific illnesses related to uranium exposure, such as primary renal cancer, chronic renal disease, non-malignant respiratory diseases like pulmonary fibrosis, and silicosis. Claimants must submit written documentation of their illnesses to qualify for benefits, with special consideration given to Native American applicants. Application decisions are made within 12 months by an assistant director in the DOJ Civil Division. Application decisions for RECA benefits are made by an assistant director within the DOJ Civil Division. Decisions must be made within 12 months of receiving a completed application. If no decision is made within 12 months, the application is automatically approved. The 2000 RECA amendments authorized HHS to provide grants for cancer screenings and medical documentation assistance. These grants are administered by HRSA as the RESEP program. There are six RESEP clinics operating in five states, with one clinic serving Native Americans. Applicants are not required to be screened for cancer at RESEP clinics. Denied applicants can file an appeal with the DOJ. Applicants for RECA benefits can file appeals with the DOJ if denied benefits, with decisions made by an appeals officer appointed by the assistant attorney general of the Civil Division. Appeals must be made in writing within 60 days, and can be further appealed in U.S. district court if dissatisfied. Representation by licensed attorneys or non-attorney tribal representatives is allowed, with limitations on fees charged. Non-attorney representatives of tribal organizations are authorized to represent RECA claimants and cannot charge fees. Licensed attorneys can collect fees based on the date of their contract with the claimant. In unsuccessful claims, attorneys can recover their costs. A 2007 court decision allows attorneys to recover expenses in addition to their fee. Some Members of Congress are considering legislation to expand the RECA program as it reaches its 25th year. Some Members of Congress are considering legislation to expand the RECA program to provide benefits to uranium workers and expand eligibility for downwinders. Current law limits benefits to those present in designated counties during atmospheric testing at NTS, excluding residents of other affected areas. These issues are likely to keep RECA on the congressional agenda. Residents of Guam affected by fallout from atomic weapons testing in the Pacific Ocean are not eligible for benefits under the RECA program. Concerns about health effects led to unsuccessful attempts by downwinders to seek compensation through civil courts before RECA was established in 1990. Legislation introduced in 1979 aimed to provide compensation to civilian downwinders affected by atmospheric testing at NTS. Legislation introduced in 1979 aimed to provide compensation to downwinders affected by atmospheric atomic testing at NTS, covering damages for cancer, onsite participants, and sheep herds. The bill outlined eligibility criteria for downwinders with specific types of cancer in a defined geographical area. A companion Senate bill also sought to make the United States liable for damages to downwinders, onsite participants, affected sheep herds, and uranium miners, with provisions for a federal advisory board to add to the list of specified cancers. The Senate bill (S. 1865) aimed to make the United States liable for damages to downwinders, onsite participants, affected sheep herds, and uranium miners. It proposed creating a federal advisory board to add specified cancers and expand the affected areas, including counties in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare would have the authority to include additional affected areas. The original RECA statute covered a smaller downwinder eligibility area compared to the proposed bill. The RECA program initially covered specific areas in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah for downwinder eligibility. The 2000 RECA amendments expanded the eligibility area, and there have been efforts to further expand it to include additional states affected by atmospheric atomic weapons testing at NTS. The RECA program initially covered specific areas in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah for downwinder eligibility. Efforts have been made to expand eligibility to include additional states affected by atmospheric atomic weapons testing at NTS, such as Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, and Guam. In 2002, HRSA requested a study by the NRC on the health effects of radiation exposure, which concluded that decisions on additional downwinder eligibility should not be solely based on geographic area. The NRC issued a report in 2005 advising against adding more downwind counties for RECA benefits solely based on geography. They recommended a science-based approach considering factors like individuals' exposure to fallout, including ingestion of Iodine 131 through contaminated milk. The NRC suggested using a model of probability of causation to evaluate individual claims for benefits instead of relying on geography for downwinder eligibility. The NRC report recommended using a model of probability of causation to evaluate individual claims for benefits under the RECA program, moving away from geography-based eligibility for downwinders. This model would estimate each applicant's absorbed dose of radionuclides based on various factors and calculate the probability that their specific cancer was caused by radiation exposure. Congress would determine benefit thresholds based on these probabilities, similar to methods used in other benefit programs. This approach has not been part of the RECA program or its amendments. The RECA program has never included disability compensation under EEOICPA or VA. Legislation has not been proposed to change RECA downwinder eligibility from geography-based to probability of causation. The NRC recommends a probability of causation model for claims, but this may result in fewer successful claims due to low radiation exposure levels. Congress may consider changes to compensation eligibility criteria based on the NRC report. The committee's report suggests that exposure to radiation from fallout is unlikely to have been a significant factor in developing cancer for most cases. Changes in eligibility criteria for compensation based on scientific findings may lead to few successful claims. RECA benefits for uranium workers are only available for those exposed before 1972, when private ownership of uranium for nuclear power plants became legal. Since the enactment of the Private Ownership of Special Nuclear Materials Act, private ownership of uranium for nuclear power plants has been legal, creating an additional market for mined and milled uranium. Legislation has been introduced to expand RECA eligibility to uranium workers exposed to radiation after 1971, including mine core drillers, and to research health effects of uranium tailing piles. Advocates argue that despite safety regulations, uranium workers remain at risk for radon-induced diseases due to higher radiation exposure limits. The RECA program aims to provide restitution to individuals affected by fallout from atomic weapons tests and uranium miners exposed to high levels of radon. Advocates propose expanding RECA to cover post-1971 uranium activities to include workers in the commercial uranium sector. This expansion would go beyond the program's original intent and address the increased risk of radon-induced diseases among uranium workers. Expanding RECA to cover post-1971 uranium activities would extend benefits to workers in the commercial uranium sector, beyond the program's original focus on atomic weapons tests and federal uranium activities. Illnesses from commercial uranium mining would likely be covered by state workers' compensation systems."
