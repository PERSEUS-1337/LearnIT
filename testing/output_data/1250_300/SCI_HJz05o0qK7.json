    "content": "Many machine learning algorithms use vector embeddings or discrete codes to represent input data. Evaluating compositionality in these representations is important, but there is a lack of general-purpose tools for this in the machine learning literature. A procedure for evaluating compositionality by measuring how well a model can approximate true representations is described. This procedure helps characterize compositional structure in various settings and explore its relationship with learning dynamics, human judgments, representational similarity, and generalization. The text discusses the relationship between compositionality and learning dynamics in various settings, focusing on representations arising from a communication game. It explores how modern representation learning techniques reflect compositional structure and questions whether compositionality arises in learning problems without built-in structure. The text explores the concept of compositionality in machine learning approaches, specifically focusing on a character-based encoding scheme learned for a communication task. It highlights the need for a standardized, formal, and quantitative technique to evaluate claims about compositional structure in learning problems. The text discusses the need for a standardized technique to evaluate compositional structure in learned representations. It introduces an oracle evaluation paradigm and proposes a formal framework called TRE to measure compositionality in model inputs and outputs. The focus is on finding an explicitly compositional model that reflects the true model. The text introduces TRE, a method for evaluating compositionality in model inputs and outputs by optimizing over primitive meaning representations. It also presents experiments on the evolution of compositionality in relation to other model properties and its correlation with human judgments. The text discusses the evolution of compositionality in relation to other model properties, correlation with human judgments, constraints on distances between representations, and the necessity of compositional representations for generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. It also explores the debate on whether distributed representations can model compositional phenomena and various approaches for compositional representation learning. The text discusses the evolution of compositionality in relation to learnability and the implementation of a compositional encoding scheme with distributed representations. Various approaches for compositional representation learning have been proposed, with and without explicit composition operations built into the model. The main experimental question is when and how compositionality arises in models without explicit composition operations. Techniques from linguistics and philosophy are used to evaluate compositionality, but applying these techniques in general settings with non-string-valued representation spaces is challenging. There is a lack of existing work describing a suitable procedure for answering questions about compositionality in the general case. The text discusses the challenges of evaluating compositionality in general settings with non-string-valued representation spaces. Existing work lacks a suitable procedure for answering questions about compositionality in the general case. Machine learning research has responded by using ad-hoc manual analyses and task-specific structures to provide evidence of compositionality. Our work aims to offer a standard and scalable alternative to these evaluations. Other authors base their analysis on related phenomena, such as correlation between representation similarity and generalization to novel inputs. Our approach offers a standardized and scalable alternative to existing methods for evaluating compositionality in non-string-valued representation spaces. We base our analysis on related phenomena, such as correlation between representation similarity and generalization to novel inputs, to track stricter notions of compositionality. Our work complements existing research in natural language processing on learning composition functions for modeling purposes. The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation of compositionality in representation systems, specifically in a communication task where speaker models send messages to listener models for downstream tasks. The focus is on determining if the representations are compositional based on the structure of the inputs. The approach is seen as a demonstration of applying NLP techniques to evaluate data from various sources. The curr_chunk discusses an automated procedure for evaluating the compositionality of representations in a communication task. It proposes a technique based on prior knowledge of the compositional structure of inputs, using a dataset of observations and a model to generate representations. The curr_chunk discusses the compositional structure of inputs, assuming inputs can be labeled with tree-structured derivations. It defines compositionality in terms of representations computed by a model f, where each f(x) is determined by the structure of D(x). The model is considered compositional if it is a homomorphism from inputs to representations. In linguistic contexts, inputs are natural language strings, derivations are syntax trees, and representations are logical representations of meaning. To show that a fragment of language is compositional, a lexicon mapping words to meaning representations and a grammar for composing meanings are needed. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges in identifying lexicon entries and handling languages with irregular structures in compositional representations. It highlights the importance of identifying primitive representations for words in order to compose meanings effectively. The curr_chunk explores the compositionality of speaker models and the challenges in reproducing model predictions exactly. It suggests that while some predictions can be reproduced approximately, the quality of the approximation measures the compositionality of the true predictor. The curr_chunk discusses measuring the compositionality of true predictors through an evaluation procedure called Tree Reconstruction Error (TRE). It involves choosing a compositional approximation to f with parameters \u03b7, computing dataset-level evaluation metrics, and assessing how well TRE captures the intuition behind the evaluation. The evaluation metric TRE(X) measures how well compositional predictions match true model predictions. It allows flexibility in choosing composition functions and parameters to optimize jointly. Care must be taken to avoid trivial solutions when learning the composition function. When choosing a composition function, especially when learning it, it is important to avoid trivial solutions. If every element in X is assigned a unique derivation, then there will always be a composition function that achieves a certain result. This paper explores experiments with fixed and learned composition functions. Implementation details include using gradient descent for models with continuous parameters and differentiable functions. For discrete parameters, a continuous relaxation approach can be used. An SGD-based solver for the evaluation metric TRE(X) is provided in the software release. Task-specific optimizers may also be employed for different problems. The paper discusses the use of task-specific optimizers for various problems, including machine translation alignment models. It also explores the relationship between compositionality and learning dynamics, focusing on the information bottleneck theory of representation learning. The paper investigates how the compression phase in deep models can lead to a compositional representation of input distribution. The paper explores the compression phase in deep models to find a compositional representation of the input distribution. It uses a meta-learning framework to predict classifiers for visual concepts composed of single attributes or conjunctions of attributes. The model is trained to minimize logistic loss between logits and ground-truth labels. The evaluation is based on a training dataset of 9000 image triplets. The model is trained on 9000 image triplets with attributes like background color and digit identity. It achieves a validation accuracy of 75.2% and explores the relationship between information bottleneck and compositionality. The paper compares TRE(X) and mutual information I(\u03b8; x) to analyze the degree of compositionality. The relationship between TRE(X) and mutual information I(\u03b8; X) is analyzed to understand the degree of compositionality in representation learning tasks, such as high-dimensional embeddings of words and phrases in natural language processing applications. The results suggest that compression in the information bottleneck framework is linked to the discovery of compositional representations. The study explores the compositional nature of phrase representations in natural language processing. It focuses on the use of Total Reconstruction Error (TRE) to determine the level of compositionality in bigrams. The analysis differs from previous work by using TRE to search for atomic representations instead of relying on pre-trained word embeddings. The goal is to validate this approach and integrate it into the broader framework of representation learning in language processing. The study investigates the compositional nature of phrase representations in natural language processing by training word and bigram embeddings using the CBOW objective. It examines the closeness of phrase embeddings to the composition of their constituent word embeddings using vector addition and cosine distance. Comparison of bigram-level compositionality judgments is done with human ratings on noun-noun compounds. The study compares bigram-level compositionality judgments computed by TRE with human ratings on noun-noun compounds. Results show an inverse correlation between TRE and human judgments (\u03c1 = \u22120.34, p < 0.01). Collocations rated as most compositional by TRE include application form, polo shirt, and research project, while those rated least compositional are fine line, lip service, and nest egg. The next section aims to formalize the relationship between TRE and topographic similarity in representation analysis. BID7 introduces the concept of topographic similarity, suggesting that a learned representation is effective if distances between representations correlate with distances between their derivations. This provides weak evidence for compositionality. The section aims to clarify the relationship between two evaluations by equipping derivations with a distance function, using tree edit distance BID3. Proposition 1 states conditions for approximating f and defining tree edit distance. The curr_chunk discusses the relationship between compositionality and generalization in communication games. It highlights that small Tree Edit Distance (TRE) is not enough for topographic similarity, but it does impose constraints on inferences from similarity judgments. The experiments focus on how derivations and representations are related in communication games. In the final set of experiments, the relationship between compositionality and generalization in communication games is investigated. Agents are trained from random initial conditions to measure the compositional structure of the language that emerges and its impact on performance with familiar and novel objects. A speaker model describes target objects to a listener model using a discrete code, focusing on a reference game. Two policies, a speaker, and a listener, are trained to communicate effectively. The experiment focuses on a reference game where two policies, a speaker, and a listener, are trained to communicate effectively. The speaker observes target objects and sends a message to the listener, who reconstructs the objects. Both models receive a reward for correct predictions. The communication protocol is discrete, and policies are jointly trained using a policy gradient objective. The target referents consist of two objects with two attributes each, and a subset of object pairs is held out for evaluation of generalization. The experiment involves training two policies, a speaker, and a listener, to communicate effectively in a reference game. The communication protocol is discrete, and the models receive rewards for correct predictions. A subset of object pairs is held out for evaluation of generalization. The representations are fixed-length discrete codes, and the composition and distance operations are different from previous examples. The agent messages are represented as sequences of one-hot vectors, and the error function is based on the 1 distance between vectors. The composition function involves free composition parameters in Equation 2, allowing for modeling non-commutative aspects of string production. The experiment involves training two policies, a speaker, and a listener, to communicate effectively in a reference game using fixed-length discrete codes. The matrices redistribute tokens in input strings but do not affect token choice, allowing for modeling non-commutative aspects of string production. Compositional languages show lower performance, even in successful training runs. Languages resulting from training runs have different token redistribution effects but induce similar listener performance. TRE is computed via gradient descent with arbitrary vectors for elements of D0, allowing for optimization of \u03b4 and * using the same procedure as preceding sections. Results from training 100 speaker-listener pairs show a nuanced relationship between compositionality and generalization. The Total Reward Error (TRE) is correlated with generalization error and absolute model reward. \"Compositional\" languages often stem from poor communication strategies rather than successful ones, as low TRE can result from trivial strategies leading to poor performance. Despite the correlation, low TRE is not a necessary condition for generalization error. The Total Reward Error (TRE) is correlated with generalization error, but low TRE does not guarantee good generalization. A new evaluation method called TRE is used to assess compositional structure in representation learning problems. This method infers primitive meaning representations that approximate observed representations and measures the quality of this approximation. TRE-based analysis has been applied to various representation learning problems, exploring compositionality and learning dynamics. Many questions regarding compositionality and representation learning remain unanswered. The Total Reward Error (TRE) is used to evaluate compositional structure in representation learning problems. It correlates with generalization error but does not guarantee good generalization. TRE-based analysis has been applied to various representation learning problems, exploring compositionality and learning dynamics. Many questions remain open, including how to generalize TRE when oracle derivations are not available.
