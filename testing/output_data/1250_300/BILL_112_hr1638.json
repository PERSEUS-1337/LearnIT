    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Dollar Bill Act of 2011\". Congress finds that it delegated the power to regulate the value of money to the Federal Reserve System, but the value of the US dollar has fallen dramatically and become unstable. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has not produced a stable and reliable value for the dollar, which hinders economic growth. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has not produced a stable and reliable value for the United States dollar, leading to economic hindrances such as increased costs of capital, reduced real earnings for workers, and decreased value of financial assets and retirement accounts. This instability also damages the economic and political standing of the United States in the world community and creates anxiety and uncertainty in financial markets and the public. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is directed to make the value of the U.S. dollar equal to the price of gold on the COMEX exchange and maintain it at that level. They are also instructed to promote stable financial markets during and after the transition. Additionally, tax depreciation is addressed. \"Effective January 1, 2011, entities can expense 100 percent of capital investment for tax purposes in the year of investment. The Congressional Budget Office will calculate the impact on Federal revenues in a present value basis. Capital investments historically yield higher returns than government bonds.\" SEC. 6. CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISION.\n\nIf provisions of this Act conflict with the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, this Act will take precedence.\n\nSEC. 7. REMOVAL OF FEDERAL RESERVE BANK AUTHORITY TO PAY EARNINGS ON RESERVES.\n\nAmendments to the Federal Reserve Act remove the authority for Federal Reserve banks to pay earnings on reserves."
