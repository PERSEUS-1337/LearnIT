    "content": "Nanotechnology focuses on understanding and exploiting unique properties of matter at nanoscale. Congress is concerned about protecting human health and the environment. Research has raised concerns about potential EHS implications of nanoscale materials. Federal government tools to address these issues include research, regulation, and international engagement. Properties of nanoscale materials have both beneficial applications and potential adverse implications for the environment and human health and safety. Nanoscale materials have great potential for beneficial applications but also raise concerns about adverse implications for the environment and human health. There is a focus on protecting the health and safety of those working with nanoscale materials and understanding the environmental impact of nanomanufacturing processes. EHS concerns primarily revolve around engineered nanomaterials intentionally designed and produced. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) was launched in 2000 to coordinate federal nanotechnology research efforts, with significant investments made by the government and private sector. Many countries have established their own national nanotechnology programs, with a focus on engineered nanomaterials and their potential environmental and health implications. The U.S. government funded $1.9 billion in 2008 for nanotechnology, leading to global investments of over $17 billion. Concerns exist about the potential health and environmental impacts of nanotechnology products and processes, including uncertainties about particle transport, reactions, distribution, and accumulation. Some argue that concerns are overstated, as nanoscale materials are often embedded in other substances. Some argue that concerns about nanotechnology EHS implications are overgeneralized and overstated. Nanoscale materials are often embedded in other substances during manufacturing, some nanotechnology products do not contain nanoscale particles, and nanoscale particles can aggregate in the environment. Additional research is needed for a rigorous risk assessment of nanoscale materials, and precautionary measures should be taken to protect health and safety. The National Research Council (NRC) and the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) recommend further research for a thorough risk assessment of nanoscale materials. Precautionary measures should be taken to safeguard the health and safety of workers, the public, and the environment. Stakeholders agree on the need to address concerns regarding the toxicity, risk assessment, and environmental impact of nanoscale materials. Congressional action options and federal agencies' roles in nanotechnology regulation are also discussed in the report. The curr_chunk discusses nanotechnology EHS issues, options for congressional action, and federal agencies' roles in nanotechnology regulation. It also provides references for further information on nanotechnology-related regulatory challenges. Many new technologies have delivered societal benefits while presenting EHS challenges, such as automobiles causing accidental deaths and emissions that damage air quality. Nanotechnology offers economic benefits but also poses EHS challenges. GM plants have advantages like higher crop yields but critics raise concerns about food allergies. Proponents of nanotechnology argue it can reduce risks and offer benefits like energy efficiency and disease prevention. Nanotechnology offers various benefits such as reducing energy consumption, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, improving industrial processes, remediating environmental damage, and advancing healthcare with disease diagnostics and treatment. Nanoscale materials show promise in detecting and removing pollutants, improving disease monitoring, and extending lives, as seen in the National Cancer Institute's initiative to apply nanotechnology in cancer prevention and treatment. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) launched a $145 million initiative in 2004 to apply nanotechnology in cancer prevention, detection, and treatment. Nanoscale particles have both positive and negative consequences due to their unique properties, according to the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office (NNCO) director. Nanoscale materials have dual effects, being beneficial as antibacterial agents but also potentially harmful by disrupting ecosystems. Some particles can breach the blood-brain barrier, offering opportunities for targeted drug delivery to treat brain disorders. Certain nanoscale materials have the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier for targeted drug delivery, but there are concerns about unintended harm. Nanoparticles with high reactivity are being explored for various applications, including catalysis and protective gear, but there are also risks of cell damage. Carbon nanotubes have diverse uses but some exhibit properties of concern. Nanotechnology, including carbon nanotubes, has a wide range of potential applications but concerns exist about their similarity to asbestos fibers and potential harm to humans and animals. More research is needed to understand the implications of nanoscale particles on health, safety, and the environment. Nanotechnology research is still emerging with a lack of information on potential health and environmental risks posed by nanoscale particles and devices. More research is needed to assess these risks as current tools are inadequate. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) is addressing potential EHS risks associated with nanotechnology. Research suggests that nanoscale particles may pose new risks to human health and the environment. Leaders emphasize the importance of addressing societal and ethical issues to ensure technology benefits without adverse effects. The NRC's third assessment of the NNI highlights the importance of addressing EHS-related uncertainty in nanotechnology to prevent potential risks that could undermine confidence and trust. Concerns have been raised by consumer and advocacy groups regarding the use of nanomaterials in various products, leading to regulatory uncertainty and hindering industry adoption. Consumer and advocacy groups have raised concerns about the use of engineered nanomaterials in various products, leading to regulatory uncertainty and hindering industry adoption. The nanotechnology industry and environmental groups agree on the need for a thorough evaluation of the health and environmental effects of nanomaterials to avoid uncertainties and potential risks. Business leaders in nanotechnology believe that the risks of exposure to nanoparticles are not fully understood, emphasizing the importance of government intervention in addressing health and environmental risks associated with nanotechnology. The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies (PEN) has warned about potential health and environmental risks associated with nanotechnology. Addressing EHS issues is crucial for protecting human health, ensuring safety, and maintaining public confidence in nanotechnology. Businesses and investors recognize the importance of government intervention in managing risks and promoting the safe use of nanoscale materials. The U.S. regulatory environment for nanotechnology is crucial for ensuring safety, public confidence, and economic benefits. It should enable innovation, assess risks accurately, and facilitate the market entry of safe products. A favorable regulatory environment can attract investments and promote innovation in the United States, while an ineffective one may hinder progress and drive stakeholders to other countries with more conducive regulatory conditions. The U.S. regulatory environment for nanotechnology is important for innovation, economic growth, and job creation. If regulations are not effective, it could hinder progress and drive investments to other countries with better regulatory conditions. This could result in missed economic benefits and potential risks to health, safety, and the environment. The United States may miss out on economic benefits of nanotechnology if regulations are not effective, potentially driving investments to other countries with better regulatory conditions. International coordination on EHS research could help address nanotechnology EHS concerns and improve regulatory consistency among nations. International coordination on EHS research is crucial for addressing nanotechnology EHS concerns and improving regulatory consistency among nations. This shared knowledge could inform regulatory decision-making and enhance the protection of workers and consumers in global supply chains. Funding for EHS research in nanotechnology is allocated internally by individual agencies and reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget before becoming part of the President's annual budget submission to Congress. The NNI budget, including the EHS component, is reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget before being included in the President's annual budget submission to Congress. Funding for nanotechnology EHS research is decentralized, with coordination through the NEHI working group. In FY2010, EHS research funding was $91.6 million, representing 5.1% of the total NNI budget. President Obama requested $116.9 million (6.6%) for EHS research in FY2011. President Obama requested $116.9 million (6.6%) for EHS research in FY2011, with NNI officials stating that EHS investments are not easily quantified. PCAST agreed, emphasizing the interconnected nature of nanotechnology EHS research with other applications, suggesting that detailed reporting on EHS relevance may not be critical for prioritization. The NNI agencies spent nearly twice as much on EHS research in FY2006 than previously reported, with critics arguing that the current level of federal nanotechnology EHS research is too low and represents too small a share of the overall NNI budget. Critics argue that federal nanotechnology EHS research funding is too low and represents a small share of the NNI budget. However, executive branch officials claim that the US leads in EHS funding and research investment. OSTP director John Marburger and NNCO director E. Clayton Teague assert US leadership in nanotechnology EHS research, with investments totaling nearly $180 million from 2005 to 2008. The United States leads in nanotechnology EHS research with investments of nearly $180 million from 2005 to 2008. Both the NRC and PCAST recommend expanding federal EHS research funding to ensure responsible development. PCAST acknowledges EHS risks but finds the current federal investment level appropriate, emphasizing the need for expanded research and standardization. Funding for EHS should grow in line with the NNI research strategy and capacity. The NNI research strategy emphasizes the need for expanded funding for nanotechnology EHS research to address emerging issues effectively. PCAST recommends targeted funding for strategic EHS research over absolute dollar amounts to ensure useful information for regulators and policymakers. The Federal Government should ensure mission-driven agencies have sufficient funds to address specific EHS issues. PCAST credits the NNI's substantial funding increases for nanotechnology EHS research for agencies like NIOSH, EPA, FDA, and CPSC. FDA and CPSC will now have specific funds for nanotechnology for the first time, a move welcomed by NNAP. Recommendations include allocating a fixed percentage of NNI funding to EHS research, with a proposed 10% allocation amounting to $178.1 million in FY2010, nearly double the reported level. The NanoBusiness Alliance and the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies support allocating 10% of NNI funding, equivalent to $178.1 million in FY2010, for EHS research. Different organizations have proposed various funding approaches, with the Environmental Defense Fund suggesting $100 million or more for federal nanotechnology EHS research. In 2008, PCAST recommended a strategic approach to nanotechnology EHS research funding, emphasizing the importance of scientifically determined priorities over fixed dollar amounts. They suggested that a 10 percent requirement could accelerate research growth, but cautioned against rapid funding increases. EHS research also relies on advancements in non-EHS areas like instrumentation development and basic nanomaterial research. Some NGOs advocate for a more restrained approach to nanotechnology R&D. Some NGOs caution against rapid nanotechnology research and development, advocating for a precautionary approach due to potential risks to health and the environment. Friends of the Earth called for a moratorium on commercializing products containing nanomaterials in 2006. The ETC Group has called for a moratorium on the commercial release of products containing nanomaterials until safety studies are completed and regulations are in place. They also urge for a halt in nanotechnology R&D and the use of products with man-made nanoparticles, emphasizing the need for a transparent global evaluation of the technology's implications. In 2003, the ETC Group proposed extending the moratorium on products with synthetic nanoparticles to those that directly contact consumers. However, a report by the NSET Subcommittee argued that conducting EHS research alongside nanomaterial development is crucial for safe nanotechnology advancement. Under Secretary of Commerce Phillip J. Bond disagreed with calls for a halt in nanotechnology R&D, emphasizing the ethical imperative to harness nanotechnology's potential for addressing societal challenges. The NRC and PCAST recommended prioritizing research on the effects of engineered nanomaterials on public health and the environment, with a focus on workplace exposure. Policymakers need to establish research priorities to manage the Federal EHS portfolio and harness nanotechnology's potential for addressing societal challenges. In 2005, PCAST prioritized research on workplace exposure to nanomaterials due to the highest likelihood of exposure during manufacture. In 2008, they reiterated this point and acknowledged broader risks, including environmental and safety risks in various settings. The NSET published a Federal Strategy for EHS Research Needs for Engineered Nanoscale Materials in February 2008, outlining research priorities and lead agencies for different categories. The NNI's EHS research strategy, with lead agencies for five research categories, aims to guide agency efforts in addressing prioritized research areas. The NRC independently reviewed the strategy in 2009, noting the need for clearer research objectives, measurement of success, and resource allocation. The NRC criticized the NSET's approach to nanotechnology-related EHS issues, stating that research needs were not clearly defined with measurable objectives, and federal funding may be insufficient. They recommended a national strategy involving various stakeholders to address research needs effectively. The NRC recommended a national strategy involving stakeholders beyond the federal government to address research needs effectively, with clear objectives, resources estimation, and specific milestones for federal EHS research coordination. The NNI officials argue for a coordinated approach to federal EHS research, with concerns raised by some Members of Congress about the time taken to develop an implementation plan. Opposition to an EHS roadmap is based on doubts about its practicality and efficacy, with some questioning OMB's commitment to a multi-year, multi-agency roadmap with specific funding levels. Some argue against a multi-year, multi-agency roadmap for EHS research, questioning OMB's commitment and agencies' ability to adapt to new priorities. Suggestions include having the National Academies produce the roadmap instead. In February 2007, various organizations and companies requested $1 million for a federal research roadmap on EHS uncertainties related to airborne particulate matter. The Senate Appropriations Committee report urged the EPA to collaborate with the National Academy of Sciences for this research. The Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008 directed the EPA to work with the National Academy of Sciences on a research roadmap for nanotechnology. The National Academies' Board on Environmental Science and Toxicology started a project in 2009 to develop reports on environmental, health, and safety aspects of engineered nanomaterials over four years. The first report, due in 18 months, will outline research priorities and resources needed, while the second report, due in July 2013, will evaluate research progress. The second report, due at the end of the study period (approximately July 2013), is to evaluate research progress, update research priorities, and estimate resources needed. The federal nanotechnology EHS research portfolio results from funding requests by individual agencies and decisions in the congressional appropriations process. PCAST recommended organizational changes to support cross-agency action on nanotechnology EHS issues. PCAST recommended organizational changes to support cross-agency action on nanotechnology EHS issues, including creating a senior-level position at NNCO for interagency coordination. In response, NNCO established a Deputy Director and EHS Coordinator role in 2010. Advocates like the Woodrow Wilson Center's Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies have called for a top-down approach to federal EHS research, emphasizing the need for a master plan, dedicated funding, and increased authorities for the NEHI working group. The Woodrow Wilson Center's Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies advocated for a top-down approach to federal EHS research, emphasizing the need for a master plan, dedicated funding, and increased authorities for the NEHI working group. However, the director of the NNCO argued against creating a centralized office with budgetary authority, stating that it would undermine successful interagency coordination and decouple nanotechnology EHS research from related efforts within NNI agencies. Creating a separate office for managing all nanotechnology EHS research could potentially hinder successful interagency coordination and lead to a decrease in research levels. While a centralized office may not be necessary, top-down leadership with authority is essential to ensure resources are allocated effectively. This leadership should empower agencies to work within a broader plan without taking away from their expertise and missions. According to Maynard, top-down leadership with authority is necessary to ensure resources are allocated effectively for nanotechnology research. Concerns have been raised about the regulatory system's ability to keep pace with technological advances, driven by market forces and global innovation. Speed-to-market has become a key factor in competition, challenging institutions to address societal implications of rapid change. Speed-to-market is a crucial factor in competition due to new competitors, increased R&D investments, global innovation models, and a growing number of scientists and engineers worldwide. This rapid pace of technological innovation may pose challenges to the regulatory system, especially in the field of nanotechnology, which has seen significant growth in investments since 2000. Nanomaterials' potential use in various products presents unique regulatory challenges, as traditional definitions based on chemical composition may not apply to nanotechnology. Nanotechnology presents unique challenges to the regulatory system as materials may exhibit different properties at the nanoscale. Questions are being raised about incorporating particle size into regulatory regimes and addressing EHS concerns. Some experts believe existing laws are sufficient, while others see legal obstacles to adequate EHS regulation. Some experts believe existing laws are sufficient for nanotechnology regulation, while others see legal obstacles. PCAST and Sean Murdock suggest using current regulatory mechanisms but increasing funding and coordination for EHS research. J. Clarence Davies suggests new laws or modifications may be necessary. Some experts believe existing laws are sufficient for nanotechnology regulation, while others see legal obstacles. J. Clarence Davies argues that new laws or modifications may be necessary due to the limitations of current regulations in addressing the complexities of nanotechnology. A new law may be necessary to manage potential risks of nanotechnology, as current regulations are inadequate. Manufacturers would need to submit a sustainability plan to ensure products do not pose unacceptable risks. Existing regulatory structures are ineffective in addressing the complexities of nanotechnology, and federal agencies responsible for environmental health and safety lack the capability to cope with new challenges. Clarence Davies suggests the creation of a Department of Environmental and Consumer Protection as a solution. Clarence Davies proposes the establishment of a Department of Environmental and Consumer Protection to address the challenges of nanotechnology. This agency would combine existing regulatory and science agencies, introducing new units for risk assessment, forecasting, technology assessment, health monitoring, and environmental statistics collection. The need for new mechanisms and institutional capabilities, such as research programs and regulatory incentives, is emphasized to promote beneficial applications of nanotechnology. Ambiguity in environmental, health, and safety regulations for nanoparticles is hindering commercialization efforts, with stability and predictability being crucial for attracting investment and driving commercial applications. The ambiguity surrounding environmental, health, and safety regulations for nanoparticles is hindering commercialization efforts. Firms are seeking a roadmap from federal agencies like the EPA and OSHA on how to approach nanoparticles. There is tension between promoting nanotechnology development, ensuring U.S. competitiveness, addressing potential EHS implications, and dealing with regulatory challenges. Some suggest health and safety research and regulation should keep pace with product development to prevent concerns from impeding innovation. Some argue that health and safety research and regulation should precede nanotechnology development to prevent potential harm. Concerns have been raised about the lack of mandatory workplace measures to assess exposures and ensure worker safety. The need for additional EHS data to inform risk-based guidelines and best practices has been acknowledged. The National Research Council and PCAST emphasized the importance of additional EHS data for risk-based guidelines and best practices in nanotechnology. Precautionary measures should be taken to protect workers, the public, and the environment until more information is available. Industry advocates argue that regulatory decisions should consider the overall risks and benefits of nanotechnology products, without holding them to a higher standard than non-nanotechnology products. Manufacturers and sellers have responsibilities for ensuring workplace and product safety, with the NNI playing a vital role in supporting federal regulatory agencies with EHS research results. The NNI has a crucial role in supporting federal regulatory agencies with EHS research results and promoting international engagement on EHS issues for responsible nanotechnology development. PCAST recommended coordinating efforts with other nations to avoid duplication and leverage investments, emphasizing non-competitive collaboration. Federal agencies have engaged internationally in various nanotechnology-related areas, including standards, nomenclature, and EHS research. The NSET established the Global Issues in Nanotechnology (GIN) working group. The NSET has engaged internationally in nanotechnology-related areas, including standards, nomenclature, and EHS research. The Global Issues in Nanotechnology (GIN) working group was established in 2005 to monitor foreign nanotechnology programs and promote U.S. commercial interests. International collaboration on R&D, including research on safeguarding the environment and human health, is a key focus. Transparent and common standards and regulations are seen as beneficial for global supply chains and market confidence in nanotechnology products. Manufacturers rely on multiple suppliers for final products, where the reliability of inputs is crucial. Transparent standards and regulations are essential to ensure supply chain integrity. Nanotechnology poses unique challenges as nanoscale particles can be difficult to detect in materials. Without proper standards, producers may face additional costs for testing, leading to potential market loss and litigation risks. Internationally agreed standards for nanotechnology can improve research comparability, enhance EHS understanding, and support regulations for human health and environmental protection. Common standards facilitate global R&D collaboration, accelerate economic potential, and promote access to global markets. Without such standards, nations may adopt lower environmental and safety regulations to attract investments. The transport and fate of nanoscale materials in the environment remain largely unknown. Efforts to promote best practices in nanotechnology research, production, use, disposal, and recycling globally may protect human health and the environment. International engagement in EHS research may face challenges such as time, cost, and alleged ineffectiveness. Some argue that the U.S.'s strong position in nanotechnology may hinder progress by diverting resources from other countries. Some argue that international engagement in nanotechnology EHS research may be unnecessary due to existing mechanisms for sharing information across borders. Concerns about other countries catching up to the U.S. in nanotechnology leadership have been raised. Advocates and critics agree that addressing environmental, health, and safety implications of nanotechnology is crucial for realizing its full benefits. However, there is a lack of knowledge on how nanoscale materials may impact humans and the environment, highlighting the need for more research in this area. Companies and countries may be hesitant to share EHS concerns and efforts due to competitive reasons and potential regulatory scrutiny. There is a consensus on the importance of addressing environmental, health, and safety implications of nanotechnology, but there is insufficient knowledge on how nanoscale materials may affect humans and the environment. Various legislation in the 111th Congress aimed to address EHS issues related to nanotechnology, but none were enacted. The 112th Congress may also consider addressing these issues, including the need for a national EHS research strategy. The 112th Congress may address nanotechnology EHS implications, including the need for a national EHS research strategy. Key questions include identifying institutions for the strategy, funding allocation, research prioritization, and sharing best practices. The federal EHS research investment and sharing of best practices in nanotechnology are key issues for Congress to address. Questions about voluntary programs, regulatory authority, coordination among agencies, common standards, and international engagement also need consideration. Congress' decisions will impact U.S. leadership in nanotechnology R&D and commercialization, societal benefits, public health and safety, environmental concerns, and global policy decisions. In nanotechnology R&D and commercialization, societal benefits, public health and safety, environmental concerns, and global policy decisions are key issues for Congress to address. Five bills in the 111th Congress aimed to address nanotechnology EHS concerns, with provisions outlined in H.R. 5116 and H.R. 554. H.R. 5116, the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2010, renamed the act and removed \"interdisciplinary\" from a provision on \"green nanotechnology\" research centers. H.R. 554, the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2009, was introduced in January 2009. The National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2009, H.R. 554, was introduced in the 111th Congress and aimed to address nanotechnology EHS concerns. The bill passed in the House and was referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. It directed the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office to maintain a public database of NNI EHS projects and required the establishment of a subpanel to assess societal, ethical, legal, environmental, and workforce concerns related to nanotechnology. The National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2009 aimed to address nanotechnology EHS concerns by establishing a subpanel to assess societal, ethical, legal, environmental, and workforce concerns related to nanotechnology. It also required the designation of an associate director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to serve as Coordinator for Societal Dimensions of Nanotechnology. The National Nanotechnology Amendments Act of 2009 aims to expand the scope of the National Nanotechnology Program by developing environmentally friendly nanoscale products and processes, supporting standards setting bodies, and including EHS education in nanotechnology programs. The bill aims to reauthorize the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, expand the National Nanotechnology Program, and promote rapid commercial development of nanoscale-enabled devices. It requires coordination of research on environmental, health, and safety risks, issuance of guidance for transitioning research into commercial products, and funding support from participating agencies. Additionally, it authorizes appropriations for the development of nanotechnology standards and the maintenance of a public information database on NNP projects. The bill authorizes appropriations for the development of nanotechnology standards and a public information database on NNP projects. It establishes the National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel (NNAP) and requires the coordination of societal, ethical, legal, and environmental concerns related to nanotechnology. Additionally, it directs the establishment of an interagency Education Working Group to coordinate educational activities on nanotechnology. The NSTC established an interagency Education Working Group to coordinate educational activities on nanotechnology. The NNP supports nanotechnology R&D in various national importance areas and in ethical, legal, and societal issues. S. 2942, the Nanotechnology Safety Act of 2010, requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a program for investigating nanoscale materials in FDA-regulated products. The Nanotechnology Advancement and New Opportunities Act, H.R. 820 (111th Congress), aims to address the potential toxicology of nanomaterials in FDA-regulated products. It authorizes $25 million per year for fiscal years 2011 to 2015 and requires the NNCO to produce an annual research strategy for nanotechnology development. Regulatory agencies are starting to address environmental, health, and safety issues related to nanotechnology. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is involved in regulating nanotechnology by conducting research on the potential environmental and health impacts of engineered nanoscale materials. EPA plays a key role in coordinating federal research efforts in this area. The EPA conducts research on the toxicology, fate, transport, and exposure of nanomaterials for risk assessment. It coordinates federal research on nanotechnology EHS issues and works with international organizations. EPA's regulatory authority over nanotechnology materials is governed by multiple statutes. Several issues have been raised about the application of EPA's authorities to regulate nanotechnology, particularly under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). TSCA requires producers of new materials to provide EPA with a premanufacture notification (PMN) for approval. Some argue that all nanoscale materials should be considered new, while others point out that some nanotechnology materials have the same composition as existing materials in commerce. Nanotechnology materials may be considered \"new\" under EPA regulations, even if they have the same composition as existing materials. FIFRA may provide more regulatory authority for nanotechnology products than TSCA, as it is use-specific and allows EPA to assess risks for pesticides. A 2006 EPA ruling classified a device with nanoscale silver ions as a pesticide under FIFRA, highlighting the applicability of FIFRA to nanotechnology products. The EPA's ruling on nanotechnology products under FIFRA requires registration for products that kill microbes. The first nanotechnology product regulated under FIFRA was a washing machine with nanoscale silver ions. However, claims of pesticidal effectiveness have been removed from advertisements, potentially limiting EPA's regulation. The U.S. Government Accountability Office found in 2010 that EPA was missing opportunities to collect information under various environmental statutes. The FDA regulates a variety of current and future nanotechnology products, including cosmetics, medical devices, foods, drugs, and combination products. The FDA regulates various nanotechnology products under different categories such as cosmetics, medical devices, foods, drugs, biological products, and combination products. The agency may not provide regulatory consideration to a nanotechnology product until well after its initial development, and its existing requirements may be adequate for most nanotechnology products. FDA asserts that nanotechnology products are in the same size-range as cells and molecules, and every degradable medical device and injectable pharmaceutical generates particulates that pass through the nanoscale size range. FDA asserts that nanotechnology products are in the same size-range as cells and molecules, with no reports of adverse reactions related to their \"nano\" size. New tests may be necessary for emerging risks from new materials or manufacturing techniques. Consumer groups argue that FDA's resources are insufficient to address the safety of emerging technologies, particularly for products like cosmetics and dietary supplements. FDA conducts research on nanomaterials and processes but does not provide grants for nanotechnology research. The FDA conducts research on nanomaterials and processes but does not provide grants for nanotechnology research. They collaborate with NIEHS on studies related to nanotechnology. NIEHS, part of the National Institutes of Health, conducts nanotechnology EHS research to support regulatory agencies. There is currently no international regulation of nanoproducts or nanotechnology. FDA participates in multinational organizations for cooperative work on nanotechnology. The NIEHS, part of the National Institutes of Health, conducts research on nanoscale materials to evaluate their toxicological properties and potential health hazards. The Nanotechnology Safety Initiative (NSI) was established in 2006 to address these concerns and focuses on three areas of research: non-medical, commercially relevant, and available nanoscale materials. The Nanotechnology Safety Initiative (NSI) research focuses on specific types of nanoscale materials like metal oxides, quantum dots, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, nanoscale silver, and gold. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) ensures worker safety by setting and enforcing standards. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) are key agencies ensuring worker safety in relation to nanotechnology. NIOSH conducts research and provides guidance on occupational safety implications, while OSHA focuses on setting and enforcing standards. Both agencies are exploring new risk management approaches to promote innovation while safeguarding worker health and safety. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is focused on maximizing flexibility for innovation while ensuring worker health and safety in nanotechnology. NIOSH has developed guidelines for working with nanomaterials and maintains a Nanoparticle Information Library. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is responsible for protecting the public from risks of injury or death from consumer products, including assessing safety and health risks of nanomaterials under existing regulations. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is responsible for assessing safety and health risks of nanomaterials under existing regulations. CPSC does not evaluate a product's risk until it has been distributed in commerce. Regulatory challenges include identifying specific nanomaterials in products and assessing health risks based on toxicological data. The CPSC does not make general statements about consumer exposure to nanomaterials or health effects due to the wide variation in potential health effects and lack of data for specific nanomaterials."
