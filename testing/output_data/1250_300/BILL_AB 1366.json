    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to increase enrollment and graduation rates for undocumented students by establishing Dream Resource Centers at public higher education institutions. Approximately 65,000 undocumented students graduate from high schools annually, but only 20 percent attend college. Many are unaware of laws like Assembly Bill 540, the California Dream Act, and DACA that support their education. Currently, most college campuses lack centralized support services for these students. The creation of Dream Resource Centers at public higher education institutions aims to streamline financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting Assembly Bill 540 requirements. These centers empower and support undocumented students, increasing enrollment, transfer, and graduation rates. Various college campuses, including UCLA, UC Davis, CSULA, CSUF, and CSUN, have established Dream Resource Centers offering workshops, legal clinics, and peer mentoring to enhance awareness of available resources and employment opportunities. Chapter 3.67 is added to the Education Code, encouraging campuses to designate a Dream Resource Liaison to assist students meeting specific requirements by providing access to financial aid and academic opportunities. California Community Colleges and State Universities are encouraged to have knowledgeable staff designated as Dream Resource Liaisons to support students, including undocumented individuals, in accessing available resources. Each campus of the California State University and the University of California is encouraged to designate a Dream Resource Liaison knowledgeable in financial aid and academic opportunities for students meeting specific requirements, including undocumented students. Dream Resource Centers may offer various support services without requiring new construction, and may be housed within existing student service or academic centers. The section allows Dream Resource Centers to be housed within existing student service or academic centers, and the space where the Dream Resource Liaison is located can be considered a Dream Resource Center. The Trustees of the California State University, the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, and the Regents of the University of California are permitted to seek and accept gifts to aid in the creation and operation of Dream Resource Centers. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act imposes costs on the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts will be made."
