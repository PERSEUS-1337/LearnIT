    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United Nations Accountability Act of 2004\". Congress finds allegations of mismanagement, fraud, and corruption in the United Nations Oil-for-Food program, as identified in audits by the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services. The audits revealed inadequate management of contracts, including failure to adhere to provisions, maintain staffing levels, overcharge the United Nations, and engage in unprofessional conduct. The OIOS audit found that the contractor failed to maintain required staffing levels, overcharged the United Nations, and engaged in unprofessional conduct. The United Nations Office of Iraq Programs was criticized for not managing contracts effectively and lacking oversight. The United Nations has refused to release OIOS audit reports to member states, including the United States regarding the Oil-for-Food Program. The United Nations has denied the United States access to OIOS audits of the Oil-for-Food Program, undermining member states' ability to fulfill their responsibilities due to the nondisclosure policy of the United Nations. The United States urges the United Nations to provide member states with OIOS audit reports without modification, except to protect privacy rights. The Department of State must report on the adequacy of financial disclosure rules for UN officials within 180 days. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to the Oil-for-food program and the Office of Internal Oversight Services established by the United Nations. The appropriate congressional committees are also specified. The curr_chunk defines the \"appropriate congressional committees\" as specific committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate."
