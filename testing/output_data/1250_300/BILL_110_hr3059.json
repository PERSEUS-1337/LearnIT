    "content": "Increased average fuel economy standards. Increased average fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles to a minimum of 27.5 miles per gallon starting from model year 2022. Regulations for passenger automobiles' fuel economy standards must be set 18 months before each model year. The Secretary shall prescribe average fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, ensuring a minimum of 35 miles per gallon for model year 2022 and subsequent years. Different standards may apply based on vehicle attributes related to fuel economy. The alternative minimum standard for domestically manufactured passenger automobiles shall be the greater of 27.5 miles per gallon or 92 percent of the average fuel economy projected by the Secretary for all manufacturers in a model year. The alternative minimum standard for domestically manufactured passenger automobiles is determined based on the average fuel economy projected by the Secretary for all manufacturers in a model year. This standard applies if the manufacturer's average fuel economy standard for passenger automobiles would allow compliance with a less stringent standard. Additionally, a transition period is provided for manufacturers to choose between complying with attribute-based standards or a single corporate average fuel economy level. The amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, with a transition period for passenger automobiles to comply with attribute-based standards or a single corporate average fuel economy level. The amendments to Chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code include defining 'non-passenger automobile' and making technical changes to subsections (g), (h), and (j) of section 32902. The amendments to Chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code involve technical changes to subsections (g), (h), and (j) of section 32902, including redefining 'non-passenger automobiles' and updating references in section 32903. Credit transferring within a manufacturer's fleet is addressed in Section 2. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a credit transferring program for manufacturers to transfer fuel economy credits within their fleet to non-compliant categories. Transferred credits can be used in the same model years they were earned, with a maximum increase of 1.0 mile per gallon. Transfers to certain categories are limited based on the manufacturer's fleet fuel economy level. The credit transferring program allows manufacturers to transfer fuel economy credits within their fleet to non-compliant categories. Transfers are limited based on the manufacturer's fleet fuel economy level and can only be done with credits earned in model year 2010 or later. The fleet includes all automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer in a specific model year, and compliance categories of automobiles are defined as passenger automobiles manufactured domestically or not domestically. The credit transferring program allows manufacturers to transfer fuel economy credits within their fleet to non-compliant categories, limited based on the manufacturer's fleet fuel economy level. Compliance categories include passenger automobiles manufactured domestically, not domestically, and non-passenger automobiles. The Secretary of Transportation will partner with industry groups to create a public education campaign on fuel conservation for drivers. The campaign will use various methods to reach a wide audience and the Secretary will provide up to 50% of the campaign's cost, with the option to accept private funds. Appropriations will be made as needed for this program."
