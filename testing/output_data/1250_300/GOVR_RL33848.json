    "content": "United Nations reform is a key policy issue for the United States, with Congress responsible for appropriating funds and imposing conditions on payments. Reform efforts have been cyclical, focusing on inefficiencies, duplication, and fraud within the U.N. system. Proposed U.N. reforms have addressed inefficiencies, duplication, fraud, and mismanagement of resources. Reforms have evolved over time to reflect political, economic, and cultural climates, with a focus on increasing membership, addressing economic cooperation, and tackling financial and structural issues. Since the early 2000s, reform efforts have been driven by budgetary challenges and controversies over mismanagement. Since the early 2000s, U.N. reform efforts have been driven by budgetary challenges, mismanagement controversies, and structural issues. Various key actors have been involved in setting reform priorities, including Members of Congress, the Obama Administration, selected member states, the U.N. Secretary-General, and groups tasked with U.N. reform. The 2005 World Summit Outcome Document laid the foundation for reforms aimed at improving U.N. activities. In 2005, U.N. reform efforts gained momentum at a World Summit in New York, leading to reforms in U.N. management structures, Security Council, U.N. system coordination, and a new Human Rights Council. Member states have been working on implementing these reforms with varying results. The success of these efforts depends on effective management and follow-through by the United Nations and its member countries. Congress generally supports the U.N. and its mission by authorizing and appropriating U.S. funds. Congress supports the United Nations and its mission by authorizing and appropriating U.S. funds. However, it can also be critical of the organization and use legislative tools to influence U.N. policy, such as placing financial conditions on U.S. funding. This has been done in the past to influence U.N. programs and policies. Congress has used its authority to limit U.S. funds to the United Nations in the past to influence U.N. policy. This includes withholding funds from programs like the U.N. Special Unit on Palestinian Rights and UNESCO due to decisions made by member states. The impact of withholding funds depends on the program's funding source. The impact of withholding U.S. funds from U.N. programs depends on the funding source. If funded by the U.N. regular budget, withholding may not have an immediate impact. However, if funded primarily by member state contributions, the impact could be greater. Congress may also enact legislation to adjust U.S. assessment levels or link payments to favored policies. Congress has the option to adjust U.S. assessment levels or link payments to favored policies, such as capping U.S. payments of peacekeeping assessments at 25%. Some Members of Congress have proposed shifting U.S. funding from assessed to voluntary contributions, but opponents argue that this may weaken U.S. influence at the United Nations and infringe on treaty obligations. Some argue that withholding U.S. assessed payments to the United Nations could hinder diplomacy and foreign policy decisions, infringe on treaty obligations, and strain relations with other member states. Supporters of linking U.S. funding to specific reforms believe it could push for comprehensive reform within the U.N., as past reforms have been slow and ineffective. They argue that tying funding to reform may encourage countries to find common ground on divisive issues. Advocates believe tying U.S. funding to U.N. reform can drive substantive changes. Past legislation threatening funding cuts led to effective reforms. Congress's influence over funding is a powerful tool for U.S. reform policy. Other strategies include proposing resolutions and working with the U.N. Secretary-General. Some Members of Congress have used resolutions to express opinions on U.S. policy in the United Nations. Working with the U.N. Secretary-General can help advocate positions and bridge disagreements among member states. U.S. citizens in key U.N. reform-related posts may further U.S. reform policy interests. Building consensus and partnerships with other U.N. member states is important for reform policies, but U.S. support may be viewed as self-serving by some. The United States may need to focus on a few key reform priorities and work with like-minded countries to advocate its agenda. U.N. reform is an ongoing process, and the 114th Congress should continue monitoring and supporting reform initiatives. The U.S. generally supports the mission of the United Nations and has played a significant role in its establishment. The United States generally supports the mission and mandate of the United Nations, playing a key role in its establishment. The current Administration has focused on re-engaging with the UN, emphasizing budget discipline and transparency in reform priorities. The Administration has highlighted priority areas including enforcing budget discipline, improving transparency and accountability, reforming human resources practices, and overhauling business practices within the UN system. The Obama Administration has also implemented initiatives to evaluate and improve UN system transparency and effectiveness. The Obama Administration has implemented initiatives to evaluate and improve U.N. system transparency and effectiveness, including supporting the U.N. Transparency and Accountability Initiative and hiring an advisor on effectiveness. They have resisted legislation tying U.S. contributions to specific U.N. reforms to avoid interfering with diplomatic efforts. In a 2011 statement, then-U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations Susan Rice emphasized the importance of paying U.N. dues for U.S. credibility and influence. The George W. Bush Administration actively participated in U.N. reform efforts, focusing on management, budget, oversight, and accountability reforms. Despite some initiatives not being approved, the Administration worked with like-minded countries and the U.N. Secretary-General to push forward a reform agenda. The Administration expressed dissatisfaction with the pace and effectiveness of U.N. reforms. Finding common ground on reform definitions among stakeholders is a significant challenge. Ban Ki-moon succeeded Kofi Annan as U.N. Secretary-General in 2006 and emphasized U.N. reform during his tenure. Ban Ki-moon succeeded Kofi Annan as U.N. Secretary-General in 2006 and has prioritized U.N. reform during his tenure. He has focused on improving delivery on the ground, maximizing existing resources, and increasing accountability. Ban has implemented various reform efforts, including restructuring departments and proposing staff mobility improvements. However, the extent and effectiveness of his reforms are still uncertain, with some critics arguing for more comprehensive changes. Ban Ki-moon's efforts to reform the United Nations have been met with challenges from member states, who hold the primary power to implement comprehensive changes. Developing countries, represented by the Group of 77, have expressed concerns that reform initiatives led by the Secretary-General may undermine their authority. Developed countries, major contributors to the U.N. budget, have also been involved in reform debates, highlighting fundamental differences in perspectives on reform within the organization. Developed countries, major contributors to the U.N. budget, focus on maintaining international peace and security, efficiency, and oversight reforms. They want the Secretary-General to have more authority for effective fund utilization. Developing countries, the largest U.N. voting bloc, prioritize development policies and oppose reforms that enhance the Secretary-General's power over the General Assembly. Reforms proposed by the Secretary-General aim to increase their power and reduce the General Assembly's influence, causing deadlock and delays in implementing management and budget reforms. Developed countries, led by the United States and Japan, linked U.N. budget to progress on reforms, placing a spending cap of $950 million on a $3.6 billion budget in 2006. The General Assembly imposed a spending cap of $950 million on the $3.6 billion budget in 2006, hoping for management and budget reform. The Fifth Committee voted on a resolution supported by the G-77, approving some reforms but delaying others. Developed nations lifted the budget cap in June 2006 to avoid a shutdown of the United Nations. Various groups have been created over the years to improve the UN, with stakeholders including past secretaries-general, member states, NGOs, and academic institutions. Various groups, including the Volcker Commission, the U.S. Institute of Peace U.N. Reform Task Force, and then-Secretary-General Kofi Annan's 2005 report, have made similar recommendations for improving the United Nations. They highlighted the need for enhanced internal oversight, Secretariat reform, staff buyouts, financial disclosure requirements, and overall streamlining of the U.N. system. In 2004, an independent high-level commission led by Paul Volcker was appointed to investigate corruption in the U.N.-led Iraq Oil-for-Food Program. In April 2004, an independent high-level commission led by Paul Volcker was appointed to investigate corruption in the U.N.-led Iraq Oil-for-Food Program. The commission recommended fundamental administrative reform in the United Nations, including the establishment of an Independent Oversight Board, a Chief Operating Officer position, fair compensation for third parties, and expanded financial disclosure requirements. Congress later directed the U.S. Institute of Peace to create a bipartisan task force to examine ways to improve the United Nations. In December 2004, Congress directed the U.S. Institute of Peace to create a bipartisan task force to improve the United Nations. The task force recommended creating an independent oversight board, a Chief Operating Officer position, a U.N. Ethics Office, and enhancing whistle-blower protection. It also suggested broadening the U.N. staff financial disclosure policy and incorporating results-based budgeting. The task force recommended incorporating sunset clauses into U.N. mandates, implementing results-based budgeting, and offering a one-time buyout for unnecessary staff. It also proposed creating a new U.N. Human Rights Council to replace the Commission on Human Rights. The report by Secretary-General Annan suggested various management reforms, including reviewing old mandates, staff buyouts, establishing a decision-making body, and enhancing oversight services. Secretary-General Annan proposed various institutional and programmatic reforms, such as modifying the U.N. Security Council composition and replacing the Commission on Human Rights with a new Human Rights Council. He also recommended streamlining the General Assembly agenda and committee structure for faster decision-making. U.N. reform initiatives may involve Charter amendments or non-Charter reforms, with the latter being more common and easier to achieve. The U.N. Charter can be amended for reforms, with rare occurrences of Charter amendments and more common non-Charter reforms. Articles 108 and 109 outline the process for Charter amendments, requiring approval by two-thirds of the General Assembly and ratification by two-thirds of member states. Possible reforms include changing Security Council membership and increasing ECOSOC membership. The Charter was last amended in 1973 to increase ECOSOC membership. The U.N. Charter allows for amendments to increase Security Council and ECOSOC membership, and convene a General Conference for Charter review. Revisions require a two-thirds vote at the conference and ratification by two-thirds of member states. The General Assembly has implemented reforms without Charter amendment through various fora and committees. The General Assembly has implemented reforms through various fora and committees, including the establishment of consensus-based budgeting in 1986 and the creation of an Office of Strategic Planning in 1997. Secretary-General Ban restructured departments and established a Change Management Team for future reform efforts. The Peacebuilding Commission was established in 2006. Achieving comprehensive U.N. reform remains a significant challenge for member states. Achieving meaningful and comprehensive U.N. reform is a significant challenge for member states. Each state has its own political agenda and may view reform differently, leading to differing opinions on when and how to implement reform. Some states use U.N. reform to advance their own policy goals, causing distrust among members. The inability to prioritize reform initiatives is seen as an obstacle to U.N. reform. Some observers believe that the inability to effectively prioritize reform initiatives is hindering U.N. reform efforts. Suggestions include selecting a few key reform priorities for adoption and implementation, rather than a large series of proposals. There is a culture of inaction within the United Nations, with resistance to implementing new programs and changes to existing ones. The complex and decentralized nature of the organization may slow down the consideration and implementation of reforms. Some argue that a \"culture of inaction\" within the United Nations hinders reform efforts. Managers and staff resist new programs and changes, lacking clear implementation plans. The current budget may limit effective reform implementation, with some initiatives struggling to operate within existing resources. Many argue that the existing U.N. budget limits may not support all reform initiatives. Some member states believe money saved from other reforms could fund further reforms or new U.N. programs. Complex relationships among member states outside the U.N. system can also impact reform efforts. Military conflict, religious differences, and geography can affect cooperation among U.N. member states. Congress may need to explore past legislative approaches' effectiveness in influencing U.N. reform adoption. Legislation such as the Kassebaum-Solomon Amendment and the Helms-Biden Agreement may have influenced past U.N. reform measures. The Kassebaum-Solomon Amendment in 1986 required the U.S. assessed contribution to the U.N. budget to be reduced to 20% unless major financial contributors had a greater say in the budget process. This led to the adoption of a new budget and planning process by the General Assembly. In 1986, the General Assembly adopted a new budget process incorporating consensus-based decision-making to give major financial contributors more influence. In 1993, concerns about oversight led to the establishment of the U.N. Office of Internal Oversight Services, following U.S. legislation withholding 10% of assessed contributions until certain criteria were met. The U.N. General Assembly established the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) in 1994 to provide internal auditing, investigation, and consulting services. The Helms-Biden Agreement in 1999 authorized payment of U.S. arrears to the U.N. if specific reform benchmarks were met, including reducing U.S. contributions to the U.N. regular budget and peacekeeping costs. The U.S. paid $107 million towards peacekeeping arrears after Congress required reductions in U.S. contributions to the U.N. regular budget and peacekeeping costs. The U.N. General Assembly lowered the regular budget assessment from 25% to 22% and peacekeeping share from 30.4% to 28%. Currently, the U.S. peacekeeping assessment is around 26.5%."
