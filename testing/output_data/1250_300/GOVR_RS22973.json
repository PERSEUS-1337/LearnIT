Congress has consistently criticized North Korea's human rights record, passing the North Korean Human Rights Act in 2004 and reauthorizing it in 2008. The Obama Administration's approach to addressing human rights in North Korea remains unclear. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 and its reauthorization in 2008 are key legislative actions addressing human rights in North Korea. The legislation criticizes the Bush Administration's approach and emphasizes human rights as a priority in U.S. policy towards North Korea. The issue is complicated by geopolitical sensitivities in East Asia, with China and South Korea cautious of U.S. involvement in human rights issues. The concern is to prevent a massive outflow of refugees that could destabilize North Korea. The U.S. executive branch officials are concerned about criticism of Seoul and Beijing's approach to North Korea's human rights violations disrupting multilateral negotiations. North Korean refugees transit through other Asian countries, raising diplomatic, refugee, and security concerns. The Bush Administration criticized Pyongyang's human rights practices publicly but did not propose negotiations on human rights during the Six-Party talks in 2007. The Six-Party Agreement called for bilateral talks between the U.S. and North Korea to resolve issues after the nuclear problem is settled. The Six-Party Agreement of February 13, 2007, aims to resolve bilateral issues between the United States and North Korea after addressing the nuclear problem. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 authorized funding for assistance to North Korean refugees and promoting human rights and democracy in North Korea. Former Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill focused on the nuclear issue after the agreement was signed in 2007. The North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 allocated funds for assisting North Korean refugees, promoting human rights and democracy in North Korea, and supporting freedom of information. It also called for the appointment of a Special Envoy to advocate for human rights in North Korea, emphasized the importance of human rights in negotiations with North Korea, and required improved monitoring of humanitarian aid distribution. Additionally, it urged enhanced support for radio broadcasting into North Korea and demanded China to grant UNHCR access to North Koreans in China. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) emphasizes the importance of human rights in U.S. policy towards North Korea. Advocates believe it will help address humanitarian crises and promote stability in Northeast Asia. Critics argue it may strain relations with South Korea and China, hindering diplomatic efforts to address North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Despite raising awareness of human rights issues, some activities were already authorized. The NKHRA raised congressional interest in North Korean human rights and refugee issues, with existing programs in place for awareness and assistance. Activities like Korean-language broadcasting were enhanced, and reports outlined steps taken to promote human rights in North Korea. The State Department has not requested funding explicitly under the NKHRA, fulfilling its mission through existing programs. The State Department has not requested funding explicitly under the NKHRA, but asserts that its mission is fulfilled through existing programs. The Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Bureau provides grants for democracy promotion in North Korea, including $1 million for human rights programs and $1 million for media freedom programs in FY2008. The NKHRA has had the most impact on refugee admissions, with 71 North Korean refugees accepted for resettlement by January 2009. The U.S. government has also sponsored UN resolutions condemning North Korea's human rights abuses. The United States accepted 71 North Korean refugees for resettlement by January 2009. The State Department's PRM Bureau provides funds for UNHCR's regional budget for East Asia, including assistance for North Korean refugees. The NKHRA calls for increased Korean-language broadcasts by RFA and VOA to North Korea. The BBG currently broadcasts ten hours per day to North Korea. The BBG increased broadcasts to North Korea in 2006, adding original programming in 2007. Currently, RFA broadcasts 3.5 hours of original programming and 1.5 hours of repeat programming, while VOA broadcasts 4 hours of original and 1 hour of repeat programming daily. The budget request for FY2008 was $8.1 million to implement a 10-hour broadcast schedule, with $8.5 million requested for FY2009 to maintain it. Content includes news briefs, interviews with defectors, and international commentary. The BBG aims to expand medium wave broadcast capability into North Korea. VOA broadcasts from stations in Tinian, Thailand, and the Philippines, as well as leased stations in Russia and Mongolia, while RFA broadcasts from stations in Tinian and Saipan, and leased stations in Russia and Mongolia. The reauthorization bill renews funding for VOA and RFA broadcasts to North Korea, criticizes the slow processing of North Korean refugees, and requires reporting on efforts to process refugees and achieve 12 hours of Korean language programming. Funding is reauthorized through 2012 at original levels to support human rights, promote freedom of information, and assist North Korean refugees. The reauthorization bill emphasizes the need for U.S. efforts to process North Korean refugees and achieve 12 hours of Korean language programming. The role of the Special Envoy for Human Rights in North Korea has drawn attention from Congress, with a focus on making the position full-time and involving the envoy in policy planning for North Korean refugee issues. The Obama Administration has yet to select a Special Envoy. The reauthorization bill includes provisions for the Special Envoy for Human Rights in North Korea to participate in policy planning and implementation on North Korean refugee issues. The previous Special Envoy, Lefkowitz, had a varied public profile, attending international conferences and testifying at congressional hearings. He raised concerns about labor practices at the Kaesong complex and criticized denuclearization talks in a speech in 2008. In January 2008, Jay Lefkowitz criticized denuclearization talks and doubted North Korea's willingness to give up nuclear weapons. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice dismissed his comments. In his final report in January 2009, Lefkowitz criticized U.S. handling of refugee admissions and the North Korean policies of South Korea, China, and Japan. Some believe implementing refugee provisions could be counterproductive, as it may encourage dangerous incursions into U.S. diplomatic missions. State Department officials warn of potential injury or death for refugees storming U.S. facilities abroad. State Department officials caution that granting asylum to North Korean refugees involves a complex vetting process due to lack of official relations with the US. Close coordination with South Korea is necessary for effective implementation of the NKHRA. Funding for refugee assistance is problematic as refugees often hide from authorities, leading to discreet labeling of funds under general assistance programs. South Korea is the primary destination for North Korean refugees, with over 14,000 defectors resettling there since the Korean War. The South Korean government provides citizenship, resettlement programs, cash, and training for defectors. The process is faster and more streamlined compared to the U.S. South Korea refrained from criticizing North Korea's human rights record until recently to foster better ties. South Korea's approach to North Korea shifted under President Lee Myung-bak in 2007, tying assistance to denuclearization progress and openly criticizing North Korea's human rights record. This new stance led to a chill in North-South relations, with South Korea voting for UN resolutions on North Korea's human rights and conditioning aid on improved distribution systems. President Bush and President Lee urged progress on North Korea's human rights in a joint statement in August 2008. South Korea's shift under President Lee Myung-bak tied assistance to denuclearization progress and criticized North Korea's human rights record, leading to a chill in relations. A joint statement from President Bush and President Lee in August 2008 urged progress on North Korea's human rights."
