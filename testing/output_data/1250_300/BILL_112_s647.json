    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Montana Mineral Conveyance Act\". Congress finds that the Secretary of the Interior conveyed mineral rights in coal tracts near the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation to the State of Montana. Development of these tracts and other energy resources yield substantial public revenues to the State, but the Northern Cheyenne tribal community does not benefit from these revenues despite facing economic hardships and deficits in public services. The Northern Cheyenne tribal community faces economic hardships and lacks revenue sources to address development impacts. In 2002, the Tribe sued the Secretary over proposed conveyances of Federal coal tracts to the State, citing violations of Federal laws and trust responsibilities. The Tribe later withdrew the suit based on commitments for legislation similar to the Act. The Tribe withdrew a lawsuit with prejudice based on commitments for legislation similar to the Act. They retain claims against the United States for failing to acquire mineral rights on Reservation land. If mineral rights conveyances are carried out under this Act, the Tribe will waive all legal claims against the United States. The Act states that mineral rights on Reservation land owned by Great Northern Properties will be conveyed. The Tribe will waive legal claims against the United States related to the loss of mineral rights if conveyances are made under this Act. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Cheyenne tracts\" refers to a 5,000-acre land located in the eastern portion of the State within the boundaries of the Reservation, as depicted on a specific map dated April 7, 2010. The \"Federal tracts\" are unleased land outside the Reservation, totaling 5,000 acres in specific sections as outlined on a map. The \"Great Northern Properties\" refer to a Delaware limited partnership and any successor with ownership interest in coal or iron. The properties are located in specific sections outlined on a map outside the Reservation. The Great Northern Properties Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, and any successor with ownership interest in coal or iron under the Cheyenne tracts are defined. The terms Reservation, Secretary, State, and Tribe are also defined as the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, Secretary of the Interior, State of Montana, and Northern Cheyenne Tribe, respectively. SEC. 4. MINERAL RIGHTS CONVEYANCES.\n\nGreat Northern Properties will convey mineral interests to the Tribe, and in return, the Secretary will convey coal rights to Great Northern Properties. The mineral interests conveyed to the Tribe will be exempt from State taxation.\n\nSEC. 5. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF MINERAL CONVEYANCES. The Tribe waives legal claims in exchange for mineral conveyances. The Tribe and Great Northern Properties must agree on revenue sharing for coal production. Mineral conveyances must be completed within 90 days after notification. Rescission of conveyances is possible under certain circumstances. If a Federal district court invalidates any part of mineral conveyances under section 4(a) and the judgment is not overturned on appeal, the Secretary or Great Northern Properties can rescind all mineral conveyances. This would result in the Tribe's waiver under subsection (a) being rescinded as well. SEC. 6. ELIGIBILITY FOR OTHER FEDERAL BENEFITS.\n\nNo benefits provided to the Tribe under this Act shall affect their eligibility for Federal services or programs due to their status as a federally recognized Indian tribe or as members of the Tribe.\n\nSEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nAppropriations are authorized as necessary to implement this Act."
