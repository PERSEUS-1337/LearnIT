Amendments to Title 18 include the arrest of a material witness if there is probable cause to believe their testimony is material and they have failed to appear after being served with a summons or subpoena. A judicial officer may waive the summons requirement if there is clear and convincing evidence that the person is likely to flee. A warrant for a material witness issued under subsection (a) must contain the witness's name or a description for identification, specify the need for their testimony in a criminal case or grand jury proceeding, command their arrest, and inform them of their right to counsel.

Upon arrest, the officer must show the warrant to the material witness. If the officer does not have the warrant at the time of arrest, they must inform the witness of its existence and purpose.
