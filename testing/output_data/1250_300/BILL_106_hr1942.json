The Congress finds that free trade agreements benefit citizens by improving income and prosperity, APEC aims for free and open trade by 2020, economic growth in the Pacific Rim is crucial for the US, and the Asian financial crisis is a concern. The strategic and economic interests of the United States in the Pacific Rim region are impacted by the financial crisis in Asia, leading to a disruption in export growth.

Building closer ties with friendly countries will benefit trade negotiations in the Asia-Pacific region.
