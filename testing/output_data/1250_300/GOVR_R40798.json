    "content": "The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of persons in the civilian labor force age 16 and older who are unemployed. It is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by the total number of employed and unemployed individuals in the labor force. The unemployment rate can fluctuate based on changes in both the number of unemployed workers and the size of the labor force. During a recession, the labor force may decrease as discouraged workers stop looking for jobs, while it may increase if more people start actively seeking employment. During a recession, the size of the labor force may decrease as discouraged workers stop searching for jobs, leading to a rise in the unemployment rate. This rate is considered a lagging economic indicator, improving only after other indicators signal recovery. Firms are hesitant to hire new workers until they are confident in sustained economic growth, often opting to increase production through existing employees and overtime. During a recession, firms may boost production by having current employees work overtime instead of hiring new workers. Job growth may not immediately follow signs of economic recovery. The Current Employment Statistics program is a key source for job data, providing information from nonfarm employers. The Business Cycle Dating Committee uses changes in national output and employment trends to determine recession periods. The U.S. economy has experienced 10 recessions since World War II, excluding the most recent one from December 2007 to June 2009. The U.S. economy has had 10 recessions since World War II, with varying severity in GDP decline and duration. Unemployment rates continued to rise during and after each recession, peaking at different points. In some cases, the rate peaked at the end of the recession, while in others, it continued to rise for a few months into the economic recovery. After the 10 recessions since World War II, unemployment rates continued to rise during and after each recession, peaking at different points. The unemployment rate kept rising for months after the end of several recessions, with sustained job growth failing to ensue until after the end of all 10 recessions. In only one instance did the employment level immediately begin trending upward, while in the other cases, the number of jobs on employer payrolls fluctuated for months after the recession's end. Sustained job growth occurred within three to five months of the start of seven recoveries, but in some cases, steady job growth did not commence until well after the recession ended. After the 10 recessions since World War II, unemployment rates continued to rise during and after each recession, peaking at different points. Job growth was delayed after the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions, leading to jobless recoveries. While private sector employment started to rise in January 2010, fiscal issues in local governments slowed overall job growth."
