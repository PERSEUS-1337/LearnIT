Any group of Indians in specific counties in North Carolina not enrolled in the Lumbee Tribe may petition for acknowledgment of tribal existence. The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and its members are eligible for services and benefits provided to federally recognized Indian tribes. Members residing in specific counties are considered to be on or near a reservation. The Secretary of the Interior and Health and Human Services will determine needs and budget for services in consultation with the tribe. The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina is eligible for federal services based on their tribal roll, which defines their service population.
