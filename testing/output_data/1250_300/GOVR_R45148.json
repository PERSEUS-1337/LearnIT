    "content": "Economics is the study of efficient resource use and trade for mutual enrichment. Countries benefit from trade by producing efficiently and trading for goods produced less efficiently, leading to higher consumption levels. Imports in the United States are driven by factors like cost efficiency and global value chains, allowing consumers access to a variety of goods at lower costs. Trade allows consumers to access a variety of goods at lower costs, improving purchasing power, especially for lower-income households. It also benefits producers by providing lower-cost inputs and overseas markets for exports, leading to increased competitiveness and opportunities for economies of scale. Trade promotes innovation, investment in research and development, and supports economic growth through increased productivity. The concept of comparative advantage, introduced by economist David Ricardo in the 19th century, remains relevant in explaining how countries trade today. Economist David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage explains how countries benefit from specialization and trade, even if one country is more efficient in producing all goods. By focusing on opportunity costs rather than absolute production costs, countries can identify their comparative advantage and trade for mutual benefit. Ricardo's insights support increased productivity and economic growth through specialization in goods where each country has a comparative advantage. Economists have expanded on Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage, examining how it applies to complex trade patterns in the 21st century. Differences in comparative advantage between countries can be attributed to factors like labor, capital, human capital, and technology. Countries specialize in activities where they have a comparative advantage to maximize productivity and economic growth. The theory of comparative advantage states that countries specialize in activities that make intensive use of their abundant factors of production, such as labor, capital, human capital, and technology. This specialization maximizes productivity and economic growth. Governments can influence comparative advantage through policies that nurture it indirectly or directly. Governments can influence comparative advantage through policies that either indirectly nurture it (e.g. eliminating corruption, enforcing property rights, liberalizing trade barriers) or directly nurture advantages in specific industries (e.g. subsidies, tariffs). There is debate on the effectiveness of targeted policies, with some economists warning that protectionist measures can distort trade flows and reduce economic efficiency. Some economists argue that protectionist policies can distort trade flows and reduce economic efficiency. Intra-industry trade is common among advanced economies with similar resource endowments. Economies of scale play a role in trade patterns, leading to specialization among countries. Trade is a key driver of changes in employment, wages, income distribution, and standard of living. It has a net positive effect on economic well-being by promoting resource efficiency, competition, economies of scale, and consumer welfare. Increased trade can boost GDP and reduce poverty globally. However, the benefits of trade are not evenly distributed within an economy and can disrupt certain sectors. According to the World Bank, global trade and investment liberalization have significantly reduced extreme poverty over the past 25 years. However, the benefits of trade are not evenly distributed, leading to job losses and stagnant wages in certain regions and industries. Economists debate the economic impact of trade on jobs and wages, with the challenge being how to balance the gains from trade while addressing the negative effects on some individuals. Adjustment assistance for those affected by trade is seen as a more economically viable solution compared to protective policies that shield workers and industries from competition. Maintaining political support for free trade also relies on providing support for those potentially displaced by trade. Trade can have different effects on workers in different occupations, known as \"occupational exposure\" to trade. Disruptions can occur through domestic trade when firms relocate for economic reasons. Trade liberalization shifts jobs into industries with comparative advantage and away from those with disadvantage, leading to changes in employment composition without necessarily causing a net loss of jobs. Trade liberalization can lead to job shifts within industries based on comparative advantage, potentially causing displacement of workers. Studies show that job loss due to trade is a small percentage of overall job losses, with some workers being reemployed elsewhere. However, the short-term costs of switching occupations or industries can be significant, including reduced wages. Import competition from China has negatively impacted local labor markets and manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Despite this, economists argue that linking net imports to unemployment levels is questionable. Import competition from China has negatively affected U.S. local labor markets and manufacturing jobs. Economists argue that linking trade deficit to unemployment levels is questionable. GDP growth reduces unemployment but also increases trade deficit. Studies show mixed results on the impact of trade on wages and income inequality in the U.S. Many studies suggest that factors like technological change have a larger impact on wages than trade. Trade can increase returns for capital and high-skilled workers in the US while decreasing returns for low-skilled labor. Imports from countries like China can negatively affect wages for low-skilled US workers in certain industries. Global value chains have led some US companies to move labor-intensive production overseas, but they may still keep high-end services jobs in the US. The growth of global value chains has led US multinational corporations to shift low-value production overseas, while high-end services jobs are often retained in the US. Workers in export-oriented industries earn more on average than those in non-exporting industries. Economic globalization involves trade, financial flows, technology transfer, and international labor migration. Scholars have identified periods of both globalization and deglobalization. Economic globalization involves global trade, foreign direct investment, and integration of the world economy through technological advances and policy changes since World War II. Global trade as a percentage of global GDP increased from 25% to 57% between 1960 and 2017, while global FDI grew from 6% to 39% of global GDP during the same period. Despite debates on its impact, most economists believe globalization has raised living standards worldwide. Globalization has steadily reduced barriers to international exchange since World War II, leading to the creation of global value chains (GVCs) organized by multinational corporations. GVCs involve the production of goods using parts and components from multiple countries, with a significant portion of global trade consisting of intermediate goods and services. Data from the OECD shows that a quarter of national exports include foreign content. The latest OECD data shows that a significant portion of national exports include foreign content in the form of imported inputs, with the United States experiencing an increase in foreign value-added share in exports. Global value chains (GVCs) have played a crucial role in globalization, facilitating lower trade barriers and technological advancements, blurring the distinction between domestic and foreign activities in trade. This has made it challenging to determine who benefits from global trade and interpret bilateral trade balances. The blurring of distinctions between exports and imports has complicated understanding of global trade benefits. Trade in intermediates has made imports crucial for exports, impacting policies affecting both. Global value chains (GVCs) are evolving, shaping globalization and policy challenges. Foreign direct investment (FDI) drives trade, supporting GVC development by multinational corporations (MNCs). FDI involves a lasting interest in and influence over a business enterprise in another country. Foreign direct investment (FDI) by multinational corporations (MNCs) has led to the development of global value chains, with the majority of trade occurring within MNCs. U.S. firms invest abroad to sell goods and services in foreign markets, adapting to local preferences. In 2016, 11% of sales from U.S. foreign affiliates went to U.S. parent companies, while 59% went to the host country's market and 30% to other foreign countries. Greater global integration through trade and investment flows can disrupt markets, leading to concerns about offshoring and outsourcing. Some U.S. multinational corporations focus on high-end activities like research and development, while outsourcing production to countries with lower labor costs. Despite this, most economists believe that globalization and trade liberalization are unlikely to significantly impact the overall U.S. employment rate. Globalization and trade liberalization may not greatly affect overall U.S. employment, but could lead to increased volatility in worker incomes and job sectors. Manufacturing jobs may decrease due to outsourcing, while service-related jobs may increase. Wealth distribution could be impacted by globalization, with lower-skilled workers facing wage dampening and higher returns to capital. Studies show that globalization contributes to a decline in the labor share of national income. Globalization, driven by factors like delocalization and import competition, has marginally contributed to rising U.S. wage inequality. Most-favored-nation treatment in the WTO requires equal trade benefits among member countries, with exceptions for certain agreements and developing nations. \"Permitted exceptions to MFN treatment include trade agreements outside the WTO, special treatment for developing countries, and national treatment principles. MFN status ensures nondiscriminatory trade relations, with PNTR being the U.S. equivalent. Some countries like Cuba and North Korea do not have PNTR with the U.S., while others may receive temporary NTR status before graduating to PNTR.\" The Trade Act of 1974 prohibits granting PNTR status to countries not receiving it at the time of the law's enactment. Jackson-Vanik amendment denies PNTR to countries restricting emigration. WTO requires MFN treatment to all members, leading to PNTR establishment for countries like China, Vietnam, and Russia upon accession. Harmonized Tariff Schedule determines tariffs imposed on imports. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) determines tariffs on imported goods using a structure of tariff classification based on standard commodity codes developed by the World Customs Organization. The HS groups products into chapters and subheadings, with higher digits indicating more detailed categories. HS codes are standard worldwide up to the 6-digit level, further subdivided into 8-digit and 10-digit tariff lines unique to each product subheading. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) uses HS codes to classify imported goods, with 6-digit codes identifying specific products like \"oranges.\" The HTS further breaks down products into 8-digit and 10-digit tariff lines unique to the United States. Rules of origin (ROO) determine the nationality of imported products, impacting duty rates and eligibility for trade agreements. Determining a product's origin can be complex in today's global economy due to parts sourced from multiple countries. The U.S. negotiates different ROO within its free trade agreements to ensure only eligible trading partners receive tariff benefits. The global economy relies on complex supply chains for goods like autos, computers, and clothing, with rules of origin (ROO) determining eligibility for tariff benefits in free trade agreements. The \"yarn-forward\" rule in the U.S. requires apparel to use yarn and fabric from FTA partners. Global trade has grown significantly, with trade reforms linked to higher growth in productivity and reduced poverty worldwide. Global trade has grown significantly from 1960 to 2017, with trade reforms linked to higher productivity and reduced poverty. However, trade growth slowed after the financial crisis in 2008, attributed to factors like weak import demand and trade protectionism. Trade growth rebounded in 2017, driven by increased investment and consumption expenditure. IMF and WTO projected a rebound in trade growth for 2018 and 2019 amid some downside risks. Global trade growth rebounded in 2017, driven by increased investment and consumption expenditure. IMF and WTO projected a rebound in trade growth for 2018 and 2019, but now expect it to slow due to rising trade tensions and policy uncertainty. Restrictive trade measures imposed by the US and its partners may be affecting trade flows and prices. Top trading economies in 2017 were the US, China, Germany, Japan, and the UK, with the EU as the largest trading economy if treated as a single bloc. The top trading economies in 2017 were the United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The EU would be the largest trading economy if treated as a single bloc. China was the largest exporter, while the United States was the largest importer. The U.S. share of global goods exports fell from 15% in 1960 to 9% in 2017. U.S. exports and imports of goods and services combined were equivalent to 27% of GDP in 2017. The United States ranked first in terms of \"openness\" or \"competitiveness\" among 140 economies. In 2017, the United States exported $2.4 trillion in goods and services and imported $2.9 trillion, with U.S. exports growing over 40% and imports over 20% in the past decade. Trade relative to GDP has increased significantly since 1960, with U.S. exports and imports as a percentage of GDP expanding. China was the top U.S. trading partner, followed by Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany. The EU is the largest export destination and source of imports for the United States. The EU is the largest export destination and source of imports for the United States, with China being the largest source of U.S. imports. The majority of U.S. global trade is with countries without free trade agreements. Multinational corporations produce worldwide, leading to complex value chains that make it difficult to interpret trade data. For example, products like iPhones are developed in the U.S. but assembled in China using imported components. The value of trade between countries can be misleading as it may not accurately reflect the true source of resources used in production or who benefits from the trade. For example, products like iPhones, developed in the U.S., are assembled in China using components from various countries. This leads to an inflated trade deficit between the U.S. and China, as the full value of the imported product is attributed to China. \"Trade in value-added\" (TiVA) aims to identify where the value of goods and services was added, providing a more accurate measure of trade dynamics. The U.S. trade deficit with China would have been reduced by one-third in 2011 if measured by \"trade in value-added\" (TiVA). A trade deficit occurs when a country imports more than it exports, indicating that the nation consumes more than it produces. The United States has had trade deficits annually since WWII, with a global trade deficit of $552.3 billion in goods and services in 2017. The United States has consistently run trade deficits since WWII, with a global trade deficit of $552.3 billion in goods and services in 2017. The deficit is mainly driven by goods trade, with a deficit of $807.5 billion in goods. However, the U.S. usually runs annual surpluses in services, with a surplus of $255.2 billion in 2017. The current account deficit in 2017 was $449.1 billion, down from its peak in 2006, largely due to reduced demand for imports after the global financial crisis in 2008. The United States had a $449.1 billion current account deficit in 2017, down from its peak in 2006. The deficit was reduced due to the economic slowdown after the global financial crisis, lower commodity prices, and decreased U.S. oil imports. The trade deficit reflects that the U.S. consumes more than it produces and imports more than it exports, mainly due to a low rate of domestic savings. Americans borrow from countries with excess savings to boost economic growth, leading to a trade deficit. The U.S. trade deficit is influenced by borrowing from countries like China with excess savings, allowing for higher economic growth. The role of the dollar as a global reserve currency also sustains the deficit by increasing the availability of dollar-denominated assets. Foreign investors lend funds to the U.S. through buying Treasury securities, enabling the deficit to continue. The deficit relative to GDP provides a metric for comparison with other countries. The U.S. trade deficit, influenced by borrowing from countries like China and the role of the dollar as a global reserve currency, can continue through buying U.S. Treasury securities. The deficit relative to GDP reached a historic high in 2006 but has since declined. Countries like the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada have large current account deficits, while countries like the Netherlands, Germany, and South Korea have surpluses. Policymakers view U.S. bilateral trade deficits with countries like China as indicators of unfair trade relationships. Some policymakers view U.S. bilateral trade deficits with countries like China as indicators of unfair trade relationships. Market-distorting trade policies, such as trade barriers and subsidies, may affect bilateral trade volume but have less impact on the overall U.S. trade deficit, which is mainly due to low savings. High tariffs and trade barriers do not necessarily lead to smaller trade deficits. Reduction of protectionist measures may increase U.S. exports, but without changes in consumption and savings behavior, the overall trade deficit would remain unchanged. Trade diversion could occur if protectionist measures are imposed or reduced in one country. The overall U.S. trade deficit remains relatively unchanged despite changes in demand for imports or protectionist trade measures. Bilateral trade balances are influenced by factors beyond trade barriers, such as economic development, raw materials, and supply chain relationships. A trade deficit requires adjustments in the economy, particularly in the exchange rate. The trade deficit in the U.S. causes adjustments in the economy, especially in the exchange rate. The surplus of U.S. dollars flowing abroad leads to a decrease in the dollar's value relative to other currencies, making imports more expensive for Americans and exports cheaper for foreign buyers. Foreign investments in U.S. Treasury securities appreciate the dollar, making U.S. exports more expensive. Foreign governments with high savings rates, like China, intervene in currency markets to keep their currency from appreciating relative to the dollar. This intervention has been criticized for hampering the realignment of global trade balances. Trade deficits reflect a savings/investment shortfall, leading to the United States borrowing from abroad. Concerns arise from the debt accumulation due to sustained trade deficits. The impact of borrowing to finance imports depends on whether the funds are used for productive investments or current consumption. Borrowing to finance new technology and productivity-enhancing products can lead to higher economic growth in the long run. However, borrowing for consumer purchases may push repayment to future generations without improving the ability to finance those repayments. Some economists warn that a rising U.S. trade deficit could cause a sudden fall in the value of the dollar, risking financial turmoil. Addressing underlying macroeconomic imbalances is crucial to prevent negative effects on the economy and trade balance in the long term. Many economists argue that reducing the U.S. trade deficit without addressing macroeconomic imbalances could harm the economy. Ways to reduce the current account deficit include boosting domestic savings, realigning exchange rates, and ensuring other countries do not devalue their currencies. Trade policies are not seen as the most effective tool for balancing trade. In 2017, the U.S. exported $1.3 trillion in manufactured goods and imported $2.0 trillion, resulting in a merchandise trade deficit of $698 billion. U.S. manufactures accounted for 56% of total exports and 70% of total imports. The U.S. trade deficit was $698 billion in 2017, with U.S. manufactures accounting for 56% of exports and 70% of imports. The manufacturing sector has seen a shift towards advanced technology and less labor-intensive production, leading to factory closures and job losses. Global value chains have transformed certain industries, with activities like assembly moving abroad while design and distribution drive the manufacturing process. The U.S. manufacturing sector has experienced a decline in employment but an increase in output due to improved productivity. From 1980 to 2017, manufacturing real output grew by over 80%, while employment decreased by more than one-third. Despite this, manufacturing remains a significant component of the U.S. economy, accounting for 11% of GDP in 2017. The share of manufacturing in GDP decreased from 21% in 1980 to 11% in 2017, while services increased from 55% to 70%. U.S. manufacturing employment fell from 19.4 million in 1979 to 12.4 million in 2017, but has been rising since 2010. In 2017, manufacturing employment accounted for 8.5% of total nonfarm employment, down from 20.7% in 1980. The decline in manufacturing employment is a trend seen in advanced economies, influenced by technology, consumer preferences, and trade. The role of trade in U.S. manufacturing employment decline is debated, with some attributing it to increased imports from China. However, others argue that job losses were offset by gains in services from expanding U.S. exports globally. Automation and other factors also played a significant role in the restructuring of the manufacturing sector. Despite a decline in the U.S. share of global manufacturing value-added, the country remains a top global manufacturer, exporting $138 billion in 2017. Manufacturing is a significant component of the U.S. economy, accounting for nearly 70% of private-sector research and development and nearly 60% of exports. Manufacturers contribute significantly to U.S. research and development and exports, with agriculture accounting for a trade surplus of $17 billion in 2017. Agricultural exports make up 6% of total U.S. exports, with foreign markets being crucial for products like wheat and cotton. Imports of products like coffee, cocoa, fish, and juices play a significant role in U.S. food consumption. Imports of certain products like coffee, cocoa, spices, fish, and juices account for a large share of U.S. food consumption. \"Services\" encompass a variety of economic activities that facilitate the economy, such as transportation, telecommunications, and financial services. Foreign barriers may hinder U.S. trade in services, which play a crucial role in global value chains. In 2017, the United States exported $798 billion in services and imported $542 billion, creating a trade surplus of $255 billion. Services barriers often occur within the importing country as discriminatory regulations favor domestic providers. Trade barriers for services involve establishing a commercial presence or temporary movement of providers and consumers across borders. In 2017, the United States had a trade surplus of $255 billion from exporting $798 billion in services and importing $542 billion. Services trade accounts for 79% of U.S. GDP and 82% of U.S. private sector full-time employment, playing a crucial role in the economy. Unlike goods trade, the U.S. consistently exports more services than it imports, helping to offset deficits in goods trade. Trade data may underestimate services trade due to the lack of value-added measurement, with services like R&D, design, and business services being essential inputs in the value chain. Digital trade encompasses a wide range of services beyond just the physical movement of goods, including R&D, design, engineering, and business services. These services play a crucial role in the economy, with their value captured in trade in value-added statistics. As manufacturing and agriculture become more technologically advanced, the consumption of value-added services also increases. Examples of digital trade include online shopping, information transmission for business operations, online health and educational services, communication channels like email, and financial services for e-commerce. Nontariff barriers can restrict digital trade, affecting what firms offer in a market or how they operate. Digital trade constraints, like traditional trade barriers, can be tariff or nontariff barriers. Nontariff barriers, such as data localization requirements, restrict the flow of commercial data, affecting the type of services a firm can offer or how it can communicate with subsidiaries abroad. These barriers also impact the ability of cloud-computing providers to enter a market. The United States played a key role in shaping the global economic order post-World War II. The United States has historically played a key role in shaping the global economic order post-World War II. U.S. trade policy focuses on supporting economic growth, liberalizing markets, enforcing trade commitments, and advancing strategic goals. The current Administration's trade policy objectives include supporting national security. The U.S. Trade Representative outlines key trade policy objectives annually, including supporting national security, negotiating new trade deals, enforcing trade laws, and reforming the multilateral trading system. The U.S. government's trade functions involve formulating policy, negotiating agreements, enforcing laws, and administering trade programs. Congress plays a significant role in trade policy through legislative and oversight authority, working with the executive branch. Interagency coordination is crucial in implementing trade policy, with the USTR serving as the President's principal trade advisor. The USTR works with the executive branch to negotiate trade agreements and coordinates with multiple U.S. agencies. Agency roles in trade policy have evolved over time through legislative and administrative actions. Congress holds primary authority over trade policy according to the U.S. Constitution. Congress plays a crucial role in U.S. trade policy by enacting laws that govern trade programs, tariffs, nontariff barriers, and trade remedies. It also sets trade negotiating objectives through trade promotion authority and conducts oversight hearings to ensure compliance with U.S. law. Additionally, Congress delegates certain powers to the President for negotiating reciprocal trade agreements and taking executive action on trade policy. Congress has delegated powers to the President for negotiating trade agreements and taking executive action on trade policy. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 authorized the President to reduce tariffs through reciprocal agreements. The Trade Act of 1974 expanded this authority to include opening markets and negotiating international trade norms. The House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee have primary responsibility for trade matters. Other committees may also be involved in trade agreements and policies. The House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee, along with other relevant committees, have primary responsibility for trade matters in Congress. Congressional Advisory Groups on Negotiations (CAGs) provide advice to USTR during trade agreement negotiations. Individual Members influence trade policy through voting and participation on relevant committees. Individual Members of Congress play a significant role in trade policy by serving as voting representatives, participating in relevant committees, providing testimony, and influencing other Members. Trade promotion authority (TPA) expedites the approval and implementation of trade agreements by ensuring a guaranteed, up-or-down vote with no amendments. Congress is responsible for implementing trade agreements that require changes in U.S. law through legislation. Trade promotion authority (TPA) expedites the approval and implementation of trade agreements through a guaranteed, up-or-down vote with no amendments, provided certain requirements are met. TPA defines how Congress exercises its authority over trade policy and gives the President negotiating credibility. TPA was first enacted in 1974 and has been renewed four times, with the most recent legislation signed into law in 2015. The executive branch executes trade policy in various ways. The most recent legislation on Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) was signed into law on June 29, 2015 (P.L. 114-26) and applies to concluded trade agreements notified to Congress before July 1, 2021. The executive branch, under the President's responsibility, negotiates, implements, and monitors U.S. trade agreements, enforces customs, collects duties, and administers trade laws. The USTR, as the chief adviser on trade policy, is responsible for developing, coordinating, and implementing trade policy, as well as negotiating trade agreements. The USTR, a Cabinet-level appointment, is the chief adviser on trade policy to the President with primary responsibility for developing, coordinating, and implementing trade policy. They negotiate multilateral, regional, and bilateral trade agreements, enforce U.S. trade laws, and report annually to Congress on the President's trade policy agenda. The USTR was created in 1962 to provide better balance in U.S. trade policy and negotiations, previously managed by the State Department. Congress and the President delegate trade functions to various executive branch departments and agencies, which coordinate U.S. positions through an interagency process. Other key agencies with trade responsibilities include the Departments of Commerce and Agriculture. The USTR administers the government's trade functions, coordinating U.S. positions through an interagency process. Other key agencies involved in trade policymaking and enforcement include the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, State, and the Treasury. The USTR has primary responsibility for trade negotiations and policy decisions, which often require a multidepartment interagency process. Congress established the Trade Policy Committee, chaired by the USTR, to implement this process. Additionally, there are two sub-Cabinet groups - the Trade Policy Review Group and the Trade Policy Staff Committee, composed of various agencies. The executive branch also seeks advice from a three-tier trade advisory committee system mandated by Congress. The Trade Policy Review Group (TPRG) and the Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) are key components of the interagency process for trade policymaking. The President plays a crucial role in influencing trade legislation, signing trade laws, and making specific decisions on trade policies. The private sector and other stakeholders are involved in U.S. trade policy formulation through a three-tiered committee system mandated by Congress. The private sector and other stakeholders play a key role in shaping U.S. trade policy through a three-tiered committee system established by Congress in the Trade Act of 1974. This system includes 28 committees with about 700 citizen advisors, covering various policy areas such as environment, labor, agriculture, and industry. The committees provide input on negotiating objectives, bargaining positions, and trade agreements to ensure that public and private sector views are considered in trade policies. The private sector, NGOs, and labor groups influence U.S. trade policy by providing information and advice on negotiating objectives, testifying before congressional committees and government bodies, and lobbying Congress and the executive branch. They also participate in trade initiatives through Federal Register notices and promote their interests in trade policies and agreements. Trade is crucial to the U.S. economy, involving various sectors including agriculture. Trade is a vital part of the U.S. economy, with a wide range of goods and services being tradeable. Stakeholders, including private sector, NGOs, and labor groups, lobby Congress and the executive branch to influence trade policies and agreements. Decisions on trade agreements and trade investigations can impact employment, economic growth, product choices, and prices for U.S. consumers. Groups also seek greater market access in various countries and are concerned with nontariff issues like intellectual property rights and labor and environmental protections. The increasing focus on nontariff issues in trade agreements has broadened stakeholder interest, with various groups striving to ensure their views are represented in trade policy decisions. Legal challenges can be brought in federal court by importers, exporters, and other parties regarding governmental actions on trade, including customs classification, antidumping proceedings, national security investigations, and state economic sanctions. The federal government may also initiate legal proceedings to enforce customs laws and restrictions on imports and exports. Some trade statutes may limit judicial review. The federal government may initiate legal proceedings to enforce customs laws and restrictions on imports and exports, with some trade statutes limiting judicial review. Court decisions, particularly in the U.S. Court of International Trade, can significantly impact U.S. trade policy by examining agency actions, deference to executive branch actions, and ruling on trade statute constitutionality. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) is an Article III federal court in New York City with exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters. It was formerly known as the Customs Court and was renamed in 1980, expanding its jurisdiction. The court has nine judges appointed by the President and Senate, with decisions appealable to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and possibly the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) has jurisdiction over trade-related matters and is governed by statutory provisions found in 28 U.S.C. Sections 251-258, 1581-1585, and 2631-2647. The United States negotiates trade agreements for economic, commercial, foreign policy, and national security reasons, aiming to reduce tariffs, increase market access for U.S. exporters, gain competitive advantages, and encourage trade liberalization. The U.S. participates in multilateral agreements through the World Trade Organization (WTO) to strengthen alliances and deepen its presence in global regions. The United States participates in various trade agreements to deepen its presence and influence in different regions. These agreements include multilateral agreements negotiated in the World Trade Organization (WTO), free trade agreements (FTAs) involving different numbers of countries, and plurilateral agreements focusing on specific sectors. Currently, the US has 14 FTAs in force covering 20 countries, with the majority of partners being small developing countries. The United States has 14 FTAs in force covering 20 countries, with the majority of partners being small developing countries. U.S. trade policy under the Trump Administration has shifted towards bilateral trade negotiations, withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and renegotiating NAFTA into the USMCA. The United States has signed the USMCA and negotiated amendments to the KORUS FTA. New trade agreements with Japan, the EU, and UK are being considered. U.S. FTAs are comprehensive and go beyond WTO rules. The United States negotiates comprehensive FTAs with more tariff coverage and enforceable commitments than other countries. U.S. FTAs include elimination of tariffs, services trade barriers, foreign investment rules, intellectual property protection, government procurement commitments, and labor/environmental standards. The U.S. establishes new trading rules in recent agreements, including digital trade and state-owned enterprises. Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs) promote trade and investment consultation between the U.S. and other countries, with the USTR leading TIFA talks. The U.S. has over 50 TIFAs, mostly with developing countries. The USTR leads Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) talks to promote trade and investment. TIFAs are nonbinding agreements that can lead to FTA or bilateral investment treaty negotiations. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was created in 1947 and governed international trade until the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. The GATT, established in 1947, committed signatories to lower tariffs and apply them in a nondiscriminatory manner. Despite its enforcement mechanism being ineffective, it led to a significant reduction in trade barriers. The WTO, formed in 1995 with the US playing a key role, administers trade rules, resolves disputes, and promotes trade liberalization through multilateral negotiations. The WTO was established on January 1, 1995, succeeding the GATT. It administers various trade agreements including GATT, GATS, TRIPS, and oversees negotiations like the Doha Development Agenda. However, the Doha negotiations have been stalled since 2015 due to disagreements among major trading partners. The WTO's effectiveness in trade negotiations and dispute resolution has been questioned since the collapse of the Doha Round. Members are exploring reforms to improve the organization's role in the global trading system, including changes to the dispute settlement system. The Trump Administration is withholding approval for appointments to the WTO Appellate Body, raising concerns about judicial overreach. The Trump Administration is withholding approval for appointments to the WTO Appellate Body amid concerns over \"judicial overreach\" and certain procedures. The dispute settlement system could cease to function by late 2019 if new appointments are not approved. Members can challenge trade practices violating WTO agreements through dispute settlement proceedings, starting with consultations and potentially leading to a panel decision appealed to the WTO Appellate Body. Failure to comply with WTO obligations may result in temporary retaliatory actions or compensation requests. 575 dispute settlement complaints have been filed in the WTO since 1995. Since 1995, 575 dispute settlement complaints have been filed in the WTO. The United States is a frequent user of the WTO dispute settlement system, involved in numerous cases. WTO decisions do not directly impact U.S. law, requiring legislative action for implementation. USTR determines compliance actions if a U.S. statute is found inconsistent with WTO obligations. The United States may amend regulations or issue new determinations in response to challenged administrative proceedings, with the possibility of compensating complainant countries. The U.S. generally complies with WTO decisions to encourage compliance from other members. Disputes under U.S. FTAs can be resolved through consultations or panels, with non-compliance leading to trade benefit suspension. State-state dispute settlement is not commonly used in U.S. FTAs. The United States may choose the forum to resolve disputes common to both FTA and WTO rules. State-state dispute settlement is not frequently used in U.S. FTAs, with disputes usually resolved through consultations. Most disputes with FTA partners are adjudicated under WTO rules. U.S. FTAs also have a separate dispute system for investment-related provisions, including investor-state dispute settlement. NAFTA has a unique binational panel system for trade remedy laws. Trade preference programs provide duty-free access to the U.S. market for eligible developing countries. Trade preference programs offer duty-free access to the U.S. market for selected exports from eligible developing countries. There are six programs created by Congress since 1974, including the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). GSP is the largest program, covering 120 countries and territories, with imports totaling $21 billion in 2017. Countries must meet specific criteria to be eligible, such as protecting intellectual property and worker rights. USTR is currently reviewing the eligibility of several GSP countries. The United States imports $220 billion from GSP countries under the program, which requires countries to meet specific criteria set by Congress. USTR is reviewing the eligibility of countries like India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Turkey. Trade capacity building (TCB) involves U.S. assistance to support developing countries in international trade. In FY2016, the U.S. invested $1.2 billion in 651 TCB activities across 134 countries. TCB helps countries negotiate trade agreements, implement reforms, and improve their capacity to benefit from increased trade. USAID typically handles coordination of U.S. government TCB efforts. U.S. assistance for customs reforms, labor and environment protections, and meeting export standards. Various agencies handle trade capacity building (TCB) activities, with USAID receiving the most funding. Congress has the power to set tariffs, which historically were used for revenue collection but now play a smaller role. U.S. Customs and Border Protection collects tariffs at ports of entry, contributing just 1% to federal revenue. Tariffs have been used to promote global trade liberalization over the past 80 years. Protection (CBP) administers the collection of tariffs at U.S. ports of entry, collecting $32 billion in tariffs in 2016, which is just 1% of total federal revenue. The United States has used its tariff policy over the past 80 years to encourage global trade liberalization, reduce tariffs through negotiations, and support global peace and economic prosperity. By 2016, the average U.S. tariff applied across all products was 3.3%, the lowest among the top five global economies by GDP. The Trump Administration has criticized low-tariff policies and has increased the use of discretionary measures. The United States has a 3.3% tariff on all products, the lowest among top global economies. Approximately 70% of products enter the U.S. duty-free. The Trump Administration has increased tariffs on certain goods from key trading partners. Trade laws include antidumping and countervailing duty laws to address unfair trade practices. Other trade remedy laws focus on import surges and trade violations. The U.S. has various trade remedy laws, including antidumping and countervailing duty laws, to address unfair trade practices. These laws must comply with U.S. WTO obligations. Supporters argue they protect U.S. industries, while others fear they may lead to disguised protectionism and inefficiencies in the trading system. Antidumping is the most commonly used trade remedy law. Antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) actions can be seen as protectionist measures that raise prices on imported goods. AD is used when foreign goods are sold at \"less than fair value\" in the US, causing harm to domestic industries. The US had 354 AD orders in place as of mid-December 2018, with over one-third targeting China. CVD is another commonly used trade remedy law to offset unfair subsidies. The United States had 354 AD orders in place as of mid-December 2018, with over one-third targeting China. Additionally, there were 113 CVD orders in place, nearly half of which were against China. Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 authorizes the President to restrict imports causing serious injury to domestic industry through safeguard actions. The Trade Act of 1974 authorizes the President to impose temporary restrictions on imports causing serious injury to domestic industry through safeguard actions. Unlike AD and CVD cases, safeguard investigations do not require allegations of unfair trade practices. The ITC conducts investigations initiated by petitions from trade associations, companies, or unions. In 2017, two safeguard investigations were initiated under the Trump Administration, resulting in safeguard measures on solar cells and large residential washing machines. The last safeguard investigation prior to this was in 2001. The President imposed safeguard measures on imports of solar cells and large residential washing machines for four and three years, respectively. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows for restrictions on imports threatening national security. The Commerce Department consults with the Secretary of Defense to determine the impact on national security before the President can impose tariffs or quotas. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows for restrictions on imports threatening national security. The Commerce Department consults with the Secretary of Defense to determine the impact before the President can impose tariffs or quotas. Section 232 specifies factors Commerce must consider regarding U.S. imports' impact on national security. The President can impose tariffs, quotas, or other measures based on findings, with few limits. Section 232 has been invoked infrequently, with investigations completed since 1963. In 2018, tariffs were imposed on steel and aluminum imports. Currently, investigations are ongoing for uranium, autos, and auto parts imports under Section 232. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the U.S. to enforce trade agreement rights and respond to unfair barriers to exports, including inadequate protection of intellectual property rights. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the United States to enforce trade agreement rights and respond to unfair barriers to exports, including inadequate protection of intellectual property rights (IPR). USTR can initiate cases by petition or self-initiation, seeking a negotiated settlement with the trading partner. If no resolution is reached, USTR may retaliate with tariffs. \"Special 301\" requires USTR to report annually to Congress on countries with inadequate IPR regimes. The \"Special 301\" provision directs USTR to report annually to Congress on countries with inadequate IPR regimes. USTR issues a three-tier list of countries based on U.S. concern levels. A \"Priority Foreign Country\" designation indicates the most serious cases, leading to Section 301 investigations. USTR has initiated 125 Section 301 cases since 1974, with almost half occurring in the 1980s. In 2017, USTR launched an investigation into China's IPR technology policies. Following USTR's findings of unreasonable practices, the Trump Administration increased tariffs on Chinese imports. China retaliated with tariffs on U.S. products, leading to disputes at the WTO. In response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, China has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. products and both sides have pursued dispute cases at the WTO. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to negotiate \"structural changes\" regarding IP, technology, agriculture, and services within 90 days. The U.S. agreed to suspend planned tariff increases contingent on reaching an agreement. Section 337 of the Tariff Act prohibits unfair competition in importing goods. States agreed to suspend the Section 301 tariff increases from 10% to 25% planned for January 1, 2019, contingent on an agreement within 90 days. Section 337 of the Tariff Act prohibits unfair competition in importing goods, focusing on IPR enforcement. It prohibits imports infringing U.S. patents, copyrights, trademarks, and more. The ITC handles Section 337 investigations, issuing exclusion orders if violations are found. Trade Adjustment Assistance programs offer federal aid to affected workers and firms. The ITC may issue exclusion orders and/or cease-and-desist orders for violations found in Section 337 investigations. Trade Adjustment Assistance programs provide federal aid to workers and firms affected by trade, with TAA for Workers being the largest program. It offers assistance to workers impacted by foreign competition through job loss or relocation, providing benefits like career services, training, and income support. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) provides federal aid to workers and firms affected by trade, offering services, training, and income support. TAA aims to offset the impact of trade liberalization by helping workers adjust to import competition. Critics argue that TAA is costly and inefficient, while supporters believe it promotes economic efficiency, equity, and support for international trade. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) aims to help workers and firms affected by trade by providing federal aid, services, training, and income support. Critics argue that TAA is costly and inefficient, while supporters believe it promotes economic efficiency, equity, and support for international trade. Despite disagreements, Congress has consistently maintained the program over the past five decades. Additionally, several federal agencies, such as the Export-Import Bank, the Department of Agriculture, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, administer finance programs to support U.S. exports and investments. The BUILD Act of 2018 establishes new initiatives to promote development. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and the Export-Import Bank support U.S. exports and investments in developing countries. The Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act of 2018 (BUILD Act) establishes a new agency to succeed OPIC. Various agencies promote U.S. exports, with a focus on commercial interests and foreign policy objectives. The Ex-Im Bank provides financial assistance to counter foreign government activities. The Export-Import Bank provides financial assistance, including direct loans and loan guarantees, to help finance U.S. exports to developing economies. Despite its reauthorization, the bank has been constrained by a lack of board quorum, affecting approval of medium- and long-term export financing. Presidential appointments to the board require Senate approval, sparking debate over the role of government in export financing. Export controls, governed by the Arms Export Control Act and Export Controls Act of 2018, aim to balance national security goals with export competitiveness. The United States restricts exports for security, foreign policy, and economic reasons through various laws such as the Arms Export Control Act, Export Controls Act of 2018, and International Emergency Economic Powers Act. These controls cover defense items, dual-use goods, nuclear materials, and items related to weapons proliferation. Different departments administer export control programs and licenses are required for certain exports. The Export Controls Act of 2018 provides broad authority for implementing dual-use export controls, replacing the Export Administration Act of 1979. The Export Controls Act of 2018 (ECA) provides legislative authority for dual-use export controls, replacing the Export Administration Act of 1979. It authorizes the Department of Commerce to regulate the export of \"emerging and foundational technologies\" crucial to national security. Dual-use goods have civilian and military applications, such as nuclear materials, electronics, and lasers. Licenses for exports are issued by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security based on technical characteristics and end use. The Bureau of Industry and Security issues licenses for exports based on technical characteristics, destination, and end use. Capital flows include foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI). FDI involves acquiring real assets, while FPI involves purchasing foreign equities or bonds. FDI stimulates direct employment, while portfolio investments are highly liquid. Official capital flows are generated by governments for various purposes. Global trade in goods and services grew significantly from 1990 to 2017. Global trade in goods and services grew significantly from 1990 to 2017, with exports increasing from $4 trillion to $23 trillion. Capital flows, including foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment, also expanded during this period. The growth in capital flows was accompanied by an increase in foreign exchange and over-the-counter derivatives markets, impacting the international exchange value of the dollar and prices of goods and services. The total daily trading of foreign currencies was more than $5.1 trillion in 2016. The value of the dollar affects prices of goods and services and securities. The total daily trading of foreign currencies was over $5.1 trillion in 2016. Multinational corporations invest abroad to increase profits, driven by factors like competitive advantages and low-cost resources. FDI supports global value chains and allows firms to operate close to customers in foreign markets. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is used by multinational corporations (MNCs) to access low-cost resources, improve efficiency, and expand market share. FDI also allows firms to operate close to customers in foreign markets with different preferences. Mergers and acquisitions through FDI can enhance global competitiveness. The total stock of global outward FDI in 2017 was $31 trillion, with the United States being the largest source and recipient of FDI. Developing Asia accounted for the largest share of global FDI inflows. The United States is the largest source and recipient of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), with outward investment positions about one-fourth or less than that of the United States. Developing Asia accounted for the largest share of global FDI inflows, followed by Europe, North America, Latin America, and Africa. From 1985 to 2017, the stock of U.S. FDI abroad rose significantly, with Europe being the largest destination for U.S. direct investment abroad. The largest sources of cumulative FDI inflows for the United States are the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, France, and Ireland. U.S. outward FDI is mainly in high-technology, finance, and services, while inward FDI is focused on the manufacturing sector, particularly chemicals and transport industries. Economists support international capital flows like FDI as they benefit both home and host economies by enhancing competitive advantages, skills, and incomes. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) benefits both home and host economies by enhancing competitive advantages, skills, and incomes. Inward FDI adds to the capital stock and skill set of the economy, brings technological advances, boosts capital formation, and contributes to a more competitive business environment. FDI also contributes to international trade and global economic integration. In 2016, foreign firm affiliates in the United States employed 7.1 million workers, exported $369.8 billion in goods, and imported $649.9 billion in goods, contributing $894.0 billion value-added to U.S. GDP. Some stakeholders raise concerns about U.S. firms investing abroad, fearing job loss and lower wages in the U.S. Most U.S. outward FDI goes to developed countries with similar markets. Economists argue that U.S. direct investment abroad does not necessarily lead to fewer jobs or lower incomes for Americans. Economists argue that U.S. direct investment abroad does not necessarily lead to job loss or lower incomes for Americans. International investment agreements establish rules on investment protections, with over 2,600 in force globally. These agreements aim to reduce FDI restrictions, ensure nondiscriminatory treatment of investors, and safeguard a government's right to regulate in the public interest. U.S. IIAs involve reciprocal commitments for specific protections. The agreements on investment protections, including bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and investment chapters in free trade agreements (FTAs), involve reciprocal commitments between the United States and partner countries. The U.S. has BITs in force with 40 countries, with the latest one ratified with Rwanda in 2012. Additionally, the U.S. has 14 FTAs covering 20 countries, most of which include investment chapters. Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) allows private investors to bring claims against host country governments. Negotiations with China and India have stalled. The United States has 14 FTAs covering 20 countries, most with investment chapters. Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) allows investors to bring claims against governments for violations. ISDS cases have increased with global FDI growth. U.S. investors make up one-fifth of claims worldwide. The U.S. has not lost any cases brought by foreign investors. ISDS provisions are common in U.S. BITs and FTAs. The use of ISDS in U.S. trade negotiations has become a subject of debate, with a focus on investor protections and government's right to regulate. The Trump Administration made significant changes to ISDS under NAFTA renegotiation. The proposed USMCA would eliminate ISDS between the U.S. and Canada, with limits on Mexico. ISDS was also contentious in T-TIP talks, with the EU pushing for an investment court system in recent trade agreements. The EU has been advocating for an investment court system in trade agreements, replacing ISDS. CFIUS, established in 1975 and expanded in 2007, oversees foreign investments for national security. The Secretary of the Treasury chairs CFIUS, which conducts risk-based analyses on potential threats. CFIUS, chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury, reviews foreign investments for national security. The President can block transactions, with recent examples including the Lattice Semiconductor Corp. and Qualcomm acquisitions. The FIRRMA of 2018 expands the scope of transactions subject to review. The FIRRMA of 2018, signed into law on August 13, 2018, amends the investment review process under CFIUS, expanding the scope of transactions subject to review to include non-controlling investments in U.S. businesses involved in critical technology or infrastructure. Some have raised concerns about the expanded role of CFIUS conflicting with the U.S.'s historically open investment climate. Additionally, the BUILD Act of 2018 establishes the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) as a successor to OPIC, aiming to enhance and consolidate development finance functions. SelectUSA, a Department of Commerce program, coordinates efforts to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) to the United States. The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) was established as a successor to OPIC and USAID to expand and consolidate development finance functions. SelectUSA, a Department of Commerce program, helps attract foreign direct investment by providing information to businesses and advocating for investments in the United States."
