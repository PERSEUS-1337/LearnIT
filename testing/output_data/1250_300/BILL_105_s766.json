    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act of 1997\". Congress finds that approximately 60% of pregnancies in the US are unintended, contraceptive services are essential for family planning, cost-effective, and help reduce the need for abortion. Unintended pregnancies lead to negative health outcomes and economic strain on families. The National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality suggests that infant mortality could decrease by 10% if all women not desiring pregnancy used contraception. The National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality found that using contraception could reduce infant mortality by 10%. Most women in the US rely on private employment-related insurance for medical expenses, but coverage for prescription contraceptives is often excluded. Private insurance offers limited coverage for contraceptives, with many plans not covering any methods other than sterilization. Women of reproductive age spend significantly more on out-of-pocket health care costs, with contraceptives being a major expense. The lack of contraceptive coverage in health insurance leads to financial barriers for women, resulting in unintended pregnancies. The Institute of Medicine recommends increasing coverage for contraceptive services to reduce these barriers. Amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 include new standards relating to benefits for contraceptives. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 has been amended to include new standards that prohibit group health plans and health insurance issuers from excluding or restricting benefits for prescription contraceptive drugs or devices approved by the FDA. Additionally, they cannot deny eligibility based on an individual's use of contraceptives. Health insurance issuers cannot deny enrollment or renewal based on an individual's contraceptive use, offer incentives to accept less coverage, penalize healthcare professionals for prescribing contraceptives, or provide incentives to withhold contraceptives. The section prohibits health care professionals from withholding contraceptive drugs or services from covered individuals. Group health plans and insurance issuers can impose cost-sharing for contraceptive benefits, but the cost-sharing for drugs cannot be greater than that for other outpatient prescription drugs covered under the plan. The section mandates that cost-sharing for contraceptive devices and services under a health plan cannot exceed that for other outpatient prescription drugs or health care services covered under the plan. The section requires health plans to cover experimental contraceptive drugs or devices, with limitations on types of healthcare. The section mandates health plans to cover experimental contraceptive drugs or devices, with restrictions on healthcare professionals and utilization review provisions. It also includes limitations on outpatient contraceptive services, such as requirements for second opinions and preauthorizations. The imposition of these requirements is considered a material modification in the terms of the group health plan. The section mandates health plans to cover outpatient contraceptive services, including consultations, examinations, procedures, and medical services related to contraceptive methods. State laws providing greater protections for enrollees are not preempted. The section mandates health plans to cover outpatient contraceptive services, including consultations, examinations, procedures, and medical services related to contraceptive methods to prevent unintended pregnancy. A clerical amendment is made to the table of contents in the Act. Section 713 of the Public Health Service Act mandates health plans to cover contraceptive benefits, effective for plan years starting on or after January 1, 1998. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must provide coverage for prescription contraceptive drugs and devices approved by the FDA, as well as outpatient contraceptive services, without excluding or restricting benefits. Additionally, they cannot deny eligibility based on an individual's use of these services. Health insurance issuers cannot deny enrollment or renewal based on an individual's use of covered items or services. They are also prohibited from providing incentives to reduce coverage or limit reimbursement for contraceptive services. Additionally, they cannot incentivize healthcare professionals to withhold contraceptive services from covered individuals. Health care professionals cannot be incentivized to withhold contraceptive drugs, devices, or services from covered individuals. Group health plans and insurance issuers can impose deductibles and cost-sharing for contraceptive drugs and devices, but these cannot be greater than those for other outpatient prescription drugs covered under the plan. The plan must provide benefits for contraceptive devices and outpatient contraceptive services, with deductibles and cost-sharing not exceeding those for other outpatient prescription drugs or health care services covered under the plan. The plan must cover experimental or investigational contraceptive drugs, devices, or services, with limitations including restrictions on the type of healthcare. The plan must cover experimental or investigational contraceptive drugs, devices, or services with limitations on healthcare professionals and utilization review provisions. The group health plan must comply with notice requirements and not preempt state laws that provide greater protections for enrollees regarding outpatient contraceptive services. The effective date for these amendments is for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1998. SEC. 5 of the Public Health Service Act adds new standards for contraceptive benefits in the individual market, aligning with existing regulations for group health plans. The effective date for these amendments is January 1, 1998."
