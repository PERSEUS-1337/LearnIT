    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act\". Congress finds that approximately 500 bird species in the United States migrate to Latin America and the Caribbean, providing valuable benefits. Many of these species are declining due to habitat loss and pollution. Conservation efforts require collaboration among countries along their migration routes. Conservation efforts for migratory birds require collaboration among countries along their migration routes and can be strengthened by increased coordination. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of neotropical migratory birds, support conservation initiatives in the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and provide financial resources for international cooperation.
