The western basin of Lake Erie is crucial to the economic and environmental future of the United States. Efforts have been made to restore water quality and fisheries in the Great Lakes, with a focus on the ecosystem approach. The Detroit River contributes 90% of the flow to the western basin. The western basin of Lake Erie, receiving 90% of its flow from the Detroit River, is a vital ecosystem supporting diverse plant and wildlife species. It boasts the largest concentration of marshes in Lake Erie and is home to over 300 species of plants, including 37 significant species. The western basin of Lake Erie is home to a large concentration of marshes, wetland complexes, and important waterfowl habitat. Various bird species use these wetlands for migration, nesting, and feeding, making it a major stopover for diving ducks during their fall migration. Lake Erie's western basin is internationally important for bird migration, fishing, boating, and tourism, with the Ottawa and Cedar Point National Wildlife Refuges showcasing its significance. The area is renowned for walleye fishing, supporting a $2 billion sport fishing industry in Ohio. Coastal wetlands in the region attract migrating ducks and contribute to the local economy. The western basin of Lake Erie is crucial for bird migration, fishing, and tourism, with the Ottawa and Cedar Point National Wildlife Refuges highlighting its importance. The area is famous for walleye fishing, driving Ohio's $2 billion sport fishing industry. However, coastal wetlands in the region have been under intense pressure for 150 years, with significant reductions in wetland hectares due to development and human impact. Only around 5,000 hectares remain today, with the Michigan shoreline also experiencing a 62 percent reduction in coastal wetlands. The coastal wetlands at the mouth of the Raisin River in Monroe, Michigan have significantly decreased in size over the past 70 years, with only about 100 hectares remaining unaltered. Stressors like sediment and nutrient loadings, contaminants, and exotic species have degraded the quality of the remaining wetlands. Erosion of protective peninsula beach systems has exacerbated shoreline erosion and impacted breeding grounds. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Refuge Complex\" refers to the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge Complex, including Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge, West Sister Island National Wildlife Refuge, and Cedar Point National Wildlife Refuge. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The term \"International Refuge\" refers to the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. SEC. 4. EXPANSION OF BOUNDARIES. The boundaries of the Refuge Complex are expanded in Ohio and the southern boundary of the International Refuge is extended in Michigan. The Secretary may make boundary revisions as needed. The Secretary will keep a map of waters in Michigan east of Interstate Highway 75 available for inspection at United States Fish and Wildlife Service offices. SEC. 5 allows the Secretary to acquire lands within the Refuge Complex through donation, purchase, or exchange with owner consent. Federal properties within the Complex can be transferred to the Secretary's jurisdiction with approval. SEC. 6 addresses the administration of the Refuge Complex. The Secretary administers federally owned lands within the Refuge Complex in accordance with the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act. The Complex is managed for the primary purpose of providing habitats for migratory birds and wildlife, with additional purposes to strengthen resource management and conservation programs. The Refuge Complex aims to provide habitats for migratory birds and wildlife in the western basin of Lake Erie. It also focuses on conserving and restoring native aquatic and terrestrial communities, fostering partnerships with various organizations, and promoting public awareness of the area's resources. The United States and Canada, along with conservation organizations, work together to promote public awareness of the resources in the western basin of Lake Erie. They aim to advance goals established in the Great Lakes Strategy 2002, focusing on protecting and restoring the integrity of the Great Lakes basin ecosystem. The Secretary ensures opportunities for fish and wildlife recreation in accordance with the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act. The Secretary prioritizes hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, photography, and environmental education as public uses of the Refuge Complex. Cooperative agreements can be made with Ohio, Michigan, or other entities for managing non-Federal lands within the complex. Encouragement is given for Ohio to utilize existing greenway authorities for funding. The Secretary encourages Ohio to use existing greenway authorities for funding trails within the Refuge Complex. The Secretary will conduct a study of fish and wildlife habitat at dredge spoil disposal sites near the Maumee River. Appropriations are authorized for land acquisition, development, and the study."
