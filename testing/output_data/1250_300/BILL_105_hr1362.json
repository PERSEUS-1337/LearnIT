The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will jointly conduct a three-year demonstration project starting in 1998. The project involves reimbursing the Department of Veterans Affairs for healthcare services provided to targeted Medicare-eligible veterans. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to waive certain Medicare requirements for this project. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will designate up to three geographic service areas for facilities to participate in a demonstration project. The selection plan will prioritize facilities suited to serve targeted Medicare-eligible veterans due to high demand for their services. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will designate up to three geographic service areas for facilities to participate in a demonstration project. Facilities must meet specific criteria, including high demand from targeted Medicare-eligible veterans, billing capability, quality care indicators, and proximity to closed military medical facilities. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 and Title II of the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act outline the voluntary participation and cost-sharing requirements for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans in a demonstration project. Payments received under the project will be credited to the Department of Veterans Affairs medical appropriation. SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNTS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for services under a demonstration project at 95% of Medicare payment rates. Payments will be made periodically from Medicare trust funds. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for services under a demonstration project at 95% of Medicare payment rates, with payments made periodically from Medicare trust funds. The annual limit for Medicare payments to the VA for the project is $50,000,000. Payment amounts may be reduced if the VA fails to maintain efforts to avoid shifting costs onto the Medicare program for hospital care and medical services for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans. The payment amounts for a project for Medicare-eligible veterans may be reduced if the actual VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans are less than the maintenance of effort level. The maintenance of effort level is determined based on the previous fiscal year's expenditures or the VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans in fiscal year 1997. The payment amounts for a project for Medicare-eligible veterans may be adjusted based on the percentage change in the medical care appropriation for the Department of Veterans Affairs compared to the previous fiscal year. Additionally, adjustments may be made based on changes in VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans and the delivery of services to targeted Medicare-eligible veterans. The curr_chunk discusses the increase in health care costs and the reduction in priority in delivering services to targeted Medicare-eligible veterans due to legislative amendments. It defines VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans as the amount spent by the Department of Veterans Affairs on hospital care and medical services for these individuals. The curr_chunk discusses monitoring expenditures for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans under a demonstration project to ensure no increase in costs to the Medicare program. The Secretaries, in consultation with the Comptroller General, will closely monitor these expenditures compared to what would have been spent without the project. The Comptroller General will audit the costs of the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Medicare program annually during the demonstration project. If expenditures increase due to the project, the Secretaries will take necessary steps to recoup the costs for the Medicare program. During a fiscal year, if program expenditures increase due to a demonstration project, the Secretaries will recoup the amount for the Medicare program and take steps to prevent future increases. This includes using the Department of Veterans Affairs' medical care appropriation to cover the increased costs and potentially suspending or terminating the project. SEC. 4. EVALUATION AND REPORTS. The Secretaries will arrange for an independent entity to evaluate the health services demonstration project annually. The entity will submit a report to the Secretaries and Congress by March 1 each year, assessing the cost of care, quality compliance, and cost comparisons of participating facilities. The Secretaries will evaluate the health services demonstration project annually, comparing quality compliance and costs of participating facilities. A report will be submitted to Congress with recommendations on extending or making the project permanent. The Secretaries will submit a report to Congress within six months of the final report on whether to extend or make permanent the health services demonstration project, expand it to cover more sites and increase reimbursement amounts, and continue or modify project terms. Additionally, by March 1, 1999, they will report on the feasibility of establishing a new demonstration project to reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for health care services for targeted medicare-eligible veterans in managed health-care plans. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"demonstration project,\" \"geographic service area,\" \"Medicare program,\" and \"Secretary.\" The Social Security Act defines terms like \"Secretary\" and \"targeted medicare-eligible veteran\" as an individual who is a veteran entitled to Medicare benefits with a specific income range.
