    "content": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a regional free trade agreement among 12 Pacific-facing nations, pending congressional approval. It aims to liberalize trade in goods and services, including agricultural products, potentially benefiting U.S. food and agricultural exports. Foreign demand for U.S. food and fiber contributes to higher commodity prices and farm income, with positive effects extending to rural communities. Foreign demand for U.S. food and fiber, including soybeans, cotton, almonds, pecans, pistachios, and walnuts, contributes to higher commodity prices and farm income. This positive impact extends to rural communities, farm input industries, and commodity processors. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) aims to liberalize trade in agricultural products among 12 Pacific-facing nations, with U.S. agricultural exports to TPP countries averaging $63.5 billion between 2011 and 2015. The TPP agreement reached in October 2015 would improve market access for U.S. food and agricultural products, enhancing competitiveness in TPP markets. The trade deal would also provide TPP partners with greater access to U.S. product markets, potentially increasing competition. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued a report in May 2016 on the projected economic impact of the agreement on the U.S. economy, specific industry sectors, including agriculture and food, and consumers. The TPP agreement reached in October 2015 would improve market access for U.S. food and agricultural products, enhancing competitiveness in TPP markets. The text below identifies four considerations about the TPP agreement that are particularly relevant for U.S. food and agriculture. The report summarizes key conclusions of the projected effects of implementing TPP for U.S. food and agriculture based on analysis undertaken by ITC and the American Farm Bureau Federation. This is followed by a partial snapshot of some of the higher-profile changes in market access for agricultural products in the agreement, a summary of selected provisions beyond market access that are of particular interest to stakeholders in food and agriculture, a brief overview of industry reactions to the agreement, and a review of what actions need to occur for the agreement to enter into force for the United States. An overarching consideration is that among significant TPP markets, the United States lacks free trade agreements (FTAs) with five TPP countries: Brunei, Japan, Malaysia. The United States lacks free trade agreements with five TPP countries: Brunei, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Vietnam. Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia offer the greatest potential for boosting U.S. farm and food exports due to higher tariffs compared to the U.S. In 2014, applied MFN tariffs on agricultural products averaged 5.1% in the United States, 9.3% in Malaysia, 14.3% in Japan, and 16.3% in Vietnam. MFN tariffs on agricultural products are higher in Malaysia, Japan, and Vietnam compared to the United States. Japan is seen as a significant market opportunity in the TPP due to its protected farm and food markets. Vietnam is also considered a potential growth market. The TPP would provide wider access to markets in Canada and Mexico, potentially impacting U.S. rice growers. The TPP agreement would open up opportunities for U.S. agricultural exports, but concerns exist about potential competition and phased-in access to markets like Japan, Canada, and Vietnam. Safeguard measures could be implemented for certain products if import thresholds are exceeded. If the U.S. does not join the TPP, its agricultural export competitors could benefit. The TPP agreement aims to increase opportunities for U.S. agricultural exports, but concerns arise regarding competition and market access in countries like Japan, Canada, and Vietnam. Safeguard measures may be applied if import thresholds are surpassed. If the U.S. opts out of the TPP, its agricultural export rivals could gain an advantage through existing tariff agreements or by joining similar trade deals without U.S. involvement. This could potentially impact U.S. beef exports to Japan, where Australia currently enjoys preferential tariff rates. Additionally, the European Union is pursuing FTAs with Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam, which could enhance its competitiveness in those markets. The implications of \"Brexit\" on these negotiations remain uncertain. The TPP agreement aims to increase opportunities for U.S. agricultural exports, with concerns about competition and market access in countries like Japan, Canada, and Vietnam. The impact of \"Brexit\" on these negotiations is uncertain. The TPP does not address domestic subsidy regimes, which are typically handled in multilateral trade negotiations. A report by the ITC in May 2016 projected significant benefits for U.S. agriculture under the TPP, including higher agricultural exports by $7.2 billion in year 15 (2032). The ITC report projects TPP outcomes for U.S. agriculture in year 15 (2032), showing a $7.2 billion increase in agricultural exports and a $2.7 billion increase in imports. U.S. dairy product exports would rise by $1.85 billion, while processed foods and beef would also see gains. The majority of export gains are expected from Japan and Vietnam. The U.S. saw an increase of $349 million, or 10.3% in exports, mainly due to lower tariffs and expanded TRQs. The total increase of $7.2 billion was concentrated in Japan ($3.6 billion) and Vietnam ($3.3 billion). The American Farm Bureau Federation supports TPP, estimating a $4.4 billion boost in U.S. farm income annually once fully implemented. Stakeholders in food and agriculture broadly support TPP, but not universally. The agreement would impact market access for various agricultural commodities and food products. The TPP agreement would affect market access for a broad range of agricultural commodities and food products. Japan would lower tariffs on beef from 38.5% to 27.5% in year one, with further reductions to 9% by year 16. Vietnam would eliminate tariffs on beef products over three to eight years. The U.S. would eliminate tariffs on beef and beef products in no more than 15 years. Japan would lower tariffs on various beef products, Vietnam would eliminate tariffs over three to eight years, and the United States would eliminate tariffs on beef and beef products within 15 years. Japan would immediately reduce tariffs on pork cuts and gradually phase out residual tariffs over nine years. Vietnam would eliminate tariffs on pork within 10 years, while the United States would immediately eliminate most tariffs. Canada would allow incremental increases in access to its poultry market. In the TPP agreement, Vietnam would eliminate tariffs on pork and pork products within 10 years, while the United States would immediately eliminate most tariffs. Canada would allow incremental increases in access to its poultry and egg markets over five years. Dairy markets would also be opened to greater import competition, with Canada allowing additional access to its dairy product markets phased in over five years. Under the TPP agreement, Canada would gradually increase access to its highly protected dairy markets by 3.25% of its output over five years. This additional access would be open to all TPP countries and include products like fluid milk, butter, cheese, and yogurt. Japan and the United States would also eliminate tariffs on certain dairy products over time. Under the TPP agreement, Canada would gradually increase access to its highly protected dairy markets by 3.25% of its output over five years. This additional access would be open to all TPP countries and include products like fluid milk, butter, cheese, and yogurt. Japan and the United States would also eliminate tariffs on certain dairy products over time. Additionally, the agreement includes provisions for corn and corn products, with Japan creating a new quota for U.S. corn and potato starch, and Vietnam and Malaysia eliminating tariffs on corn products. Soybeans and soybean products would also see tariff reductions under the agreement. Under the TPP agreement, tariffs on various agricultural products would be gradually eliminated or reduced. Japan would eliminate tariffs on soybean meal and soybean oil over time, while Vietnam and Malaysia would immediately eliminate tariffs on soybean products. For wheat, Japan would lower government-imposed markups on in-quota wheat and establish a new duty-free quota for U.S. wheat. Japan would establish new duty-free quotas for U.S. wheat and processed wheat products, with progressively lower markups over time. Vietnam and Malaysia would eliminate tariffs on soybean products immediately, while Japan would gradually reduce tariffs on barley and barley products under the TPP agreement. Japan would establish a new TPP-wide TRQ for barley, with a progressive reduction in markup over nine years. They would also eliminate tariffs on feed barley and create duty-free quotas for U.S. unroasted and roasted malt. Additionally, Japan would establish a duty-free quota for U.S. rice, with an increase over time, but still below what the U.S. rice industry had sought. The TPP agreement includes provisions for rice, cotton, and tree nuts. Japan would eliminate tariffs on rice imports, while U.S. tariffs on rice products would be phased out. Vietnam would eliminate tariffs on cotton within four years and on tree nuts within three years. Japan would immediately eliminate tariffs on certain nuts, while the U.S. would phase out tariffs on nuts within five years. In the TPP agreement, Vietnam would eliminate tariffs on walnuts and almonds within three years. U.S. tariffs on fresh or dried nuts would be eliminated within five years, while tariffs on prepared or preserved nuts would be phased out within 10 years. Japan would reduce tariffs on oranges over six to eight years and eliminate tariffs on grapefruit in six years. Tariffs on orange juice and grapefruit juice would be phased out in eight and six years, respectively. In the TPP agreement, tariffs on various fruits would be reduced or eliminated over different timeframes. Japan would reduce tariffs on oranges over six to eight years and eliminate tariffs on grapefruit in six years. Tariffs on orange juice and grapefruit juice would be phased out in eight and six years, respectively. Japan's tariffs on fresh apples and cherries would also be reduced and eliminated over time. Vietnam and Malaysia would eliminate tariffs on various fruits within two to three years. The TPP agreement includes reductions in tariffs on various fruits over different timeframes. Japan would reduce tariffs on oranges and eliminate tariffs on grapefruit over six to eight years. Tariffs on orange juice and grapefruit juice would be phased out in eight and six years, respectively. Vietnam and Malaysia would eliminate tariffs on various fruits within two to three years. Additionally, the United States would make changes to its sugar market, including establishing new TRQs for sugar and sugar-containing products totaling 86,300 tons annually. Australia and Canada would receive new duty-free quotas, with the potential for expansion in the future. This could potentially impact Mexican sugar exports to the United States. The TPP agreement includes reductions in tariffs on various products. Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the United States would make changes to their sugar and tobacco markets. Japan would expand access to its market for sugar and sweetener-related products. Tariffs on tobacco would be eliminated over different timeframes for various countries. Vietnam would create a TRQ for unmanufactured tobacco imports and eliminate tariffs on tobacco leaf over time. Vietnam would increase unmanufactured tobacco imports by 25 tons annually with no limit after year 21. Tariffs on unmanufactured tobacco and tobacco leaf would be eliminated over 11 and 21 years, respectively. Tariffs on blended tobacco, cigars, and other products would be removed over 16 years. A controversy arose over a provision allowing countries to deny ISDS protections to tobacco manufacturers for claims on tobacco control measures. USDA has detailed how the agreement addresses market access for various farm commodities and food products under the TPP. The TPP agreement addresses trade measures beyond tariffs and TRQs that are important for producers and exporters of food and agricultural products. Provisions in the agreement cover rules of origin, SPS, agricultural biotechnology, GIs, export programs, and TBT. Only goods of TPP origin can benefit from preferential tariff rates and TRQs. The TPP agreement specifies criteria for determining TPP origin of agricultural products, including plants, animals, and marine life. A de minimis provision allows for non-TPP content up to 10% of the transactional value, with exceptions for certain agricultural goods like dairy products. The TPP agreement allows for non-TPP content up to 10% of the transactional value, with exceptions for certain agricultural goods like dairy products, edible oil-bearing crops, citrus juices, and fruit. The agreement also addresses non-tariff barriers such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures. The TPP agreement addresses non-tariff barriers, specifically sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS), which go beyond WTO agreements in areas like risk assessment, transparency, and rapid response. It includes obligations to base measures on international standards or scientific evidence, allow for public comment, and provide rapid notification of import restrictions. SPS disputes are to be resolved through technical consultations among TPP countries. The TPP agreement requires rapid notification of import restrictions within seven days. SPS disputes are to be resolved through technical consultations, with the option of turning to dispute settlement procedures if necessary. Signatories must increase transparency on laws related to agricultural biotechnology products and share information on low-level presence incidents. Importers and exporters commit to exchanging information to minimize disruptions to trade. A working group on agricultural biotechnology is established within the TPP Committee on Agricultural Trade. The TPP agreement establishes a working group on agricultural biotechnology to exchange information on national laws and policies affecting trade in biotech products. Parties are not obligated to change existing laws. Geographical Indications (GIs) protect the quality and reputation of products from specific regions, such as Parmesan cheese and Champagne. GIs have become a point of controversy in international trade. Geographical Indications (GIs) protect products like Parmesan cheese and Champagne, causing controversy in international trade. GIs can be exclusive, like \"feta\" in the EU, affecting trade agreements like the TPP. The TPP agreement outlines procedures for recognizing and objecting to Geographical Indications (GIs) among member parties. Criteria for opposing a GI include potential confusion with trademarks, pending applications, or customary terms in a country's language. For wines and spirits, GIs are not required to be recognized if they match a grape variety's customary name in a party's territory. The agreement also considers international agreements on GI protection involving TPP members. The TPP agreement outlines procedures for recognizing and objecting to Geographical Indications (GIs) among member parties. Criteria for opposing a GI include potential confusion with trademarks, pending applications, or customary terms in a country's language. The agreement also considers international agreements on GI protection involving TPP members. Additionally, signatories commit to eliminating export subsidies and cooperating on developing multilateral disciplines around export credits, credit guarantees, and insurance programs. The TPP agreement focuses on cooperation in developing multilateral disciplines around export credits, credit guarantees, and insurance programs. It also aims to limit restrictions on exports of food and agricultural products to 6 months, with consultation required for restrictions lasting more than 12 months. The agreement includes provisions for technical barriers to trade, with a specific annex for wines and distilled spirits outlining labeling and certification parameters. The TPP agreement establishes parameters for labeling and certification of products, including common definitions for wine and distilled spirits. It also addresses proprietary formulas for prepackaged foods and food additives, emphasizing the protection of commercial interests and confidentiality of information. Additionally, it encourages cooperation among TPP members regarding organic production and certification to improve international guidelines. The TPP agreement encourages cooperation among members on organic production and certification. Various food and agricultural organizations have expressed support for the TPP agreement since its issuance on November 5, 2015. Various food and agricultural organizations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation, American Feed Industry Association, American Soybean Association, and others, have expressed support for the TPP agreement. Agricultural Technical Advisory Committees also endorsed the TPP, with the ATAC for Trade in Fruits and Vegetables highlighting benefits for growers, packers, and marketers. The ATAC for Trade in Fruits and Vegetables strongly endorsed the TPP agreement, with members from various agricultural organizations expressing support for benefits to growers, packers, and marketers. The ATAC for Trade in Sweeteners and Sweetener Products also unanimously viewed the TPP as meeting negotiating objectives. The ATAC for Trade in Processed Foods praised new market access opportunities but did not outright endorse the TPP. The ATAC for Trade in Processed Foods praised aspects of the TPP agreement, citing new market access opportunities for processed food exports and enhanced SPS commitments. However, criticisms include dairy product TRQs from Canada and Japan not providing meaningful access, and objections to the product-specific exception for tobacco products in dispute settlement. Groups opposing TPP include the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association, National Farmers Union, R-CALF USA, U.S. Rice Producers Association, and UFCW. UFCW faults the agreement for lacking an enforcement mechanism against currency manipulation, leading to job losses. USA Rice has not taken a position in support. USA Rice, among other agricultural groups, has not taken a stance on the TPP agreement. Trade ministers signed the agreement on February 4, 2016, but Congress must pass implementing legislation for it to take effect. There is no time limit for Congress to act on the agreement, but once implementing legislation is introduced, Congress has up to 90 days to vote on it without amendments."
