    "content": "The 109th Congress is considering legislation to reauthorize the block grant of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) for five years. The program has received multiple short-term extensions since its original funding authority expired in 2002. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to extend basic TANF funding at current levels through FY2010 and include President Bush's proposal for marriage promotion grants. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to extend basic TANF funding at current levels through FY2010 and include President Bush's proposal for marriage promotion grants. S. 667 would add $6 billion over five years to current levels of mandatory child care funding, while H.R. 240 would add $1 billion over five years. The major difference between the two bills is that S. 667 would completely revamp the TANF contingency funds. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to extend basic TANF funding at current levels through FY2010. S. 667 would revamp the TANF contingency funds, while H.R. 240 would make minor revisions. The basic TANF block grant and maintenance of effort requirements have not been adjusted for inflation. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to continue basic TANF funding at current levels through FY2010. Supplemental grants are provided to 17 states totaling $319 million per year, and both bills would maintain these grants for the same states. Supplemental grants totaling $319 million per year are provided to 17 states including Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 would continue these grants at the current funding level through FY2009. The TANF contingency fund is designed to provide extra matching grants to states during economic downturns, with H.R. 240 maintaining the fund on existing rules and S. 667 revamping it. S. 667 proposes changes to TANF contingency fund requirements, eliminating certain spending and matching requirements. It also revises criteria for economic need in states. Federal TANF grants can be used for various benefits and services to assist low-income families. Grants can also be transferred to other block grant programs, with limits on transfers to specific programs. The TANF grants can be transferred to other block grant programs, with limits on transfers to specific programs. Both bills propose changes to ease rules regarding TANF fund usage, including allowing states to use carryover funds for any TANF benefit and service. The bills also aim to narrow the definition of \"assistance\" to exclude child care and transportation aid. The bills aim to narrow the definition of \"assistance\" under TANF, excluding child care and transportation aid. They incorporate the \"universal engagement\" proposal, requiring states to develop self-sufficiency plans for adult recipients. Both bills also propose raising work participation standards from 50% to 70% and providing partial credit for required hours of work. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to revise TANF work participation standards by raising the required percentage from 50% to 70% and increasing the hours of work needed to receive full credit. They also propose providing partial credit for families that do not meet the full credit standard and revising the list of activities that count towards TANF standards. The bills differ in their approach to these changes, with current law requiring states to have a specified percentage of families participating in creditable work activities. The caseload reduction credit has significantly impacted participation standards, reducing the standard to 0% for 20 states in FY2003. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to raise the work participation standard for all families to 70% by FY2010 and eliminate the separate standard for two-parent families. H.R. 240 revises the caseload reduction credit by measuring caseload change from a more recent year, while S. 667 replaces the caseload reduction credit with a credit for employed welfare leavers starting in FY2008. S. 667 would replace the caseload reduction credit with a credit for employed welfare leavers starting in FY2008. It also sets a minimum effective standard of 10% in FY2006, increasing to 50% in FY2010. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 raise the hours standards, with H.R. 240 requiring a 40-hour workweek for full credit and providing partial credit for at least 24 hours of participation. No special lower-hour standard is provided for single parents with preschoolers in either bill. H.R. 240 and S. 667 both raise the hours standards for TANF work participation. H.R. 240 requires a 40-hour workweek for full credit, with partial credit for 24 hours of participation. S. 667 has lower hour requirements, with single parents with preschoolers needing 24 hours per week for full credit. Creditable activities include work, job search, vocational training, and community service. The proposed changes in H.R. 240 and S. 667 for TANF work participation standards differ significantly. H.R. 240 eliminates job search and vocational education as core activities, giving states more discretion in defining countable activities. Once the initial three months are completed, only work, on-the-job training, community service, or work experience would count towards meeting the standards. The proposed changes in H.R. 240 and S. 667 for TANF work participation standards differ significantly. H.R. 240 eliminates job search and vocational education as core activities, giving states more discretion in defining countable activities. Once the initial three months are completed, only work, on-the-job training, community service, or work experience would count towards meeting the standards. S. 667 retains the current law list of core activities and provides states additional discretion by permitting an expanded list of activities for three months in a 24-month period. This additional discretion is provided in addition to six weeks of job search and 12 months of vocational educational training, which are retained as \"core\" activities. Both H.R. 240 and S. 667 offer states more flexibility in defining countable activities for TANF work requirements. S. 667 includes options for education and rehabilitative activities, such as undergraduate education and treatment for drug and alcohol abuse. The bills S. 667 and H.R. 240 provide states with flexibility in defining TANF work requirements, including options for education, rehabilitation, and promoting marriage. They offer marriage promotion grants with $100 million in matching funds for activities aimed at ending dependency on government benefits and promoting two-parent families. The bills S. 667 and H.R. 240 offer $100 million in matching funds for marriage promotion activities, including public advertising campaigns, education in schools, marriage skills programs, and divorce education. Funds must be used primarily for marriage promotion, with 80% allocated to such activities. The bills S. 667 and H.R. 240 provide funding for marriage promotion activities, including education programs and mentoring. S. 667 includes provisions for consulting organizations familiar with domestic violence, clarifying voluntary participation, and prohibiting sanctions for non-participation. Both bills also make amendments to TANF provisions. H.R. 240 and S. 667 reauthorization bills include provisions for drug testing TANF applicants, additional special-purpose grants, assistance for teen parents, and amendments to TANF provisions. S. 667 also allows states to provide assistance for teen parents not living with an adult for up to 60 days. S. 667 and H.R. 240 reauthorization bills include provisions for drug testing TANF applicants, special-purpose grants, and assistance for teen parents. S. 667 allows states to assist teen parents not living with an adult for up to 60 days to comply with the requirement to live in a supervised setting. Tribal welfare programs are also addressed, with increased funding for tribal work programs and grants to enhance tribal capacity to operate TANF programs. H.R. 240 funds tribal TANF programs at current levels through FY2010 and makes tribal organizations eligible for TANF bonuses. Table 1 compares the TANF provisions of S. 667 and H.R. 240."
