    "content": "A state may apply to waive any or all of the ACA provisions listed below for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2017. Part I of Subtitle D of the ACA includes Sections 1301-1304 related to qualified health plans. Part II of Subtitle D includes Sections 1311-1313 related to health insurance exchanges. Section 1402 provides cost-sharing reductions, Section 36B provides premium tax credits, Section 4980H includes the employer mandate, and Section 5000A includes the individual mandate. The curr_chunk discusses the broad scope of provisions that can be waived under a state innovation waiver, including requirements for health plans to be certified as Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) and essential health benefits (EHB) packages. The Secretary of Health and Human Services reviews and grants waiver requests for provisions not included in the IRC, while the Secretary of the Treasury reviews and grants requests to waive provisions in the IRC related to premium tax credits and the employer mandate. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Secretary of the Treasury review and grant waiver requests for provisions not included in the IRC, such as premium tax credits and employer mandates. They assess state waiver applications based on coverage, affordability, comprehensiveness, and federal-deficit neutrality criteria. Waivers may be granted if they promote increased access to affordable private market coverage, sustainable spending growth, state innovation, support for those in need, and consumer-driven healthcare. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Treasury assess state waiver applications based on coverage, affordability, comprehensiveness, and federal-deficit neutrality criteria. Changes to Medicaid or CHIP that require approval outside of the waiver process are not considered in the assessment. This applies regardless of whether the state's application is submitted alone or in coordination with another waiver application. In October 2018, HHS and the Treasury updated guidance to support some federally facilitated health insurance exchange (FFE) variation. States can incorporate CMS's enrollment functionalities in waivers that require them to create their own website. States must work with HHS early in the waiver application process to determine feasible modifications and are responsible for funding all FFE modifications and operational support. States must work with HHS early in the waiver application process to determine feasible modifications for FFEs. States are responsible for funding all FFE modifications and associated operational support. Costs for FFE modifications are not considered for deficit neutrality, but changes to CMS administrative processes are. The IRS may not accommodate state-specific tax rule changes, but small changes to federal tax provisions may be feasible if they align with current IRS capabilities. States are responsible for funding all changes to IRS administrative processes related to waivers. Credit eligibility for individuals with household income under 100% of the federal poverty level may be feasible through a state innovation waiver. States must fund changes to IRS administrative processes for waiver implementation, which are assessed for deficit neutrality. Prior to submitting an application, a state must enact a law allowing for waiver actions, provide public notice and comment, and conduct public hearings. The Secretary of HHS transmits waiver applications to the Secretary of the Treasury for review. The state must submit a complete application to the Secretary of HHS for review, including information on state legislation, the plan or program to replace waived provisions, and analyses to meet waiver requirements. Incomplete applications will be notified for missing elements. Once deemed complete, the application will be made public for review and comment before a final decision by the Secretary or Secretaries. The final decision on a state's application for a waiver must be made within 180 days of receiving a complete application. Approved waivers may result in the state not receiving certain tax credits, but they will receive pass-through funding instead. The amount of pass-through funding is determined annually and can be adjusted as needed. The state innovation waiver, also known as pass-through funding, is determined annually by the appropriate Secretary and can be updated at any time. It must be used for implementing the plan or program established under the waiver, which cannot extend beyond five years without a request for continuation. The Secretaries must coordinate applications for state innovation waivers and other health care-related waivers under federal law, allowing states to submit a single application for multiple waivers. Under the coordinated process, states can submit a single application for a state innovation waiver and other applicable waivers. HHS and the Treasury assess state innovation waiver applications independently, without considering the impact of changes requiring separate federal approval. 14 states have submitted applications, with eight approvals so far. HHS and the Treasury have approved eight state innovation waiver applications from Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, and Wisconsin. Massachusetts, Ohio, and Vermont received incomplete application notifications. California, Iowa, and Oklahoma withdrew their applications."
