President Obama proposed to retain lower rates for lower- and middle-income taxpayers but increase rates for higher-income individuals. The tax rates were temporarily extended through 2012 and eventually resolved in 2013 with the American Taxpayer Relief Act. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-312) and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-240) resolved the tax rates for capital gains for higher-income individuals. The potential revenue gain from increasing capital gains taxes is influenced by behavioral responses assumed by the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Department of the Treasury. Different forecasts and assumptions led to varying estimates of revenue increases, with the Obama Administration estimating $16 billion in revenue in FY2019 from allowing the Bush tax cuts for capital gains to expire. The capital gains tax rate was 13.3% in 2008 and was projected to increase to 17.9% in 2019, resulting in a potential revenue difference of $40 billion. To address behavioral responses to tax increases on capital gains, some have proposed applying mark-to-market rules to tax gains as accrued, eliminating the realization response for affected assets. This approach, while complex, aims to understand the limits of behavioral assumptions in increasing taxes on realized capital gains. The behavioral response to changes in capital gains taxes can impact revenue projections. Realizations responses by revenue-estimating agencies were discussed in the late 1980s. The analysis suggests that current projections may underestimate revenue gains from allowing lower capital gains tax rates to expire. Concerns exist about potential revenue loss due to reduced realizations. Tax increases could lead to revenue loss if realizations are postponed. Economists and policymakers are concerned about potential revenue loss from capital gains taxes due to reduced realizations. Tax increases could lead to revenue loss if realizations are postponed, as there is an incentive to delay or avoid selling assets to escape taxes. Elasticities measure the response of realizations to tax changes, with higher values indicating smaller revenue gains or losses. A tax increase gains revenue if the elasticity is less than one, and loses revenue if the elasticity is greater than one. The elasticity of capital gains tax changes determines the revenue gain or loss. A higher elasticity results in smaller revenue changes. If the elasticity is less than one, a tax increase gains revenue; if it's greater than one, revenue is lost. Different types of elasticities, such as permanent, short-run, and transitory, measure realizations response to tax rate changes. The short-term and transitory elasticities measure responses to temporary tax changes. Taxpayers may shift realizations to take advantage of lower tax rates. These effects pose challenges in estimation and impact shorter-term responses to tax changes. The short-term response to a capital gains tax cut is often discussed in the context of taxpayers realizing gains due to lower tax rates. However, this response may be muted if there has been recent increases in realizations. Short-term responses may not apply to tax increases that are not pre-announced. The short-term response to a capital gains tax cut is often discussed in the context of taxpayers realizing gains due to lower tax rates. However, short-term responses may not apply to tax increases that are not pre-announced. Transitory responses can occur due to temporary changes in tax rates, with examples from 1986 and 2012. Higher-income taxpayers may experience fluctuations in income and taxes, leading to transitory responses even in years without changes in tax laws. In the period before 1987, individuals experiencing fluctuations in income and taxes due to capital gains may have transitory responses, especially when capital gains were subject to graduated rates. Elasticities of realizations responses are based on various functional forms, with the elasticity rising proportionally with the tax rate. The discussion in the 1990 debate focused on the 22% tax rate, and elasticities are expected to be negative but will be reported in absolute value. This formulation also determines the revenue-maximizing tax rate. The current report discusses capital gains realizations elasticities and the revenue-maximizing tax rate. It mentions the 22% tax rate as a starting point for tax increases, along with additional rates and the net investment income tax. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a 21.2% marginal tax rate for long-term capital gains. These issues do not apply to taxes on dividends, which are taxed at a slightly lower rate of 18.4%. In 1990, the George H. W. Bush Administration proposed to reduce the capital gains tax rate from 20% to 28%, treating capital gains as ordinary income. Revenue-estimating agencies began investigating realizations elasticities and including tax variables in forecasts. The Administration and JTC used different elasticities to estimate realizations response. In 1990, the issue of revenue cost was crucial. The Administration and JTC used different elasticities to estimate realizations response, with estimates varying dramatically from 0.3 to almost 4. An elasticity of 0.3 would imply a 70% revenue gain with a small tax rate increase, while an elasticity of 4 would result in a loss three times the projected revenue gain. Estimates of realizations response elasticity varied widely, from 0.3 to 3.8 based on individual taxpayer data. The range of estimated responses raised concerns about the reliability of estimation methods, with the JCT favoring time series results. Researchers faced challenges in estimating realizations response, with individual data preferred over aggregation to avoid bias and information loss. The challenges in estimating realizations response include difficulties in distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses, controlling for changing factors over time, and individuals timing realizations to coincide with low tax rates. Panel data studies were suggested to separate elasticities, as relying on simple cross-section results for permanent responses was not feasible. Panel data studies attempted to separate elasticities by examining individual tax rates over several years. These studies reported smaller but still significant elasticities, influencing the Treasury to choose a larger elasticity. However, the issue of transitory effects was not fully addressed, as periods of lower or higher income could persist for several years. Although panel studies offered some control over transitory effects, the available panels were limited to a few years. The proposed tax cuts were not enacted at that time, although they were eventually reduced in 1997 and again in 2003. Researchers focused on producing more precise estimates for evaluating capital gains taxes, influenced by the spike in realizations in 1986. Researchers focused on producing more precise estimates for evaluating capital gains taxes, influenced by the spike in realizations in 1986. The sharp increase in realizations in 1986, following a tax increase for the following years, raised concerns about transitory responses in econometric studies. Multiple academic studies since 1990 have examined realizations responses, with estimates provided by CBO, JCT, and Treasury. The table includes estimates of practices by CBO, JCT, and Treasury for projecting capital gains realizations. CBO's estimate is part of a statistical study with various variables. The coefficient in the second column of Table 1 produces the elasticity when multiplied by the tax rate. Gravelle's study highlighted a limit to realizations response, noting that realizations cannot exceed accruals. The study analyzed the ratio of realizations to accruals over a long period and found an upper limit of 0.5 for the realizations elasticity. This limit suggests that individuals would sell every asset every year in the absence of taxes and transaction costs, but in reality, the elasticity is likely lower due to various factors. The study covered data from 1954 to 1989 and provided insights into the behavior of investors regarding asset sales. The study conducted in 1991 analyzed the realizations to accruals ratio, estimating it at 46% with a tax rate of 18.4%. Recent evidence from 1989-2013 showed a similar ratio of 48% and a tax rate of 17.3%, supporting the initial findings. Panel studies suggested that without taxes and costs, realizations could increase significantly, but corrections were made to address transitory issues. The panel studies in the 1980s corrected the elasticity to 3.2, similar to cross-section results. Burman and Randolph's study used state tax rates to estimate elasticity, finding a small permanent elasticity and a large transitory elasticity. Auerbach and Siegel replicated the approach with similar results. Most subsequent studies incorporated state tax rates, with Auten and Joulfaian and Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen having the highest elasticities. The Auten and Joulfaian study and the Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study had the highest elasticities among panel studies. They added state tax rates and had a longer panel, which likely affected their estimates. The Dowd, McCLeeland, and Muthitacharoen study also conducted sensitivity analysis, producing a wide range of estimates. The estimates for elasticities in different studies varied based on time periods and variables included. Time series studies showed a range of coefficients, with some falling within the range of studies from the 1980s. Adding more years to the data tended to result in lower elasticities. Some studies used data from outside the United States, such as an Australian study. State studies also provided insights, with some having higher elasticities due to longer panels and additional variables. The third time series study, based on Australian data, and two state studies by Bogart and Gentry and Bakija and Gentry, used aggregate data over time grouped by state. Results slightly exceeded the upper limit of the Gravelle study. Bakija and Gentry emphasized the importance of controlling for state fixed effects. Elasticities in Table 1 were lower and closer together compared to studies from the 1980s. JCT's current coefficient is similar to the estimate from the 1990 debate. Treasury estimate has been reduced to a similar magnitude as the JCT assumption. The Treasury estimate has been reduced to a similar magnitude as the JCT assumption for raising the tax rate on capital gains by five percentage points in 2019. The revenue gain ranges from a reduction of 26% to 97% of the static gain, based on CBO projections and elasticities. The revenue gain from a five-percentage-point tax rate increase on capital gains ranges from $31.4 billion to $1 billion per year, with potential for adopting accrual-based taxation methods. The Auten and Joulfaian panel study is considered reliable despite some transitory elasticity effects. The Auten and Joulfaian panel study, Dowd, McClellan, and Muthitacharoen study, and Eichner and Sinai results suggest that the elasticity of a tax rate increase on capital gains is likely below 0.5. This indicates that revenue-estimating assumptions from the 1990 debate may underestimate the revenue gain. The elasticity of a tax rate increase on capital gains is likely below 0.5, indicating that revenue-estimating assumptions from the 1990 debate may underestimate the revenue gain. Post-1980s econometric studies and the limits study show revenue gains from a five percentage point tax rate increase, with potential gains three times larger than projected by the JCT. The JCT's projections may likely understate revenue gains from increasing capital gains tax rates. The elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes can be estimated using a semi-log function. The revenue equation is R = tAe -bt, where R is revenue, t is the tax rate, A is a constant, and b is the tax rate coefficient. The revenue maximizing tax rate can be calculated using the formula (1/b), where b is the tax rate coefficient. The look-back method adjusts basis to achieve the same net on a sale as accrual taxation. The growth rate can be determined using the formula g = (S/B) (1/T) -1. To determine the growth rate g, the formula is g = (S/B) (1/T) -1. To find a value of B* for the same return as accrual taxation, the formula is B* = [B(1+ ((S/B) 1/T -1)(1-t)) T -S(1-t)]/t. Appendix B discusses elasticities in studies of the 1980s relating to capital gains realizations and tax rates. The studies in this report analyze capital gains realizations at a 22% tax rate, categorized by different approaches. Challenges arise in statistical studies linking capital gains to tax rates, with debates on data types: aggregate time series vs. individual taxpayer data. Results show aggregate time series with smaller, consistent estimates (0.3 to 0.9), while individual data varied (0.55 to almost 4). Individual data is preferred due to loss of information and potential bias in aggregate data. The use of individual data is preferred over aggregate data in analyzing capital gains realizations due to the loss of information and potential bias. Challenges arise in studies linking capital gains to tax rates, with debates on data types and econometric problems such as the effective capital gains tax rate being an endogenous variable. Different techniques could be used to address these issues. The effective capital gains tax rate, often considered an exogenous variable in regression analysis, is actually endogenous and influenced by realizations. Various techniques can be used to address this econometric issue, such as using different tax rate measures or instrumental variables methods. Endogeneity problems are more severe in individual cross-section data compared to aggregate time series data. Timing realizations to coincide with low tax periods is common, especially among high-income individuals. The problem of distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses in tax rates due to fluctuating income, especially for high-income individuals. Attempts to address this issue with panel studies by averaging tax rates over multiple years may not fully correct for the transitory effect. Studies since the 1980s have examined realizations and tax rates, with some using different specifications to replicate previous studies. The Slemrod and Shobe (1990) study replicates previous studies on tax elasticities using a six-year small panel. They found large elasticities, confirming potential issues with previous studies. However, their methodology has been largely rejected, so their results are excluded from the main analysis. The study by Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) extends previous research on tax elasticities by using different approaches and instruments. They found that using an instrumental variables technique and the maximum tax rate as an instrument increased the coefficient and elasticity values. The results are excluded from the main analysis due to methodological concerns. The study by Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) suggested using the maximum tax rate as an instrument to increase coefficient and elasticity values. They also argued for differencing the data to capture short-term effects and extended the time period through 1989, finding varying estimates for elasticities based on different instruments. The study by Burman and Randolph (1994) innovatively separated permanent and transitory effects using state tax rate variations in a short panel from 1979-1983. They highlighted issues with using the maximum tax rate as an instrument due to changes in the law over time, leading to varying impacts on taxpayers. Burman and Randolph (1994) conducted an innovative study from 1979-1983, separating permanent and transitory effects using state tax rate variations. They estimated an elasticity of 0.18 at an 18% tax rate and 0.22 at a 22% tax rate, with a statistically insignificant effect. Their study introduced a transitory element by including the first dollar current tax rate in their instruments. Several subsequent studies, including Bogart and Gentry (1995) and Auerbach and Siegel (2000), used state tax rate variations to analyze permanent responses. Bogart and Gentry reported an elasticity of 0.65, while Auerbach and Siegel found an elasticity of 0.33. The tax rates used in these studies were around 22-25%. The tax rate is estimated to be around 25%. Auerbach and Siegel found a coefficient of 1.126, suggesting an elasticity of 0.25 at a 22% rate. They also reported a higher permanent elasticity of 1.75, attributing it to the inclusion of the current first dollar rate. The coefficient reported in Table 1 by Auerbach and Siegel is 1.126, indicating a larger elasticity due to the permanent tax rate. Eichner and Sinai's study extends time series analysis through 1997, with a coefficient of 2.28 when excluding 1986, and 2.18 when both 1986 and 1997 are excluded. Different specifications yield varying coefficients, with an instrumental variables method resulting in an estimate of 3.8. Excluding 1997 leads to a coefficient of 5.13. The analysis by Auten and Joulfaian (2004) uses a longer micro-data panel to estimate permanent and transitory effects, with elasticities ranging from 0.83 to 1.46. They include state tax rates but do not use them to identify permanent effects. The coefficient reported in Table 1 is 2.28. The analysis by Auten and Joulfaian (2004) uses a longer micro-data panel to estimate permanent and transitory effects, with elasticities ranging from 0.83 to 1.46. They find an elasticity of 0.72 at a 20% tax rate, indicating a coefficient of 3.6, and an elasticity of 0.79 at a 22% tax rate. Evans (2009) conducted a cross-section regression study with elasticities typically between 2 and 5, using public use file data. The main reservation about this study is the recognized shortcomings of cross-section studies. Bakija and Gentry (2014) use a 50-year panel of state data with state- and time-fixed effects. Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen (2015) use a 10-year panel for their study. The study by Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen (2015) examines the effects of omitting state-fixed effects and year-fixed effects on raising elasticities. It includes year-fixed effects to control for transitory effects from law changes. Minas, Lim, and Evans (2018) conduct an aggregate time series study using Australian data from 1988 to 2015, with controls for GDP, inflation, and the stock market index. The curr_chunk discusses studies on GDP, inflation, and the stock market index, with citations to studies from the 1980s on capital gains taxation and tax reform.
