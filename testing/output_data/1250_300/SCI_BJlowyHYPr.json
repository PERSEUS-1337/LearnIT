It utilizes a Dynamic Point-cloud Convolution (D-Conv) operator to extract local spatial features from neighboring points, maintaining permutation invariance and representing neighboring correlations. This operator can be easily integrated into traditional LSTM architectures for spatiotemporal predictive learning. CloudLSTM is a novel recurrent neural model for forecasting point-cloud streams, applied to mobile service traffic and air quality indicator forecasting. It outperforms other neural network models in accuracy, operating on irregular and unordered sets of points with complex spatial correlations. The proposed approach focuses on forecasting point-cloud streams, which operate on irregular and unordered sets of points with complex spatial correlations. Unlike traditional LSTM models, convolution-based RNN models like ConvLSTM and PredRNN++ are not suitable for handling scattered point-cloud data. The approach involves forecasting directly over point-cloud data streams without pre-processing, offering a new method for geospatial data stream forecasting. The proposed PointCNN leverages spatial-local correlations of point clouds, irrespective of input order. CloudLSTM architecture, utilizing the DConv operator, enables precise forecasting over point-cloud streams by combining Seq2seq learning and attention mechanisms.

The dataset used for the study is fully anonymized and does not contain personal information. It includes mobile service traffic information at the antenna level. The raw data cannot be made public due to a confidentiality agreement. The analysis considered 38 different services, with streaming being the dominant type of traffic, accounting for almost half of the total consumption. Other services like web, cloud, social media, and chat also consume significant fractions of mobile traffic. The air quality dataset from 43 cities in China, collected by Microsoft Research, contains 2,891,393 records from 437 monitoring stations over a year. Stations are divided into two clusters based on location. Missing data was filled through interpolation. The dataset can be accessed at a provided link. Evaluation of forecasting accuracy for mobile services using Attention CloudLSTMs shows similar performance across cities at both service and category levels. The MAE evaluation on mobile service accuracy shows that services with higher traffic volume tend to have higher prediction errors due to more frequent fluctuations. RNN-based models for air quality forecasting also exhibit increasing errors over time, with larger K values improving the robustness of CloudLSTM models.

Visualizing the hidden features of the CloudLSTM provides insights into the knowledge learned by the model, with scatter distributions showing spatial correlations in the data. The evaluation of NO2 forecasting examples in City Cluster A and B by RNN-based models shows the superior performance of Attention Cloud-LSTMs in capturing trends and delivering high long-term visual fidelity. The DConv model in Cluster B uses Sigmoid functions to regularize coordinate features for improved prediction accuracy. The CloudLSTM model, utilizing DConv and LSTM structures, excels in forecasting NO2 levels in Cluster B by refining the positions of input points, even with outlier points identified by DBSCAN. The model consistently achieves low prediction errors, as demonstrated in Table 4. The DBSCAN algorithm identifies 16 outlier points, located far from the point-cloud center. The CloudLSTM model shows the lowest prediction error compared to other models, including CloudCNN with DConv operator. Experiments are conducted with controlled scenarios, randomly selecting 10 outliers and moving their positions away from the center. The CloudLSTM model performs well in forecasting over inliers and outliers, regardless of the distance to outliers. It outperforms the PointLSTM model significantly. Comparisons with simple baselines using MLPs and LSTMs with different input forms are also conducted. The CloudLSTM model outperforms MLPs and LSTMs in forecasting by considering local spatial dependencies through DConv kernels and merging global spatial dependency. The number of neighbors K affects the receptive field of each model, with a small K relying on limited local spatial dependencies and a large K looking around larger location spaces. The results show that K does not significantly affect the performance of baselines, while the CloudLSTM model excels in capturing both local and global spatial correlations. The proposed CloudLSTM model, which captures local spatial dependencies through DConv kernels and global spatial dependency through time steps and layers, outperforms simple baselines in forecasting. Seasonal information in mobile traffic data can be utilized to enhance forecasting performance, but directly inputting data spanning multiple days is impractical due to the large sequence length. To efficiently capture seasonal information, 30-minute sequences are concatenated with a sub-sampled 7-day window to create an input with a manageable length of 90. By incorporating seasonal information in forecasting models using a sub-sampled 7-day window, performance is improved. However, this increases input length and model complexity. Future work aims to fuse seasonal information more efficiently with minimal complexity increase."
