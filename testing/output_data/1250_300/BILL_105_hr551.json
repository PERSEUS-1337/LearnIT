SEC. 3. TERMINATION OF DETERMINATIONS OF GRANDFATHER RIGHTS. Section 127 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to include a provision on Grandfather Rights. States are prohibited from allowing the operation of any vehicle not in conformance with Interstate weight limits, unless it is on a published list. The Secretary is required to determine and publish a list of vehicles not in conformance with weight limits but previously allowed before January 1, 1997. The Secretary is required to publish a final list of vehicles or combinations that were previously allowed to operate before January 1, 1997, despite not conforming to Interstate weight limits. No vehicle or combination can be included on the list based on the assumption that a State law could have authorized such operation at an earlier date. The Secretary will publish a final list of vehicles or combinations exempt from Interstate weight limits 270 days after enactment. States can reduce weight limits for these vehicles but not below pre-1997 levels. All listed vehicles must adhere to existing State-specific regulations. A conforming amendment removes State determination from section 127(a) of the title. SEC. 4. NONDIVISIBLE LOAD PROCEEDING. Section 127 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to include a proceeding to determine the meaning of 'vehicles and loads which cannot be easily dismantled or divided' and issue final regulations within 270 days. The policy aims to promote conformity with Interstate weight limits for the benefit and safety of all motorists. The policy of this title is to promote conformity with Interstate weight limits for the benefit and safety of all motorists, defined as the 80,000 pound gross vehicle weight limitation, single and tandem axle weight limitations, and overall maximum gross weight on consecutive axles. SEC. 5. WEIGHT LIMITATIONS. Title 23, United States Code, is amended to include new section 127a regarding gross vehicle weight and axle loading limitations on non-Interstate highways on the National Highway System. The limitations set by State statute as of January 1, 1997, apply to existing non-Interstate highways, while Interstate weight limits apply to new segments. The section also addresses the publication of State limitations. The Secretary will publish a list of State weight and axle limitations for non-Interstate highways on the National Highway System as of January 1, 1997. Additionally, a list of nonconforming operations will be published for vehicles not complying with State limitations before January 1, 1997. The Secretary will publish a final list of nonconforming operations for vehicles not complying with State limitations before January 1, 1997. Vehicles on the list will be subject to routing-specific, commodity-specific, and weight-specific designations in force in a State on December 31, 1996. The limitations established by subsection (a) will apply to any new designations made to the National Highway System and remain in effect on non-Interstate highways. The limitations established by subsection (a) shall apply to new designations on the National Highway System and non-Interstate highways. States can reduce weight limitations on existing non-Interstate highways. Interstate weight limits are defined as 80,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, 20,000 pounds single axle weight, and 34,000 pounds tandem axle weight. Enforcement of requirements is amended, and the chapter analysis is updated accordingly.

Enforcement procedures have been revised and the chapter analysis has been updated accordingly."
