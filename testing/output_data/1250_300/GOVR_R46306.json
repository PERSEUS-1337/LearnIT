    "content": "In recent years, there has been interest in increasing financial support for non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs for individuals beyond high school age. These programs include apprenticeships, college certificate programs, and courses leading to professional certificates or licensure. There is a growing demand for workers in jobs that require training or postsecondary education but not a college degree. Despite the availability of over $100 billion in federal financial aid for postsecondary education, most of these funds are not utilized. The percentage of jobs requiring more than a high school diploma but not a degree is increasing. Federal financial aid for postsecondary education is not fully utilized. Some colleges are exploring creative ways to increase enrollment, including targeting adults for short programs to reenter the workforce or boost earnings. Congress may consider providing direct federal support for non-degree programs. Several proposals aim to increase federal support for students in short-term programs. Several proposals have emerged to increase federal support for students in short-term non-degree programs, including expanding Pell Grants eligibility. The President's Council of Economic Advisers suggested options to retrain individuals for the changing economy, such as providing unemployment benefits during training and developing comprehensive retraining programs. The President's FY2021 budget proposed expanding Pell Grants to currently ineligible short-term programs. The President's FY2021 budget proposed expanding Pell Grants to short-term programs that are not currently eligible, with support from education and business organizations. Concerns include the quality of non-degree programs, potential high federal costs, and perpetuating income inequalities. Some concerns have been raised about non-degree educational programs and their impact on income inequalities and employment opportunities. Employers are increasingly requiring degrees for entry-level positions, potentially making it harder for non-degree holders to secure long-term employment. Additionally, adults with degrees in positions that don't require one may be displacing non-degree holders in some occupations. The report discusses how non-degree holders are being crowded out of occupations that typically require a degree. It provides an overview of federal programs supporting training and education in non-degree programs, highlighting employer demand for individuals with non-degree qualifications. The report also details federal programs and tax benefits that offer financial support to students in non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs. The report discusses federal programs and tax benefits providing financial support to students in non-degree programs, highlighting gaps and limitations in support. It also emphasizes the importance of non-degree credentials in meeting employer needs and economic growth. Data on employment and wages by education requirements is provided to show the market for non-degree credentials. In May 2018, around 6.2% of jobs required a non-degree postsecondary credential for entry. Mean annual wages for occupations with high school diploma, some college, or non-degree credentials are similar. However, there are differences in wages within these categories. Postsecondary non-degree programs provide training primarily to individuals beyond typical secondary education age, preparing them for specific occupations. These programs may be instructional or work-based, with some combining both approaches. Earnings differentials exist within education categories, with research showing premiums for long-term certificates in technical and health fields, as well as those from community colleges. Postsecondary non-degree instructional programs prepare individuals for specialized jobs and general employment by offering postsecondary courses or curriculum without awarding a degree. Upon completion, individuals receive a postsecondary educational certificate to expand knowledge, skills, prepare for further education, employment, or promotion. These programs exclude postbaccalaureate certificates and transfer programs. Non-degree instructional programs are offered by various entities including colleges, universities, trade schools, and technical schools. These programs are designed to prepare individuals for specialized jobs, sustain employment, and seek promotion. They do not lead to postbaccalaureate certificates or transfer programs. Certifications and licenses are separate from non-degree instructional programs, with certifications demonstrating competency in an occupation and licenses being required for certain professions. In fall 2018, nearly 1.9 million individuals were enrolled in non-degree instructional programs at almost 3,000 institutions of higher education. Non-degree instructional programs are offered by various entities including colleges, universities, trade schools, and technical schools. These programs vary in length and may last from a few days to over two years. They are designed to instill industry skills and meet curriculum requirements for employment or certification. Over 4,500 for-profit non-traditional postsecondary educational institutions enrolled almost 670,000 students in AY 2009-2010. Non-degree instructional programs vary in length and are designed to instill industry skills for employment or certification. Program duration may be influenced by federal, state, and private entities. Programs can be offered in various formats and students are responsible for funding the cost, which can vary depending on the program length and provider. For example, average tuition and fees were over $9,000 at public less-than-two-year colleges and approximately $15,000 at private less-than-two-year colleges in AY2018-2019. In non-degree instructional programs, a distinction exists between credit courses and noncredit courses. Credit programs offer transferable credits and lead to various vocations, while noncredit programs do not provide currency towards credit programs. Noncredit programs offer vocational certificates and continuing education units, but do not count towards credit programs. They are cost-effective, cover a wide range of topics, and can be quickly adapted to industry needs. Noncredit programs include ABE, ESL, personal enrichment, and customized training. Enrollment data shows that 38% of students in one state community college system were in noncredit courses. National data on non-degree programs is incomplete, with some states and the federal government not collecting data on noncredit programs. Noncredit programs, such as ABE and ESL, offer vocational certificates and continuing education units. National data on non-degree programs is incomplete, with some states and the federal government not collecting data on noncredit programs. A 2016 survey found that 8% of adults aged 16-65 had a postsecondary certificate. Work-based learning encompasses various training activities to impart workplace skills. Work-based learning includes various forms such as on-the-job training, apprenticeships, internships, and cooperative programs. Registered Apprenticeship (RA) programs are a unique form of work-based learning overseen by the Department of Labor (DOL) or a DOL-approved state agency. RA programs must meet federal regulations and include a work process schedule outlining competencies and training methods. The application for work-based learning programs must include a work process schedule outlining competencies and training methods. Programs must be reviewed every five years for compliance, and may be deregistered for persistent failure. Work-based learning can be offered by employers, unions, training providers, or educational institutions. It is structured to meet the needs of the employer, potential employer, or trainee, with opportunities ranging from informal internships to formal curriculum. Work-based learning programs are structured to meet the needs of employers, potential employers, or trainees. They can range from informal internships to formal RA programs lasting one to six years. RA programs can be time-based or competency-based, or a hybrid of both approaches. Program costs are primarily covered by the provider, with trainees possibly responsible for living expenses. The costs of work-based learning programs are mainly covered by the provider, with trainees potentially responsible for living expenses. Program costs may include fees for trainers, trainee wages, and lost work time. Trainees who do not receive remuneration may need to cover their own transportation, room, and board. Data on employer-provided training are limited and vary in methodology and purpose. A summary of government surveys in the 1990s found that 16% to 70% of workers received training. In 2016, 21% of adults aged 16-65 completed work-based learning programs, with healthcare and teaching being common fields. The Department of Labor reported 633,000 active apprentices in 25,000 programs in FY2019, with 81,000 completing a program. Construction has the most apprenticeships, but they are also available in manufacturing and transportation. The federal government provides financial support for training and education, with programs like the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Title I, federal student aid, tax benefits, and veterans educational assistance. These programs aim to support workforce development and non-degree programs. The federal government offers various programs to support workforce development and education, including WIOA Title I, federal student aid, tax benefits, and veterans educational assistance like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC. These programs provide financial support for individuals pursuing training and education. Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses (VET TEC) provides financial support for students pursuing educational and training programs. Other programs like SNAP Employment & Training and TANF also offer training and education opportunities for individuals in need. These federal programs aim to develop a skilled workforce through non-degree programs. Key program design elements and differences are highlighted in the report. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Title I is a federal workforce development legislation aimed at increasing coordination among programs to improve workforce quality and reduce welfare dependency. It is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL) and provides services to enhance employment, earnings, and postsecondary credential attainment. Formula grants are allocated to local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) under the Adult and Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities program. The Adult and Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities program under WIOA Title I provides formula grants to states, which are then allocated to local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) for various purposes like establishing One-Stop delivery systems, providing career and training services, building relationships with employers, and developing industry partnerships. WIOA offers consumer choice to participants, with services structured around career services and training. Career services include basic and individualized assistance, while training can be pursued at eligible training providers listed by the state. Eligible WIOA participants can pursue training at the state's Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL), which includes institutions offering programs leading to a recognized credential. Training activities supported by WIOA funds include non-degree and degree programs, work-based learning, and incumbent worker training for in-demand occupations. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) allows eligible participants to access training at approved institutions for in-demand occupations. Training services provided by an Eligible Training Provider (ETP) lead to industry-recognized certificates, licenses, degrees, or employment. WIOA ensures universal access to career services for adults aged 18 and older, with individualized services available to help individuals secure and maintain employment. Up to 20% of funds can be reserved for incumbent worker training in local areas. Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), all adults have access to basic career services, with individualized services available to help them secure employment. Eligibility for training services requires the individual to demonstrate the need for training to obtain or retain employment leading to economic self-sufficiency, have the necessary skills and qualifications, select a training service linked to a local in-demand occupation, and be unable to obtain other grant assistance. One-Stop operators determine eligibility through interviews, evaluations, or assessments. Local Workforce Development Boards designate entities to serve as One-Stop operators. Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), One-Stop operators assess individuals for eligibility for career and training services. Priority is given to public assistance recipients, low-income individuals, and those with basic skills deficiencies. Local Workforce Development Boards determine fund allocation among priority groups. Training can be provided through Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) or contracts for services, with funds also available for supportive services and needs-related payments. Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), individuals deemed eligible for training services can choose from the Eligible Training Provider List (ETPL) in consultation with a One-Stop operator. An Individual Training Account (ITA) is then established for payment to the training provider, not the individual. Local Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) have the authority to set limits on training type, duration, and ITA amounts based on individual circumstances. ITA funds can be used for non-degree programs, degree programs, and related instruction. WDBs can also provide supportive services like transportation, child care, housing, and needs-related payments to facilitate training participation. Authorized to provide supportive services like transportation, child care, housing, and needs-related payments for training participation. Local WDBs may offer training through a contract for services, including work-based learning. The contract is between the WDB and an employer or RA sponsor for occupational training in exchange for reimbursement. Various criteria must be met for using a contract for services, such as consumer choice requirements, types of training services, insufficient training providers, effectiveness of local training programs, and training multiple individuals in in-demand occupations. Local WDBs may contract training services for individuals with barriers to employment, focusing on in-demand occupations or industry sectors. Reimbursement rates for OJT providers or RA sponsors can reach up to 75% of wages. States establish the ETPL, while local WDBs and One-Stop operators manage training programs and payments. Quality assurance for training providers is ensured through eligibility processes. The governor and state WDB set criteria for eligible training providers to receive funding in workforce investment areas. The governor and state WDB establish criteria and procedures for eligible training providers to receive funding in workforce investment areas. RA programs are automatically eligible for the state ETPL, while non-RA providers must apply for initial eligibility. Existing providers must follow procedures for continued eligibility, with local WDBs having discretion on specific factors such as the length of OJT contracts. The length of OJT contracts is determined by the local WDB based on factors like occupation, training content, and prior work experience. WIOA requires consideration of individual characteristics and training relevance for employer eligibility. ETPs and states must report program participation and outcomes, with providers submitting performance and cost information every two years for continued eligibility under WIOA Title I. The governor may require specific performance information for program eligibility, including earnings, credential attainment, cost of attendance, and completion rates. States must publish annual ETP performance reports with details on participants, training providers, and program outcomes. The ETP performance reports must include data on participants in WIOA Title I programs, such as total number trained, exits, and average cost per participant. It should also detail participants with barriers to employment by program of study, subpopulation, race, ethnicity, sex, and age. Recent data shows high numbers of adult and dislocated worker participants, with the majority being over 30 years old and unemployed or laid off. Many participants have no postsecondary education experience. The majority of participants in WIOA Title I programs are over 30 years old, unemployed, and have no postsecondary education experience. Some participants have a degree. Training services are mainly focused on skills training and upgrading through non-degree programs. Popular occupations pursued include healthcare, transportation, computer and mathematical, and management. The program supports adult entry or reentry into the workforce through career services and short-term training. WIOA Title I supports adult entry or reentry into the workforce primarily through career services and short-term training. Suggestions to enhance support for non-degree training include increasing access, additional funding for wage reimbursement and ITAs, relaxing the 20% limit on incumbent training, and eliminating restrictions on obtaining other grant assistance. Quality of non-degree programs may vary due to state and local flexibility in developing the ETPL. Title IV of the Higher Education Act authorizes programs that provide financial assistance to students at certain institutions of higher education. The programs, administered by the Department of Education, offer grants and loans to financially needy students. Federal Pell Grants and federal student loans through the Direct Loan program are the primary types of aid available. These programs are designed to provide portable aid to eligible individuals, regardless of congressional appropriations. Other smaller aid programs authorized under Title IV are not discussed in this report. The Pell Grants and Direct Loan program provide financial aid to eligible individuals regardless of congressional appropriations. Pell Grants are considered a quasi-entitlement, while Direct Loans are a mandatory entitlement program. Both can be used for Title IV-eligible programs offered by participating institutions of higher education. Eligibility criteria include quality assurance measures. Title IV-participating IHEs, including public, private nonprofit, and proprietary institutions, must meet quality assurance criteria. Non-degree programs must lead to a recognized credential and have defined credit or clock hours. OJT in work-based learning must be supervised by the IHE, with less than 50% outsourced. Non-degree programs have specific durational requirements. Non-degree programs at Title IV-participating IHEs must meet quality assurance criteria and have specific durational requirements. For Pell Grants, these programs must be at least 15 weeks long with a minimum of 600 clock hours or 16 semester hours. For the Direct Loan program, non-degree programs must be at least 10 weeks long with 300-599 clock hours. Students must be enrolled at least half-time to borrow through the Direct Loan program. Students must be enrolled in an eligible program on at least a half-time basis to borrow through the Direct Loan program. Non-degree programs at public and private nonprofit IHEs that are at least one academic year in length and lead to a certificate or other recognized non-degree credential are eligible for Pell Grants and Direct Loan programs. Eligibility criteria include being a U.S. citizen, national, legal permanent resident, or other specified eligible noncitizen, having a high school diploma or equivalent, and meeting program-specific criteria. To qualify for Pell Grants or Direct Loan program loans, individuals must meet specific eligibility criteria including being enrolled in an undergraduate program, demonstrating financial need, and meeting program-specific requirements. Pell Grant recipients are subject to a lifetime eligibility cap of 12 full-time semesters. Direct Loan program loans require at least half-time enrollment and additional eligibility criteria may apply for specific loan types. The primary loans available are Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduates with financial need, Direct Unsubsidized Loans for all students, and PLUS Loans. The Direct Loan program offers various loan types including Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduates with financial need, Direct Unsubsidized Loans for all students, and PLUS Loans for parents and graduate students. New borrowers after July 1, 2013, have limits on borrowing Direct Subsidized Loans. The amount of aid a student can receive is based on statutory rules and cannot exceed the cost of attendance, which includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, and sometimes room and board, transportation, and dependent care expenses. The Cost of Attendance (COA) for Pell Grant includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board, transportation, and dependent care expenses. Pell Grant is determined independently of other financial aid. The maximum award for AY 2020-2021 is $6,345 for full-time students. Pell Grant used for non-degree programs may be taxed, while for degree programs, it is taxed only if not used for tuition and fees. Direct Loan program rules vary by loan type, and other factors can affect aid amount. The Direct Loan program award rules vary by loan type and other factors can affect the aid amount. Financial assistance awarded to the student must be considered when awarding Direct Loan program loans. There are statutory annual and aggregate award limits for Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans based on dependency status and class level. The maximum loan amount for undergraduate students is prorated for shorter academic programs. The Office of Federal Student Aid administers Title IV aid. The Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) administers Title IV aid programs, with various actors like FSA and IHEs handling administrative tasks. FSA manages high-level functions such as system operations, customer service, and program integrity. IHEs handle day-to-day tasks like verifying student eligibility, calculating aid amounts, disbursing funds, and managing program finances. Additionally, IHEs receive an administrative cost allowance under the Pell Grant program. The Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) administers Title IV aid programs, with various actors like FSA and IHEs handling administrative tasks. IHE functions include verifying student eligibility, calculating aid amounts, disbursing funds, and managing program finances. The program integrity triad of state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification ensures quality and compliance in Title IV programs. Non-degree programs may need to meet gainful employment requirements. Non-degree programs must meet gainful employment requirements to participate in Title IV programs. State approval and licensure requirements for postsecondary education vary among states, with some requiring approval of individual programs and others only approving the institution as a whole. States evaluate program curricula, objectives, enrollment projections, student outcomes, and program need justification differently. Some states also require programmatic accreditation or approval by another state agency. To participate in Title IV programs, an IHE must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by ED as a reliable authority on education quality. Accrediting agencies evaluate various criteria such as faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and student achievement. Regional or national accreditation is typically required for Title IV program eligibility. Accrediting agencies evaluate an IHE's faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and student achievement in relation to the institution's mission. Regional and national accreditors may evaluate the whole institution or a sample of programs. Programmatic accreditation is not required for Title IV purposes but can be sought for employer and licensure requirements. To participate in Title IV programs, an IHE must apply for certification from ED and meet eligibility requirements for each educational program. To participate in Title IV programs, an IHE must apply for certification from ED. ED evaluates if the IHE meets Title IV participation requirements by reviewing each educational program for eligibility. Programs must meet specific criteria, such as verifiable completion and placement rates of at least 70% for 300-599 clock-hour programs. Non-degree programs must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The 2014 gainful employment regulations, which set debt-to-earnings rates for program quality, were rescinded in 2019. The 2014 gainful employment regulations set debt-to-earnings rates for program quality, intending to measure programmatic quality by ensuring students can repay loans. Programs failing to meet standards may lose Title IV eligibility for three years. Programs subject to these rules must also meet third-party standards for accreditation and licensure. The Higher Education Act (HEA) requires Title IV participating institutions to report enrollment, certificates, degrees conferred, student charges, and other relevant information. Educational prerequisites for professional licensure or certification must be met. Data on non-degree instructional for-credit programs is collected annually by the Department of Education. In the 2017-2018 academic year, 4,618 out of 6,418 Title IV-participating institutions offered non-degree for-credit programs. Private for-profit institutions offer about half of these programs, while public institutions award over two-thirds of the credentials. In AY2015-2016, approximately 765,000 Pell Grant recipients pursued non-degree credit programs and received about $2.7 billion in Pell Grant awards. Roughly 10% of total recipients and dollar amount of awards went to non-degree programs. About 10% of undergraduates who borrowed a Direct Loan were pursuing certificate programs. Support for non-degree programs is limited to Title IV-participating IHEs and specific program durations. Some students may be ineligible if they lack a high school diploma or are not enrolled in a career program. Non-degree programs offered by Title IV-participating IHEs have varying quality and are assessed through state authorization requirements. State authorizers and accreditors have flexibility in determining quality criteria. Variation among state authorization requirements complicates assessing institutional experiences. State history, resources, and priorities influence the state's role in evaluating non-degree programs. Researchers have identified potential weaknesses in state authorization requirements, including concerns about oversight by state boards, input requirements hindering innovative education models, lengthy authorization processes, conflicts across state laws for institutions offering programs in multiple states, and limited reporting on student outcomes for authorization renewal. The accreditation system has strengths such as tailored peer reviews and programmatic alignment, but weaknesses include conflicting interests, lack of resources, and difficulty in assessing innovative education methods. Education tax benefits help offset higher education costs for eligible taxpayers. Education tax benefits, administered by the IRS, offset some higher education costs for eligible taxpayers. They favor upper middle income taxpayers and are claimed when filing federal income tax returns. Benefits are received after paying for education expenses, sometimes months later. Some benefits are available for degree programs, while others include non-degree programs. Unlike most federal education programs, these benefits reduce federal revenues instead of increasing outlays. Education tax benefits, such as the Lifetime Learning Credit and Employer Provided Educational Assistance, are available for individuals pursuing education, including non-degree programs. These benefits reduce federal revenues and are not subject to annual appropriations. They may incentivize overconsumption of education and subsidize education that would have occurred anyway. The Lifetime Learning Credit and 529 accounts can be used for eligible education expenses at Title IV-eligible IHEs. Qualified education expenses include tuition, books, supplies, and equipment required for enrollment. Expenses must be reduced by tax-free educational assistance. Expenses not required for enrollment can be reduced by tax-free educational assistance, including employer-provided assistance and 529 account distributions. Courses can be part of a degree program or for job skills improvement. Employer assistance can cover tuition, fees, books, and supplies for skill development. Withdrawals from 529 accounts can be used for qualified expenses like tuition and fees. Tax-free withdrawals from 529 accounts can be used for qualified expenses at a Title IV-eligible institution, including tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, and equipment. Participants must file a federal income tax return or be claimed as a dependent to claim tax benefits for education expenses. The tax credit cannot be claimed if filing as married filing separately, if they are nonresident aliens, or if their income exceeds certain thresholds. Participants can only use the tax benefit if their employer offers an educational assistance program. Participants can claim tax benefits for education expenses if their income is below certain thresholds and their employer offers an educational assistance program. The Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC) can be applied for when filing federal income tax returns after incurring qualified educational expenses. The LLC is calculated as 20% of the first $10,000 of expenses, with a maximum credit of $2,000 per taxpayer. The credit phases out for taxpayers with income between $58,000 and $68,000 ($116,000 and $136,000 for married joint filers) in 2019. The credit is nonrefundable and cannot exceed the taxpayer's federal income tax liability. Taxpayers with low income may not benefit much from non-refundable tax credits like the LLC, as the credit cannot exceed their federal income tax liability. Employers can offer up to $5,250 in tax-free tuition assistance per year. Funds from 529 accounts can be withdrawn tax-free for qualifying education expenses, with the option to transfer balances to certain relatives tax-free. Taxpayers can transfer 529 account balance tax-free to certain relatives. IRS relies on taxpayers, employers, and states for benefit administration. Taxpayers apply for LLC by filing Form 1040 and Form 8863. Employers' educational assistance program must meet specific requirements. An employer's educational assistance program must be in written form and meet specific requirements. The program cannot discriminate in favor of certain employees and must provide reasonable notice to eligible participants. States typically sponsor 529 plans, where individuals can establish accounts for beneficiaries. Withdrawals from a 529 plan result in a Form 1099-Q showing the total amount withdrawn and the breakdown between earnings and basis. The 529 program provides taxpayers with a Form 1099-Q showing total withdrawals and the breakdown between earnings and basis. If funds are used for non-eligible expenses, a portion may be subject to taxation. Taxpayers do not need to document how withdrawals are spent unless audited. The IRS does not have rules on the quality of education programs for tax benefits. Limited IRS data shows that in 2015, 2.5 million taxpayers claimed $2.1 billion in LLC, with an average credit of $830 per taxpayer. Approximately 2.5 million taxpayers claimed $2.1 billion of the LLC in 2015, with an average credit of $830 per taxpayer. Half of all LLC dollars were claimed by taxpayers with AGI between $50,000 and $200,000. Those with AGI below $15,000 or over $200,000 generally did not claim the LLC. No studies have evaluated the impact of the LLC on enrollment in non-degree programs or its effectiveness in improving job skills. Data on employer provided educational assistance and 529 plans are unavailable. Few families have 529 accounts, typically with higher assets and income. Research on education tax benefits, including 529 plans, shows limited impact on increasing enrollment in non-degree programs. The delay in receiving benefits after expenses may hinder students who cannot afford upfront costs. Confusion over eligibility for different education benefits and the requirement of income tax liabilities exclude many low-income taxpayers from benefiting. The GI Bills and VET TEC provide financial assistance to students based on qualifying service in the uniformed services. VET TEC incentivizes training providers for program completion and employment, offering an alternative approach to education benefits. VET TEC incentivizes training providers for program completion and employment, offering financial assistance to students based on qualifying service in the uniformed services. The Post-9/11 GI Bill represents the majority of total GI Bill participation and spending, supporting education through degree pursuit and work-based learning programs. VET TEC benefits support non-degree high-technology programs at approved training providers, offering a variety of training options for eligible individuals. Training providers must meet specific criteria and enter into a Program Participation Agreement with the VA. The VET TEC program offers high-technology education in computer programming, software, and data processing. Eligible servicemembers and veterans, as well as their family members, can access Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. The program has specific criteria for training providers and eligibility requirements for participants, including transferable benefits for family members and support for those who die in the line of duty. Both the Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC provide living stipend payments to participants. To be eligible for VET TEC, an individual must be a GI Bill-eligible veteran enrolled full-time in a VET TEC-eligible program. VET TEC participants may or may not be recipients of GI Bill benefits. Both the Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC provide living stipend payments directly to participants and payments to providers for program costs. Program costs are paid by the Post-9/11 GI Bill concurrent with program pursuit, while VET TEC pays costs during and after pursuit. Eligible individuals may apply for personalized counseling to help guide their career paths and achieve their goals. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides educational assistance payments over 36 months, with benefit levels and payment amounts varying based on individual circumstances. Under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, transferees must share 36 months of entitlement, with various benefit payments available based on individual circumstances such as benefit level, type of program, enrollment rate, charges, location, and mode of education. Payments can include tuition and fee coverage for educational institutions, monthly housing allowance, books and supplies stipend, tutorial assistance, and additional payments. In AY2019-2020, a veteran at a private institution could receive up to $24,476.79 for tuition and fees, along with monthly living stipends ranging from $800 to $4,300. In AY2019-2020, veterans enrolled in educational programs could receive up to $24,476.79 for tuition and fees at private institutions. They could also receive monthly housing allowances ranging from $800 to $4,300, along with up to $1,000 for books and supplies. Under VET TEC, veterans receive monthly housing allowances similar to the Post-9/11 GI Bill while training providers are reimbursed for tuition costs. Training providers cannot charge tuition and fees to VET TEC participants. The VA pays 25% of the program cost upon enrollment, 25% upon completion, and 50% upon employment in a suitable field. Training providers cannot charge VET TEC participants directly. Eligible individuals apply to the VA for Post-9/11 GI Bill or VET TEC, enroll in approved programs, and institutions certify enrollment to the VA. Program quality is overseen by state approving agencies for GI Bill programs and relies on employment outcomes for VET TEC programs. VA verifies eligibility, calculates payments, and distributes them to individuals and institutions. Quality for GI Bill-approved programs is determined by state approving agencies (SAAs) and the VA, with oversight obligations. VET TEC program quality is based on participant employment outcomes. The VA relies on SAAs for initial program approval and shares ongoing oversight responsibility. Standards are established for education programs, institutions, and training establishments to ensure quality and proper administration of GI Bill benefits. Key quality standards include program objectives, restrictions on independent study, the 85-15 rule, and contractual arrangement restrictions. The quality of GI Bill-approved programs is determined by state approving agencies and the VA, with oversight obligations. Program quality for VET TEC is based on participant employment outcomes. Standards include program objectives, restrictions on independent study, the 85-15 rule, and contractual arrangement restrictions. Additional requirements vary depending on the type of program, such as non-degree programs needing adequate facilities, qualified instructors, and recognized curricula. Programs preparing individuals for licensure or certification must meet specific criteria. The VA determines eligibility for VET TEC programs, ensuring quality and value through various standards and criteria. Approved programs must have adequate facilities, qualified instructors, recognized curricula, and meet specific licensure or certification criteria. Payment structure is designed to reimburse for program quality and value. The VA determines eligibility for VET TEC programs based on meeting licensure, certification, or board standards. The payment structure and key elements of the program ensure quality and value, with reimbursement for training providers upon veterans' completion and meaningful employment within 180 days. Training providers must be licensed or approved by relevant agencies and meet the 85-15 rule. The program must not be self-paced, and annual reporting is required to assess program effectiveness in preparing individuals for the future. Performance measures include program admittance rate, job placement, and retention. The VET TEC program measures the performance of Post-9/11 GI Bill participants through various criteria such as program admittance rate, job placement, retention rates, and median annual salary. While most participants pursue degrees, a small percentage opt for educational certificates or on-the-job training. Educational institutions and training providers offering non-degree programs are also approved for GI Bill purposes. In FY2018, 0.4% of Post-9/11 GI Bill participants pursued OJT or apprenticeships. Data from December 2019 showed that many approved locations did not award degrees, including 500 flight school locations, over 18,000 school locations, and over 9,000 OJT/apprenticeship locations. The most popular certificates completed were in welding, information technology, HVAC, healthcare, and gunsmithing. Program eligibility is for uniformed service members and their families, with concerns raised about program quality oversight. The oversight process for the program serving uniformed services and their family members may be compromised, as indicated by a 2018 GAO report and a 2018 VA OIG report. The SNAP program, administered by the Department of Agriculture, provides benefits for eligible low-income households redeemable for food. States also receive SNAP Employment & Training funding for education services. States receive SNAP Employment & Training (E&T) funding to provide employment and education services for SNAP participants, with the option to make the program mandatory or voluntary.

Components include job search programs, training, workfare, work experience, education, self-employment training, and more. Funding includes $124 million without a state match and federal match for administrative expenses. Since October 2015, USDA-FNS and Seattle Jobs Initiative have been operating SNAP to Skills, a capacity-building project focusing on education beyond high school. SNAP to Skills is a project by USDA-FNS and Seattle Jobs Initiative since October 2015, providing technical assistance to states for more effective SNAP E&T programs. It integrates with WIOA Title I program and addresses challenges like low basic skills and housing instability for E&T recipients. Services vary by state and can include education activities to improve basic skills. SNAP E&T programs offer education activities to improve basic skills and employability for recipients. States provide varying services, including high school programs, literacy education, and ESL instruction. Education components must directly enhance employability and have a clear link to job readiness. Some states fund non-degree programs for SNAP participants. SNAP E&T programs focus on providing education and training to help participants transition into employment quickly. Education activities offered include vocational training, basic education, work experience, and apprenticeships. To qualify for SNAP, households must meet income and nonfinancial eligibility criteria. Under current law, SNAP participants must meet income requirements at or below 100% of the federal poverty level, with some states allowing up to 200%. Work requirements are in place for non-disabled adults, who must register for work and maintain at least 30 hours per week. States have flexibility in designing SNAP E&T programs, with mandatory participation options. USDA guidance mandates assessment of participants for effective program placement. The 2018 farm bill requires all states to offer case management services and individualized service plans. The 2018 farm bill now requires all states to include case management services such as comprehensive intake assessments, individualized service plans, and progress monitoring for SNAP participants. SNAP E&T funds can cover education costs, program development, and associated expenses like dependent care and transportation. Funding is administered by state agencies and contracted programs. The USDA-FNS promotes third-party partnerships for SNAP E&T programs, where states collaborate with entities like community colleges. These partnerships involve financial or in-kind contributions, with federal funds reimbursing partners. Pell Grant-eligible students must use the Pell Grant first for college expenses before utilizing E&T funds for remaining costs. Expenses covered by E&T must be reasonable and necessary. The E&T benefit is based on college expenses not covered by the Pell Grant and must be reasonable and necessary. Workforce partnerships were added to the program by the 2018 farm bill, including private employers and nonprofit organizations. Each state designs its SNAP E&T program within federal rules and must consult with the state workforce development board or private employers. Programs vary in capacity and services offered. The 2018 farm bill added workforce partnerships to the SNAP E&T program, requiring consultation with state workforce development boards or private employers. States monitor program quality, with USDA providing technical assistance. USDA established performance indicators reporting, with the first annual report due in January 2018. National reporting measures include unsubsidized employment and median quarterly wages after completion of SNAP E&T participation. The USDA has not published a compilation of reports on SNAP E&T participation. National reporting measures include unsubsidized employment and median quarterly wages after completion of the program. Most SNAP E&T participants receive services other than education. In FY2016, 38 state agencies provided an education component, serving almost 70,000 participants. Some states served fewer than 100 participants, while others served nearly 100,000. Less than 10% of participants receive education in SNAP E&T. Some states served fewer than 100 participants, while others served nearly 100,000 in SNAP E&T. Limitations include a focus on job search over education, lack of information on program quality, and no data on subsequent employment outcomes. Wages earned may affect SNAP eligibility. TANF block grants aim to promote work, job preparation, and marriage to reduce dependence on government benefits. States have flexibility in using TANF funds. TANF block grants aim to reduce dependence on government benefits by promoting work, job preparation, and marriage. States have flexibility in using TANF funds for a wide range of benefits and services, including monthly assistance for needy families with children. TANF funds can be used for various activities, including supporting career pathways and vocational education programs for low-income families with children. States have flexibility in deciding which training and education programs are eligible for funding. TANF funds are used for vocational education for low-income families with children. States determine eligibility rules and benefit amounts, with significant variation among them. Over one-third of adult TANF recipients have less than a high school education. States decide how funds are spent based on state legislatures' determinations. TANF programs are determined by states, including eligibility rules, benefit amounts, and required activities for adult recipients. Benefits may be reduced or ended if recipients refuse to participate in required activities like training and education. TANF also offers support services such as advising, career planning, and employment services, delivered at the state and local level. States decide which participants receive these services, and some may refer recipients to WIOA One Stop Centers for education or employment. State TANF programs determine services for participants, which may include referrals to WIOA One Stop Centers for education or employment. States can operate employment and training services separately from WIOA. The minimum work participation rate is TANF's main performance measure, with rules limiting training and education engagement. States can meet the rate by reducing cash assistance caseload. Data on TANF participation in training and education outcomes is limited. The TANF program requires a minimum number of work hours per week, which can be met by reducing the cash assistance caseload. Limited data exists on TANF participation in training and education. Child care and educational barriers hinder TANF recipients from pursuing non-degree programs. Most TANF adults are single mothers with young children, and states can use TANF funds for child care. The 12-month limit on vocational training restricts options for TANF recipients, and income eligibility thresholds may affect participation in apprenticeship programs. The quality of training and education programs is uncertain."
