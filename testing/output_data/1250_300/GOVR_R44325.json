    "content": "The level of pay for congressional staff is determined by Senate committees, with job titles, pay rates, and resources set by the chair and ranking Member. There is interest in congressional pay data for various reasons, but publicly available sources do not provide aggregated data. The data in this report is based on official Senate reports and collected by LegiStorm. The pay data in this report is based on the Senate's Report of the Secretary of the Senate, published semiannually, and provides annual data by fiscal year for Senate committee staff compensation. It includes pay data for 13 staff position titles used in Senate committees since FY2001. Position titles were identified through a two-step process, excluding titles filled by only one staff member and those used by six or fewer panels. The pay data for Senate committee staff is based on the Senate's Report of the Secretary of the Senate, providing annual data by fiscal year for 13 staff position titles. Titles were identified through a two-step process, excluding those used by only one staff member or by six or fewer panels. Pay data collected includes annual salaries, overtime, bonuses, and other payments in addition to base salary. Staff must hold the same job title in the same committee for the entire fiscal year and not receive pay from any other congressional employing authority. Data collected for this report may differ from an employee's stated annual salary due to the inclusion of overtime, bonuses, or other payments in addition to base salary. Pay data for staff working in House committee offices are available in CRS Report R44322, Staff Pay Levels for Selected Positions in House Committees, 2001-2014. Data describing the pay of congressional staff working in the personal offices of Senators and Members of the House are available in CRS Report R44324, Staff Pay Levels for Selected Positions in Senators' Offices, FY2001-FY2014, and CRS Report R44323, Staff Pay Levels for Selected Positions in House Member Offices, 2001-2014. Data presented here are subject to challenges that could affect findings or interpretation, such as the representativeness of the data provided. The data collected for Senate committee staff positions may not be fully representative due to the way staff titles are assigned. Two categories of positions emerge: one with data for single staff members per committee, likely representing pay accurately, and another with data for multiple staff members, which may be a sample rather than complete data. Pay data does not consider factors like education or work experience. Differences in job duties for positions with the same title could exist. The pay data for Senate committee staff positions may not fully represent the actual compensation levels due to differences in job duties for positions with the same title. Congressional employing authorities have wide discretion in setting terms of employment, leading to potential variations in duties and pay levels. Tables in this section provide background information on Senate pay practices, comparative data for each position, and detailed data and visualizations. Table 2 shows maximum payable rates for Senate committee staff since 2001 in both nominal and constant 2016 dollars.
