    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the possession of weapons of mass destruction by hostile states or terrorist groups is the greatest threat to national security. It is a top priority to protect the US and its allies from such attacks. The US policy is to ensure compliance with nuclear and chemical weapons treaties. The United States is committed to various international treaties and agreements aimed at preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile technologies. These agreements include the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Biological Weapons Convention, the safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and control lists of various export control regimes. These commitments are in line with the national security interests of the United States. The United States has benefited from international agreements like the Nunn-Lugar Act, which has deactivated nuclear warheads and destroyed intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Nunn-Lugar Act has successfully eliminated and destroyed various nuclear weapons and missile systems, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, missile silos, bombers, nuclear air-to-surface missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missile launchers and missiles, strategic nuclear submarines, and nuclear test tunnels. President George W. Bush called for the expansion of the program in 2004 to prevent dangerous materials from falling into the wrong hands. The Nunn-Lugar legislation, passed in 1991, aims to prevent weapons and dangerous materials from the Cold War from getting into the wrong hands. The program helps former Soviet states employ former weapons scientists and dismantle, destroy, and secure leftover Soviet WMD arsenal materials. There is still more work to be done in this area.

The sense of Congress emphasizes the need to prevent catastrophic terrorism using weapons of mass destruction, utilize all US capabilities, pursue multilateral and bilateral agreements, hold nations accountable for violations of nonproliferation treaties, and prevent dangerous regimes and terrorist groups from acquiring the world's most dangerous weapons. The President must ensure compliance with international nonproliferation treaties and provide assistance to uphold them. The authority to use Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction funds should align with the importance placed on reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction. SEC. 4. REPEAL OF RESTRICTIONS. Repeals sections of various acts related to nuclear and chemical weapons destruction. SEC. 5. INAPPLICABILITY OF OTHER RESTRICTIONS. States that certain restrictions do not apply to Cooperative Threat Reduction programs. SEC. 6. COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION PROGRAMS DEFINED. Defines Cooperative Threat Reduction programs as specified activities in a specific act."
