    "content": "The report discusses key base closure developments from the 105th to the 107th Congress, including the signing of legislation in December 2001 for a new base closure round in 2005. The closures and realignments from previous BRAC commissions have resulted in significant savings. Defense spending trends and force structure changes have necessitated additional base closures. The Department of Defense recognized the need for additional base closures due to the downward trend in defense spending and force structure. Secretary of Defense William Cohen called for two more rounds of closures in 1999 and 2001 to achieve a proper balance and secure significant savings for future readiness and weapons acquisition programs. Secretary of Defense Cohen's plan to close more bases in the next five years faced opposition on Capitol Hill, with concerns about economic and political repercussions in districts. Despite efforts by Senators to authorize two more rounds of base closures in 1999 and 2001, the proposal narrowly failed in the Senate Armed Services Committee. Senator Levin, along with Senators McCain, Coats, and Robb, pushed for more base closings to reduce excess infrastructure for new weapons funding. The full Senate voted against the McCain-Levin initiative, opting for a substitute amendment that delayed new base closings until DOD developed accurate cost/savings measurements. The House National Security Committee also showed strong opposition to new closures. In the House National Security Committee, opposition to a new round of base closures was strong. Representative Joel Hefley indicated that there should be no new base closure rounds for at least five years. Questions were raised about the actual savings of closing bases, with concerns about rushing into new closures without a thorough understanding of the military implications of previous rounds. Despite lack of broad support on Capitol Hill, senior DOD officials claimed net savings, but the Congressional Budget Office was unable to confirm those estimates. Senior DOD officials and the President pushed for new rounds of base closures despite opposition on Capitol Hill. Secretary of Defense Cohen and Gen. John Shalikashvili called for more closures to fund weapons programs. The Defense Reform Initiative included two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005, aiming for annual savings of $1.4 billion each. This was part of a larger plan to save $6 billion annually through various actions. The Defense Reform Initiative included two rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2005, aiming for annual savings of $1.4 billion each, totaling $2.8 billion. Support for additional closures came from the National Defense Panel urging Congress to act quickly. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the importance of these closures for financing and accelerating the transformation of U.S. military capabilities. President Clinton opposed the closure of two Air Force maintenance depots recommended by the 1995 base closure commission, citing disproportionate effects on California and Texas. He advocated for \"privatization-in-place\" to prevent job losses in these states. President Clinton faced opposition for his intervention in preventing job losses in California and Texas through \"privatization-in-place\" at Air Force maintenance depots. Legislators from Oklahoma, Georgia, and Utah opposed the plan, fearing job loss and depot vulnerability in future base closure rounds. Resentment over Clinton's actions persisted, influencing opposition to new base closure rounds. Some Members tried to block DOD's privatization plans for depot maintenance. President Clinton's intervention in preventing job losses at Air Force maintenance depots faced opposition from legislators. Efforts were made to block DOD's privatization plans, leading to debates and amendments in the House and Senate committees. Ultimately, depot-related provisions were removed from the DOD authorization bill before floor consideration. Efforts to restore depot-related restrictions in the House and Senate bills were led by Representative Terry Everett and Senator Inhofe, but were ultimately withdrawn. The depot-related language became a major obstacle in reaching a final agreement on the FY1998 defense authorization bill, with opposing camps unwilling to yield. A resolution was achieved by Senate and House conferees and reported on October 23. A resolution was achieved by Senate and House conferees on October 23, resulting in an increase in the limit on depot work by private contractors from 40% to 50%. The House passed the conference report on October 28, while the Senate debated the provisions but did not move to a final vote. The Senate reached final agreement on November 6, passing the conference report by a vote of 90 to 10. President Clinton signed the bill into law on November 18 (P.L. 105-85), which included language (Section 2824) in the FY1998 defense authorization act. In November 1998, the Senate passed a bill prohibiting new base closures until a report on costs and savings was submitted. The Department of Defense submitted the report in April 1998, stating that the base structure was 23% in excess. Secretary of Defense Cohen called for new base closure legislation, emphasizing the need for savings. Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the need for new base closure legislation, highlighting that the base structure was 23% in excess. He pointed out the imbalance between force and base structures, citing examples such as the significant reduction in Navy ships and Army soldiers compared to classroom space. The base closure report indicated that the costs of previous rounds were lower than estimated, with expected savings from base shutdowns. The base closure report highlighted that previous closure costs were lower than estimated, with expected savings exceeding initial estimates. The report also mentioned that new rounds of closures in 2001 and 2005 were projected to produce additional savings of about $3 billion annually. The Department of Defense recommended applying the model of previous closure commissions for the upcoming rounds, and emphasized the successful economic recovery of impacted communities. The base closure report recommended applying the model of previous closure commissions for the upcoming rounds in 2001 and 2005. A memo from the Air Force added controversy by mentioning White House involvement in encouraging Lockheed Martin Corporation to take on maintenance work at McClellan Air Force Base. Members opposed keeping depot maintenance work at McClellan AFB and Kelly AFB, accusing the Administration of meddling in the closure process. Capitol Hill reacted strongly to the report's call for new closure rounds, with widespread resistance. Reaction on Capitol Hill to the April 2, 1998 report's call for two new base closure rounds was strong and widespread. The House National Security Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee were divided on the issue, with the Senate committee defeating a proposed new round of base closures in 2001. Senators John McCain and Carl Levin considered seeking support for passage of a floor amendment during Senate consideration of the FY1999 defense authorization bill but ultimately abandoned their initiative. In floor action, the Senate narrowly voted in support of an amendment to the FY1999 defense authorization bill. In floor action on June 25, the Senate voted 48-45 in support of an amendment to the FY1999 defense authorization bill. The amendment, sponsored by Senator James Inhofe, aimed to make it more difficult for the Pentagon to proceed with base closings by imposing restrictions on base closures and realignments. It would have delayed or blocked the Department of Defense from closing a base by reducing the number of civilian employees to less than 225. Additionally, the amendment expressed congressional opposition to any new rounds of closures and realignments until all actions from previous rounds were completed. The Inhofe amendment aimed to hinder the Pentagon's base closure efforts by imposing restrictions on closures and realignments. It expressed opposition to new closure rounds until previous actions were completed. The Congressional Budget Office's review of DOD's base realignment and closure report found that DOD's estimates of savings were consistent with its own, but firm measures of BRAC savings were difficult to determine. BRAC savings are avoided costs that DOD would have incurred without BRAC actions. DOD can only estimate savings as they are not actual expenditures. CBO noted DOD's clear summary of future base closure savings but lacked analysis on closures. Difficulty in estimating impact on local communities until specific bases are identified. DOD had trouble locating some data, including original cost and savings estimates for BRAC commissions. GAO also submitted a review. The General Accounting Office reviewed DOD's report on BRAC costs and savings, giving generally good grades and affirming substantial net savings from previous closure rounds. However, it noted that DOD's report provides a rough approximation rather than precise accounting, with data systems not capturing all savings. GAO found no long-term problems affecting military capabilities due to BRAC actions. The GAO findings on DOD's analysis of BRAC actions show no long-term problems affecting military capabilities. Communities affected by prior BRAC actions are rebounding economically, with proposed BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2005 following similar processes. Congress debated authorizing new base closings in the 106th Congress, with Senator John McCain and Senator Carl Levin involved in the discussions. Senator John McCain and Senator Carl Levin sponsored a bill calling for two new rounds of base closures in 2001 and 2003. Senator McCain highlighted the excess infrastructure capacity claimed by the DOD and emphasized the potential billions of dollars in savings from closing and realigning bases. The bill proposed changes to the BRAC selection process, including a later start date in 2001 to allow a new President to nominate commission members and restrictions on privatization-in-place without commission approval. Secretary of Defense William Cohen also advocated for further base closures during this time. Privatization-in-place would not be allowed in closing installations unless recommended by the new base closure commission. Secretary of Defense William Cohen emphasized the importance of further base closures, stating that wasteful spending on unneeded facilities was hindering military readiness. Despite appeals for two additional rounds of closures to save money, many Members of Congress were hesitant due to constituent concerns. The Senate and House committees rejected Secretary of Defense Cohen's proposal for two more rounds of base closures, with strong opposition in Congress. Despite attempts by Senators McCain and Levin, the initiative to close more military bases was effectively blocked for the year. The Administration's FY2000 DOD budget sought authority for base closures, but faced significant resistance. In the second session of the 106th Congress, the Administration's FY2000 DOD budget proposal sought authority to close more military bases in 2003 and 2005. Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre and Secretary of Defense Cohen emphasized the need for base closures to save costs and improve military capabilities. Despite their efforts, Congress chose not to authorize any new rounds of closures in 2000. In the second session of the 106th Congress, the Administration sought authority to close military bases in 2003 and 2005 to save costs and improve military capabilities. However, Congress did not authorize any new rounds of closures in 2000. In the early stages of the 107th Congress, Senators Levin and McCain introduced a bill to authorize two new rounds of base closures in 2003 and 2005, which was rejected in a Senate vote. The Taxpayers for Common Sense organization supported the initiative, estimating savings of billions by closing excess military bases. The Administration proposed closing military bases in 2003 and 2005 to save costs and improve capabilities. The Taxpayers for Common Sense estimated savings of billions by closing excess bases. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison expressed concerns about closing more domestic bases prematurely. The Department of Defense urged Congress to approve another round of base closures due to excess capacity. The Department of Defense proposed a new round of base closures and consolidations in 2003 to address excess capacity. The term \"BRAC\" was replaced by the \"Efficient Facilities Initiative of 2001 (EFI)\" and a new approach was introduced based on the Brooks Air Force Base demonstration project. The Senate Armed Services Committee grappled with two base closure proposals before ultimately agreeing on a plan. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended a new round of base closures and realignments in 2003, with a vote of 17 to 8 in favor. The full Senate approved the proposal by a margin of 53 to 47, citing the need to convert excess infrastructure into war-fighting ability due to the current struggle with terrorist groups. The Senate approved a proposal for new base closures and realignments in 2003 to convert excess infrastructure into war-fighting ability amid the current struggle with terrorist groups. Supporters emphasized the importance of prioritizing military resources for combating terrorism, while opponents argued against closing bases during the war on terrorism and uncertain economy. The House and Senate leaders faced a stalemate over base closures in the FY2002 defense authorization bill. After weeks of negotiations, a compromise was reached on December 10, 2001, and the President signed the bill into law on December 28, 2001. The compromise retained most of the 1990 BRAC Act language but included some important changes. Congress extended the authority for one new round of base closures in 2005, and the Secretary of Defense was required to submit a plan. The 2005 BRAC Act extends the authority for one new round of base closures and realignments. The Secretary of Defense must submit a force structure plan, review all types of installations, and certify the need for closure or realignment based on military value and cost savings. The 2005 BRAC Act extends the authority for one new round of base closures and realignments. The Secretary of Defense must certify annual net savings within six years, prioritize military value in recommendations, increase commission members to 9, allow Sec/Def to testify on proposed base additions, prohibit privatization-in-place unless recommended by the commission, and announce the need for closure rounds in 1999 and 2001. In 2001, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld won approval from Congress for a new round of base closures. Communities near military bases are concerned about survival, developing defensive and offensive strategies to keep units/functions at home or acquire them from other areas. \"Range encroachment\" is a growing concern for bases, as urban growth and other factors may impact their desirability. Range encroachment is a serious concern for communities near military bases, as it may de-value installations and make them prime candidates for closure in 2005. The process involves bases being hemmed in by urban growth, competition for air space, and protection of endangered species. The BRAC timeline for 2005 closure includes criteria published by the Secretary of Defense and a process where the President prepares a report for Congress to approve or disapprove within 45 days."
