    "content": "The Department of Defense was funded by continuing resolutions until FY2011, when an omnibus funding bill was signed on April 15, 2011, providing $659.9 billion for DOD activities, a reduction of $18.2 billion from the President's request. Additionally, $17.8 billion was provided for DOD's military construction budget, a reduction of $2.2 billion from the President's request. H.R. 1473 provided $17.8 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs and other agencies, with reductions totaling $2.2 billion from the President's request. The bill included cuts to various DOD funds, civilian pay, and research and development corporations. Major weapons programs also saw significant reductions, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and a new ground combat vehicle for the Army. The H.R. 1473 bill made cuts to major weapons programs, including $1.7 billion from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, $473 million from a new ground combat vehicle for the Army, and $325 million from a new mid-air refueling tanker for the Air Force. The bill also added funds for various programs such as Navy strike fighters, National Guard equipment, medical research, Israeli missile defense systems, and Military Career Advancement Account program. The bill did not add funds for an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act passed by the House authorized $725.9 billion for defense activities, $2.7 million less than requested. The Senate version authorized $725.7 billion, a reduction of $240.7 million. The Senate did not act on the bill due to opposition to repealing the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The Senate rejected a motion to invoke cloture on S. 3454, known as \"don't ask, don't tell.\" A compromise version of the authorization bill (H.R. 6523) was signed into law on January 7, 2011 (P.L. 111-383), supporting President Obama's budget request. The bill did not include funds for the C-17 long-range cargo plane and authorized a 1.9% increase in basic pay for military personnel. The House-passed bill challenged Administration positions by authorizing a 1.9% increase in basic pay for military personnel and $485 million for an alternate jet engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The enacted FY2011 bill authorized a 1.4% basic pay raise and $485 million for the alternate engine. The President's FY2011 budget request included $738.7 billion for national defense, with $733.3 billion in discretionary spending. The FY2011 budget for national defense includes $733.3 billion in discretionary spending, with $5.3 billion in mandatory spending for military retirees. Additionally, $159.3 billion is allocated for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, bringing the total DOD request to $708.3 billion for FY2011. The FY2010 DOD appropriations bill included $33 billion for war costs to deploy additional troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total amount appropriated for FY2010 war costs to $162.6 billion. The FY2011 war budget request was $159.3 billion, $3 billion lower than FY2010. Additionally, $655 million was added for humanitarian relief operations in Haiti after the earthquake. The Administration amended its FY2010 DOD supplemental funding request to include $655 million for humanitarian relief operations in Haiti after the earthquake. The DOD relief effort involved deploying Navy ships, cargo flights, and military personnel. The requested FY2011 base budget would see a 3.4% increase, with real growth in purchasing power. The budget request also includes real growth in spending for other security agencies like the Department of State and Homeland Security, totaling $719.2 billion for discretionary programs. The Administration requested $719.2 billion for discretionary programs of security agencies, a 5.2% increase from FY2010. For non-security agencies, the request was $386.4 billion, a 1.5% decrease from FY2010. The $548.9 billion requested for the FY2011 DOD base budget is $18.2 billion higher than FY2010. Adjusted for inflation, the FY2011 base budget would be DOD's third largest since the end of the Korean War. The requested FY2011 base budget for DOD would be the third largest since the end of the Korean War, falling short of the 2% real growth rate needed for investments through FY2015. Secretary Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to sustain current forces with future budgets. Secretary Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to sustain current forces with future budgets. This would involve shifting funds within the budget to support combat forces while reducing spending on administrative and support activities. The goal is to cut overhead costs and transfer savings to force structure and modernization. Secretary Gates aims to reduce DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually, shifting funds from administrative and support functions to support combat units. This would provide a 3% real increase in the budget for combat-related activities. Initiatives include a 10% reduction in service support contractors and a decrease in the number of generals and admirals. Secretary Gates announced initiatives to reduce DOD's headquarters and support bureaucracies costs, including a 10% funding cut for service support contractors, reducing generals and admirals by 50, and eliminating certain DOD entities. Additionally, he introduced contracting and acquisition initiatives to increase efficiency in goods and services procurement, aiming to save $10 billion annually. The Administration implemented various contracting revisions to reward efficiency, reduce costs, and manage programs more effectively. Some Members of Congress raised concerns about the projected budget increases being insufficient, leading to potential cuts in acquisition programs. Representative Barney Frank called for reductions in the DOD budget despite exemptions from the Administration's discretionary spending freeze. Some Members object to exempting DOD from budget freeze, calling for reductions in unnecessary weapons programs and overseas military deployments. The FY2011 DOD base budget request amounts to 3.6% of GDP, marking a leveling off of the steady upward trend in DOD share of GDP since 9/11. The FY2011 DOD budget request reflects the strategy and force planning assumptions from the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). The QDRs show a shift towards preparing for a diverse array of missions, moving away from Cold War-era strategies. The budget sustains initiatives from previous years and maintains major weapons programs. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for U.S. forces to be ready for various missions, with a focus on ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Recommendations include increased funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft. Longer-term initiatives include converting a heavy Army brigade combat team into a Stryker brigade. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for U.S. forces to be ready for various missions, with a focus on ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Recommendations include increased funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft. The report also suggests converting one heavy Army brigade combat team into a Stryker brigade, with the possibility of more conversions in the future. The QDR predicts that adversaries will challenge U.S. forces asymmetrically, using unconventional tactics and technologies. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of military readiness for various missions, including ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. It challenges the notion of a conflict spectrum and highlights the use of advanced technologies by low-end terrorist groups and near-peer competitors. The report stresses the need for effective operations in cyberspace and calls for strengthening cyber defense capabilities through specific steps like developing greater expertise, centralizing command, and collaborating with other agencies for enhanced security. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of military readiness for various missions, including ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. It highlights the need for effective operations in cyberspace and calls for strengthening cyber defense capabilities through specific steps like developing greater expertise, centralizing command, and collaborating with other agencies for enhanced security. The report also emphasizes the importance of preparing U.S. forces to deal with asymmetric threats and the ability to handle multiple missions concurrently around the globe. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of preparing U.S. forces to deal with asymmetric threats like \"anti-access, area-denial\" capabilities that China and other adversaries are developing. These threats could target U.S. forward bases and naval forces, which are crucial for power projection in regions far from the U.S. homeland. This power projection is essential for U.S. alliances and stability efforts in Europe, Asia, and other regions. However, these capabilities are costly, contributing to the high U.S. defense spending. Overseas bases and naval forces may be increasingly vulnerable to missile and bomber attacks. The 2010 QDR highlights the vulnerability of U.S. power projection capabilities to anti-access strategies, such as missile and bomber attacks. Recommendations include increasing reliance on long-range strike weapons and submarines, as well as developing offensive electronic attack capabilities. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components, reflecting a 4.7% increase over FY2000. This follows a reduction in active-duty manpower that began in FY1987 and accelerated during the 1990s. Missile defense and offensive electronic attack capabilities are key measures to protect forward deployed forces. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components, reflecting a 4.7% increase over FY2000. Active duty end-strength was reduced by about one-third across each of the services during the drawdown of the early 1990s. The end strength of the Army and Marine Corps rebounded to 562,400 and 202,100, respectively, since the start of combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Congress authorized an additional increase in the Army's active duty strength, with a $1 billion budget for a 1.4% raise in basic pay effective January 1, 2011. The Basic Allowance for Housing was set to increase by 4.2% in FY2011, adding about 20% to service members' basic pay. Congress has typically approved military pay raises 0.5% higher than the ECI increase since FY2004. DOD officials argue that service members are already well-compensated compared to private sector workers, proposing to allocate funds for reenlistment bonuses instead of a higher across-the-board raise. Military advocacy groups, however, advocate for closing the pay gap between military personnel and civilians. The FY2011 DOD funding bills allowed for legislative initiatives regarding President Obama's decision to revise a 1993 law and DOD regulations. In FY2011, the DOD funding bills aimed to address the pay gap between military personnel and civilians. Legislative initiatives were introduced regarding President Obama's decision to revise a 1993 law and DOD regulations on openly homosexual individuals serving in the military. Some Members of Congress argued that openly homosexual personnel in combat units could affect cohesion and combat effectiveness. Bills were introduced in the 111th Congress to repeal the law and establish a nondiscrimination policy based on sexual orientation. Two bills introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy for service members and replace it with a nondiscrimination policy based on sexual orientation. President Obama called for the repeal of the 1993 legislation in his State of the Union Address. The Department of Defense launched a study on implementing this change, with Secretary Gates initially opposing the repeal pending the study's completion. Changes were made to enforcement procedures in March 2010, requiring higher authority to initiate investigations into homosexual conduct. Senators and a Representative proposed an amendment to the FY2011 Defense Authorization Act to repeal the 1993 law. In a letter to President Obama, Senators and a Representative proposed an amendment to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service. The amendment would be implemented after the current DOD review is completed and certified by the President, Secretary of Defense, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Administration supported the draft amendment despite preferring that congressional action wait for the DOD study to finish. The Administration supports a draft amendment to repeal the 'don't ask, don't tell' law, despite preferring to wait for the completion of the current DOD study. Federal Judge Virginia A. Phillips ruled the law unconstitutional on September 9, 2010, leading to a temporary stay by the Ninth Circuit on October 19, 2010. The FY2011 budget request for the DOD health care system included $50.7 billion. The system serves 9.5 million eligible beneficiaries through various medical facilities. The cost of the medical program is projected to increase annually at a rate of 5-7% through FY2015. The steady increase in military health care costs is attributed to factors such as more retirees using TRICARE, increased frequency of beneficiaries using DOD medical services, legislatively mandated benefit increases, and no fee increases for TRICARE since 1995. Attempts to increase enrollment fees and copayments have been blocked by Congress. The Obama Administration did not propose fee increases in 2011, but Secretary Gates expressed a desire to control costs. Secretary Gates expressed a desire to work with Congress to control TRICARE costs by considering modest increases in fees or copayments. The FY2011 budget request included an increase in funding for weapons and equipment procurement, with a shift towards production from research and development, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The FY2011 budget request included a total of $11.2 billion for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, with $4.0 billion for R&D and $7.2 billion for procurement. The Administration proposed cuts for the production of additional C-17 cargo jets and an alternate jet engine for the F-35. Congress added funding for these programs in 2009 despite the Administration's requests. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, which received a $3.2 billion request for FY2011. The Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program has faced controversy, particularly regarding the design of the proposed new Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV). The program replaced the Future Combat System (FCS) and Secretary of Defense Gates recommended cancelling the manned ground vehicle component due to design strategy concerns. The Army replaced the Future Combat System (FCS) with the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program, aiming to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017. The GCV competition was restarted in 2010 after the Army cancelled the existing competition and revised performance specifications. This decision raised concerns about rushing the development and potential risks of another unsuccessful acquisition program. The Army restarted the GCV competition in 2010 after cancelling the existing one and revising performance specifications. The FCS program elements were incorporated into the Army's Modernization program, with plans to deploy components to all 73 Army BCTs by 2025. The Navy's FY2011 budget requested funding for nine new battle force ships, including submarines, destroyers, LCSs, and amphibious assault ships. The Navy's shipbuilding plan includes various types of ships, with a total of 50 new battle force ships planned over five years. The 30-year shipbuilding plan projects a fleet growth from 284 ships in FY2011 to 315 ships in FY2020, peaking at 320 ships in FY2024 before declining. The plan does not fully support the 313-ship plan in the long run, with estimates of required funding at $15.9 billion per year in constant FY2010 dollars. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan may face funding challenges as estimates differ between the Navy and the Congressional Budget Office. The plan includes the development of next-generation ballistic missile submarines to replace the Ohio-class submarines. The Navy plans to procure 12 next-generation ballistic missile submarines, known as SSBN(X)s, to replace the current Ohio-class submarines. The program received significant funding in the Navy's budgets for research and development. The estimated cost for each SSBN(X) is $6 billion to $7 billion. Concerns have been raised about the program's impact on the affordability of the Navy's long-term shipbuilding program and potential reductions in procurement rates for other types of Navy ships. The Navy plans to procure 12 next-generation ballistic missile submarines, SSBN(X)s, to replace the Ohio-class submarines. Concerns have been raised about the program's impact on the affordability of the Navy's long-term shipbuilding program and potential reductions in procurement rates for other types of Navy ships. Options to reduce costs include procuring fewer SSBN(X)s, reducing the number of submarine-launched ballistic missiles, stretching out the procurement schedule, and increasing the Navy's shipbuilding budget. The Navy plans to procure SSBN(X) submarines, increase shipbuilding budget, and shift funding for SSBN(X) procurement. The budget proposes ending Zumwalt class destroyers, resuming Arleigh Burke class destroyers, and terminating the CG(X) cruiser program. Flight III DDG-51s will be built starting in FY2016. The Navy plans to procure Flight III DDG-51 destroyers starting in FY2016, equipped with a smaller version of the new Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR). The Aegis ballistic missile defense program aims to increase the number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships from 20 to 38 by the end of FY2015. Concerns have been raised about the growing demand for BMD-capable Aegis ships outpacing the supply, especially with the intention to use them for defense in Europe. The Aegis BMD program faces challenges as demands for BMD-capable Aegis ships are increasing faster than the supply. Concerns arise over potential strain on the Navy's ability to provide ships for non-BMD missions. Funding for the program comes from MDA and Navy budgets, with FY2011 requests totaling $2.16 billion and $457 million respectively. Congress must decide on approving the development of Flight III DDG-51 design, funding requests, and providing direction for the program. The FY2011 budget requested $1.59 billion for the Aegis BMD program to fund two Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) designed for shallow water operations with interchangeable weapons modules. The Navy accelerated its timetable to choose between two LCS designs, planning to procure 10 ships over five years. The Navy planned to select a single design for LCSs to be built over five years. Initially, the winning contractor would build 10 LCSs, with a second competition for up to five more ships. However, a new acquisition strategy was proposed to buy 10 ships from each competing industry team. There is a concern about the shortage of fighter aircraft due to the aging fleet built in the 1980s. In early 2009, the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps faced a shortage of fighter aircraft due to aging fleets from the 1980s. Concerns were raised about budget constraints affecting the procurement of replacement fighters, with projections of a shortfall of up to 800 Air Force aircraft by 2024 and over 100 Navy-Marine Corps strike fighters by 2018. The overall affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft was a key issue for Congress, with fears of a budget \"train wreck\" as funding may not meet acquisition needs. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter was highlighted as crucial for DOD's plans. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, with an estimated total acquisition cost of over $300 billion, is crucial for DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans. Concerns have been raised about the affordability of the program amidst constrained DOD resources. The Administration's FY2011 budget requested $11.3 billion for the F-35 program, including funding for research and development as well as procurement. The F-35 program faces concerns about affordability due to constrained DOD resources, with the annual production rate requiring over $10 billion in acquisition funding. The British government plans to reduce their F-35 purchase from 138 to as few as 40 planes, omitting the vertical-takeoff version. The British government plans to reduce its defense spending by purchasing as few as 40 F-35 planes, excluding the vertical-takeoff version. Congress has rejected proposals to terminate the program for an alternative engine, with approximately $2.5 billion already provided for the project. The GAO stated that the DOD estimate for the F136 engine should be seen as a range of possible costs, not an absolute amount. Critics argue that terminating the F136 engine was driven by immediate budget pressures rather than long-term considerations. They believe engine competition saved money and increased reliability. Supporters of termination claim single-source contracts are more cost-effective. Cancelling the F136 engine raises concerns about operational risks, impact on the defense industrial base, and relations with allied countries. The termination of the F136 engine raises concerns about operational risks, impact on the defense industrial base, and relations with allied countries. It also raises issues regarding the competitive market forces for DOD business, cost control, and the impact on the F-35 acquisition program. The Administration's proposed FY2011 defense budget includes funding for a new fleet of mid-air refueling tankers. The Air Force received $863.9 million for its third attempt to acquire new mid-air refueling tankers, KC-X, to replace aging KC-135 tankers. Boeing and Northrop Grumman/EADS competed to build 179 tankers, with Boeing offering a 767-based design and EADS offering an A330-based design. Bidding closed on July 9, 2010, with three offerors submitting bids. Boeing won the KC-X tanker contract in Mobile, AL, based on its 767 design. EADS did not challenge the decision. The competition was intense due to the contract's value, job creation, and tanker aircraft importance to the military. The history of previous attempts influenced the new KC-X competition. The Obama Administration dropped the plan for a modified BMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic in favor of the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) using BMD-capable Aegis ships to defend against potential ballistic missile attacks. $2.27 billion was requested in FY2011 for PAA programs, including development efforts unique to PAA and procurement of the Aegis ship-borne BMD system. The FY2011 budget includes $712 million for development unique to the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) and $1.56 billion for the Aegis ship-borne BMD system. The military construction budget for FY2011 is 20% lower than FY2010, mainly due to reduced spending on facilities for units relocating from BRAC. Military family housing budget also decreased due to privatization policy. The DOD's policy of privatizing military family housing has led to increased Basic Allowance for Housing payments to personnel. The FY2011 DOD bills were used by Congress members to oppose the Navy's plan to move a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to Mayport, FL. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review endorsed the Navy's decision to establish Mayport as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port for security reasons. The U.S. Navy plans to homeport an East Coast carrier in Mayport, Florida to mitigate risks. This move would require new nuclear support facilities and shift economic activity from Norfolk to Mayport. Congress members from Florida support the proposal, citing benefits for the Navy's Atlantic Fleet CVNs. The estimated cost of moving a CVN to Mayport is $589.7 million, including $46.3 million for dredging. Congress approved the dredging but remains skeptical about the carrier homeport. The total cost for moving a carrier to Mayport, Florida is $589.7 million, including $46.3 million for dredging. Congress approved the dredging but remains skeptical about the carrier homeport. Additionally, the Administration's budget includes $139 million for facilities on Guam for 8,000 Marines and their families moving from Okinawa. Guam is expected to receive additional military personnel by 2014-2016. The Department of Defense (DOD) plans to relocate military personnel to Guam by 2014-2016, with estimates of a potential increase in population by as much as 56,000. Concerns have been raised about the island's infrastructure supporting this influx. The Administration's budget supports the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command to centralize command of DOD networks. The reorganization of cyber forces within the Department of Defense began in 2008 to centralize command of DOD networks and coordinate their protection and operation. This included integrating offensive and defensive cyber operations under the U.S. Cyber Command, led by the director of the National Security Agency. Some view this consolidation as the militarization of cyber capabilities. The National Security Agency director was nominated to lead the new U.S. Cyber Command, which will centralize offensive and defensive cyber operations. Some concerns about militarization of cyberspace and privacy issues have been raised, but proponents argue that the command will improve organization and standardization of DOD cyber practices. The FY2011 budget includes $139 million for Cyber Command, with plans to locate it at Ft. Meade, MD. The Obama Administration aims to rebalance DOD and State Department roles in foreign assistance. The FY2011 DOD budget request includes funding for the Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISSF) for Iraqi police training, while the State Department will also take responsibility for Iraq police training in FY2012. The budget request reflects a shift in roles between DOD and the State Department in providing foreign assistance, with controversial programs like the \"Section 1207\" and Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund now funded by the State Department. The FY2011 budget includes funding for the Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISSF) for Iraqi police training, with a shift in roles between DOD and the State Department in providing foreign assistance. The Administration is reviewing security assistance authorities, with the Senate Armed Services Committee welcoming proposals for enhancing U.S. security assistance. The FY2011 budget includes funding for the Iraq Security Forces Fund for Iraqi police training, with a shift in roles between DOD and the State Department in providing foreign assistance. Secretary of Defense Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mullen emphasized the importance of advising and mentoring foreign security forces, aligning with recommendations in the Quadrennial Defense Review Report to strengthen the capability to train and advise partner nations' security forces. The FY2011 DOD budget request emphasizes the importance of combining power with diplomacy and other national instruments. Secretary Gates and Adm. Mullen advocate for bolstering civilian capabilities to assist foreign governments in conflict prevention and recovery. The budget includes funding for security assistance programs like the \"Section 1206\" program and the Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program. The relationship between defense and diplomacy is seen as essential in international relations. The FY2011 DOD budget request includes funding for various security assistance programs, such as the Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program and new initiatives like the Defense Institution Reform Initiative. Secretary Gates highlighted the need to modernize the national security system, emphasizing the importance of combining defense and diplomacy in addressing current threats. Congress is considering proposals for a pooled fund for security assistance involving DOD, State, and USAID contributions. The FY2011 DOD budget request includes funding for security assistance programs. Congress is considering a pooled fund for security assistance involving DOD, State, and USAID contributions. The House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act differ in funding amounts and provisions, including the repeal of \"don't ask, don't tell.\" The Senate rejected S. 3454, known as \"don't ask, don't tell,\" on December 9, 2010. A compromise bill, H.R. 6523, was signed into law on January 7, 2011, dropping the controversial provision. The bill authorized lump-sum totals for DOD and Energy Department budgets without specific program allocations. The defense authorization bill, H.R. 5136, S. 3454, and H.R. 6523 (P.L. 111-383) authorized a total end-strength of 1.43 million for active-duty members, with a 1.4% increase in military basic pay. The final bill did not include provisions for increased allowances for separated married personnel or those at risk of hostile fire. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the Government Accountability Office to assess DOD's use of cash incentives for recruitment and retention of qualified individuals. The final FY2011 defense authorization act did not include a provision to repeal the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military. The House and Senate considered repealing the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military, with the House passing an amendment to do so. The provision was enacted as a standalone law. The House and Senate considered repealing the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military. The Senate voted on a motion to invoke cloture on debate over the bill, which did not include a provision to repeal the ban on using military facilities for abortions. The Senate repealed a law prohibiting military facilities from performing abortions, allowing DOD to use private funds for abortions. The authorization bill did not include a provision for a pilot program allowing officers to pursue varied mid-career educational programs. The final version of the bill establishes the position of director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office, improves protocols for medical care of sexual assault victims in the military, and guarantees access to victim advocates. It does not include provisions for confidentiality of victims' communications with advocates. H.R. 6523, the final version of the bill, guarantees access to victim advocates for sexual assault victims in the military. It does not include provisions for confidentiality of victims' communications with advocates, legal assistance, or a hotline for reporting sexual assaults. The bill also requires the Secretary of Defense to evaluate the feasibility of allowing victims to receive assistance from military legal counsel. Additionally, the bill authorizes the Administration's $50.7 billion budget request for DOD's health care program, without increases in TRICARE fees and pharmacy copayments. The final version of the bill, H.R. 6523, includes provisions similar to prior years, prohibiting TRICARE fee increases and pharmacy copayments. It allows TRICARE beneficiaries to extend coverage to dependent children up to age 26. The bill does not include a provision for a unified medical command but includes requirements for training programs for officers in the services' medical corps. The final version of H.R. 6523 included provisions related to TRICARE, training programs for officers in the medical corps, and responses to incidents at Fort Hood and a recruiting station in Little Rock. It did not include provisions for special compensation for victims of these incidents. The House provision not included in the final bill would have provided special compensation to persons killed or wounded in terrorist attacks targeting service members or DOD civilians affiliated with the U.S. military. It also required the Secretary of Defense to allocate up to $100 million for implementing recommendations from a panel analyzing the Fort Hood incident. Both the House-passed and Senate committee bills supported ballistic missile defense activities, authorizing slightly more than the $10.3 billion requested, with additional funds allocated. The House and Senate authorized over $10.3 billion for missile defense, with additional funds added by H.R. 5136 and S. 3454. H.R. 6523 specifically allocated $205 million for Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system. The bill did not specify funding for other programs in the missile defense plan. Funding levels for specific programs are detailed in Table A-2. The bill also affirmed the New START treaty with Russia. The final version of the authorization bill requires a DOD report on the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for defending Europe against long-range ballistic missiles. It also places restrictions on the PAA similar to those applied to the Bush plan, limiting deployment in Europe of defenses against medium-range and long-range missiles. The final version of the authorization bill requires a DOD report on the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for defending Europe against long-range ballistic missiles. It places restrictions on the PAA, limiting deployment in Europe of defenses against medium-range and long-range missiles. The bill allows the Secretary of Defense to waive provisions in the interest of national security and authorizes the establishment of a shared ballistic missile early warning system with the Czech Republic. The final version of the authorization bill includes provisions for a shared ballistic missile early warning system with the Czech Republic and statements regarding missile interception capabilities and strategic stability with Russia. It does not include provisions from the House bill that would have delayed U.S. nuclear weapons reduction. The final version of the authorization bill includes provisions for a shared ballistic missile early warning system with the Czech Republic and statements regarding missile interception capabilities and strategic stability with Russia. It also bars the reduction of U.S. nuclear weapons below the limits set by the New START Treaty until a joint report is submitted to Congress justifying the proposed cuts. The bill expresses concerns about the Administration's Nuclear Posture Review weakening U.S. security. The budget request includes funding for Navy shipbuilding programs such as DDG-51 Aegis destroyers, Virginia-class attack submarines, Littoral Combat Ships, and other vessels. The budget request includes funding for Navy shipbuilding programs, such as destroyers, attack submarines, combat ships, a troop carrier, an oceanographic research ship, and funding for aircraft carriers and helicopter carriers. Incremental funding is common for expensive ships, but it is an anomaly in the congressional appropriations process. H.R. 6523 allows for the incremental funding of a helicopter carrier over two years, with a provision for a report on the impact of using cruisers and destroyers for anti-ballistic missile defense. The final authorization bill did not include provisions to prevent a decline in the fleet size, such as blocking the retirement of large helicopter carriers without replacements and limiting the number of ship retirements compared to new vessels. The Senate committee directed assessments on the Navy's shipbuilding plans and their impact on the Marine Corps's ability for amphibious landings. Navy and Marine Corps leaders agreed that 33 amphibious landing ships would be adequate for two brigade-sized assault landings, despite the ideal number being 38. The Navy and Marine Corps leaders have agreed that 33 amphibious landing ships would be adequate for two brigade-sized assault landings, despite the ideal number being 38. The Senate committee expressed concerns about cost increases and construction delays potentially hindering the Navy's goal of 33 ships. The FY2011 defense authorization bill did not address the Navy's plan to replace its Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines with the new SSBN(X) submarines, which are expected to absorb a significant portion of the Navy's shipbuilding budgets after 2016. The final version of the bill approved a lump-sum authorization for Navy R&D without specifying allocations for specific programs. The final version of the authorization bill approved a lump-sum authorization for Navy R&D without specifying allocations for specific programs. The bill did not include a provision to bar the Navy from obligating more than half of the money until certain information is submitted. Funds were not authorized to continue production of the C-17 cargo jet, despite previous budget additions. The bill also addressed concerns about cost overruns in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and included a provision requiring DOD to create a detailed plan. The final authorization bill included provisions addressing cost overruns in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. It required DOD to create a detailed plan for ongoing progress assessment. The bill did not limit the number of F-35s procured in FY2011 until cost and performance milestones were met. Both the House and Senate versions authorized $11 billion for F-35 development and 42 plane purchases, rejecting an additional $205 million request for a replacement fighter lost in combat operations. The House Armed Services Committee noted that the Air Force could replace a lost fighter by continuing to operate another fighter of the same type. The House-passed bill included $485 million for an alternate jet engine for the F-35, while the Senate committee's bill did not provide additional funds for the second engine. The final bill did not take a specific position on the additional funding for the alternate engine. Secretary Gates intended to recommend a veto if the defense bill funded the alternate F-35 engine. In May 2010, Secretary Gates reaffirmed his intention to veto any defense bill funding the alternate F-35 engine due to concerns about program delays and unwise drop in carrier-borne fighters. Both House and Senate committees proposed adding funds for additional F/A-18E/F fighters to address the \"strike fighter gap.\" The enacted bill does not specify the number of planes authorized. The enacted bill does not allocate authorization totals among specific programs or authorize a specific number of planes. It includes a provision requiring the Navy to report on dealing with the strike fighter gap. The bill also authorizes funds for the development of the KC-X mid-air refueling tanker, with EADS and Boeing competing for the contract. The House adopted an amendment requiring DOD to consider any unfair competitive advantage in the bidding process. The provision in the House amendment required DOD to consider any unfair competitive advantage in the bidding process for the KC-X mid-air refueling tanker contract. This was based on concerns about government subsidies given to EADS for its commercial airliners, potentially giving them an unfair advantage. Ultimately, Boeing's tanker design was selected, and EADS chose not to challenge the decision. Both H.R. 5136 and S. 3454 would deny authorization for part of the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program. The House and Senate committees denied authorization for part of the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, cutting funding for the Non-Line of Sight missile program and trimming back the Army's plan. The authorization bill did not specify funding levels for the projects within the BCT program, but both versions authorized funds for the development of a new family of Ground Combat Vehicles. The House and Senate committees did not allocate specific funding levels to the projects in the BCT program. They authorized $934.4 million for the BCT Modernization program to develop a new family of Ground Combat Vehicles. The House Armed Services Committee recommended a less technologically ambitious approach for the new combat vehicle program, focusing on basic requirements and potential upgrades. The Army was urged to consider upgrading its current fleet of combat vehicles to meet GCV requirements. DOD reduced its FY2011 GCV funding request to $461 million. The enacted authorization bill did not provide details on individual program funding but was said to fully fund the program. The House Armed Services Committee's press release on the enacted bill stated that H.R. 6523 fully funded the Administration's adjusted request of $461 million for the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program. The bill did not include a provision to prevent funds from being used for planning and designing structures at the Naval Station in Mayport, FL for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. Additionally, the House committee directed the GAO to assess the costs of homeporting a carrier in Mayport and requested a report from the Navy on alternative options for using the Mayport naval facilities. H.R. 6523 authorized $176.0 billion for military construction on Guam, reducing funds for Marine Corps units redeployment from Okinawa. The bill approved funds for improving access roads and wharves but denied funding for a Marine base and aviation facilities. It did not authorize $70.0 million for a military hospital replacement but approved $50.3 million for Air Force projects and $19.0 million for a National Guard Readiness Center. The bill did not include a provision to assist Guam with increased municipal services costs. The House-passed version of H.R. 6523 did not include a provision to assist Guam with increased municipal services costs. It also prohibits the transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees to U.S. territory or foreign governments without certification from the Secretary of Defense. The final version of H.R. 6523 prohibits the transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees to U.S. territory or foreign governments without certification from the Secretary of Defense. It also bars the use of funds to build or modify facilities for detainees at Guantanamo Bay and requires a report on transferring detainees to alternative sites. Additionally, the bill addresses the \"Global Train and Equip\" program funding request for FY2011. The House-passed version of the authorization bill for the \"Global Train and Equip\" program in FY2011 would have increased funding to $500 million, extended program authorization through FY2012, and required DOD to transfer $75 million to build counterterrorism forces in Yemen. The House Armed Services Committee recognized Yemen as a \"strategic partner\" in combating Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The provision in the bill would expand the Section 1206 program to support police agencies for domestic law enforcement. The Senate committee bill would not increase the $350 million cap on funding but create a separate authority for the Secretary of Defense to provide up to $75 million in assistance to the Yemen Ministry of the Interior for counterterrorism operations against Al Qaeda. The final version of the authorization bill authorizes up to $75 million in assistance to the Yemen Ministry of the Interior for counterterrorism operations against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. It also includes a provision for the Secretary of Defense to use up to $150 million of Army funds to support stability operations in Afghanistan. The final version of the bill authorizes assistance to Yemen Ministry of the Interior for counterterrorism operations against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and allows the Secretary of Defense to use Army funds for stability operations in Afghanistan.

The final version of the bill includes provisions related to cybersecurity, requiring the development of a tailored acquisition process for cyberspace and continuous monitoring of DOD computer networks for security and FISMA compliance. It also mandates annual reports to Congress on cyber attack damages and net assessments of cyberwar capabilities. The bill did not include a provision for a National Office for Cyberspace with government-wide coordination responsibilities. The House and Senate did not agree on a FY2011 budget resolution, leading to spending caps being adopted through other procedures. The House set a one-year cap on discretionary spending, with the Defense Subcommittee receiving $523.9 billion, $7 billion less than requested. The Senate did not adopt an overall ceiling on FY2011 discretionary spending. The Senate Budget Committee approved a FY2011 budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 60), but it was not considered by the Senate.

The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee approved a FY2011 DOD Appropriations bill totaling $671.0 billion, with $513.3 billion for the base budget and $157.7 billion for war costs. The subcommittee did not release the full text of the bill or detailed recommendations. The subcommittee bill for war costs would have provided $157.7 billion, a reduction of $253 million from the request. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill for FY2011 DOD appropriations totaling $669.9 billion, including $512.2 billion for the base budget and $157.7 billion for war costs.

The Senate debated the bill but laid it aside on March 9, 2011. An alternative funding measure was rejected, and on April 15, 2011, the President signed an omnibus funding bill. The Inouye amendment, part of the omnibus funding bill (H.R. 1473), provided $503.1 billion for base budget programs funded by the annual defense appropriations bill. The bill allocated $502.4 billion for the base budget and $677.7 billion for all DOD funding, including military construction and war costs, resulting in a $20.1 billion reduction from the President's request for FY2011 DOD appropriations. The omnibus funding bill (H.R. 1473) allocated $4.4 billion in reductions to the President's DOD budget request, including cuts to various programs and projects.
