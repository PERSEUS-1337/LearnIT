    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Multiple Punitive Damages Fairness Act\" and includes sections on the short title, table of contents, findings, purpose, definitions, general rule, applicability, preemption, jurisdiction of Federal courts, and effective date. The Congress finds that multiple punitive damages can deprive defendants of assets, impact settlements, result in unfair punishment for the same conduct, and dissipate assets for future compensatory claims. The Congress finds that multiple punitive damages can result in unfair punishment for the same conduct, impact settlements, and hinder the resolution of mass tort claims involving numerous injured claimants. Federal and State courts lack the authority to address issues caused by multiple punitive damages, while individual State legislatures can only offer a partial remedy. Individual State legislatures have limited power to address issues with multiple punitive damages as they cannot control awards in other states. The purpose of this Act is to address the issue of multiple punitive damages in interstate commerce by providing a fair and balanced resolution. It defines punitive damages as those awarded to punish or deter specific behavior demonstrating conscious indifference to safety or welfare. The term \"claimant\" includes individuals bringing civil actions, their decedents, parents, or guardians in cases involving minors or incompetents. SEC. 6. GENERAL RULE. Punitive damages are generally prohibited in civil actions if they have already been awarded against the defendant for the same act. However, punitive damages may be awarded if substantial new evidence of additional wrongful behavior is presented or if the previous award was deemed insufficient to punish or deter similar behavior in the future. The court may impose limitations on the award of punitive damages in such cases. The court may award punitive damages to deter wrongful conduct, with limitations on the award including specific findings of fact, reduction based on previous punitive damages paid, and prohibition of disclosure to the jury. SEC. 7 of the Act applies to civil actions seeking punitive damages for the same conduct where punitive damages have already been awarded, except for cases involving damages awarded under specific statutes. The Act preempts any Federal or State laws on punitive damages recovery, and Federal courts do not have jurisdiction over civil actions under this Act. SEC. 8 of the Act specifies that it will take effect upon enactment and will apply to civil actions pending or commenced on or after that date, including actions where harm occurred before the enactment date."
