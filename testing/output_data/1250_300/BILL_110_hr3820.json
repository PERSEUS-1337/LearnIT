    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Motor Vehicle Advanced Safety Technology Tax Act of 2007\". Congress finds that commercial motor vehicle crashes are a major concern in the United States, with large trucks being 2.6 times more likely to result in fatalities compared to passenger cars. In 2005, 5,212 individuals died and 114,000 were injured in large truck-related crashes, totaling 25,533 fatalities from 2001 to 2005. These crashes not only result in human loss but also impose a significant economic cost on society. In the United States, there have been 25,533 large truck-related fatalities, costing society $230.6 billion annually. Investments in advanced safety technologies aim to reduce commercial vehicle crash rates. The Department of Transportation aims to decrease the traffic fatality rate to 1.0 per hundred million vehicle miles traveled by 2011. The Department of Transportation aims to reduce the traffic fatality rate to 1.0 per hundred million vehicle miles traveled by 2011. Congress finds it beneficial to increase the deployment of advanced vehicle safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles through tax incentives to mitigate the societal cost of crashes. SEC. 3. CREDIT FOR ADVANCED COMMERCIAL VEHICLE SAFETY SYSTEMS. This section introduces a new tax credit for commercial vehicle advanced safety systems under the Internal Revenue Code to promote the deployment of advanced safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles. The commercial vehicle advanced safety system credit allows a 50% credit for the cost of qualified systems placed in service during the taxable year. Limitations include a maximum credit of $1,500 per system, $3,500 per vehicle, and a total of $350,000 per taxpayer. The goal is to promote the deployment of advanced safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles. The credit for qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety systems is capped at $350,000 per taxpayer. These systems include brake stroke monitoring, lane departure warning, collision warning, and vehicle stability systems, or any system identified by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as enhancing safety. The system must be certified by the manufacturer. The qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety system must be certified by the manufacturer or installer, appropriate for the vehicle, properly installed, and have its original use with the taxpayer. The qualified commercial vehicle must have a certified advanced safety system properly installed and functioning before first use by the taxpayer. The system must have its original use with the taxpayer, and depreciation or amortization is allowable. A qualified commercial vehicle is defined as a highway motor vehicle used for commerce with a gross weight rating of 26,001 pounds or more, or a seating capacity of at least 15 individuals. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of a brake stroke monitoring system and a lane departure warning system for commercial vehicles. The brake stroke monitoring system uses electronic sensors to detect brake issues, while the lane departure warning system alerts drivers of lane deviations. The curr_chunk defines various safety systems for vehicles, including lane departure warning, collision warning, and vehicle stability systems. These systems alert drivers of lane deviations, potential collisions, and intervene to prevent rollovers or instability. The curr_chunk discusses automatic interventions in vehicles to prevent rollovers or instability by adjusting speed or applying brakes. It also addresses how controlled groups are treated as a single taxpayer and outlines special rules for reducing property basis and recapturing credits. The curr_chunk discusses the reduction of credits allowable under subsection (a) and the recapture of credits for property no longer eligible. It also specifies that no credit is allowed for property used outside the United States or by tax-exempt entities. The curr_chunk explains that the person selling property for use by another entity must disclose any allowable credits, and certain subsections do not apply to the seller. Additionally, a taxpayer can choose not to take a credit for a qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety system. Supporting documentation is required for the credit to be allowed. The qualified commercial vehicle owner must provide supporting documentation as required by the Secretary, including details of the advanced safety system purchased and installed on the vehicle. Certification is necessary for the credit to be allowed. The section outlines requirements for the commercial vehicle advanced safety system credit, including certification and documentation needed for the credit to be allowed. Amendments are made to the general business credit and other sections of the tax code to accommodate this new credit. Amendments are made to the tax code to accommodate the commercial vehicle advanced safety system credit, including adding a new paragraph and updating subsections. The tax code is amended to include a credit for commercial vehicle advanced safety systems, effective for property placed in service after the enactment of the Act."
