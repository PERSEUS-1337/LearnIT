    "content": "The federal K-12 education legislation, starting from the Improving America's Schools Act in 1994 to the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001, has focused on granting flexibility to grantees. This flexibility allows for waivers of federal program requirements for state and local aid recipients who meet certain criteria. The report provides an overview of these authorizations and will be updated as needed to reflect new developments. The federal K-12 education legislation grants flexibility to state and local aid recipients by waiving federal program requirements for those meeting eligibility criteria. This flexibility includes provisions for consolidating programs, transferring funds, and waiving specific requirements under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). However, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is not included in these flexibility authorities. The report discusses federal involvement in K-12 education through the ESEA, excluding the IDEA. It reviews program requirements, special flexibility authorities, and cross-cutting issues. The 110th Congress is considering amending and extending the ESEA, with updates on legislative developments provided regularly. The report examines federal involvement in K-12 education through the ESEA, focusing on program requirements and special flexibility authorities. It discusses accountability requirements and the balance between specific requirements and flexibility in federal education programs. Federal K-12 education programs focus on student populations with special needs, specific instructional services, innovative approaches, or subject areas. These programs are often referred to as \"categorical\" programs due to their targeted focus. The federal K-12 education programs are categorized as either \"categorical\" programs or as block grants. There are federal requirements and non-regulatory policy guidance for state and local recipients of federal aid. Program regulations, published in the Federal Register and integrated into the Code of Federal Regulations, supplement statutory language for complex issues prioritized by the U.S. Department of Education. Non-regulatory policy guidance, such as \"Dear Colleague\" letters, is also provided for many programs. Non-regulatory guidance, such as \"Dear Colleague\" letters, provides extensive Q&A on program aspects or specific policies from the U.S. Secretary of Education. Grantees are not required to follow this guidance, but may perceive it as equivalent to regulations, leading to potential challenges in the use of federal aid. Competitive priorities set by ED for grant programs also offer preferential consideration for certain applications. The \"competitive priorities\" established by ED for grant programs offer preferential consideration for certain applications, although not required. These priorities are typically published in the announcement of the grant competition in the Federal Register, and are not regulations. There has been a trend towards less voluminous regulations for federal education programs in recent years. The Department of Education has been publishing fewer regulations for federal education programs, with some programs having no regulations at all. The regulations that are published are shorter and cover fewer issues compared to before the early 1990s. For example, regulations for ESEA Title I-A focus on standards, assessments, accountability, schoolwide programs, private school participation, and fund allocation within states and LEAs. The trend towards minimal regulations has been embraced since the NCLB of 2001, with the Secretary regulating only when necessary. The Department of Education has been reducing regulations for federal education programs since the NCLB of 2001. Regulations are now focused on specific topics under ESEA Title I-A, with an emphasis on providing guidance for flexibility and clarification. The goal is to inform schools, parents, and other stakeholders about different approaches to meet program requirements and establish accountability for federal aid funds. LEAs and aid grantees must demonstrate accountability for federal grant funds by focusing on target, outcome, and fiscal accountability. Target accountability ensures funds benefit eligible localities and pupils for equal educational opportunities. Outcome accountability focuses on improving student achievement and K-12 instruction quality. Fiscal accountability ensures federal funds supplement, not replace, state or local funds. Accountability for federal aid funds involves assuring financial integrity, targeting resources on high-need pupil groups, limiting fund uses to high priority services, enhancing parental participation, implementing staff qualifications, reporting program activities to parents, meeting student achievement goals, and evaluating instructional services. Violations may result in fund repayment or grant disqualification. The regulations for federally supported instructional services include consequences for violations, such as fund repayment or grant disqualification. These regulations cover various aspects, including financial management, civil rights, and privacy of student records. LEAs participating in federal child nutrition programs must also adhere to specific requirements. LEAs participating in federal child nutrition programs must comply with various requirements, such as providing free or reduced-price school lunches to low-income students. Additionally, federal regulations from agencies other than the Department of Education may apply to LEAs and schools as employers. State and local educational agencies have flexibility in areas like grade levels and instructional techniques, with requirements for instructional methods typically broad and allowing for state and local discretion. The ESEA and related programs have broad requirements, allowing for state and LEA discretion. Complaints about program-specific requirements focus on prohibitions against commingling funds, restrictions on resource use, targeting aid, eligibility thresholds, and outcome accountability. Prohibitions against commingling funds aim to establish fiscal accountability. The ESEA Title I-A programs have prohibitions against commingling funds, restrictions on resource use, targeting aid, eligibility thresholds, and outcome accountability requirements under the NCLB. These measures aim to ensure fiscal accountability and focus federal funds on those with the greatest needs. The outcome accountability requirements are intended to improve the effectiveness of federally supported education services. However, state and local perspectives may find these requirements inflexible, especially for smaller LEAs receiving grants from multiple federal programs. The traditional federal categorical approach in education programs has been criticized for potentially leading to fragmented instruction and focusing more on targeting resources rather than improving outcomes. This approach may result in challenges such as inefficient resource use, fragmented services for children, and instruction in separate settings that may not be the most effective. The traditional federal categorical approach in education programs has been criticized for leading to fragmented instruction and focusing more on resources than improving outcomes. Difficulties may arise from implementing federal programs in states with varying policies and conditions, leading to misunderstandings of federal requirements and constraints on the use of funds by state and local education officials. State and local education officials sometimes complain about constraints on the use of federal funds, including difficulties in obtaining current, accurate information on federal requirements. LEA staff often express concerns about the costs of meeting administrative responsibilities under federal K-12 education assistance. LEA staff often express concerns about the costs of meeting administrative responsibilities under federal K-12 education programs, including required reports and timelines. Authorities allow waivers for federal program requirements, but with limitations and accountability measures. Some federal programs offer waivers on a case-by-case basis or through \"blanket\" authority, with varying levels of accountability for pupil outcomes. Different types of flexibility in fund usage are provided under Ed-Flex, Secretarial waivers, schoolwide program authority, Innovative Programs block grant, and flexibility for small, rural LEAs. These authorities were established before the NCLB of 2001. Under Ed-Flex, the Department of Education can delegate authority to states to waive certain requirements under ESEA programs. The Ed-Flex authority was initially granted to 12 states in 1994 and expanded to a maximum of 12 states in 1996. It was modified in 1999, amended in 2001, and extended in 2006. Currently, no state has been granted Ed-Flex authority since January 2002. The Ed-Flex authority was initially granted to 12 states in 1994 and expanded to a maximum of 12 states in 1996. Currently, 10 states have Ed-Flex status under P.L. 106-25. No state has been granted Ed-Flex authority since January 2002, and the authority for additional states expired in FY2004. Recent congressional action (P.L. 109-211) addressed the expiration of authority for the 10 Ed-Flex states by January 2007. States with Ed-Flex authority as of September 30, 2004 retain that authority until reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. States participating in Ed-Flex must waive state and federal requirements affecting LEAs and schools. States participating in Ed-Flex must waive state and federal requirements affecting LEAs and schools, commit to curriculum and performance standards under ESEA Title I-A, monitor performance, and report outcomes to ED. Ed-Flex applies to various federal programs including Education for the Disadvantaged, Teacher Training, Safe Schools, and Innovative Programs. The Ed-Flex program allows states to waive certain state and federal requirements for education programs, including those under ESEA Title I-A, such as Education for the Disadvantaged, Teacher Training, Safe Schools, and Innovative Programs. Additionally, participating states can waive administrative requirements for programs like State and Local Technology Grants, Emergency Immigrant Education Act, Safe and Drug-Free Schools, and Innovative Programs, as well as the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. The Ed-Flex program allows states to waive certain state and federal requirements for education programs, including fiscal accountability, equitable participation by private school pupils and teachers, parental involvement, allocation of funds, school selection requirements, and civil rights requirements. LEAs or schools requesting waivers in Ed-Flex states must apply to their SEA, providing necessary information. SEAs may not waive requirements applicable to themselves and must ensure that the underlying purposes of the statutory requirements are still met. Local waivers can be terminated if student performance is inadequate or declines. The Ed-Flex program allows states to waive certain education program requirements, but must ensure that the purposes of the statutory requirements are still met. Local waivers can be terminated if student performance is inadequate or declines, with states required to submit annual reports on waivers granted. ED is to make state reports available to Congress and the public, summarizing the effects of waivers on student performance. The Ed-Flex program allows states to waive education program requirements, with annual reports on waivers granted. Waivers can be terminated if student performance declines. Another type of flexibility authority involves waivers granted by the U.S. Secretary of Education on a case-by-case basis. The most commonly used waiver authority is in Title IX, Part D of the ESEA, allowing the Secretary to waive most requirements associated with any program authorized by the ESEA. Requests for waivers must include specific educational goals and methods for measuring progress. The ESEA Title IX-D waiver authority allows for waivers of most requirements associated with any program authorized by the ESEA, requested by SEAs, LEAs, Indian tribes, or schools. Certain requirements cannot be waived, including prohibitions on ESEA funds in state school finance programs, use of funds for religious worship or instruction, certain prohibitions on sex education funding, and eligibility requirements for charter schools under the Public Charter Schools program. The ESEA Title IX-D waiver authority allows for waivers of most requirements associated with any program authorized by the ESEA, requested by SEAs, LEAs, Indian tribes, or schools. Waivers granted under this authority may not exceed four years and can be extended if they contribute to improved student achievement. The Secretary of Education must publish a notice of the decision to grant a waiver in the Federal Register. The Department of Education failed to publish notices of waivers granted under ESEA Title IX-D for several years. A total of 197 waivers were granted between 2002 and 2006, with most being waivers of administrative cost limitations for Indian education grants. Other waivers were related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, growth models for progress, and providing supplemental educational services. The pilot program allowed LEAs to provide supplemental educational services (SES) instead of school choice in schools during their first year of improvement under ESEA Title I-A. General programmatic waivers allowed exceptions to fiscal accountability and school selection requirements. The Secretary is required to submit annual reports on waivers' effects. Another waiver authority affects schools in the Public Charter Schools program. The Public Charter Schools (PCS) program under ESEA Title V, Part B allows waivers with broader authority than other waiver programs. Schools with 40% or more low-income students can use federal funds flexibly in schoolwide programs. In schoolwide programs, federal aid from Title I-A and other K-12 education programs can be used to improve services for all students, not just the most disadvantaged. These programs are exempt from certain regulations, but funds must supplement, not replace, other sources of funding. The IDEA requirements must still be met in schoolwide programs. In schoolwide programs, flexibility in fund use is allowed for the IDEA, but all program requirements must still be met. This flexibility is most significant for Title I-A programs, as other programs typically focus on LEAs rather than individual schools. Title I-A funds can be combined with state and local funds without separate accounting, providing significant flexibility compared to targeted assistance programs. Few additional requirements are imposed on schoolwide programs. The eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs was reduced from 50% to 40% of pupils from low-income families by the NCLB, allowing more high poverty schools to operate schoolwide programs. This increased flexibility in fund use is significant for Title I-A programs, as it allows funds to be used to serve all disadvantaged pupils in the school, rather than just the lowest achieving individuals. The NCLB has reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs, allowing more high poverty schools to operate them. This increased flexibility in fund use is significant for Title I-A programs, as it allows funds to serve all disadvantaged pupils in the school. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) under ESEA Title VI-B provides flexibility for small, rural LEAs to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) under ESEA Title VI-B allows small, rural LEAs to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs for various educational activities. This flexibility is relevant for LEAs with low attendance or located in sparsely populated rural areas. The REAP Flex authority allows small, rural LEAs to combine and transfer funds among selected ESEA programs to support effective educational activities. This flexibility is necessary due to the small size of grants received by these LEAs, which may not be sufficient to support separate programs. The authority applies to 100% of funds under the affected programs, providing special flexibility to ensure effective use of resources. The small, rural LEA authority allows for the transfer of funds among selected ESEA programs, providing flexibility to support effective educational activities. Participation in REAP Flex is widespread, with approximately 4,781 LEAs eligible and an estimated 51% participating in the rural LEA flexibility authority in 2005-2006. Funds are often transferred out of Teacher and Principal Training and Safe and Drug-Free Schools programs, and into Education for the Disadvantaged and Innovative Programs block grant. Rural LEAs frequently transfer funds from ESEA Titles II-A and IV-A into Titles I-A and V-A due to small formula allocations, finding the flexibility of REAP Flex beneficial. There is confusion between REAP Flex and general Transferability authority at the LEA level. ESEA Title V-A, Innovative Programs, is considered a block grant in K-12 education. ESEA Title V-A is a block grant program in K-12 education that provides flexibility to states and LEAs in using funds. It was consolidated in 1981 and funds are allocated based on population aged 5-17 years. The majority of funds must be allocated to LEAs based on state-developed formulas considering enrollment in public and private schools. Title V-A funds must be allocated by SEAs to LEAs based on state-developed formulas, considering enrollment in public and private schools. Formulas must prioritize high-cost pupils, including those from economically disadvantaged families and those in sparsely populated or poverty-stricken areas. States must suballocate at least 85% of the grant received in FY2002 to LEAs, with variations based on funding levels. States can retain a small percentage of funds, with most required to suballocate 100% of grants above the FY2002 level to LEAs. States are required to suballocate 100% of their Title V-A grants above the FY2002 level to LEAs, with a minimum share of 50% for states receiving the minimum grant amount. Of the funds retained by states, only 15% can be used for administrative costs, with the rest allocated to specified programs and services. LEAs can use their funds for various innovative assistance programs, including charter schools and same-gender classrooms. LEAs can use Title V-A funds for a variety of innovative assistance programs, including charter schools, same-gender classrooms, school nurses, education reform projects, and programs to improve academic achievement. The program was first enacted in 1981 as Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act, consolidating multiple federal K-12 education programs. Title V-A is considered a block grant due to its broad categories of authorized fund use and prohibits SEAs from influencing LEA decisions on fund usage. The Title V-A program, authorized by ESEA in 1981, consolidated federal K-12 education programs. A study found that 58% of LEAs used funds for instructional materials, 39% for educational technology, and 34% for academic services. Based on a survey of LEAs, 58% used Title V-A funds for instructional materials, 39% for educational technology, and 34% for academic services. Large LEAs favored teacher professional development and school improvement efforts. Funding for high-need pupils or schools was limited. Appropriations for Title V-A have sharply declined over the years, with zero funds allocated in FY2008, possibly leading to the program's termination. The FY2008 Act provides zero funds for Title V-A, possibly leading to the program's termination. Limited support and lack of demonstrated impact have contributed to the decline in funding. Funds have been supplemented through other authorities, but the program faces challenges in demonstrating targeting of funds and improved educational outcomes. ESEA Title V-A was amended by NCLB to require states to submit annual summaries on how funding contributes to improving student achievement. SEAs and LEAs can increase Title V-A funding by transferring funds from other federal programs. Additional provisions provide increased flexibility, but their impact is marginal compared to the flexibility authorities described above. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) introduced various flexibility authorities for ESEA programs, including the ability for LEAs to transfer funds among different programs. These authorities, found in Parts B and C of ESEA Title IX, focus on administrative convenience for SEAs and LEAs. Additionally, NCLB expanded existing flexibility measures, such as lowering eligibility thresholds for schoolwide programs under ESEA Title I-A. The NCLB amendments allow LEAs to transfer up to 50% of their formula grants among four ESEA programs. LEAs failing to meet AYP requirements can transfer only 30% of their grants for AYP-related activities. States can transfer up to 50% of program funds among specified programs, excluding administrative funds. The NCLB amendments allow LEAs to transfer up to 50% of their formula grants among four ESEA programs, with states having authority over the funds. The Transferability authority is limited for states as they cannot transfer funds required for LEAs or state administration. The total appropriations for the programs subject to LEA Transferability authority amount to approximately $3.5 billion. The process is simple and does not require specific approval, but transferred funds must still adhere to program requirements. The Transferability authority allows LEAs to shift up to 50% of their formula grants among ESEA programs, with states overseeing the funds. Participation is low, with 12-16% of LEAs involved in 2005-2006. Confusion exists between REAP Flex and Transferability authorities at the LEA level. Many LEAs participate in Transferability, moving funds between ESEA programs like Title II-A and Title IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A. Reasons for not participating include lack of information, satisfaction with existing flexibility, or insufficient funding levels. The new State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act allows up to seven states to consolidate their state administration and activity funds under various ESEA programs for five years. This \"State-Flex\" authority grants flexibility in fund usage beyond the activities authorized by the programs. States must meet state AYP to retain this authority. States granted flexibility under the State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act can use funds for any ESEA program purpose for five years. They must meet state AYP requirements to maintain this authority. Selected states must enter agreements with 4-10 LEAs, with at least half serving high-poverty populations. LEAs can consolidate funds and align their usage with state guidelines. Under the State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act, participating states can align the use of consolidated funds with state guidelines for ESEA programs. Florida was granted State-Flex authority but withdrew before implementation. Local-Flex allows up to 80 LEAs to consolidate funds from various programs for specific purposes. LEAs can consolidate funds under various ESEA programs for five years, with a 4% limit for administration. Failure to meet AYP requirements or comply with the agreement results in loss of authority. Renewal is possible if goals are met. Certain requirements like civil rights and fiscal accountability cannot be waived. The Local-Flex program allows LEAs to consolidate funds under ESEA programs for five years with a 4% administration limit. Failure to meet AYP requirements or comply with the agreement leads to loss of authority. Certain requirements like civil rights and fiscal accountability cannot be waived. Only one LEA, Seattle, has participated in Local-Flex, with limited interest from states and LEAs overall. Interest in State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities is low, with only one LEA participating in Local-Flex and no states in State-Flex. Barriers to participation include additional responsibilities, limited organizational capacity, and lack of information. A new round of competition for these authorities began in 2004, with states and LEAs receiving preference in future grant competitions for participating. State-Flex and Local-Flex participants receive preference in future grant competitions due to their comprehensive planning to improve teacher quality and academic achievement. These programs allow for broad use of funds authorized under ESEA programs with few restrictions, but participation is limited to a maximum of seven states and a select number of LEAs. Despite low interest, a new round of competition for these authorities began in 2004. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs have limited participation, with only a maximum of seven states and select LEAs involved. Despite multiple invitations, interest in these provisions has been low. States are still responsible for meeting administrative duties under each program, with a small portion of funds allocated for state-level activities. The relevant share of state total grants varies depending on the program, with participating states having influence over funds consolidated by the local LEAs. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs offer limited flexibility, with only a few states and LEAs participating. States have influence over funds consolidated by local LEAs, with varying grant percentages depending on the program. LEAs in the state demonstration program may have reduced flexibility, as their use of funds must align with state guidelines. The inclusion of the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant in the Local-Flex authority has limited significance. Comparing State-Flex and Local-Flex with earlier flexibility authorities in NCLB legislation shows differences in flexibility levels. The State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities in the NCLB legislation offer limited flexibility compared to earlier proposals in the House and Senate versions of H.R. 1. The Senate-passed version would have provided greater flexibility with increased outcome accountability, but was not included in the final legislation. Overall, the State-Flex and Local-Flex programs are more limited than optional performance agreement/grant consolidation proposals. The H.R. 1/Senate flexibility/performance agreement authority offers more flexibility than State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities, with increased outcome accountability. It is more limited than optional performance agreement/grant consolidation proposals from the 106th Congress, allowing for participation of 7 states and 25 LEAs. Funds can be used for various ESEA programs, including Title I-A grants for Education of the Disadvantaged. The H.R. 1/Senate flexibility/performance agreement authority offers more flexibility than State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities, with increased outcome accountability. Participating states could reallocate funds among LEAs to target concentrations of poor children. They would need to exceed AYP goals by a statistically significant amount, ensuring achievement gains are not due to random variations in pupil scores. The report concludes with an analysis of selected cross-cutting issues related to special forms of flexibility under NCLB. These flexibility authorities allow states and LEAs to use federal aid funds according to their priorities, with limitations on participation and program requirements. The special flexibility authorities under NCLB allow states and LEAs to waive federal program requirements in exchange for accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes. These authorities have been adopted in a policy context of increased accountability requirements and flexibility for ESEA programs. Around 12-16% of all LEAs have utilized at least one of these flexibility authorities. The NCLB has introduced flexibility authorities for ESEA programs, allowing states and LEAs to waive federal requirements in exchange for accountability based on pupil achievement. These authorities have been utilized by 12-16% of LEAs, with REAP Flex being the most widely used among small, rural LEAs. Reporting on the use and impact of flexibility is required, but specific impacts on pupil achievement are not well-documented. There are limitations to the current flexibility authorities, raising questions about their effectiveness in addressing concerns about federal fund usage and administrative burdens. The current flexibility authorities under the NCLB raise questions about their effectiveness in addressing concerns about federal fund usage and administrative burdens. The ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program authority is limited to schools with slightly above average low-income pupil rates. Waiver authorities require individual requests to the U.S. Secretary of Education, and fund Transferability authority allows for a maximum transfer of 50% of funds received under any program. Rural LEAs have access to flexibility authority. The fund Transferability authority allows LEAs to transfer up to 50% of funds received under any program, with certain limitations on flexibility for rural and State-Flex LEAs. Participation in these authorities is low due to restrictions on waiving requirements such as fiscal accountability and ESEA Title I-A standards. The Ed-Flex program provides flexibility for states and LEAs in meeting certain requirements, but it does not address the main regulatory burdens associated with IDEA, ADA, child nutrition programs, and environmental requirements. Some states find Ed-Flex to have limited value due to the few programs and requirements that can be waived, while others see it as a tool for encouraging innovation and flexibility. The Ed-Flex program offers limited flexibility due to the few programs and requirements that can be waived. Some states view it as a tool for promoting innovation and flexibility, especially with the increased flexibility in federal program requirements. The Ed-Flex program provides limited flexibility to states and LEAs in deciding how to use funds, with waivers seen as removing federal barriers to local educational reform. However, there is limited information on the use of new flexibility options, and waivers granted under pre-NCLB authorities were not always related to innovation. ESEA Title IX-D authority has allowed some states to participate in a growth model pilot for determining AYP. The ESEA Title IX-D authority has been used to allow states to participate in a growth model pilot for determining AYP. A recent study found that flexibility authority was often used to move funds between different programs, such as Teacher and Principal Training and Education for the Disadvantaged. LEAs used these authorities to compensate for grant reductions, target resources on failing schools, and utilize funds with flexibility. In the pre-NCLB era, Secretarial waivers and other flexibility authorities were used to waive various requirements related to ESEA Title I-A programs, including schoolwide program eligibility thresholds, targeting of funds on schools with high numbers of low-income students, deadlines for standards and assessments, and limitations on fund use for teacher programs. This raised questions about the flexibility of schoolwide programs for schools with low resources. Schoolwide programs offer flexibility in fund usage under Title I-A and other federal programs, but concerns arise for schools with low poverty rates. There is no evidence that schoolwide programs are more effective than targeted assistance programs. Waivers may disperse funds among low-poverty schools, reducing the focus on high-poverty schools. Ed-Flex places restrictions on waivers. The use of waivers under Ed-Flex may disperse Title I-A funds among low-poverty schools, reducing the focus on high-poverty schools. Waivers have been requested to accommodate various requirements related to teacher hiring, training funds, and professional development in the past. The use of waivers under Ed-Flex may disperse Title I-A funds among low-poverty schools, reducing the focus on high-poverty schools. Waivers have been requested to accommodate various requirements related to teacher hiring, training funds, and professional development in the past. Following enactment of the NCLB, some common uses of Ed-Flex and other pre-NCLB flexibility authorities are no longer as relevant. The CSR and Eisenhower programs were consolidated into a more flexible ESEA Title II program supporting teacher and principal recruitment and training. Limited information is available on the impact of special forms of flexibility on pupil achievement or other outcomes. Limited information is available on the impact of waivers granted under ESEA Title IX-D during the post-NCLB era. Anecdotal information on achievement effects of Ed-Flex and Secretarial waivers in a few LEAs was included in a 1999 ED report. No reports have been published on the actual purposes of waivers or their effects under the Ed-Flex authority enacted in 1999. Supporters of special flexibility authorities argue for their broader impact on state and local public education systems. Supporters of special flexibility authorities argue that Ed-Flex has supported standards-based reform in affected states by facilitating program coordination, streamlining administration, and focusing on outcomes to improve student achievement. Limited data is available on the impact of waivers granted under ESEA Title IX-D post-NCLB era. The use of special flexibility authorities, such as Ed-Flex, aims to improve student achievement by focusing on outcomes and standards-based approaches. However, there is limited data available on the effectiveness of these waivers, making it challenging to evaluate their impact. The Education Department (ED) has not effectively disseminated relevant information on the use of waiver or special flexibility authorities, making it difficult to evaluate their significance. The outcome accountability requirements associated with these flexibility authorities are based on goals set by states and LEAs, raising questions about their effectiveness compared to other forms of accountability. The report discusses the goals set by states and LEAs for programs like Ed-Flex and State-Flex, as well as meeting AYP requirements under ESEA Title I-A. A GAO study found that states varied in setting clear outcome goals for waivers, with limited ED oversight. The GAO study found that states had varying outcome objectives linked to waivers, with limited ED oversight. The current flexibility authorities do not require substantial additional outcome accountability for participating LEAs and states, focusing instead on meeting generally applicable outcome requirements. The outcome accountability requirements under the NCLB are important for all schools, LEAs, and states. Special flexibility authority provides an additional incentive to meet these requirements to maintain eligibility. The enhanced outcome accountability is limited but aligns with the nature of special flexibility authorities. The NCLB legislation expands outcome accountability requirements and flexibility in federal aid funds for all states, LEAs, and schools. Proponents argue that increased flexibility in fund usage can lead to improved pupil outcomes without the need for additional accountability measures. Critics may argue against granting special flexibility without significant changes in accountability requirements. Critics of special flexibility authorities argue that granting such authority without significant changes in accountability requirements may not lead to improved pupil outcomes. They are concerned that these authorities lack sufficient accountability provisions and are often used for purposes that do not increase program effectiveness."
