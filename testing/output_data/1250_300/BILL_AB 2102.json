    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Controller, in consultation with the California Gambling Control Commission, will divide the County Tribal Casino Account into Individual Tribal Casino Accounts for each tribe operating a casino in the county. Funds from these accounts will be used to make grants to local jurisdictions impacted by tribal casinos, based on each tribe's contributions to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund in the prior fiscal year. In each county with Indian gaming, an Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee is created to select grants from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts or County Tribal Casino Accounts. The committee must follow priorities and requirements, establish application policies, assess eligibility, and ensure grants mitigate the impact of the casino on the applicant. The Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee assesses grant applications from local jurisdictions impacted by tribal gaming operations and determines reimbursement for county administrative costs. The committee is composed of seven representatives, including two from the county selected by the county board of supervisors. The Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee consists of seven representatives, including two from the county selected by the county board of supervisors, and three elected representatives from cities near tribal casinos. Additional local representatives may be chosen based on mutual agreement between the county board of supervisors and tribes contributing to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. The Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee consists of seven representatives, including two from the county selected by the county board of supervisors, and three elected representatives from cities near tribal casinos. Two representatives are selected based on the recommendation of tribes paying into the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund in each county, or tribes operating casinos in counties where no tribes contribute. The committee must adopt a Conflict of Interest Code in compliance with legal requirements. Sixty percent of the Individual Tribal Casino Account is allocated for nexus grants to cities and counties impacted by tribes contributing to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. Grants are awarded based on a nexus test using criteria like geographical proximity to tribal casinos. Grant selection is done by each county's Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee, with grants possibly awarded on a multiyear basis. The local government jurisdiction's eligibility for nexus grants is determined by criteria such as proximity to Indian lands, access routes to casinos, and distance from casinos. Grants are awarded based on meeting specific nexus test criteria, with funds allocated in different proportions based on eligibility. Twenty percent of the specified amount in subdivision (c) will be awarded to local government jurisdictions meeting two nexus test criteria in paragraph (1). If no eligible jurisdiction meets this requirement, the funds will be available for grants to jurisdictions meeting the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3). Thirty percent of the amount in subdivision (c) will be awarded to jurisdictions meeting three nexus test criteria in paragraph (1), with a similar reallocation if no eligible jurisdiction qualifies. Twenty percent of the Individual Tribal Casino Account is allocated for discretionary grants to local jurisdictions impacted by tribes contributing to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. Grants are available to all local jurisdictions in the county, selected by the Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee and administered by the county. Multiyear grants may be awarded and accounted for annually. Twenty percent of the Individual Tribal Casino Account is set aside for discretionary grants to local jurisdictions impacted by tribes not contributing to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. Grants are available to all local jurisdictions in the county, selected by the Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee and administered by the county. Grants are limited to addressing service-oriented impacts and one-time large capital projects related to Indian gaming impacts, sponsored by the contributing tribe and recommended by the Committee. Grants from the County Tribal Casino Account are subject to the tribe's sponsorship and the recommendations of the Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee. Funds may be released for grants to local jurisdictions impacted by tribal casinos, following specified priorities and requirements. Funds not used from the County Tribal Casino Account will return to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund annually. Grant priorities from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts include law enforcement, fire services, emergency medical services, environmental impacts, and other specified areas. The Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee selects grants to mitigate casino impacts on local jurisdictions. Grants must be used for approved purposes, or they revert to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. Grants finance only the portion of expenditures that mitigate casino impacts. All grants from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts require tribal sponsorship and must align with casino impact priorities. Grants cannot support opposition to Indian gaming and will be revoked if misused. Terminated grants will be reallocated for qualified nexus grants. Local government jurisdictions receiving grants from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts must publicly acknowledge the funding source. County Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committees approve projects for funding, with unallocated funds reverting back to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund at the end of each fiscal year. Funds allocated for specific fiscal years have expiration dates for expenditure. Moneys allocated for specific fiscal years must be spent by December 31 of the following year. Local government jurisdictions receiving grants from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts must use the interest from funds for mitigating casino impacts. Any misuse of funds will result in reverting the remaining portion to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. Reimbursement for state-mandated costs will be provided to local agencies and school districts. The Legislature intends to enact legislation related to tribal gaming in California. If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act imposes state-mandated costs, reimbursement will be provided to local agencies and school districts."
