    "content": "The 112th Congress is considering legislative proposals to limit the government's risk from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises responsible for nearly half of the nation's residential mortgage debt. In 2008, their capital proved inadequate during the financial crisis, leading to government intervention to support the mortgage markets. The U.S. Department of the Treasury purchased over $175 billion in special preferred stock to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Treasury and the Federal Reserve also bought $1.4 trillion in MBS to aid the mortgage market. Legislation may reduce the enterprises' size and increase their costs, potentially impacting mortgage prices and interest rates for borrowers. Several legislative proposals aim to increase costs for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, potentially impacting mortgage prices and interest rates. These bills include new limitations on mortgage purchases, increased regulatory oversight, higher capital requirements, and a deadline for the enterprises to return to stockholder control or be dissolved. Several legislative proposals aim to address the financial difficulties of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Some proposals include setting a deadline for the enterprises to return to stockholder control or be dissolved, while others focus on replacing the enterprises in the secondary mortgage markets. In September 2008, both enterprises entered voluntary conservatorship, with the Federal Housing Finance Agency taking control. The Treasury also signed contracts to provide financial support to keep them solvent. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) took control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, with the Treasury signing contracts to provide financial support. The enterprises play a crucial role in the mortgage market by purchasing mortgages from lenders and packaging them into Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS). The Obama Administration's report presents three alternatives for the future of the enterprises and the housing finance system. The Obama Administration's report presents three alternatives for the future of the housing finance system: a privatized system with government mortgage programs targeted by income or first-time homebuyer status, a privatized system with government guarantee during crises, and a privatized system with government reinsurance of private mortgage insurance. No legislation has been introduced yet to implement these proposals. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress addresses various concerns, including executive compensation and reforms in different areas. Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress addresses concerns such as executive compensation and reforms in different areas.

The reports will be reviewed by the FHFA inspector general and posted on the FHFA website. Additionally, the IG will examine FHFA's loss mitigation policies and their impact on the enterprises' financial condition and foreclosure rates. The FHFA's reporting requirements overlap with current reports, covering capital, investments, and loss mitigation activities. Legislation like H.R. 463 and H.R. 1221 aim to increase transparency and limit executive compensation at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. No action has been taken on these bills yet. H.R. 1221, the Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2011, aims to limit executive pay at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It proposes suspending current executive compensation packages and setting a maximum pay for employees.

H.R. 1222, GSE Subsidy Elimination Act of 2011, would require the enterprises to charge a guarantee fee reflecting mortgage risk and capital costs. FHFA could phase in the higher fee over two years or impose it at the higher level two years after enactment.

FHFA has the authority to implement the provisions as conservator or receiver.

The proposed rules would allow enterprises' guarantees to satisfy risk retention requirements if they are in conservatorship or receivership.
