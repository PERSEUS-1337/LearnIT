    "content": "The Obama Administration planned to establish a special oversight board for the economic stimulus package, chaired by a Chief Performance Officer. They also intended to create a website, Recovery.gov, to provide information on contracts and financial details. The Obama Administration established Recovery.gov to track stimulus spending and ensure accountability. Oversight provisions were included in economic stimulus legislation to root out waste and inefficiency. Concerns were raised about agencies' capacity to spend funds rapidly and the resources of inspectors general and the Government Accountability Office for oversight. The House and Senate passed versions of the stimulus legislation, with negotiations ongoing. Challenges include balancing speed with prudence and reconciling values of transparency, accountability, efficiency, effectiveness, and equity in crisis response. Longer-term issues involve building capacity for federal agencies, Congress, and the President to better respond to crises. The federal government faces challenges in crisis response, balancing speed with prudence and reconciling values of transparency, accountability, efficiency, effectiveness, and equity. Longer-term issues include building capacity for federal agencies, Congress, and the President to better respond to crises, as well as anticipating and avoiding preventable crises. The 9-11 Commission emphasized the importance of \"institutionalizing imagination\" to address these issues. Various oversight entities within the federal government, such as Congress, the Office of Management and Budget, inspectors general, and the Government Accountability Office, play a role in ensuring accountability and oversight. The Executive Office of the President, along with oversight agencies like the Government Accountability Office, provide assistance to Congress and agencies. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible for managing and overseeing agencies, while agencies oversee their own activities as mandated by Congress. Oversight tools like monitoring and evaluation are used to ensure compliance with laws, regulations, and sound management practices. Multiple perspectives on oversight objectives include legal compliance, congressional intent, and avoiding mismanagement and bias in funding and policy decisions. The House- and Senate-passed versions of economic stimulus legislation include oversight provisions related to legal requirements, congressional intent, avoidance of mismanagement and bias, effectiveness, and efficiency of funded activities. Implementation by agencies, nonfederal recipients, OMB, oversight board, and IGs remains to be seen."
