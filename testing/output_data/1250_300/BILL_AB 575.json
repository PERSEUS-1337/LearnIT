    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The state board is required to adopt basic instructional materials for kindergarten and grades 1 to 8 in various subject areas including language arts, mathematics, science, social science, and bilingual or bicultural subjects. The adoption of materials in each subject area is subject to specific provisions to ensure a comprehensive curriculum. The state board is required to adopt basic instructional materials for various subject areas, including science, social science, and bilingual or bicultural subjects. Procedures are in place for the submission of materials, with restrictions on resubmission of rejected materials without substantive changes. The state board adopts instructional materials for various subjects and sets procedures for their submission. Publishers or manufacturers submitting revisions after the specified timeframe may incur a fee. Instructional materials must be adopted or rejected within six months, with the possibility of an extension. Review committees, including volunteer experts and teachers, are involved in the review process. The state board adopts instructional materials using transparent procedures regardless of format. Criteria for adoption include alignment with curriculum standards, factual accuracy, and current research principles. Instructional materials must be factually accurate, aligned with state content standards, and free from unnecessary commercial branding. Commercial branding may only be used if deemed necessary for educational purposes or if incidental to the illustration. The state board may adopt fewer than five basic instructional materials in each subject area for each grade level if necessary criteria are met, as established by the state board. If basic instructional materials are rejected, the state board must provide a written explanation based on specific criteria. The state board may adopt fewer than five basic instructional materials in each subject area for each grade level if necessary criteria are met. If fewer than five materials meet the criteria or fail to meet the curriculum framework, the state board can adopt fewer materials. This section does not limit the state board's authority to adopt materials that are not basic instructional materials. The state board can adopt fewer than five basic instructional materials in each subject area for each grade level if necessary criteria are met. The authority of the state board is not limited to adopting materials that are not basic instructional materials. The state board must ensure that the adopted materials provide for the educational needs of diverse pupil populations, illustrate diverse points of view, represent cultural pluralism, and offer a broad spectrum of knowledge and technology-based materials. The state board adopts instructional materials and provides a listing with unit costs for procurement. The list remains available until new materials are adopted based on a revised curriculum framework. Information on adopted materials is accessible by subject and grade level, including publisher details and copyright information. The state board adopts instructional materials and provides unit costs for procurement. The Superintendent develops guidelines for implementation. Section 60227 of the Education Code outlines followup adoption procedures, including posting notices on the department's website and assessing fees for participation. The department assesses a fee for followup adoption procedures to cover costs, aiming to keep the fee reasonable by minimizing duplication of work from the primary adoption process. The department requires publishers or manufacturers participating in followup adoptions to declare specific programs and grade levels, paying a fee even if they withdraw. The fee should not deter small publishers, and the state board may reduce it upon request. The state board may reduce the fee for small publishers or manufacturers participating in followup adoptions. Small publishers and manufacturers are defined as independently owned businesses with 100 or fewer employees and average annual gross receipts of $10 million or less. Revenue from fees charged will be used for adoption and review costs. If there is little interest, the followup adoption may not be conducted. General fund revenue cannot be used for followup adoption costs. General fund revenue cannot be used for follow-up adoption costs. This section will be in effect until January 1, 2024, and will be repealed unless a later statute extends the date."
