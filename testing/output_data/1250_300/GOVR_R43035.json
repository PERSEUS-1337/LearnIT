    "content": "Since Burma's military junta transferred power to a quasi-civilian government in 2011, Congress has mostly deferred to the White House and relevant departments on U.S. policy towards Burma. The Obama Administration has made adjustments using executive authority, but may need congressional action for further changes. Congress may consider reassessing its role in shaping U.S. policy towards Burma. The Obama Administration has implemented changes in U.S. policy towards Burma, including engaging in direct dialogue with the ruling military junta and cooperating on international security issues. The goal remains to support a unified, peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Burma that respects human rights. The Obama Administration's new policy towards Burma aims to support a unified, peaceful, prosperous, and democratic nation that respects human rights. Key goals include releasing political prisoners, ending conflicts with ethnic minorities, and initiating political dialogue with opposition leaders. The administration also calls for Burma to sever ties with North Korea and abandon its alleged nuclear weapons program. Following the policy announcement, Burma underwent a political transformation, holding parliamentary elections and releasing opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. The SPDC in Burma held parliamentary elections in November 2010, leading to the release of Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. Power was transferred to a quasi-civilian government in March 2011, with President Thein Sein leading political and economic reforms. Reforms included releasing political prisoners and amending oppressive laws. The political and economic reforms in Burma under President Thein Sein's leadership have led to the release of political prisoners and the amendment of oppressive laws. The by-elections in April 2012 saw Aung San Suu Kyi's party winning a majority of seats, prompting positive political developments. The Obama Administration responded by increasing high-level meetings with the Burmese government and easing sanctions, culminating in the first U.S. President's visit to Burma while in office. Hillary Clinton was the first Secretary of State in over 50 years to visit Burma, followed by President Obama, who became the first U.S. President to visit while in office. Sanctions on Burma have been waived, with plans to increase U.S. assistance, including reopening the USAID mission after 23 years. Despite reforms, the political and economic situation in Burma remains serious and fragile, with ongoing fighting between the military and ethnic-based militias, particularly in Kachin State. Fighting between the Burmese military and ethnic-based militias continues across the country, with serious human rights violations reported in Kachin State. Ethnic tensions have been exposed in Rakhine State, while oppressive laws remain in place despite some improvements in civil liberties. The NLD participated in the 2012 by-elections, but political parties face registration challenges and over 200 political prisoners are still held. The 113th Congress may address issues related to Burma's political and economic development. The 113th Congress may consider various issues regarding Burma's political and economic development, including President Thein Sein's commitment to democracy and human rights, collaboration with the Union Parliament and military for reforms, relations with ethnic minorities, progress in negotiations, sanctions enforcement, and aid assistance. The 113th Congress may consider issues related to Burma's political and economic development, including sanctions enforcement, aid assistance, and U.S. policy towards Burma in the context of the Obama Administration's rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific region. The Obama Administration's approach towards Burma evolved over time, initially expressing skepticism towards the government but later becoming more optimistic and establishing closer ties with President Thein Sein's administration. This shift in attitude included direct engagement with the military regime and the continuation of sanctions, aligning with recommendations made by Green and Mitchell. The Obama Administration's assessment of President Thein Sein and his government became more optimistic over time, leading to closer ties between the two governments. This shift in policy focused on promoting progressive forces within the government and isolating anti-reform individuals and organizations. The U.S. now speaks of a partnership with President Thein Sein's government, potentially at the expense of relations with Burma's opposition parties and ethnic groups. The Obama Administration shifted its policy towards Burma, aligning closely with President Thein Sein's government and focusing on promoting further reforms. This change has sparked debate among experts and interest groups, with some concerned about rewarding modest progress too quickly, while others feel the White House has been too cautious with sanctions. Observers have differing opinions on the Obama Administration's approach towards Burma, with some feeling it has moved too fast in rewarding progress, while others believe it has been too slow with sanctions. The Administration held discussions with SPDC officials and maintained existing sanctions until concrete reform progress is seen, with the possibility of implementing additional sanctions if needed. The Obama Administration reserved the right to impose or recommend sanctions based on the political situation in Burma, including the possibility of relaxing sanctions if certain criteria were met. The tense political environment in Burma in 2010 led to the NLD and other parties boycotting the elections, while the SPDC formed a new political party. The SPDC formed the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) to support the Burmese military's policies. Ethnic militias were required to become Border Guard Forces (BGF) or face conflict. Tensions escalated with fighting between the Burmese military and ethnic militias, leading to a refugee crisis. Reports of Burma's alleged nuclear weapons program and arms trade with North Korea may have influenced the cautious response of the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration responded cautiously to Burma's political transition due to reports of Burma's alleged nuclear weapons program and arms trade with North Korea. Concerns were raised about Burma exploring nuclear weapons development and receiving technical support from North Korea, despite doubts about their technical ability. The continuation of arms trade prohibited by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874 was a major concern for the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration expressed concerns about Burma's nuclear weapons program and arms trade with North Korea, prohibited by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874. President Obama criticized Burma's 2010 elections as neither free nor fair, highlighting the regime's repression and detention of political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi. The National League for Democracy was silenced and sidelined by unfair electoral laws and a partisan Election Commission. The unfair electoral laws and partisan Election Commission in Burma silenced the National League for Democracy and denied registration to certain ethnic parties. The United States will continue pressure and engagement strategies, calling for the release of political prisoners, accountability for human rights violations, and dialogue with pro-democracy and ethnic minority groups. Acting Deputy Department Spokesman Mark C. Toner criticized the flawed electoral process in Burma. Following the transfer of power in Burma on March 30, 2011, Acting Deputy Department Spokesman Mark C. Toner expressed reservations about the situation, calling the electoral process fundamentally flawed. He urged Burmese authorities to release political prisoners, recognize democratic parties, and engage in dialogue for reconciliation. The cautious approach to Burma continued after the establishment of the Thein Sein administration. Derek Mitchell was confirmed as the first Special Representative to respond to developments in Burma. Derek Mitchell was confirmed as the first Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma in response to political developments in the country. The position, created by the JADE Act, had remained vacant for over three years. Mitchell's responsibilities include coordinating U.S. policy towards Burma, consulting with foreign governments, and advising Congress. The new Burmese government under President Thein Sein made significant changes, including commuting death sentences to life in prison and releasing political prisoners. Presidential Order No. 28/2011, issued on May 16, 2011, commuted all death sentences to life in prison, releasing 14,578 people, including 55 political prisoners. President Thein Sein reached out to Aung San Suu Kyi and ethnic organizations for political reconciliation. However, tensions rose when a Navy destroyer intercepted a cargo ship suspected of carrying banned weapons from North Korea to Burma. The Burmese Army broke a ceasefire with the Kachin Independence Army, leading to fighting spreading in northern Burma. Former Assistant Secretary Campbell summarized the Obama Administration's views on the new Burmese government. In May 2011, former Assistant Secretary Campbell expressed disappointment with the progress of the new Burmese government. Deputy Assistant Secretary Yun also disagreed with the assessment of a \"disciplined and flourishing democracy\" due to former SPDC officials still in key positions. Ambassador Mitchell visited Burma in September 2011. Ambassador Mitchell's visit to Burma in September 2011 included meetings with key leaders and discussions on human rights abuses, ceasefire agreements, and Burma's relations with North Korea. President Thein Sein's announcement of willingness to negotiate ceasefire agreements was seen as a potential step towards future developments in bilateral relations. This visit also paved the way for Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin's visit to the U.S. in late September 2011. President Thein Sein's actions in October and December 2011, including a large-scale prisoner pardon and signing a law allowing peaceful protests, were significant steps towards political reform in Burma. Ambassador Mitchell and Assistant Secretary Posner also visited Burma to discuss political reform, ethnic conflicts, and human rights issues. President Obama expressed concerns about human rights violations in Burma during the East Asia Summit in November 2011. President Obama, attending the East Asia Summit in Bali, released a statement on Burma in November 2011, expressing concerns about human rights violations but acknowledging progress. After consulting with Aung San Suu Kyi, he sent Secretary of State Clinton to Burma to explore positive transition possibilities. During her visit, Clinton announced potential exchange of ambassadors and new development programs, including aid for conflict victims and an anti-malaria initiative.

On January 2, 2012, 6,656 prisoners, including 34 political prisoners, were released, and on January 13, 2012, 651 prisoners, including 302 political prisoners, were freed. President Obama waived a section of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act for Burma on February 3, 2012. A parliamentary by-election was held in Burma on April 1, 2012 to fill 45 vacant seats. The Obama Administration waived a provision of the TVPA to allow IMF and MDBs to offer technical support to Burma. The April 2012 parliamentary by-election in Burma saw Aung San Suu Kyi and NLD members running as candidates, despite concerns about the election's fairness. Aung San Suu Kyi and 42 NLD candidates won seats, with the remaining going to a USDP candidate. Aung San Suu Kyi and 42 NLD candidates won seats in the April 2012 parliamentary by-election in Burma. The Obama Administration and other countries congratulated Burma on their participation in the electoral process and removed most sanctions. Former Secretary Clinton announced five steps to support reforms in Burma using existing executive authority. The Obama Administration announced five steps to support reforms in Burma following the by-elections and progress in recent months. These steps were chosen after consultation with Congress, allies, and friends in Europe and Asia. One of the steps involved relaxing restrictions on private U.S. organizations providing nonprofit activities in Burma, with the State Department working with the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control to create an expanded general license for such activities. OFAC approved a new general license on April 17, 2012, allowing financial services exportation to Burma for specific not-for-profit projects. Officials mentioned easing trade and investment restrictions in areas like agriculture, banking, tourism, and telecommunications. They emphasized caution in \"more regressive sectors\" like gems and timber, considering local opposition to government-approved projects. Implementation of the five steps will involve existing waiver authorities and rescinding executive orders, with no current plans to seek Congressional approval for changes. The Obama Administration announced significant developments in U.S. policy towards Burma, including the establishment of a USAID mission, U.S. support for UNDP projects, relaxation of restrictions on nonprofit activities, and facilitation of travel for Burmese officials. Presidential waiver authority in existing sanction laws will be invoked, with a presidential determination and certification required to meet waiver provisions. Burma's Foreign Minister visited Washington, DC, at the invitation of former Secretary Clinton. During the foreign minister's visit, the Obama Administration announced three significant developments in U.S. policy towards Burma: renewing sanctions for another year, nominating Derek Mitchell as ambassador, and easing bans on financial services and investment. Former Secretary Clinton provided details on the easing, promoting responsible investment and transparency in business practices. The State Department plans to work with Congress, Treasury, and other agencies to promote responsible investment and deter abuses. U.S. investors in Burma can now invest in all sectors and export financial services, as long as the partner is not on the SDN list. The list will be regularly updated to prevent \"bad actors\" from benefiting. Criteria for listing will include business practices and attitudes towards Burma's reforms. Clinton urged U.S. businesses to set a good example in Burma. The State Department, in consultation with various stakeholders, is developing voluntary corporate governance standards for U.S. companies in Burma. The Obama Administration eased some sanctions on Burma on July 11, 2012, including lifting the ban on new U.S. investments and the export of financial services. Executive Order 13619 expanded sanctions to target individuals threatening Burma's peace, involved in human rights abuses, arms trade with North Korea, or assisting in such acts. On July 11, 2012, the Obama Administration eased sanctions on Burma by lifting the ban on new U.S. investments and the export of financial services. President Obama delegated authority to waive the investment ban to Secretary Clinton, which was then exercised by Deputy Secretary of State Thomas R. Nides. This waiver led to the creation of General License No. 17, allowing new investments in Burma with certain limitations. General License No. 17 permits new investments in Burma by U.S. persons with restrictions, such as avoiding investments with certain entities and complying with State Department reporting requirements. Investments do not need pre-approval but must be reported, especially those involving Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise or exceeding $500,000 in value. Failure to comply may result in liability for the U.S. investor. The State Department requires reporting of investments in Burma exceeding $500,000 annually by April 1. General License No. 16 allows exportation of financial services to Burma with restrictions, superseding previous licenses. Sanctions on certain Burmese nationals were imposed by President Obama. President Obama imposed sanctions on certain Burmese nationals via E.O. 13619, prohibiting visas, asset freezes, and financial services for those threatening Burma's peace, engaging in human rights abuses, or dealing arms with North Korea. Amid policy changes in May 2012, Burma saw mixed political developments. The Obama Administration imposed sanctions on certain Burmese nationals under E.O. 13619 for threatening peace, human rights abuses, or dealing arms with North Korea. In May 2012, Burma experienced a mix of positive and negative political developments, including Vice President Tin Aung Myint Oo's resignation and ceasefire agreements with ethnic groups. However, progress towards peace agreements stalled, leading to sporadic skirmishes. Rioting erupted in Rakhine State between Rohingyas and Rakhines, with the censorship board blocking reports on the unrest. In response to rioting in Rakhine State, Burma's censorship board warned publications and blocked reports of Tin Aung Myint Oo's resignation. The unrest led to casualties, destruction of property, and displacement of over 100,000 Rohingyas. Despite the turmoil, President Thein Sein pardoned political prisoners and implemented reforms, including ending pre-publication censorship and changing the exchange rate regime. In August 2012, he reshuffled his cabinet, bringing in close advisors. In August 2012, President Thein Sein reshuffled his cabinet to consolidate political power, leading to a debate over the oversight authority of the Union Parliament. The Constitutional Tribunal ruled that parliamentary bodies could not compel ministerial officials to testify. The Constitutional Tribunal ruled in August 2012 that parliamentary bodies could not compel ministerial officials to testify. This decision led to protests by the Union Parliament and the resignation of nine tribunal members in September 2012.

The Burmese government agreed to important actions, including allowing the Red Cross to resume prisoner visits and committing to becoming a full member of Open Government Partnership by 2016. However, there were concerns raised about the government's commitment to political reform following violent attacks on civilians in Rakhine State and a major assault on the Kachin Independence Army in Kachin State. Burmese police violently attacked a peaceful protest in Sagaing Region, injuring Buddhist monks and civilians. The military launched a major assault on the Kachin Independence Army in Kachin State, breaking a ceasefire. President Thein Sein and Parliament took steps to protect assembly and media freedom. Operation Thunderbolt aimed to take over KIA/KIO headquarters in Laiza with a significant military force, including aircraft support. Operation Thunderbolt involved a large number of soldiers and aircraft attacking the KIA in violation of President Thein Sein's instructions. The Burmese military was accused of civilian casualties, human rights abuses, and using child soldiers. The U.S. Embassy urged both sides to establish a dialogue process to address the conflict in Kachin State. The U.S. Embassy in Rangoon urged both sides to establish a dialogue process to address the conflict in Kachin State. Despite a ceasefire announcement, the Burmese Army resumed fighting, leading to civilian casualties and undermining national reconciliation efforts. The United States strongly opposes ongoing fighting in Kachin State, resulting in civilian casualties and hindering national reconciliation efforts. Burma's Ministry of Foreign Affairs blames KIA for ceasefire violations, labeling them as \"terrorist attacks.\" Negotiations between the Union Government and KIO/KIA took place in China, but fighting continues. It is uncertain if Tatmadaw supports the negotiations or will adhere to any agreements. Despite ongoing conflict, the Union Government and Parliament made policy changes to enhance civil liberties, including dissolving the Press Scrutiny and Registration Division.

The Ministry of Information forwarded a draft media legislation to replace an existing law, criticized for being more restrictive. The Ministry of Information (MOI) bill, intended to replace the 1962 Printer and Publishers Registration Act, faced criticism from media groups in Burma for being more restrictive. The draft legislation, published in February 2013, prohibits reporting on ethnic conflicts, criticizing the 2008 constitution, or \"disturbing the rule of law.\" It also gives the MOI the power to issue or withdraw publishing licenses, seen as a form of media censorship by journalist organizations. The draft law proposed by the Ministry of Information in Burma is criticized for being more restrictive, with penalties of imprisonment and fines for violating it. OFAC issued general license No. 19 to allow financial transactions with certain Burmese banks, easing U.S. sanctions to encourage economic involvement in Burma.

The Obama Administration's approach to U.S. policy towards Burma was reflected in the testimony of senior officials at a hearing on human rights in Burma. Special Representative Murphy highlighted President Thein Sein's reform agenda, stating that the U.S. has entered a new era of relations with Burma. The United States has entered a new era of relations with Burma in response to President Thein Sein's reform agenda. The U.S. government seeks to support further progress and remain a long-term partner in the reform process. Despite positive and negative developments since Burma's quasi-civilian government took power, the political situation remains fragile and complex. The administration in Burma has made changes since announcing a new policy, but the political situation remains fragile. General Khin Kyunt outlined a roadmap for a \"disciplined democracy\" in 2003, with the transfer of power completed in 2011. President Thein Sein acknowledges the ongoing democratization process but lacks clarity on what a \"disciplined democracy\" entails. The democratization of Burma is a work in progress, with key elements of a future democratic Burma still under debate. Questions remain about civilian control over the military, the balance of power between branches of government, and citizenship conditions, including the status of Rohingyas born in Burma. The power balance between the President, Ministers, and Union Parliament in Burma is still uncertain. Questions linger about the selection process for the President and Vice Presidents, citizenship criteria, and the rights of Rohingyas. The military's influence and its relationship with the Union Government remain opaque, with little known about their stance on political reforms and the military's role in Burma's democracy. President Thein Sein's recent ministerial changes included appointing former generals to his Cabinet. The military's influence in Burmese politics is still unclear, with many former generals appointed to President Thein Sein's Cabinet. Despite calls for military operations to cease, Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hliang has not confirmed orders, raising questions about his political intentions. Additionally, the replacement of military members in the Union Parliament in 2012 has further highlighted the military's role in the country's democracy. The reassignment of military personnel, including regional commanders, by General Min Aung Hlaing has raised questions about his political intentions. The replacement of 59 military-appointed members of the Union Parliament in April 2012 was seen as an effort to tighten discipline. Tensions between the military and the Union Parliament have been evident, with disputes over the military budget and land seizures. The parliamentary commission reported that the military seized over 247,000 acres of land between July 2012 and January 2013. They recommended returning most of the land to owners or the state and compensating those displaced. The military's involvement in Burma's economy, with regional commanders benefiting from their power, remains unresolved. Major corporations in lucrative sectors are allegedly owned by the military or senior officers. The Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (UMEHL) is reportedly owned by the Ministry of Defense and operated by the military. The Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (UMEHL or UMEH) and the Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) are conglomerates owned and operated by the Ministry of Defense, providing the military with independent revenue sources. These companies own banks and have control over various economic sectors in Burma. The military's involvement in the economy dates back to the 1962 coup, driven by the failure of the civilian government to suppress ethnic militias and protect national integrity. The Tatmadaw granted ethnic states autonomy and took control in a 1962 military coup due to the civilian government's failure to suppress ethnic militias. The military is designated as the main entity for safeguarding national integrity. The Union Government proposed a three-step peace process to negotiate an end to the civil war and reconcile with ethnic organizations. The Union Government proposed a three-step peace process to negotiate with ethnic organizations regarding political and economic development, amend the 2008 Constitution, and disband or merge ethnic militias. Former Railway Minister Aung Min is the lead negotiator. The United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) has proposed an alternative path to national reconciliation. The Union Government's three-step peace process has been rejected by several ethnic organizations. The United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC) proposed an alternative path to national reconciliation involving direct negotiations, a national conference, and a national convention to negotiate a \"national accord\" for a federal union of Burma. Talks between the Union Government and ethnic organizations have yielded mixed results, with preliminary ceasefire agreements reached with 13 groups but not the KIO/KIA. The UNFC has appointed a negotiating team and held informal talks with the Union Government in China. Ceasefire agreements have been reached with 13 of 21 different groups, excluding the KIO/KIA. Informal talks between the UNFC and the Union Government in China resulted in an agreement for future discussions. Challenges remain in achieving national reconciliation in Burma, including disagreements on the powers of the central government versus ethnic States and the need for Tatmadaw's support. Reports of Burmese Army attacks on ethnic militias raise doubts about Tatmadaw's commitment to peace. The Burmese military has not been actively involved in current negotiations, and reports of attacks on ethnic militias raise doubts about their support for the peace process. Disagreements exist on the process for negotiating national reconciliation, with the Union Government pushing for incorporation into the 2008 Constitution, while major ethnic groups prefer equal talks without accepting the constitution's legitimacy. The future of the 2008 Constitution is crucial for any proposal for national reconciliation. The drafting and adoption of the 2008 Constitution in Burma was politically problematic, with many opposition parties and ethnic organizations not participating in the process. Public access to the Constitution was limited, and the official results of the referendum are seen as fraudulent. The parliamentary elections held under the Constitution are considered neither free nor fair, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the Union Government and Parliament. President Thein Sein has shown willingness to consider limited amendments to the Constitution. President Thein Sein and the Burmese military consider the 2008 Constitution legitimate. The President is open to limited amendments, including changes to the Tatmadaw's privileged status in the Union Parliament. Opposition parties, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, also seek amendments, such as allowing her to serve as President. However, ethnic organizations do not accept the Constitution and are unlikely to comply with its amendment provisions. Many opposition groups, including ethnic organizations, are hesitant to follow the amendment process outlined in the 2008 Constitution. They prefer direct negotiations with the Union Government and Tatmadaw for changes in the national government and a new constitution. The requirements for amending the constitution, outlined in Chapter XII, may hinder the implementation of any negotiated agreements. Amendments must be supported by at least 20% of Union Parliament members and receive at least 75% approval, with certain sections requiring a nationwide referendum with a majority of eligible voters. The 2008 Constitution outlines the process for amending the constitution, requiring support from at least 20% of Union Parliament members and 75% approval. Certain sections need a nationwide referendum with majority approval from eligible voters, including key provisions related to the government structure, military's role, state of emergency declaration, presidential eligibility, and amendment requirements. This implies the need for support from military appointees in the Union Parliament and indirectly, the Tatmadaw. The 2008 Constitution outlines the process for amending the constitution, requiring support from at least 20% of Union Parliament members and 75% approval. Any amendment must also obtain the support of military appointees in the Union Parliament, indirectly the Tatmadaw. It is uncertain if an acceptable amendment will satisfy ethnic organizations. Approval by more than 50% of eligible voters is needed, which could be a challenge given low voter turnout in past elections. The 113th Congress may play a more active role in U.S. policy towards Burma during this potential political transition. Critics have differing views on the Obama Administration's handling of Burma relations. The Obama Administration's handling of Burma relations has faced criticism for being too fast or too slow in relaxing sanctions. The 112th Congress passed laws and bills related to Burma, with most laws extending sanctions.

The 112th Congress passed laws extending sanctions on Burma, including bans on military assistance and funding for child soldiers. The 112th Congress passed laws extending sanctions on Burma, including bans on military assistance and funding for child soldiers. The legislation prohibits the use of funds for military training or operations involving child soldiers in Burma and other selected countries. It also requires the Secretary of the Treasury to vote against any financial support for Burma at international financial institutions, unless the President determines it is in the national interest of the United States. Notification of such a determination must be provided to specific congressional committees. The 112th Congress passed laws extending sanctions on Burma, including bans on military assistance and funding for child soldiers. Written notice of such determinations is to be provided to specific congressional committees. Additionally, the Congress introduced over 20 bills related to Burma, with most not seeing further action. Six congressional hearings on Burma were held during the 112th Congress. The 112th Congress held six hearings on Burma, with three in the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and three in the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Topics included religious freedom, democracy, human rights, and U.S. policy towards Burma. Senate hearings focused on the nomination of Derek J. Mitchell for Special Representative and Ambassador to Burma. The 113th Congress has various aspects of U.S. policy towards Burma to consider, including oversight of the Obama Administration's approach, implementation of existing laws, potential legislative adjustments, funding for assistance programs, and congressional oversight of federal law administration. The 113th Congress has the opportunity to examine Administration requests for funding assistance programs in Burma and oversee the implementation of federal laws. Congressional committees may hold hearings to assess U.S. policy towards Burma and the Obama Administration's approach. Congress may also consider the reasoning behind any shifts in policy towards Burma and convey its assessment of U.S. policy in the region. The 113th Congress may consider examining the reasoning behind the shift in the Administration's approach to Burma and assess the conduct of U.S. policy in the region. Key aspects to consider include changes in the political situation in Burma, the pace of easing sanctions, the focus on President Thein Sein, acceptance of the Union Government and Parliament, and the approach to fostering further reforms. The Obama Administration's approach to Burma includes assessing the Burmese military's attitude towards political reform, considering reestablishing military-to-military relations, and establishing closer relations with ethnic groups. Congress may also examine specific issues related to U.S. policy towards Burma, such as the Administration's implementation of existing laws and intentions regarding the Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma. The Obama Administration's approach to Burma involves assessing the military's stance on political reform, potential reestablishment of military relations, and closer ties with ethnic groups. Congress may scrutinize U.S. policy implementation, including the appointment of a Special Representative for Burma and the administration of sanctions lists. The 2008 JADE Act mandates the appointment of a Special Representative with ambassador rank, who cannot hold another executive branch position concurrently. The Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma cannot hold another executive branch position concurrently. Ambassador Derek J. Mitchell was confirmed as Special Representative but stepped down after becoming U.S. Ambassador to Burma. Deputy Special Representative W. Patrick Murphy is currently acting in the role, exceeding the 210-day limit for temporary appointments. Congress may need to address this issue. The temporary appointment of Deputy Special Representative W. Patrick Murphy for the position of Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma has exceeded the 210-day limit. Congress may need to inquire about the Obama Administration's intentions regarding nominations for the position. Additionally, the compilation of lists of Burmese individuals subject to sanctions under existing laws has faced criticism. The Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008 prohibits entry visas for certain Burmese nationals unless in the national interest of the United States. Presidential determinations and executive orders block visas for selected Burmese individuals, with the Department of State maintaining the list. The Act freezes assets of certain Burmese persons in the US and bans financial services for those under visa bans. Financial sanctions are administered by the Secretary of the Treasury. Sanctions under the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act are to be enforced by the Secretary of the Treasury, in line with relevant laws and presidential EOs. Human rights groups criticize the State and Treasury Departments for not fully implementing visa bans and financial sanctions. The State Department has not disclosed the names on the visa ban list, raising concerns about compliance with the law. Burmese government officials have visited the US, potentially violating sanctions, with uncertainty about required presidential determinations. The Treasury Department has delegated responsibility for maintaining sanctions. The Treasury Department has delegated responsibility for maintaining the list of Burmese persons subject to financial sanctions to its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The current SDN list does not include dozens of Burmese nationals and companies that meet the conditions specified in the relevant laws. Implementation of required reports to Congress has drawn criticism for delivery and quality. The delivery and quality of congressionally mandated reports to Congress on Burmese sanction laws have been criticized for being incomplete. Existing sanctions on Burma remain in effect until conditions are met or Congress acts to remove them. President Obama has waived some sanctions but retains the authority to reinstate them. The 113th Congress may consider extending or altering existing sanctions on Burma, including the import ban, in response to a presidential waiver. Congress may also review legislation to modify U.S. policy towards Burma and clarify conditions for terminating sanctions. The 113th Congress may consider altering sanctions on Burma, including funding levels for assistance programs proposed by the Obama Administration. This includes aid for landmine victims, English language training, democracy programs, and expanding USAID operations in Rangoon, requiring additional federal funding. The Obama Administration plans to expand USAID operations in Rangoon, Burma, requiring additional federal funding. Sequestration and budget constraints may affect funding availability for programs in Burma. The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates a 5% reduction in funding, with uncertainty on post-sequestration levels for Burma. Due to uncertainty in country allocations, post-sequestration funding levels for Burma cannot be calculated. A rough estimate suggests reducing FY2012 estimates by 5%. The 113th Congress may influence U.S. policy towards Burma during its transition to a civilian democratic government. The text chunk discusses the determination and conduct of U.S. policy towards Burma during its transition to a civilian democratic government. It includes a map of Burma, a chronology of major events, and required reports to Congress on Burma."
