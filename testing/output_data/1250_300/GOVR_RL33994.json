President Jose Ramos-Horta called for the UN to stay for five more years in May 2008 due to ongoing security concerns. Civilians displaced in 2006 returned home in 2008-2009. A group led by former Major Alfredo Reinado attempted to assassinate President Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Gusmao in 2008. Reinado, killed in the attempt, led a group of former soldiers fired from the army in 2006. The security situation in Timor-Leste has improved, but concerns remain about implementing security reforms after the 2006 mutiny. The security situation in Timor-Leste has improved since the 2006 mutiny, but concerns remain about implementing security reforms. A joint Indonesian-East Timorese Truth Commission blamed Indonesia for atrocities in 1999, leading to President Yudhoyono expressing regret. President Ramos-Horta urged moving on after the report. There are concerns about government plans to withdraw funds from Timor's Petroleum Fund in 2009 and efforts to gain economic benefit from gas reserves in the Timor Sea. China's role in Timor-Leste is also a point of interest. The geography of the seabed and political instability in Timor have made it less attractive for processing natural gas compared to Darwin, Australia. China's involvement in Timor-Leste increased in 2009, providing assistance with construction and offering to sell power plants and patrol boats. The government of East Timor created the National Recovery Strategy Program in 2007, covering areas like housing, security, and social protection. The Portuguese colonial presence in East Timor lasted until 1975 when Fretilin gained control. The Portuguese colonial presence in East Timor lasted until 1975 when Fretilin gained control and declared independence.

A referendum in 1999 resulted in East Timor opting for independence, triggering retaliation by pro-integrationist militias. In 1999, after a referendum resulted in East Timor opting for independence, pro-integrationist militias backed by elements of the Indonesian military retaliated, leading to widespread destruction and over 1,300 deaths. International Force East Timor (INTERFET) was deployed to restore order. Jose Ramos-Horta, the president of Timor-Leste, played a key role in advocating for independence and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996. Former President Xanana Gusmao of Timor-Leste was a key figure in the resistance against Indonesian occupation, serving as the first president after independence in 2002. He later became the prime minister in 2007. Gusmao was captured by Indonesian forces in 1992 but was released in 1999. Xanana Gusmao, former President of Timor-Leste, was imprisoned in 1992 and released in 1999 by President B.J. Habibie. He became the first president in 2002 and later served as prime minister in 2007. Gusmao survived an assassination attempt in 2008 by Reinado forces. Mari Alkatiri, a former prime minister, resigned in 2006 amidst unrest. Alkatiri, a Muslim minority in Timor-Leste, has a strained relationship with Gusmao. Fretilin, led by Alkatiri, opposes Gusmao's use of petroleum reserves for budget deficits. Timor-Leste has a 65-member unicameral parliament elected in 2007. The Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste has a unicameral national parliament of 65 members, elected in 2007.

In 2007, Timor-Leste held parliamentary and presidential elections. Ramos-Horta was elected president with 69% of the vote. Xanana Gusmao became prime minister leading the largest coalition after the parliamentary elections. Prior to this, in 2001, a constituent assembly was elected to draft a new Constitution. Gusmao won the 2002 presidential election with 86% voter turnout. Events in 2006 led to internal security issues in East Timor. In April 2002, Gusmao won the presidential election with 86% voter turnout. Events in 2006 led to internal security issues in East Timor, prompting the deployment of foreign peacekeepers. The Australian military contingent was the largest, with UNMIT established to support stability and democratic governance. Strife in 2006 stemmed from divisions within the Fretilin party. The source of the 2006 strife in East Timor can be traced to divisions within the dominant Fretilin party dating back to their struggle against the Indonesians. This led to splits within the military and police forces, with many military recruits being Xanana loyalists. Personal and institutional tensions between the president and the ruling party, Fretilin, also contributed to the politicization of the police force. The 2006 strife in East Timor was triggered by the dismissal of 591 military members by former Prime Minister Alkatiri, leading to rioting, looting, and political turmoil. The military divisions stemmed from regional differences between the eastern and western districts of East Timor, with the police also becoming factionalized. In July 2006, police in East Timor broke into factions, with some joining rebels in the hills. The dismissal of protesting troops in March 2006 led to rioting, looting, and the fleeing of thousands from the capital. Former Prime Minister Alkatiri was accused of forming \"hit squads,\" and Interior Minister Lobato was sentenced for authorizing weapon transfers. Major Alfredo Reinado, a leader in the protests, drew support from the western districts. In March 2006, violent protests led by Major Alfredo Reinado resulted in a soldier mutiny. Reinado, with support from the west, escaped from prison in August 2006. Australian forces failed to capture him in March 2007 after he persuaded a border patrol unit to hand over their assault rifles. Reinado had attracted support from young men resentful of foreign military presence and was in conflict with Fretilin. Unemployment among youth in East Timor is high, contributing to escalating violence. The escalating violence in East Timor, fueled by resentment towards Fretilin and high youth unemployment, led to gang violence, displacement of residents, and property destruction. The instability affected livelihoods, displacing 100,000 people by February 2007, with issues of water access and sanitation in IDP camps. The escalating violence in East Timor led to the displacement of 100,000 people by February 2007, with issues of water access and sanitation in IDP camps. Many IDPs did not have homes to return to due to damage or destruction, facing challenges such as poor sanitation, risk of disease, and flooding. The overall context in East Timor included high poverty rates, child mortality due to lack of sanitation, infectious diseases, and malnutrition, as well as rice shortages and increasing food prices. Deteriorating social structures and services affected healthcare, education, and disaster response, with a transition from humanitarian to development activities posing challenges. During the rainy season in East Timor, distribution of basic essentials and projects for IDPs were prioritized, but needs were widespread. Transitioning from humanitarian to development programs faced challenges due to extreme poverty levels. Funding increased during times of insecurity, with the UN providing emergency assistance in 2006 and 2007. Security incidents led to restrictions on humanitarian personnel movement, raising concerns about access and safety for displaced individuals and aid organizations. Local gang-related incidents were believed to be behind violent demonstrations, causing displacement due to civil unrest. Some concerns arose regarding the protection and security of displaced individuals and aid organizations during violent demonstrations in East Timor. Contingency planning was initiated by the National Disaster Management Office and Ministry of Labour. International humanitarian aid efforts, including the U.N. peacekeeping operation, provided assistance alongside local organizations. By April 2008, IDPs willing to return received support packages, leading to the decommissioning of some IDP camps. The Ministry of Social Solidarity oversaw the returns process with help from organizations like the International Organization for Migration. At the height of the crisis, there were reportedly 65 IDP camps in East Timor. The Ministry of Social Solidarity, with assistance from international organizations like the International Organization for Migration, oversaw the return process. By November 2008, 10,400 families had returned, 21 camps had closed, and transitional shelter sites were constructed. However, returning IDPs still faced challenges such as limited access to food, water, and basic services, along with land disputes, damaged homes, and fear of violence hindering reintegration into their communities. Despite these difficulties, there were no major incidents of violence during the recent IDP returns. During recent IDP returns in East Timor, challenges such as limited access to basic services, land disputes, damaged homes, and fear of violence hindered reintegration. The U.N. Representative on Human Rights for IDPs emphasized the need for sustainable returns and durable solutions. The U.N. Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste was established to assist with security, political, and humanitarian issues, including support for electoral processes. The U.N. Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste was established to assist with security, political, and humanitarian issues, including support for the presidential and parliamentary electoral process.

Indonesia's parliament confirmed the referendum results on October 19, 1999. The United Nations Transitional Authority for East Timor (UNTAET) was created on October 25, 1999, to oversee East Timor's transition to independence. UNTAET's mandate included providing humanitarian aid, reconstruction assistance, and aiding East Timorese refugees in Indonesia. The United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) was established in 2002 after the killing of U.N. humanitarian workers by East Timorese militia groups. It was succeeded by the United Nations Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL) in 2005, which focused on peace-building activities and supporting state institutions. In his address to the U.N. Security Council on January 23, 2006, Sukehiro Hasegawa, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Timor-Leste, highlighted progress in strengthening state institutions, democratic governance, human rights, and the development of the national police force, particularly the Border Patrol Unit. The Timorese were building skills in public administration, training national judges, and developing expertise in the finance sector. Progress was also made in drafting strategic plans, complaint handling systems, and fulfilling international legal obligations. Concerns about progress were raised, including the need for further assessments and training of the Border Patrol Unit. Hasegawa raised concerns about weaknesses in capacity building in justice and finance sectors, pending civil and criminal cases, human rights activities needing supervision, unresolved issues over crimes against humanity in East Timor, and the need for additional training for the Border Patrol Unit. Despite progress, the situation was described as \"fragile\" with a focus on maintaining stability for upcoming elections.

They also have economic interests in hydrocarbon resources in the seabed between the two countries, recognized through the Timor Gap Treaty with Indonesia in 1989. The Timor Gap Treaty between Indonesia and Australia in 1989 established Indonesian control over East Timor for joint development of hydrocarbon resources. The Timor Sea Treaty replaced it in 2003 with Timor-Leste. Despite disagreements on sovereignty, Australia and Timor-Leste cooperate on developing resources. Timor-Leste prefers a processing facility in Timor, while Australia supports one in Darwin due to commercial concerns. Key players in the greater Sunrise project include Woodside, ConocoPhillips, Shell, and Osaka Gas.

President Gusmao supported a joint East Timor-Indonesia Commission of Truth and Friendship to address past atrocities. Public hearings were held in Bali in February 2007, but some criticized Gusmao for not holding Indonesia accountable for documented atrocities in 1999. The Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor (CAVR) report released in October 2005 detailed executions, torture, mutilations, and rape. If Gusmao becomes prime minister, it is likely that there would be no accountability for these atrocities.
