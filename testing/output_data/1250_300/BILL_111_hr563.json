    "content": "The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" requires priority for SCHIP coverage of children in families with income under 200 percent of the federal poverty level. The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" mandates the inclusion of income-related data in annual reports to assess the success of states in providing health insurance for children at different income levels. The Secretary must establish standards for data collection and statistical methodologies by September 30, 2009. The Act requires family income levels to be based on gross income relative to percentages of the poverty line for the size of the family. States must develop a plan to ensure all low-income children have health coverage approved by the Secretary. The Act mandates states to develop a plan approved by the Secretary to ensure health coverage for low-income children starting in fiscal year 2010. The Secretary will review and approve plans promptly, with the opportunity for states to resubmit modified plans if disapproved. States will be notified promptly of plan approval or disapproval. The Act requires states to submit a plan meeting specific criteria for providing health coverage to low-income children. The Secretary will promptly notify states of plan approval or disapproval. The term 'qualified low-income child' is defined based on family income and eligibility requirements. Additionally, there are limitations on the use of SCHIP funds related to increases in income eligibility. The Act imposes limitations on SCHIP funds regarding increases in income eligibility levels for State child health plans. Payment will not be made for individuals whose family income exceeds the eligibility level unless the State shows that no more than 10% of low-income children are not covered. The Act imposes limitations on SCHIP funds for qualified low-income children and currently eligible children. Payment will not be limited for these children under the State child health plan eligibility standards in effect as of the enactment date."
