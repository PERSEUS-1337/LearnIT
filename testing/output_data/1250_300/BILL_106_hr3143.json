    "content": "The Act titled \"High Performance Schools Act of 1999\" is established for the purpose of improving school performance. The Congress finds that American K-12 schools spend over $6 billion annually on energy costs, educators and students perform best in a comfortable, healthy environment, over half of schools are over 40 years old and need renovation, inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, and uncomfortable temperatures can affect student performance, and inefficient water use is common in older schools. Inefficient water use in older schools can impact student performance. Adopting a whole building approach in school design and renovation leads to high performance buildings and improves student and teacher performance. This approach also results in lower life-cycle costs and energy conservation, saving money for teachers and educational materials. Utilizing renewable energy sources is also beneficial. Construction and renovation projects in schools can save energy costs, allowing more funds for teachers and materials. Using renewable energy sources and environmentally friendly products can improve indoor air quality. Many school districts lack knowledge of efficient design and technologies. Legislation is being considered to support new school construction and renovations. The purpose is to help school districts create high-performance elementary schools. Congress is considering legislation to assist school districts in building new high-performance schools that are energy efficient and environmentally sound. The legislation aims to establish and administer a program to help school districts construct energy-efficient and environmentally friendly high-performance schools. The High Performance Schools Program is established in the Department of Education to provide grants to school districts for energy efficiency improvements and renovations to respond to increasing school enrollments or facility renovations. Grants aim to achieve energy efficiency performance at least 30 percent beyond the levels in the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code. The High Performance Schools Program provides grants to school districts with demonstrated need for funding to accommodate growing enrollments or renovate facilities. Districts must show lack of funds to address these needs independently and commit to developing high performance school buildings. Grants can also be used for compliance evaluation and promoting energy efficiency in new and existing facilities. The High Performance Schools Program provides grants for developing high performance school buildings, organizing programs, obtaining technical services, and collecting data. Grants can also be used for promotional activities, financing, energy efficiency, and public benefit programs. The High Performance Schools Program provides grants for developing high performance school buildings, organizing programs, obtaining technical services, and collecting data. Grants can also be used for promoting the use of energy service companies, working with school administrations, students, and communities, coordinating public benefit programs, and implementing plans developed by school districts in consultation with State offices of energy and education. The State agency designated by the Governor determines the feasibility and appropriateness of the plans, and encourages school districts to supplement grant funds with other sources. SEC. 4. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS.\n\nGovernors will receive funds for implementing the Act and will decide which State agency will administer the assistance program to school districts. Funds will be allocated as follows: 70% for grants under section 3(b)(1), 15% for grants under section 3(b)(2), and 15% for grants under section 3(b)(3). The Secretary of Education may retain funds to assist State agencies in coordinating and implementing the Program. \n\nSEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n$200,000,000 authorized for fiscal year 2001, $210,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, $220,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, $230,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, and additional funds for the following 6 years. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\nDefines \"elementary school\" and \"secondary school\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. \nDefines \"high performance school building\" as a building that maximizes renewable energy use, is cost-effective, uses environmentally friendly materials, and enhances indoor quality. \nDefines \"renewable energy\" as energy from solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass sources."
