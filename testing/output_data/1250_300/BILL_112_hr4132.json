    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Faster Access to Specialized Treatments Act\" or \"FAST Act\". Congress recognizes the critical role of the FDA in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of new medicines. Advances in medical sciences have led to the development of targeted treatments for serious diseases, utilizing innovative drug development strategies. FDA should implement more effective processes for expedited development and review of innovative medicines for serious or life-threatening diseases, including rare conditions, using modern scientific tools earlier in the drug development cycle. This could lead to fewer, smaller, or shorter clinical trials without compromising FDA's high standards for drug approval. Patients benefit from quicker access to safe and effective therapies for unmet medical needs. Patients benefit from expedited access to safe and effective innovative therapies for serious or life-threatening diseases. The existing statutory authority governing expedited drug approval should be enhanced to expedite development and access to novel treatments. Congress believes the FDA should utilize accelerated approval and fast track provisions to help expedite the availability of treatments for serious conditions. The fast track provisions in section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act are amended to expedite the development and availability of treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES OR CONDITIONS. Amendment to Section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to expedite approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases. The Secretary will expedite the review of new drugs designated as fast track products for serious or life-threatening diseases, addressing unmet medical needs. The sponsor may request this designation, and within 60 days, the Secretary will determine eligibility. The Secretary can designate a drug as a fast track product under the Public Health Service Act, expediting its development and review process. Additionally, the Secretary may approve a product for a serious or life-threatening disease based on certain criteria, including the availability of alternative treatments. The Public Health Service Act allows the Secretary to designate a drug as a fast track product, expediting its development and review process. Approval for a serious or life-threatening disease may be based on specific criteria, including the effect on surrogate or clinical endpoints that predict clinical benefit or other clinical outcomes. The evidence supporting these endpoints may include various scientific methods or tools. The Secretary may require post-approval studies and review of promotional materials for products approved under the fast track designation. Approval may be withdrawn expediently if necessary. The Secretary can withdraw approval of a fast track product if the sponsor fails to conduct required post-approval studies, if a study fails to verify predicted effects, if evidence shows the product is not safe or effective, or if false promotional materials are disseminated. The Secretary can withdraw approval of a fast track product if the sponsor disseminates false or misleading promotional materials. The Secretary may review portions of an application before it is complete if the sponsor provides a schedule for submission of necessary information and pays any required fees. The Secretary can withdraw approval of a fast track product for false advertising. The Secretary may review parts of an application before completion if a schedule is provided for necessary information and fees are paid. Any agreed time period for drug application review does not apply until the application is complete. The Secretary must raise awareness among relevant parties about accelerated approval and fast track products. A program should be established to promote the development of scientific methods to predict clinical benefit. The Secretary may review parts of an application before completion if a schedule is provided for necessary information and fees are paid. A program should be established to promote the development of scientific methods to predict clinical benefit, including biomarkers and other tools for serious or life-threatening conditions with unmet medical needs. SEC. 4. GUIDANCE; AMENDED REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must issue draft guidance within one year of the enactment of the Act, followed by final guidance and amendments to regulations within one year of the draft guidance issuance. Considerations include issues related to accelerated approval and fast track processes for drugs designated for rare diseases. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must issue guidance within one year of the Act's enactment, focusing on processes for drugs designated for rare diseases and incorporating novel approaches to surrogate endpoints review based on pathophysiologic and pharmacologic evidence. The issuance of guidance or regulations should not delay the review or approval of requests or applications under section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT REVIEW.\n\nThe Secretary will contract with an independent entity to evaluate the FDA's application of new drug review processes and their impact on innovative treatments for serious conditions. Consultation with various stakeholders is required.\n\nSEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\nThe amendments aim to encourage innovative approaches for product assessment under accelerated approval while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards."
