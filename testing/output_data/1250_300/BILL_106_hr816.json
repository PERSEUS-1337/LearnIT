Subsequent payments can be deducted in the year they are made. Definitions for \"applicable child support payments\" and \"eligible taxpayer\" are as per section 166(f). The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1999, and define \"applicable child support payments\" and \"eligible taxpayer\" as per section 166(f). SEC. 4.
