    "content": "Intelligence officials and Members of Congress are discussing ways to reduce intelligence spending while protecting core capabilities. DNI James R. Clapper Jr. warned of a 7% cut, or roughly $4 billion, to the National Intelligence Program budget under sequestration, leading to reduced global coverage and intelligence collection. He also highlighted the negative impact of past budget cuts in the 1990s, resulting in workforce distortions. Congress passed the FY2013 intelligence authorization legislation in December 2012, signed into law in January 2013. The FY2013 intelligence authorization legislation (S. 3454) was passed by the Senate and House in December 2012, signed into law in January 2013 (P.L. 112-277). This bill reflected increased funding for intelligence activities following the 9/11 attacks and the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) oversees the intelligence community, advises the President, and directs intelligence collection. The role was established to address the lack of coordination in the intelligence community highlighted by the 9/11 Commission. The DNI has authority over budget priorities, collection methods, and analytical products. The 9/11 Commission released its report in July 2004, with Congress debating its recommendations. Key issues included the authorities of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and intelligence organization reforms. Many recommendations were adopted with a compromise provision to respect department heads' authorities. The intelligence community consists of the DNI, CIA, INR, and Defense. For more details on intelligence community reform, intelligence collection disciplines, and budgeting, refer to Appendix A. The intelligence community, as defined by the 113th Congress, includes various agencies such as the CIA, DIA, NSA, NGA, FBI, Army Intelligence, Navy Intelligence, Air Force Intelligence, and others. These agencies are part of different departments but collaborate on intelligence activities, with the CIA playing a central role in analytic efforts. The CIA is a key player in the intelligence community, providing all-source analytical capabilities and conducting covert actions when directed by the President. The Department of Defense houses major intelligence agencies like the NSA, NRO, and NGA, responsible for signals intelligence, reconnaissance, and geospatial intelligence, respectively. The NSA, NRO, and NGA are major intelligence agencies responsible for signals intelligence, reconnaissance satellites, and geospatial data. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) provides analytical products for the Department of Defense, while the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) is known for high-quality analysis. The DNI has budgetary and management authority over these agencies, but the Secretary of Defense retains responsibilities for them. The State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) is a small but highly respected analytical agency within the intelligence community. The FBI's key intelligence functions focus on counterterrorism and counterintelligence, with a growing emphasis on sharing information with other agencies. Military service intelligence organizations primarily concentrate on mission-specific concerns, supplementing the work of CIA analysts and DIA. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for fusing law enforcement and intelligence information on terrorist threats. The Coast Guard focuses on maritime security, while the Energy Department analyzes foreign nuclear weapons programs. The Treasury Department collects information affecting U.S. fiscal policies. The Energy Department analyzes foreign nuclear weapons programs and energy-security issues, with a robust counterintelligence effort. The Treasury Department collects information affecting U.S. fiscal policies and covers terrorist financing. Intelligence authorization bills were enacted from FY1979 through FY2005, providing guidance to intelligence agencies. No intelligence authorization legislation was enacted between December 2004 and October 2010. The absence of intelligence authorization acts led to key intelligence issues being addressed in defense authorization acts, resulting in misplaced priorities and wasteful spending estimates. Congress has passed three Intelligence Authorization bills in the last two years, including classified authorizations, to address issues such as DNI authorities, GAO audit authority, and national security leaks. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 tasked the DNI with eliminating waste and duplication in the intelligence community. Some believe the DNI has focused more on information sharing than on reducing redundancy, leading to the proliferation of intelligence organizations. Redundancy can be beneficial in intelligence, especially in counterterrorism efforts. Redundancy in intelligence, particularly in counterterrorism and analysis, serves important functions by ensuring due diligence in identifying and disrupting threats. Competitive analysis helps check biases and avoid single points of failure in strategic analysis. The DNI's focus on information sharing has led to the proliferation of intelligence organizations. The lack of competing analytic judgments was a criticism by post-9/11 commissions, suggesting that competition could have improved pre-war analysis. Balancing the need for effective competition while preventing large-scale attacks will be a challenge for the 113th Congress in intelligence. Reforms post-9/11 aimed to improve information sharing, with the USA Patriot Act and Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 facilitating greater access to intelligence information. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 improved information sharing within the intelligence community, leading to successes in sharing intelligence about potential threats. John Brennan noted that sharing between intelligence agencies and partners was at an all-time high. John Brennan highlighted the challenges of information overload in the intelligence community, with analysts struggling to connect disparate data points due to the large volume of intelligence traffic. The Senate report on the Christmas day bombing attempt also noted that analysts faced difficulties in searching through terrorism-related intelligence. The intelligence community faces challenges in connecting data points due to information overload. Analysts struggle to search through large volumes of terrorism-related intelligence, leading to difficulties in separating valuable information from irrelevant data. Congress may need to review technical and institutional changes made since 2009 to address this issue. Intelligence has become integral to military operations, with the Persian Gulf War highlighting the importance of both tactical and national intelligence systems. The Persian Gulf War emphasized the significance of intelligence in military operations, with satellites previously focused on Soviet facilities now playing a crucial role. Despite technical challenges, improvements have been made with congressional support. However, a 2012 report by the President's Intelligence Advisory Board raised concerns that the CIA and the intelligence community have become too focused on tactical operations, neglecting strategic intelligence gathering and analysis. Some observers believe the intelligence community has shifted focus towards operational support and counterterrorism, potentially neglecting strategic intelligence gathering and analysis. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) is responsible for setting community priorities and ensuring resources are allocated accordingly. Despite concerns raised by the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, the intelligence agencies collect vast amounts of information daily, aiding in military capabilities and providing valuable knowledge on various subjects. The emergence of the international terrorist threat has posed challenges to intelligence agencies, especially in gathering information about sophisticated terrorist groups. The Intelligence Reform Act called for increased emphasis and resources to enhance human intelligence capabilities, leading to the establishment of the National Clandestine Service at the CIA in 2005. Congressional concerns also exist regarding the depth and breadth of human intelligence operations. The National Clandestine Service was established at the CIA in 2005 to manage humint operations and coordinate efforts by other intelligence agencies. Congressional concerns exist regarding major technical systems, such as reconnaissance satellites, with substantial budgetary implications. The intelligence community and potential targets now heavily rely on commercial technologies, including encryption systems. There is ongoing debate on acquisition programs for new satellites, and the goal of intelligence remains to provide accurate analysis in a timely manner, although it is not an exact science and failures in assessments and estimates have occurred. The performance of the intelligence community's analytical offices is debated, with some highlighting high quality analysis while others point to failures like the 9/11 attacks and flawed Iraqi weapons estimate. Congressional concerns include weaknesses in analysis, lack of language skills, and a focus on current intelligence over strategic analysis. Legislation has increased funding and introduced provisions for improvement, such as red team analyses and ensuring timely, objective, and independent intelligence products. Efforts to improve intelligence analysis include designating individuals for timely, objective, and independent intelligence products, as well as providing counsel for analysts. However, challenges remain in training analysts, especially in fields like counterterrorism. The quality of analysis may be tested by emerging national security challenges, such as Iran's nuclear program. Oversight of the Intelligence Reform Act implementation is expected to continue amidst government-wide budgetary issues. The 113th Congress faces security challenges related to Iran's nuclear program and government-wide budget issues affecting intelligence activities. Oversight of the Intelligence Reform Act implementation remains a concern, along with monitoring the relationship between the DNI and CIA Director. Congressional interest also focuses on the effectiveness of post-9/11 intelligence elements and future satellite procurement programs. Unauthorized disclosures of classified information continue to be a worry, prompting new provisions to prevent and detect such leaks. The committee expresses grave concern over unauthorized disclosures of classified information, prompting new provisions to prevent and detect leaks. The CIA's role in targeted killings may face scrutiny as the government seeks to balance transparency with national security. The Benghazi attack raised intelligence issues, with debates on whether it was a terrorist attack and if there was a prior protest. The public debate following the Benghazi attack focused on whether it was a terrorist attack and if there was a protest prior to the incident. The intelligence community initially assessed incorrectly that a protest had occurred but later revised their assessment to confirm it was a deliberate terrorist attack. Analysts faced challenges in making judgments based on incomplete information, with the understanding that assessments can change as new information emerges. The Benghazi attack raised questions about the intelligence community's analytical capabilities and the need for improved tradecraft. Congressional oversight has focused on State Department actions and public statements, with challenges in looking behind intelligence analysis noted by Britt Snider. The Benghazi attack raised questions about the intelligence community's analytical capabilities and the need for improved tradecraft. Congressional oversight has focused on State Department actions and public statements, with challenges in looking behind intelligence analysis noted by Britt Snider. Oversight questions for Benghazi include the validity of the initial protest judgment, credibility of protest information, timeliness of assessment corrections, and the presence of \"anchoring bias\" in analysts. U.S. counterterrorism efforts heavily rely on drones for intelligence collection in various regions. U.S. counterterrorism efforts heavily rely on drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), for intelligence collection in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and other areas. These drones provide real-time intelligence, serve as substitutes or supplements to other platforms, and can be armed for targeted attacks. Operated remotely, they offer advantages such as avoiding direct combat and diplomatic complications. Military services and intelligence agencies operate UAVs based on operational and statutory considerations, with concerns raised about their expanded use in targeted attacks. The use of drones in targeted attacks has raised concerns about legality and effectiveness, especially in countries where the US is not in armed conflict. Questions have been raised about the legal basis for strikes against US citizens and the long-term effectiveness of drone programs. Former DNI Blair has warned that civilian casualties in countries like Pakistan could fuel opposition to US policy goals and strengthen al-Qaeda. Former DNI Blair warns that civilian casualties in countries like Pakistan could fuel opposition to US policy goals and strengthen al-Qaeda. Congress is expected to closely oversee the use of UAVs in counterterrorism efforts. FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III introduced reforms to improve intelligence efforts after criticism for failing to focus on the terrorist threat and share intelligence. Congress has expressed concerns about the effectiveness of these reforms and the FBI's information technology acquisition efforts. The FBI's intelligence transformation post-9/11 has faced challenges, highlighted by the Fort Hood shooting in 2009. Senate investigation revealed incomplete progress and internal barriers hindering the agency's shift towards an intelligence-driven approach. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established a Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection within DHS to identify and assess terrorist threats to the US. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established a Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection within DHS to identify and assess terrorist threats to the US. This Directorate has since been divided into two components, with intelligence functions falling to the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A). The Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) was established in 2003 and later transferred to the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) to assess potential terrorist threats. NCTC coordinates information from various sources, while I&A serves as a liaison between federal, state, and local partners with a broader mandate beyond counterterrorism. The establishment of NCTC and the FBI's transition to an intelligence-driven organization have raised questions about the role of DHS I&A. The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) holds significant authority over intelligence agencies within DOD, including systems acquisition. Reports suggest DOD special forces are involved in intelligence collection not coordinated with the CIA. Potential conflicts between the USD(I) and the DNI's office have been noted. Stephen Cambone was the first USD(I), succeeded by James Clapper, who later became DNI. Michael Vickers also held the position. The USD(I) holds significant authority over DOD intelligence agencies, with responsibilities including budgetary and hiring authority. The relationship between the USD(I) and the DNI is influenced by personal relationships and temperament. Congressional interest remains in the mission and responsibilities of the USD(I) and its relationship with the DNI. Concerns have been raised about DOD intelligence personnel's expanded efforts in humint collection and battlefield preparation operations. Some observers are concerned about DOD intelligence personnel expanding humint collection efforts and battlefield preparation operations, potentially interfering with CIA humint collectors. Intelligence officials claim there is no unnecessary duplication of effort and emphasize coordination during operations. Questions have been raised about DOD's administration of intelligence personnel, including cover problems and deployment locations. The creation of the Defense Clandestine Service in 2012 aimed to shift defense intelligence activities towards humint operations against national-level priorities. The Defense Clandestine Service was created to focus on humint operations against national-level priorities. The Senate Armed Services Committee froze funding for civilian personnel conducting defense human intelligence to support the current number of personnel. Concerns were raised about DOD's intelligence needs despite significant growth in personnel since 9/11. The Defense Clandestine Service was established to prioritize humint operations against national-level targets. Despite the winding down of overseas conflicts, the Department of Defense feels its intelligence needs are not being adequately addressed. Statutory provisions require informing Congress of covert actions and intelligence activities, with a \"Gang of Eight\" established for limited notification in exceptional circumstances. Controversy surrounds whether this limited notification should extend to intelligence activities beyond covert actions. The House Intelligence Committee proposed removing the \"Gang of Eight\" provisions and requiring all committee members to be briefed on intelligence activities, including covert actions. The Administration opposed this, stating it restricts the President's ability to protect sensitive intelligence activities. The Senate version of the bill ultimately addressed notification for both covert actions and intelligence activities, requiring Administration briefing if notification is not limited by the committee. The Senate version of the FY2010 intelligence authorization bill, which became P.L. 111-259, addresses notification of covert actions and intelligence activities. Members have expressed frustration with the lack of consultation on intelligence activity, as seen during the Senate confirmation of CIA Director John Brennan. Unauthorized disclosures of classified information are a concern. Some Members suggested initial distrust between intelligence community and oversight bodies due to refusal to share opinions. Unauthorized disclosures of classified information have been a significant concern. Senate Intelligence Authorization legislation focused on tighter restrictions to prevent leaks and define consequences. The bill includes limits on media interaction, insider threat program development, and withholding pensions for illegal disclosures. Provisions on unauthorized disclosure were dropped from the final bill. White House released National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding in December 2012. The White House released its National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding in December 2012, calling for reforms to address unauthorized disclosures of classified information. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has the authority to audit and investigate public funds but has exceptions for intelligence activities. Some Members believe the GAO should have a role in intelligence oversight. Intelligence authorization bills have included provisions expanding GAO's responsibilities. Some Members believe the GAO should have a role in intelligence oversight, with provisions for an expanded GAO role included in recent intelligence authorization bills despite Administration opposition. An amendment was added to the FY2011 Defense Authorization bill that would require the DNI to provide the GAO with necessary information for analysis, evaluation, or investigation by congressional intelligence committees. The GAO audits of intelligence agencies could be requested by any congressional committee with appropriate jurisdiction, with redacted information provided only to the congressional intelligence committees. The DNI issued a directive in May 2011 to govern GAO access to intelligence agency information, which went into effect in June 2011. The directive encourages cooperation but limits access to core national intelligence capabilities and activities for GAO audits. The Directive issued by the DNI in May 2011 went into effect on June 30, 2011. GAO's response to ICD 114 highlighted concerns about potential hindrances to their work. Congress may need to assess the interpretation and impact of ICD 114 on GAO access to intelligence information. The intelligence community is structured around three major disciplines: signals intelligence (sigint), imagery intelligence (imint), and human intelligence (humint). Sigint collection is managed by NSA at Fort Meade, MD, and the increasing use of encryption systems poses challenges for intelligence gathering. NSA at Fort Meade, MD is responsible for Sigint collection, which has evolved to target terrorist groups using advanced encryption systems. Lieutenant General Michael Hayden initiated a reorganization of NSA to adapt to changing conditions. Imagery intelligence (imint) is also undergoing significant changes in collection methods. The U.S. intelligence community is outsourcing functions previously done by career personnel, with some acquisition initiatives not meeting objectives. Imagery intelligence (imint) is collected through satellites, manned aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). There is a greater need for satellites to collect information on various targets, but questions arise about the private sector's ability to meet intelligence agency requirements. High altitude UAVs like the Global Hawk are also being utilized. The National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) was established in 1996 to manage imagery processing and dissemination previously undertaken by separate agencies. It was renamed the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in 2004. NGA's goal is to use imagery and geospatial information to describe physical features and activities on Earth. The CIA is the primary collector of human intelligence (humint), but the Defense Department also has responsibilities in this area. The CIA is the primary collector of humint, but the Defense Department also has responsibilities in this area. Inadequate humint has been a systemic problem, especially in gaining prior knowledge of the 9/11 plots. The changing international environment requires seeking information from clandestine terrorist groups or narcotics traffickers. Placing U.S. intelligence officials under \"nonofficial cover\" (NOC) in foreign countries is crucial for gathering important humint. Placing U.S. intelligence officials under \"nonofficial cover\" (NOC) in foreign countries presents significant challenges due to administrative complexities, potential conflicts of interest, and risks of involvement with terrorist groups or smugglers. The responsibilities of operatives under nonofficial cover must be reconciled with those to private employers, leading to potential embarrassment and physical danger. The CIA established guidelines in 1995 for recruiting informants with unsavory backgrounds in response to allegations of close ties with criminals in Central America. The guidelines were replaced in 2002, as directed by the FY2002 Intelligence Authorization Act. A major challenge for intelligence collection is the lack of personnel trained in needed languages, as the intelligence community now requires experts in a wider range of obscure languages and dialects. The intelligence community faces a challenge in recruiting personnel trained in a variety of languages and dialects. Various approaches have been considered, including using civilian contract personnel, military reservists with language qualifications, and providing substantial bonuses for maintaining proficiency. The National Security Education Program offers scholarships and career training for individuals in national security agencies. Masint, a highly technical discipline involving analytical refinements to information collected by sensors, has received greater emphasis in recent years. Retaining personnel with expertise in masint systems is a key issue. Spectral imaging is used for identifying objects based on light reflection and absorption. Masint, conducted by DIA and other DOD agencies, faces challenges in retaining experts due to better opportunities in private industry. Open source information (osint) from various sources is increasingly important for gathering information on multiple regions and topics. There are calls for intelligence agencies to be more aggressive in using osint, which could potentially reduce the need for certain collection efforts. The availability of osint raises questions about the necessity of traditional intelligence gathering, analysis, and dissemination efforts. The availability of open source intelligence (osint) may reduce the need for traditional collection efforts by intelligence agencies. There have been calls for a dedicated Open Source Center to coordinate osint collection and dissemination. Integrating data from different intelligence sources remains a challenge due to technical issues and security concerns. The Intelligence Reform Act mandated the establishment of an Intelligence Sharing Environment (ISE) to facilitate sharing terrorism-related information. Barriers between foreign intelligence and law enforcement information have been a challenge, but the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 allowed for sharing law enforcement information with intelligence agencies. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 removed barriers between law enforcement and intelligence information, allowing for sharing of information. The Homeland Security Act and subsequent creation of the National Counterterrorism Center aimed to combine information from both sources. Intelligence spending is divided between the National Intelligence Program and the Military Intelligence Program. The Military Intelligence Program (MIP) was established in September 2005, encompassing DOD-wide intelligence programs and intelligence programs supporting armed services. The bulk of national intelligence spending is hidden within the DOD budget, described in classified annexes to legislation. Intelligence spending is authorized in intelligence authorization acts or defense appropriations acts when authorization legislation is not enacted. Intelligence spending is authorized in intelligence authorization acts or defense appropriations acts. Attempts to make total intelligence spending public were unsuccessful, with only limited information disclosed in response to a lawsuit. Figures for intelligence spending in subsequent years were not released. In 2004, the Senate approved a bill requiring the publication of the National Intelligence Program (NIP) amount, but the House version did not include this provision. The Intelligence Reform Act did not make intelligence spending amounts public. However, the DNI was required to disclose the aggregate amount of funds appropriated for the NIP starting in 2007. The NIP amounts for FY2008 and FY2009 were $47.5 billion and $49.8 billion, respectively. In 2009, DNI Blair stated that total annual intelligence spending was $75 billion, including military intelligence activities. In FY2009, the NIP was $49.8 billion. DNI Blair announced in September 2009 that total intelligence spending was $75 billion, including military intelligence activities. For FY2010, NIP received $53.1 billion, while MIP received $27 billion. In FY2011, NIP received $54.6 billion and MIP received $24 billion. FY2012 saw NIP receiving $53.9 billion. FY2013 requested NIP funding was $52.6 billion. Senate Intelligence Committee has jurisdiction over intelligence programs. The FY2013 intelligence authorization bill is slightly above the President's 2013 request and below 2012's enacted budget. The Senate Intelligence Committee has jurisdiction over the NIP, while the House Intelligence Committee has jurisdiction over both NIP and MIP programs. Intelligence spending is mainly done by agencies within DOD, involving oversight from armed services committees. Most intelligence appropriations are included in national defense acts, funding CIA, DIA, NSA, NRO, NGA, State Department, FBI, DHS, and other agencies. Senate established an Appropriations Subcommittee on intelligence in October 2004. The Senate established an Appropriations Subcommittee on intelligence in October 2004, but a similar action was not taken by the House. In January 2007, the House approved H.Res. 35 to establish a select panel within the appropriations committee to oversee intelligence program appropriations. Intelligence budgeting issues were central to the debate on intelligence reform legislation in 2004, aiming to make the new DNI responsible for the National Intelligence Program budget. The final version of P.L. 108-458 provides broad budgetary authorities to the DNI, requiring the President to issue guidelines for the DNI to respect statutory responsibilities of other departments. Effective working relationships among the Office of the DNI, DOD, and the White House staff are crucial for implementing the Intelligence Reform Act. Observers anticipate that the Intelligence Reform Act's budgetary provisions will rely on effective relationships between the Office of the DNI, DOD, and the White House. Recent legislation, including the FY2012 Intelligence Authorization bill and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, have impacted intelligence budgeting. These acts establish Treasury Department accounts for receiving funds from defense intelligence elements and other agencies, aligning intelligence budget submissions with Defense Department formats. These provisions aim to enhance the DNI's management of intelligence accounts and improve congressional oversight. In response to the September 11 attacks, the Intelligence Community had general indications of a possible terrorist attack in 2001 and issued strategic warnings. The Joint Inquiry conducted public hearings to investigate the attacks, with testimony from families of victims, policymakers, and senior CIA and FBI officials. The DNI's management of intelligence accounts and congressional oversight were strengthened, despite limitations on budget requests separate from the DOD. The Intelligence Community had indications of a possible terrorist attack in the spring and summer of 2001, but did not have specific details on when, where, and how the attacks would occur. The Joint Inquiry found that there was a steady stream of intelligence reporting on potential attacks within the United States from 1998 to 2001. The inquiry also highlighted the intelligence community's lack of preparedness for global terrorism, budgetary inefficiencies, and shortages of linguists and human sources. The Joint Inquiry found that the intelligence community lacked preparedness for global terrorism, had budgetary inefficiencies, and shortages of linguists and human sources. Recommendations included creating a Director of National Intelligence separate from the CIA director, reorienting the FBI towards counterterrorism, and possibly establishing a domestic surveillance agency similar to Britain's MI5. The 9/11 Commission report recommended establishing a National Intelligence Director (NID) to oversee the National Intelligence Program and its contributing agencies. Former Governor Thomas H. Kean served as chairman, with hearings held in spring 2004 to discuss intelligence agency roles before the 2001 attacks. The NID would manage the budget and nominate agency heads. The 9/11 Commission recommended creating a National Intelligence Director (NID) to oversee the National Intelligence Program and its agencies. The NID would manage the budget, nominate agency heads, and oversee paramilitary operations. The commission also suggested a single intelligence committee in each house of Congress and public disclosure of intelligence appropriations. President Bush signed executive orders in 2004 to implement some of these recommendations, including establishing a National Counterterrorism Center. The 9/11 Commission recommended creating a National Intelligence Director (NID) to oversee the National Intelligence Program and its agencies. President Bush signed executive orders in 2004 to reform intelligence, including establishing a National Counterterrorism Center. Legislation was enacted to create a National Intelligence Director separate from a CIA Director. The Intelligence Reform Act, signed into law in December 2004, focused on the authorities of the Director of National Intelligence in relation to major intelligence agencies in DOD. Ongoing implementation of the Act will receive oversight during the 113th Congress. The Intelligence Reform Act, signed into law in December 2004, became P.L. 108-458. Ongoing implementation of the Act will continue to receive oversight during the 113th Congress. In December 2005, media reports of NSA electronic surveillance outside FISA parameters led to criticism of the Administration. The Bush Administration defended the surveillance as necessary for national security, citing constitutional authorities and the Joint Resolution providing for Authority for the Use of Force. The Bush Administration defended NSA electronic surveillance outside FISA parameters as necessary for national security, citing constitutional authorities and the Joint Resolution providing for Authority for the Use of Force. Agreement was reached in early March 2006 with intelligence committees for enhanced oversight, and legislative initiatives were considered to modify FISA or establish new authorities for electronic surveillance. The House Intelligence Committee's 2006 report reflected differing views on the NSA effort. In January 2007, the Bush Administration advised that electronic surveillance under the Terrorist Surveillance Program would be subject to FISC approval. The Bush Administration informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that electronic surveillance under the Terrorist Surveillance Program would now require FISC approval. The Senate Intelligence Committee discussed revising FISA in May 2007, with differing views on the legislation. A FISC judge ruled in 2007 that surveillance of foreign communications passing through the US required a FISC order. The DNI argued in August 2007 that court orders should not be necessary for collecting foreign intelligence overseas. The Bush Administration informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that electronic surveillance under the Terrorist Surveillance Program would now require FISC approval. The DNI argued in August 2007 that court orders should not be necessary for collecting foreign intelligence overseas, leading to the signing of the Protect America Act (PAA) in August 2007, which allowed surveillance without a court order of foreign to foreign communications. The Protect America Act (PAA) allowed for the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning persons believed to be outside the US, including US persons, without the need for a court order. The DNI and Attorney General had to certify that this did not constitute electronic surveillance, with oversight by the FISC. The PAA expired in 2008, and efforts to extend it failed in Congress. The Protect America Act (PAA) expired on February 1, 2008, and efforts to extend it further failed in Congress. Acquisitions authorized under the PAA may continue until their expiration. The RESTORE Act was passed in an attempt to clarify that a court order is not required for certain communications interceptions. The RESTORE Act aimed to provide increased judicial oversight and quarterly audits for intelligence agencies conducting communications interceptions. The Senate Intelligence Committee also proposed a FISA amendment allowing targeting of non-U.S. persons outside the United States for foreign intelligence information. The Senate bill (S. 2248) proposed provisions for targeting non-U.S. persons outside the United States for foreign intelligence information, with FISC approval required for targeting U.S. persons located outside the U.S. It also included retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies from civil suits related to assistance in intelligence activities between 9/11/2001 and 1/17/2007. The role of the judicial branch, particularly the FISC, in approving and overseeing surveillance was a central issue. The Senate bill proposed provisions for targeting non-U.S. persons for foreign intelligence information, with FISC approval required for targeting U.S. persons outside the U.S. It included retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies from civil suits related to intelligence activities between 9/11/2001 and 1/17/2007. The role of the judicial branch, particularly the FISC, in approving and overseeing surveillance was a central issue. The Senate approved S. 2248 on February 12, 2008, and the House approved an amendment to H.R. 3773 on March 14, 2008. The Senate and House approved S. 2248 and H.R. 3773, respectively, with provisions for targeting non-U.S. persons for foreign intelligence information. The House amendment required judicial review by the FISC for targeting procedures, which the Bush Administration argued could delay collection efforts and intelligence gathering. The House-passed amendment to H.R. 3773 required FISC approval for targeting communications of non-U.S. persons, with provisions for renewals and emergency acquisitions of U.S. persons' communications. It did not grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies but allowed them to defend themselves in court. Additionally, it proposed establishing a commission on warrantless electronic surveillance activities conducted between September 11, 2001, and January 17, 2007. The House-passed amendment to H.R. 3773 required FISC approval for targeting communications of non-U.S. persons, with provisions for renewals and emergency acquisitions of U.S. persons' communications. It did not grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies but allowed them to defend themselves in court. Representative Reyes introduced a new bill, H.R. 6304, that strengthened the role of the FISC in approving procedures for intelligence surveillance and provided telecommunications companies an opportunity to demonstrate their compliance. H.R. 6304 was passed by the House and Senate in 2008, becoming P.L. 110-261. Several FISA provisions were extended until June 1, 2015, by subsequent legislation. The FISA provisions were extended multiple times, with the latest extension until June 1, 2015, by P.L. 112-14. Various reports and acts related to intelligence capabilities and terrorism prevention were also mentioned. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has issued various reports and acts related to intelligence capabilities and terrorism prevention, including the Intelligence Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years 2005 to 2011. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has issued reports and acts related to intelligence capabilities and terrorism prevention for Fiscal Years 2005 to 2011. The reports include the Intelligence Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years 2009 to 2012, Counterterrorism Intelligence Capabilities and Performance Prior to 9-11, and the U.S. Intelligence Community's Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq. The Intelligence Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years 2005 to 2011 were issued by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. These acts authorized appropriations for intelligence and intelligence-related activities, including the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System. The Intelligence Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years 2010 to 2013 were issued by the United States Senate, covering various sessions of Congress. Additionally, reports on the attempted terrorist attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 and reviews of FBI security programs were also included in the documents."
