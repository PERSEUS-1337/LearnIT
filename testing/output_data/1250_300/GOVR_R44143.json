    "content": "Under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, both state and federal governments are prohibited from denying equal protection of the laws. Courts apply different levels of scrutiny based on the classification involved, with strict scrutiny being the most demanding form of review. This heightened scrutiny increases the likelihood of a court finding the government's action unconstitutional. Strict scrutiny is the most demanding form of judicial review, applying to governmental classifications that are constitutionally suspect or interfere with fundamental rights. Courts consider historical discrimination, minority status with unchangeable characteristics, or inadequate political protection to determine suspect classifications. Governmental actions under strict scrutiny must be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest, with the burden on the government to prove constitutional validity. Intermediate scrutiny is less searching than strict scrutiny. The government must prove the constitutional validity of its actions under strict scrutiny, showing it cannot achieve its goals through less discriminatory means. Intermediate scrutiny applies to \"quasi-suspect\" classifications like gender or illegitimacy, requiring actions to be substantially related to an important government interest. Rational basis review is the least searching form of scrutiny, where actions must be rationally related to a legitimate government interest to survive. The government must prove the constitutional validity of its actions under strict scrutiny, showing it cannot achieve its goals through less discriminatory means. Intermediate scrutiny applies to \"quasi-suspect\" classifications like gender or illegitimacy, requiring actions to be substantially related to an important government interest. Rational basis review is deferential to the government, where actions must be rationally related to a legitimate government interest to survive. Courts consider the legitimacy of any possible governmental purpose behind the action, and parties challenging governmental actions bear the burden of establishing their invalidity under rational basis review. The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees are contained within the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, prohibiting the government from depriving a person. The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees are contained in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, preventing the government from depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property without due process. Substantive due process protects fundamental rights from undue governmental infringement, with the Supreme Court determining the historical recognition and importance of these rights. The Supreme Court determines fundamental rights based on historical recognition and importance. Governmental actions infringing on these rights are subject to strict scrutiny, requiring a compelling government interest and narrow tailoring. Recognized fundamental rights include the right to have children, use contraception, and marry. The Supreme Court has recognized fundamental rights such as the right to have children, use contraception, and marry. In Obergefell v. Hodges, the Court ruled that states must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages formed in other states, citing due process and equal protection principles. The decision was based on the fundamental right to marry, even though previous cases assumed opposite-sex relationships. The Supreme Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, citing reasons such as individual autonomy, support for committed unions, safeguarding children, and maintaining social order. This decision in Obergefell v. Hodges departed from previous precedent but upheld the right to marry for all couples. The Supreme Court recognized the fundamental right to marry for same-sex couples, departing from precedent based on historical roots. The Court emphasized that rights evolve with societal understanding and did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans. The Supreme Court departed from precedent by recognizing the fundamental right to marry for same-sex couples and did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans. The Court invalidated the bans, stating that equal protection and due process guarantees protect the right to marry for same-sex couples. The Supreme Court recognized the fundamental right to marry for same-sex couples, invalidating state same-sex marriage bans. The Court did not apply strict scrutiny and did not mention the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. Dissenting Justices believed the issue should have been resolved through the democratic process and expressed concern about the majority's departure from tradition and history in establishing a fundamental right. The dissenting Justices voiced concern about the majority's departure from tradition and history in establishing a fundamental right contrary to Supreme Court precedent. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about its broader impact on the rights of gay individuals, the level of judicial scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation, and the recognition of fundamental rights moving forward. The Obergefell decision raised questions about its impact on the rights of gay individuals, specifically regarding the level of judicial scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. The decision focused on the fundamental right to marry, without addressing whether classifications based on sexual orientation warrant heightened scrutiny. This limited the decision's broader implications for the rights of gay individuals. The Obergefell decision raised questions about the level of judicial scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. Prior to Obergefell, federal appeals courts had differing views on the scrutiny applicable to such classifications. The Ninth and Second Circuits applied heightened scrutiny, while the Sixth Circuit only used rational basis review. Obergefell's focus on the right to marry limited its broader implications for gay individuals' rights. The Obergefell decision did not definitively resolve the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. This ambiguity may lead to different circuit courts applying either heightened scrutiny or rational basis review to laws based on sexual orientation in the future. The Sixth Circuit's decision on government action based on sexual orientation could lead to varying outcomes in constitutional challenges. The Obergefell decision raised concerns about extending the right to marry to polygamy, with Chief Justice John Roberts suggesting potential legalization of plural marriages. The majority's opinion in Obergefell aimed to limit its reach to same-sex marriage, emphasizing the fundamental right to marry for same-sex couples. In the context of marriage, the Obergefell decision extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples. There are debates on whether this rationale could also apply to plural marriages, with some suggesting potential constitutional protections for plural marriages based on individual autonomy and family considerations. The Court's departure from traditional precedent in determining fundamental rights raises the possibility of future considerations based on contemporary views. The Court's departure from traditional precedent in determining fundamental rights raises the possibility of future considerations based on contemporary views, potentially expanding the number of rights deemed fundamental. The Court did not clarify the level of judicial review applied to state same-sex marriage bans, creating ambiguity regarding the proper level of scrutiny for governmental actions infringing on fundamental rights."
