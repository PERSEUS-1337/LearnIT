The Act emphasizes the need for a program to promote universal helmet use to prevent injuries and save lives. The Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993 emphasizes the importance of promoting bicycle helmet use among individuals under 16 through grants for programs that enforce helmet laws, provide helmets, and educate on helmet safety. Grants allow for flexibility in program design to increase helmet usage. The Children's Bicycle Helmet Safety Act of 1993 requires bicycle helmets manufactured 9 months after enactment to conform to interim standards like ANSI Z90.4-1984 and Snell B-90, with the Consumer Product Safety Commission establishing a final standard within 60 days. The final standard for bicycle helmets must include provisions to prevent helmets from coming off, address injury risks to children, and may include additional provisions. Sections 7 and 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act do not apply, and the final standard will take effect one year after issuance. Non-conforming helmets will be considered in violation of safety standards until the final standard is in place. The interim standard for bicycle helmets must be followed until the final standard is in place.
