    "content": "Bankruptcy filings peaked in 1987 for businesses, while consumer filings continued to rise until 2005, surpassing 2 million before the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 took effect. The new law caused a sharp drop in filings in 2006, but numbers rose steadily until 2010. Household debt is mainly comprised of mortgage debt and consumer credit, with credit card debt and auto/college loans being the major components. Household debt is primarily made up of mortgage debt and consumer credit, with credit card debt and auto/college loans being the main components. The burden of debt service, representing the percentage of household disposable income used to repay loans, has fluctuated within a narrow range over the past decade. Despite a gradual increase in debt burden since the 1980s, it does not fully explain the significant rise in personal bankruptcy filings over the last two decades. The increase in debt burden since the 1980s has not fully explained the significant rise in personal bankruptcy filings over the last two decades. Despite declining interest rates, the ratio of debt outstanding to income has been rising, suggesting potential future increases in bankruptcy filings if interest rates rise suddenly. The data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances shows that lower-income families are the most likely to file for bankruptcy, with no sharply rising trend in distress levels from 1998 to 2007. This suggests that the increase in personal bankruptcy filings cannot be fully explained by the rise in debt burden since the 1980s. The 2007 data shows an increase in personal bankruptcy filings among families in the upper income percentiles, possibly due to increased mortgage debt during the housing boom. The reasons for families at or below the national median income taking on high levels of debt and ending up in bankruptcy court remain unclear. Supporters of the 2005 bankruptcy reform argued that the code was too debtor-friendly, while opponents blamed marketing strategies of credit card issuers for financial distress. In December 2007, the U.S. economy entered a recession amidst global financial panic, leading to a decline in household debt levels. Debt balances fell for 11 quarters, with home equity and credit card debt leading the decrease. Factors contributing to the decline include households paying down debt, borrowing less, and lenders writing off uncollectible debt. Some lenders also tightened credit standards for new loans. Several factors contributed to the fall in debt balances, including households paying down debt, borrowing less, lenders writing off uncollectible debt, and tightened credit standards for new loans. Mortgage balances decreased due to modifications, negotiations reducing principal outstanding, and foreclosed homes being sold for less than the old mortgage amount. Causes and implications of deleveraging are discussed in CRS Report R41623, U.S. Household Debt Reduction."
