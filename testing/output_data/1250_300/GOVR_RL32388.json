    "content": "This report, General Management Laws: Major Themes and Management Policy Options, is a companion to CRS Report RL30795, General Management Laws: A Compendium. The main objectives are to identify and describe major general management laws, assist Congress in overseeing executive branch management, and help in considering potential changes to management laws and legislation. The quality and implementation of these laws are crucial for maintaining executive branch accountability and influencing federal agency effectiveness in policy formulation. The companion report focuses on major themes and management policy options for Congress related to general management laws. It includes over 90 entries organized into seven functional categories, crucial for maintaining executive branch accountability and influencing federal agency effectiveness in policy formulation. The curr_chunk discusses various functional categories within management, such as Performance Measurement, Financial Management, and Human Resources Management. It highlights how most entries in the compendium profile specific laws, with a focus on civil service laws codified in Title 5 of the United States Code. Each entry includes a brief history, major provisions, key developments, and source readings for further information. The curr_chunk discusses the roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch, highlighting the debate over their constitutional powers. It emphasizes that both branches have historically played a role in managing federal agencies, as outlined in the U.S. Constitution's system of separated powers. The U.S. Constitution establishes a system of separated powers and checks and balances between Congress and the President in managing the executive branch. Congress has the power to establish administrative agencies and determine their operations. The U.S. Constitution grants legislative powers to Congress and executive powers to the President, with limitations on each branch's authority. Congress has the authority to make laws necessary for executing its powers, while the President is tasked with ensuring laws are faithfully executed. The President's power is not absolute and must align with congressional intent. Executive departments are mentioned in Article II, where the President can seek opinions from department heads on relevant matters. The U.S. Constitution grants legislative powers to Congress and executive powers to the President. Article II mentions executive departments and the President's appointment powers. In 1789, Congress enacted laws to establish the Treasury Department and set salaries for department Secretaries. By the end of the 18th century, only three departments and the Navy Department existed. Elected officials faced challenges in federal administration post-nation's founding. By the end of the 18th century, only three departments and the Navy Department had been created, along with the office of Attorney General and the Post Office. Elected officials faced challenges in administering the federal government of a growing nation. The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, established an administrative system with an independent chief executive and a fiscal system. The Democratic-Republicans, under Thomas Jefferson, continued this framework but Congress became more involved in the administrative system. By the 1820s, both Presidents and department heads were overwhelmed with official work. By the end of the 1820s, federal employment had significantly increased from 4,837 employees in 1816 to 36,672 in 1861. The structure of executive departments had become more complex, with departments in 1860 consisting of the Secretary, bureaus handling routine business, and a field service. Post-Civil War developments, including industrialization and the Progressive Movement, further impacted government administration. The rise of the administrative state after the Civil War led to challenges in managing the executive branch. By 1946, Congress delegated much legislative authority to administrative agencies, relying on their expertise to formulate public policies. This shift also aimed to improve executive branch management practices through the expansion of general management laws. Congress expanded general management laws to address various aspects of the executive branch, including increasing transparency through legislation like the Administrative Procedure Act, Freedom of Information Act, and Federal Advisory Committee Act. To enhance oversight and accountability, inspectors general were established, the Congressional Review of Regulations Act was enacted, and agency strategic planning was required under the Government Performance and Results Act. Additionally, Congress aimed to reassert influence over the budget process with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act. Congress expanded general management laws to improve oversight and accountability in the executive branch. The Chief Financial Officers Act was passed to enhance agencies' financial management. The impact of these laws on agency discretion and presidential influence remains a topic of debate. Numerous issues for Congress to consider persist, with history providing insight into the matter. Before outlining some of the issues Congress may consider, scholars have debated the extent to which management practices in the public and private sectors can be compared. While similarities exist, key differences should be acknowledged. Public administration scholar Wallace Sayre famously stated that \"public and private management are fundamentally alike in all unimportant respects.\" Public administration scholar Wallace Sayre noted that public and private management are similar in unimportant respects. However, a significant difference lies in the laws governing government agencies and private companies. Government agencies operate under laws that regulate their coercive power, while private companies operate under laws that create and regulate a market economy. Government agencies operate under laws that regulate their coercive power, while private companies operate under laws that create and regulate a market economy. Private companies are primarily accountable to their owners or shareholders, while government agencies have restrictions on retaining earnings, allocating resources, and choosing goals. Government agencies must allocate factors of production according to administrators' preferences and serve goals not of their choosing. Control over revenues, factors, and agency goals lies with external entities like legislatures and interest groups. Managing the executive branch poses challenges in measuring agency performance and raises public policy issues. Congress must decide how much discretion to grant the executive branch. Several major themes emerge when examining general management laws, raising potential issues and policy options for Congress. The question of how much discretion to grant the executive branch is heavily debated, with arguments for flexibility in tailoring laws to specific circumstances and responsiveness to changing situations. Giving discretion can expedite regulatory processes and management actions, especially in technical areas where the executive branch may be better positioned. Granting discretion to the executive branch can expedite regulatory processes and management actions, especially in technical areas where the executive may be better positioned. However, this discretion can also lead to decisions that lack support from Congress and key stakeholders, potentially reducing transparency and political accountability. Congress faces a tension between flexibility and accountability when considering granting discretion to the executive branch. The tension between flexibility and accountability arises when Congress considers granting discretion to unelected agency officials. This tension was evident in decisions regarding the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense in 2002 and 2003, as well as in the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review in 1993. Scholars have identified four general options for Congress to address delegation situations and balance flexibility with accountability, including contract design to ensure the executive branch carries out Congress's intentions. Congress can address delegation situations by setting conditions for authority delegation, such as establishing goals, sanctions, probation periods, or sunsets. They can also use screening and selection mechanisms to ensure effective performance by the executive branch agency. Congress can increase accountability and transparency by requiring agencies to report their actions, milestones, and obtained information for a given activity or program. This can be done through monitoring and reporting requirements, utilizing information technology for real-time updates. However, some argue that excessive reporting can be burdensome and reports may not always be utilized effectively. The use of information technology and the Web can enable real-time and frequent reporting, but some argue that excessive reporting requirements can be burdensome. Congress can implement institutional checks to delegate authority to agencies, such as involving additional agencies in decision-making processes or requiring independent studies. The question arises whether management laws for agencies should be standardized or tailored to each agency's needs. The tension between standardization and customization in management laws for agencies is a frequent issue for Congress. Standardization can improve transparency and accountability in the executive branch, as seen in laws like the Administrative Procedure Act and the CFO Act of 1990. Congress must decide whether to have uniform rules for all agencies or agency-specific laws tailored to each agency's needs. Congress has introduced standardization in stages for financial management, requiring audited financial statements from executive departments and agencies. The Accountability of Tax Dollars Act extended these requirements to most executive agencies. Standardization promotes accountability by requiring agencies to justify exceptions, while customization aligns management with internal and external environments. The government balances standardization and customization in agency management, with Congress using statutes to direct actions and allowing customization in general management laws. Examples include exemptions for small agencies from audited financial statements and customization of HRM systems for DHS and DOD. This mixed approach aims to balance standardization with customization. The government balances standardization and customization in agency management through statutes, allowing flexibility within general management laws. The mixed approach aims to balance standardization with customization, as seen in the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. The government balances standardization and customization in agency management through statutes, allowing flexibility within general management laws. Alongside the advantages of standardization, customization can sometimes reduce transparency or accountability. Congress has policy options to avoid problems that may arise from mixed approaches, with decisions depending on various factors. Regular examination of increased customization or standardization is recommended to address different stakeholders' definitions of \"the problem\" to be solved. One option to improve transparency, accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness in general management law is to regularly assess the need for increased customization or standardization. Analytical support can be obtained from various sources such as agency management, program evaluations, and outside scholars. Another option is to reduce the analytical burden by requiring the executive branch to maintain real-time descriptions and comparisons across agencies, especially in areas with widespread customization like human resources laws. The current state of affairs involves maintaining updated comparisons across agencies, particularly in areas like pay, performance management, and adverse actions. Fragmentation of civil service laws may complicate monitoring and analysis. Reporting requirements in areas of customization could help reduce the analytical burden for Congress and the public. Central management agencies could report on customized management policies to facilitate government-wide analysis and comparisons. Central management agencies like OPM, GSA, and FMS could report on customized management policies to enable government-wide analysis and comparisons. Functional orientation in organizations can enhance efficiency through specialization but may hinder organization-wide coordination if too inward-looking. Functional orientation in organizations is important for boosting efficiency through specialization and centralized control over strategic decisions. However, if functions operate as silos in isolation, it can hinder organization-wide coordination and development of general managers. The management literature emphasizes the need for a broader, integrated general management perspective to avoid missed opportunities and problems for the organization as a whole. Developing a general management perspective is crucial in organizations to integrate various functional viewpoints and achieve a comprehensive understanding of problems or opportunities. This approach combines individual function perspectives with an overarching view, offering a range of solutions for executive management. An example could be utilizing information technology to enhance human resources and financial management. The integrated general management perspective combines individual function perspectives to address executive branch management problems. General management laws can be utilized together to provide mutual support, integrating through changes to laws, agency statutes, appropriations, and other legislative tools. For example, leveraging the E-Government Act of 2002 for more timely financial and performance reporting. Congress can integrate functional perspectives by leveraging existing laws such as the E-Government Act of 2002 to improve financial and performance reporting, directing appropriations for hiring contract oversight specialists, restructuring budget accounts for better resource alignment, and utilizing the Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002 for developing metrics. Integrating functional perspectives in federal government management reform can be achieved by leveraging existing laws like the E-Government Act of 2002 and the Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002. This involves aligning resources with results, developing metrics for assessing staff resources, and utilizing various functional perspectives such as information policy, strategic planning, and human resources management. The history of federal government management reform includes efforts to improve agencies' performance, organization, and management practices. Despite challenges, progress has been difficult to achieve. Congress faces challenges in overseeing executive branch management and measuring agencies' progress. Management literature emphasizes the importance of measurement as a motivator for action. Measurement systems can be a strong motivator for action, as emphasized by industrial psychologist Mason Haire. However, they can also create perverse incentives, such as focusing on short-term profits over long-term sustainability. The history of agency management problems in the federal government highlights the challenges in achieving effective oversight and progress. In the last 25 years, agency inspectors general (IGs) and the GAO have reported persistent major management problems in executive branch agencies in areas like financial management, acquisition, information technology investment, human resources, and strategic planning. GAO released reports detailing \"high risk\" areas and major management challenges, noting progress but also highlighting remaining work. Various management reform initiatives were pursued by presidential administrations during this period. Various management reform initiatives were pursued by presidential administrations, including President Ronald Reagan's Reform '88, President George H. W. Bush's efforts in financial and information management, and President William Clinton's NPR. Concerns about government management were expressed by Congress, with recommendations made to improve central management, procurement, information resources, financial management, and human resources. Senator Fred Thompson highlighted urgent federal government management problems during President George W. Bush's administration, including issues with the federal workforce, financial management, information technology, and duplication. President George W. Bush's Office of Management and Budget released the President's Management Agenda in August 2001. President George W. Bush's Office of Management and Budget released the President's Management Agenda in August 2001, addressing problems in the federal workforce, financial management, information technology, and overlap and duplication. The agenda includes five government-wide initiatives with quarterly evaluations by OMB using \"stoplight scores\" to assess agency progress. Green indicates meeting all standards, yellow for partial success, and red for serious flaws. Progress is evaluated based on deliverables and timelines for the initiatives. The Office of Management and Budget evaluates agency progress on the President's Management Agenda through \"stoplight scores\" - green for meeting all standards, yellow for partial success, and red for serious flaws. Progress is assessed based on deliverables and timelines for the initiatives, with green indicating implementation according to agreed plans, yellow showing slippage or issues requiring adjustment, and red signaling serious jeopardy. The five government-wide PMA initiatives are designed to be mutually reinforcing and leverage general management laws to achieve their goals. The President's Management Agenda (PMA) initiatives leverage general management laws to achieve their goals. Agencies are making significant progress, but there are observations about PMA measurement practices related to congressional oversight. Several observations can be made about PMA measurement practices related to congressional oversight. PMA evaluation practices lack transparency outside the executive branch, unlike OMB assessments using the Program Assessment Rating Tool. The stoplight scoring criteria may introduce subjectivity in evaluating initiatives. The PMA's evaluation criteria for initiatives lack transparency and may introduce subjectivity. Key requirements include acceptable IT business cases for the Expanded Electronic Government initiative and succession strategies for the Strategic Management of Human Capital initiative. Verification and validation assessments by independent organizations have not been conducted on agency stoplight scores. Some management issues like contract oversight and real property management are not explicitly addressed by the PMA. The PMA does not address key management issues like contract oversight and real property management. Various entities, including agency IGs, GAO, OMB, and Congress, have made efforts to improve agency management practices over the years. This includes creating \"high risk\" programs and issuing letter grades to evaluate agency performance in areas such as financial management and information security. Adam Putnam and Senator Fred Thompson have issued grades to evaluate agency compliance with information security and performance reports. Congress has options to ensure agencies improve management practices, including maintaining current oversight tools like GAO and agency IGs. Congress has options to ensure agencies improve management practices, including maintaining oversight tools like GAO and agency IGs, independent verification and validation, and transparency in accessing PMA stoplight worksheets. Congress has options to ensure agencies improve management practices, including transparency in accessing PMA stoplight worksheets, independent measurement by GAO or IGs, and amending GPRA to address major management problems. Congress has options to ensure agencies improve management practices by requiring them to address major management problems and high-risk areas in their strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual performance reports. This could involve establishing milestones and timelines for improvement and increasing agency management capacity. Additionally, Congress could mandate the President to address these issues in the government-wide performance plan. Another key theme is the creation of agency \"chief officer\" positions and interagency councils to oversee management functions. The creation of agency \"chief officer\" positions, such as inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers, has been established by statute. These chief officers oversee various functions within executive branch agencies and report to specific individuals. The creation of agency \"chief officer\" positions, such as inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers, has been established by statute. These officers have specific reporting relationships and appointment rules, with some requiring political appointments. The positions were created to address the lack of attention to functional perspectives in agency management. Many observers believed that senior managers in executive branch agencies did not focus enough on functional perspectives like financial management. To address this, functional perspectives were elevated within agencies by placing chief officers into interagency councils. These councils were established by law or executive order, with varying memberships, but the Office of Management and Budget's deputy director for management chairs or vice-chairs each council. The President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) was established by President Ronald Reagan through executive order in 1981. The PCIE aimed to coordinate government-wide activities to combat fraud and waste in government programs. It became a source of leverage for agency Inspectors General (IGs) to secure resources and enhance their independence. Standing committees were formed within the PCIE to facilitate idea-sharing and collaboration among IGs. The PCIE was endorsed for enhancing IGs' lobbying power and building informal networks for organizational learning. IGs found benefits in sharing ideas and cooperating on projects through standing committees. Despite criticism as a \"trade union\" for IGs, it provided a unique mechanism for collaboration. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush established two IG councils, the PCIE for presidentially appointed IGs and the ECIE for IGs. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush established two IG councils, the PCIE for presidentially appointed IGs and the ECIE for IGs typically appointed by agency heads. The CFO Council, created by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, gave the DDM chairperson status over the CFO Council and overall responsibility for establishing general management policies in the executive branch. The CFO Council was initially passive but became energized in 1994 with recommendations to broaden membership. The CFO Council, established by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, initially passive, became energized in 1994 with recommendations to broaden membership, elect officers, and set their agenda. OMB supported the recommendations, forming committees for special emphasis. The CFO Council served as a model for other interagency efforts, leading to the establishment of the CIO Council, CHCO Council, and CAO Council. The establishment of IGs, CFOs, and CIOs has met with little criticism and is generally supported by long-time observers. The establishment of three additional chief officer councils by Congress - the CIO Council in 2002, the CHCO Council in 2002, and the CAO Council in 2003 - has been generally successful in bringing focus to their functional perspectives. However, challenges such as high turnover among CIOs, difficulties with change management, and performance measurement persist. Some commentators argue that agencies still face management difficulties due to budget pressures and lack of attention from short-serving political appointees. Management scholars remain wary of functional silos within agencies. Public management scholars have noted persistent management difficulties in agencies due to budget pressures and lack of attention from short-serving political appointees. Functional silos within agencies are a concern, as they may hinder a more integrated general management perspective. Interagency councils of chief officers have been seen as beneficial, with increasing attention on the potential benefits of interagency collaboration. Testimony from a former OMB official highlighted the importance of councils in improving federal management by facilitating knowledge sharing and best practices. The Chief Human Capital Officers Council plays a crucial role in improving federal management by promoting knowledge sharing and best practices among different parts of the Federal Government. This approach is seen as valuable in enhancing organizational performance. Management theorists caution against solely focusing on one function, emphasizing the need for a broader perspective to avoid neglecting other functions or the agency as a whole. Scholars and practitioners suggest re-evaluating the structure and role of the Office of Management and Budget to address management challenges in the federal executive branch. Some scholars and practitioners suggest re-evaluating the structure and role of the Office of Management and Budget within the Executive Office of the President to improve federal executive branch management. Questions arise about the need for additional chief officers, the preservation of institutional memory, and the accountability of interagency councils to Congress. The importance of chief security officers in ensuring government services during emergencies is highlighted. The need for agency \"chief security officers\" (CSOs) is questioned in light of security risks for federal agencies. While some CSOs focus on information technology, others handle all security responsibilities. Establishing statutory CSO positions could lead to turf battles but may bring a more integrated approach to security and risk management. Many federal agencies may already have systems in place to address these issues. Establishing \"chief program evaluation officer\" (CPEO) positions in major agencies could address the lack of program evaluation efforts and integration across agency boundaries. Proponents argue that these positions would bring more attention to program evaluation and improve agency performance. Establishing chief program evaluation officer positions in major agencies could create a \"seat at the table\" for program evaluation in agency senior management teams. Critics argue that adding another chief officer position would be excessive. Congressional discussions have focused on the appointment process for chief officers, with debates on whether political or career officials should hold these positions. Witnesses had differing opinions on the proposed CHCO positions, with arguments for political appointees bringing functional perspective and career officials providing continuity. The CFO Act reflects these perspectives, with CFOs being political and deputies being career. Reporting relationships for CFOs and CIOs are mandated by law, while CHCOs and CAOs are at the agency head's discretion. The need for direct reporting relationships to agency heads is debated for ensuring access and addressing management problems effectively. The debate over direct reporting relationships to agency heads revolves around ensuring access and addressing management problems effectively. One argument is to provide the chief officer with personal access to senior leadership, but concerns exist about the potential for too large a span of control. Congress is considering whether to make IG councils statutory to improve training, strengthen relationships with Congress, and enhance coordination between IG offices. The vice chair of the PCIE believes codification would require modest appropriations but improve training, strengthen IG-Congress relationship, and enhance coordination between IG offices. Funding for interagency councils varies, with IG councils self-financing via MOUs and the CHCO Council funded by the Office of Personnel Management. Funding for interagency councils varies, with some funded through interagency transfer or reimbursement under Title VI general provisions in the Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill. Congress could maintain the status quo or consider making a separate appropriation for each council, potentially giving them more control and improving institutional memory and continuity. Congress could consider altering the reporting and strategic planning requirements for interagency councils to improve control and leverage. Some councils currently have no reporting or planning requirements, and Congress could require them to submit plans or reports to the President or Congress. Additionally, OMB could be required to submit an overall plan for leading the chief officer councils as part of the government-wide performance plan. Congress could consider requiring OMB to submit an overall plan for leading the interagency chief officer councils, as part of the government-wide performance plan. This could increase transparency and accountability to Congress, although it may limit the President's discretion and increase costs."
