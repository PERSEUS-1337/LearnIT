    "content": "The Act titled \"Coastal State Renewable Energy Promotion Act of 2008\" amends the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to include provisions for state surveys on ocean and coastal renewable energy, site identification, and planning. The Act allows the Secretary to provide grants to coastal States for surveys of coastal and Federal waters to identify areas suitable for renewable energy projects. Surveys must consider hydrographic data, oceanographic observations, marine ecosystems, and existing marine uses. The Act allows the Secretary to provide grants to coastal States for surveys of coastal and Federal waters to identify areas suitable for renewable energy projects, including sensitive marine ecosystems, existing marine uses, shore locations, and offshore infrastructure. Coastal States are required to facilitate participation from relevant stakeholders for comprehensive surveys. Guidelines must be established within 180 days after the enactment of this section. The Secretary can provide grants to coastal States for renewable energy surveys in coastal and Federal waters. Guidelines must be published within 180 days, and grants cannot exceed $750,000 per fiscal year. Matching fund contributions are not required before fiscal year 2011. The Secretary can provide grants to coastal States for renewable energy surveys in coastal and Federal waters. Matching fund contributions are required after fiscal year 2011, with a 2-to-1 ratio for fiscal year 2011 and a 1-to-1 ratio for fiscal year 2012. No matching funds are required for surveys of Federal waters adjacent to a State's coastal zone. Subsequent grants are contingent on satisfactory survey development, and no coastal State is eligible for grants for more than 3 fiscal years. The coastal State must develop surveys satisfactorily to receive grants under this section for a maximum of 3 fiscal years. Surveys do not grant new authority to coastal States or override existing Federal or State regulations on renewable energy facilities in the outer Continental Shelf. Areas suitable for renewable energy development will be prioritized for permitting, while unsuitable areas will not be considered. Assistance under this section prioritizes renewable energy facility siting, licensing, leasing, and permitting by Federal agencies. Surveys developed with assistance must be used to avoid unsuitable areas to the maximum extent practicable. The Secretary is authorized to provide technical assistance to coastal States for survey development. Renewable energy is defined as wind, wave, current, tidal, or ocean thermal energy. Authorization of appropriations under the Coastal Zone Management Act is amended. The Coastal Zone Management Act is amended to authorize appropriations for grants related to renewable energy, including wind, wave, current, tidal, or ocean thermal energy."
