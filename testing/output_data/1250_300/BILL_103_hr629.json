    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Improvement of Information Access Act of 1993\". The Congress finds that a well-informed citizenry is essential for democracy, access to Government information is crucial for accountability, and citizens should have timely and affordable access to such information. Federal agencies should utilize modern technology for the benefit of the public, and government information is a national resource that belongs to the public. Taxpayers should not have to pay excessive fees for accessing government information, and it should be easy for citizens to provide feedback on federal information policies. Federal agencies make it difficult for citizens to provide feedback on information policies and are slow in developing standards for easier access to government information. Many agencies also do not provide timely access to information at reasonable costs. SEC. 3. IMPROVED PUBLIC ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT INFORMATION. Title 44, United States Code, amended by adding new chapter: \"CHAPTER 41--INFORMATION DISSEMINATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES.\" Each executive department, military department, and independent establishment must annually prepare and provide a report to the public detailing their information dissemination policies and practices, including plans for new information products, efforts to develop standards for easier information access, and progress in creating comprehensive indexes and bibliographies. Each year, executive departments, military departments, and independent establishments must publish a report detailing their information dissemination policies, including creating comprehensive indexes, methods for accessing information, protecting access to outdated records, promoting information resources, and summarizing public comments and responses. The department, military department, and independent establishment must publish a notice in the Federal Register and other channels informing the public about the availability of a report on their information dissemination policies. The public is given a 90-day period to submit comments on various aspects, such as the types of information collected, methods of dissemination, pricing, and the quality of the information provided. The agency must provide a 120-day period for public comments before discontinuing an information product or service. This allows for dialogue between agency officials and the public on proposed and existing policies for disseminating information. Each agency must provide a 120-day notice for public comments before discontinuing an information product or service. The agency must disseminate information in diverse modes, ensure timeliness, usefulness, and reliability, store and disseminate information in standardized formats, and use distribution channels that improve public access to government information. The agency must provide public access to government information through depository libraries and national computer networks without charging excessive fees. The Archivist of the United States and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish model performance standards for agencies. The Archivist of the United States and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will issue model performance standards for agencies to provide access to public records, including a timeframe for agencies to provide copies of public documents upon request. The Archivist of the United States and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will issue model performance standards for providing access to agency records under section 4101(f) of title 44, United States Code within one year of the enactment of this Act."
