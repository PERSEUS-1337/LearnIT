    "content": "The Act titled \"Hydrographic Services Improvement Act Amendments of 2007\" redesignates sections 302 through 306 as sections 303 through 307 and adds a new section 302 with findings and purposes. The Congress finds the importance of maintaining federal expertise in hydrographic data and services to support safe marine transportation. This includes conducting surveys, providing nautical charts, and offering various services related to hydrography, geodesy, cartography, mapping, tides, currents, and water level observations. The need to maintain federal expertise in hydrographic data and services is crucial for supporting safe marine transportation, international trade, and interstate commerce. The marine transportation system is expected to become more congested with a doubling of international maritime commerce in the next 20 years, with a significant portion of cargo being hazardous substances. Hydrographic data also supports national needs such as emergency response, homeland security, marine resource conservation, and coastal resiliency. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plays a key role in establishing national standards for hydrographic data and services, with the Director of the Office of Coast Survey serving as the U.S. National Hydrographer. This expertise is crucial for supporting safe marine transportation, international trade, and national needs such as emergency response and coastal resiliency. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, through the Office of Coast Survey, plays a crucial role in providing hydrographic expertise and data for establishing marine territorial limits and jurisdiction. The Act aims to enhance NOAA's capabilities, improve hydrographic data accuracy, and promote the use of new technologies for increased efficiency and safety. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, through the Office of Coast Survey, aims to provide accurate hydrographic data and services to support international trade, interstate commerce, homeland security, emergency response, and ecosystem management. This includes hydrographic surveys, electronic navigational charts, real-time tide information, shoreline surveys, geodesy data, and more. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, through the Office of Coast Survey, aims to provide accurate hydrographic data and services to support international trade, interstate commerce, homeland security, emergency response, and ecosystem management. This includes promoting improved integrated ocean and coastal mapping, research and development in hydrographic data and services, and providing national and international leadership for hydrographic and related services, sciences, and technologies. SEC. 4. CHANGES IN DEFINITIONS. Section 303 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 (33 U.S.C. 892) is amended to define hydrographic data and outline the management, maintenance, and dissemination of various types of information for providing hydrographic services. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to define hydrographic data and outline the management, maintenance, and dissemination of various types of information for providing hydrographic services, including charts and nautical databases. The Coast and Geodetic Survey Act is also amended to clarify its functions and duties. SEC. 5. CHANGES IN FUNCTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR. Section 304 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to fulfill data gathering and dissemination duties under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, promote safe marine transportation, and fulfill the purposes of the Act. The Administrator under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act may procure, operate vessels and equipment for safe navigation, design hydrographic monitoring systems, acquire data to support conservation efforts, and provide hydrographic services. The Administrator under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act may acquire hydrographic data and provide services for conservation, safety, and emergency response, including supporting commerce and homeland security needs. They have the authority to create joint centers, enter contracts, and award contracts for data acquisition. Changes are made to the quality assurance program and the hydrographic services review panel under the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998. Amendments are made to Section 306 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998, including changes to the composition of the panel and qualifications of voting members. Amendments to Section 306 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 include changes to the composition of the panel and reimbursement of expenses for voting members. Section 307 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to authorize appropriations of $168,771,000 in fiscal year 2008 and such sums as necessary for fiscal years 2009 through 2012 for carrying out the Act."
