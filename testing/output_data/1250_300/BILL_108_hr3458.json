    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Diabetic Retinopathy Prevention Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that type 2 diabetes affects millions of Americans, leading to diabetic retinopathy which can cause blindness. Early detection and treatment can reduce vision loss by 90 percent. Remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy can reach diabetic patients in rural areas lacking access to in-office eye examinations, reducing vision loss by 90%. Medicare coverage of remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy is added to the Social Security Act, allowing for remote assessments to reach diabetic patients in rural areas without access to in-office eye examinations. The Social Security Act now includes Medicare coverage for remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, enabling annual diagnostic examinations of the retina for early detection in diabetic patients, meeting technical standards set by the Secretary and provided via a telecommunications system by qualified healthcare professionals. Payment is allowed regardless of the provider's location. The amendments to the Social Security Act allow for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy using store-and-forward technologies, enabling asynchronous transmission of health information in various formats. Interim payment will be provided until a final regulation is published, with temporary HCPCS codes assigned for payment purposes. The Secretary will provide payment for retinopathy assessments under the Social Security Act and conduct a study on costs for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy services. Recommendations on reimbursement adequacy will be submitted to Congress within 2 years. The amendments made by subsection (a) regarding diabetic retinopathy assessments under Medicare will apply 30 days after the enactment of the Act. The study on the need for repeating assessments and their frequency is also considered. Medicaid will cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy. Medicaid will cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, with amendments to the Social Security Act specifying the effective date and state compliance requirements. The effective date for Medicaid coverage of remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy is the first day of the first calendar quarter after the State legislature's regular session following the enactment of the Act. If a State has a 2-year legislative session, each year is considered a separate regular session. SEC. 5. MOBILE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY SCREENING PILOT PROGRAM. Amends Title III of the Public Health Service Act to establish a pilot program for mobile diabetic retinopathy screening. The Secretary will establish a grant program called the \"Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program\" to provide grants to 5 eligible entities for setting up mobile diabetic retinopathy screening programs. Grants cannot exceed $1,000,000 per year, and entities must agree to use the funds for designing, demonstrating, and implementing the screening program. The Secretary will solicit applications for grants within 90 days of funds becoming available. The Secretary will prioritize grant applicants with experience in diabetic retinopathy evaluation using telecommunications equipment and serving rural, impoverished, minority, and remote populations. Grants will not be awarded without Congressional notification at least 3 days prior. The Secretary will evaluate the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program three years after the first grant is awarded to determine its effectiveness in early detection and prevention of diabetic retinopathy. The Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program aims to assess the program's impact on reducing diabetic retinopathy prevalence and severity. It will also evaluate if the program can be a model for detecting complications related to diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. An advisory committee will report the findings to Congress within 42 months of the first grant. Eligible entities include hospitals as defined in the Social Security Act. The Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program aims to assess the impact on reducing diabetic retinopathy prevalence and severity, serving rural and underserved areas. Eligible entities include hospitals and various healthcare organizations. The program offers remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy and will be evaluated by an advisory committee. The Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program is aimed at reducing diabetic retinopathy prevalence and severity in rural, underserved, and remote areas. The Program is mobile and has an authorization of $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2005 to 2009."
