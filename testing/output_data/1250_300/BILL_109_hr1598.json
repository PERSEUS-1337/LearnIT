    "content": "The \"Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 2005\" improves veterans' benefits for former prisoners of war. The \"Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 2005\" enhances benefits for former prisoners of war by repealing the minimum period of internment for presumption of service connection for certain diseases and adding additional diseases presumed to be service connected. The \"Prisoner of War Benefits Act of 2005\" adds heart disease, stroke, diabetes (type 2), and osteoporosis to the list of diseases presumed to be service-connected for former prisoners of war. The Act also grants the Secretary of Veterans Affairs the authority to determine additional diseases warranting a presumption of service connection based on the experience of being a prisoner of war. The Secretary can establish a presumption of service-connection for diseases associated with being a prisoner of war based on sound medical evidence and recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Former Prisoners of War. The evaluation includes considering statistical significance, replicability, and peer review of studies. The Secretary evaluates studies for service connection presumption based on statistical significance, replicability, and peer review. An association between a disease and being a prisoner of war is considered positive if credible evidence outweighs against it. The Secretary must determine if a presumption is warranted within 60 days of receiving a recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Former Prisoners of War. If warranted, proposed regulations are issued within 60 days. The Secretary must issue proposed regulations within 60 days if a presumption of service connection is warranted. If not warranted, a notice must be published in the Federal Register with an explanation. Final regulations must be issued within 90 days of proposing regulations. If a disease is removed from regulations, veterans awarded compensation for it are affected. The Secretary must issue final regulations within 90 days of proposing them. If a disease is removed from regulations, veterans awarded compensation for it will still receive benefits. The Secretary must consult with the Advisory Committee on Former Prisoners of War when carrying out this subsection."
