In response to the 1970s energy crisis, Congress promoted distributed generation, including customer-sited generation like net metering. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 encouraged states to adopt net metering to offset energy provided by utilities with on-site generation. State net metering policies are relevant to discussions on renewable energy sources like solar in the nation's electricity system. Solar photovoltaic is the most commonly deployed energy type. State net metering policies are important for discussions on renewable energy sources like solar in the nation's electricity system. Solar photovoltaic is the most commonly used energy type in net metering, comprising 97% of capacity in 2018. Federal and state policies, such as tax incentives and renewable portfolio standards, interact with net metering policies to determine the pace of solar energy deployment. Some states have modified their net metering policies recently, with effects on stakeholders. Congress could choose to restrict, encourage, or require state policy modifications related to net metering. This report provides background information and discusses current issues on net metering policy. Net metering policies determine how electricity customers with distributed generation are compensated for electricity they deliver to the grid. Net metering typically involves a one-to-one compensation for electricity generated and consumed by the customer. Different policy options include buy-all, sell-all, where the utility buys electricity at a lower rate and sells it back at the retail rate. As of April 2019, 45 states had net metering policies in place that require utilities to offer net metering to customers, with some policies predating EPACT05. Almost 2 million customers participated in net metering programs in the United States in 2018. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), almost 2 million customers participated in net metering programs in the United States in 2018, representing about 1% of all electricity customers. The number of net metering customers has been increasing since 2013, with variations in participation levels by state. Hawaii has the highest participation rate, with over 15% of customers involved in net metering. Levels of net metering participation vary by state, with Hawaii having the highest rate at over 15% of customers. Factors influencing participation include state policies, electricity prices, and solar resource quality. Electricity ratemaking allocates costs to customers, with complexities and local factors influencing the process. Ratemaking for vertically-integrated investor-owned utilities involves state regulators approving rates to cover costs like power plant operations, grid maintenance, utility services, and public policy implementation. The process of setting rates for utilities involves covering costs like grid operation, meter data collection, bill relief, and a return on investments. Volumetric rates are commonly used, where customers pay a rate per kilowatt-hour based on their electricity usage. Regulators estimate rates to ensure the utility recovers its total costs, shared among all customers. Customer service costs may be separate from the electricity rate and recovered through a fixed customer charge. Costs associated with customer service are sometimes separated from the electricity rate and recovered through a fixed customer charge. This charge appears as a fixed value on the customer's bill and does not change monthly. Customer charges are in addition to volumetric rates. Some high-consuming customers may also incur demand charges for special system modifications. States with net metering have varied approaches in compensating customers, impacting distributed generation. States with net metering have different approaches in compensating customers, which can impact distributed generation markets. A common method is compensating customers at the utility's retail rate of electricity, known as net energy metering (NEM). Initially, policymakers viewed the retail rate as a suitable proxy for rate setting, especially when solar PV and other distributed generation markets were not economically viable. Initially, NEM was seen as a simple approach for compensating customers in the early stages of distributed generation markets. Retail rates were considered a close proxy for the value of solar or DG, providing high compensation for net metering generation. Retail rates encourage participation due to the ability to recover upfront costs. The retail rate reflects the total costs incurred by the utility for delivering electricity, including generating electricity and maintaining the grid. Net metering customers can recover upfront costs of a DG system more quickly with retail rates, potentially leading to increased costs for non-net metering customers due to a cost shift or cross-subsidy. This arises from the allocation of total utility costs among all customers, where self-generation reduces the need for utility-provided electricity but not necessarily other services like grid maintenance. Some stakeholders have raised concerns about potential equity issues with residential net metering customers, who tend to have higher incomes than non-net metering customers. Studies have conflicting views on the extent of cross-subsidies between net metering and non-net metering customers, with methodological differences playing a role in the lack of consensus. Local factors like distributed generation penetration and electricity demand growth can also impact observed cross-subsidies over time. One synthesis of estimates conducted around 2015 found that net metering cost shifts range from $444 to $1,752 per customer per year. Observers may disagree on the threshold for policy action regarding cross-subsidies. A 2017 study assessed various factors affecting electricity rates, with distributed generation likely causing increases between 0.03 cents/kWh and 0.2 cents/kWh, compared to other factors causing increases up to 3.6 cents/kWh. The study found that distributed generation (DG) could lead to rate increases between 0.03 cents/kWh and 0.2 cents/kWh, compared to other factors causing increases up to 3.6 cents/kWh. Cost shifts from net metering are not unique to DG and regulators aim to mitigate these effects through precise rate design. Some states are moving towards more accurate allocation of system costs and benefits for net metering customers. Some states are considering adding fixed charges or changing compensation rates for net metering customers to address concerns about cost shifting. Utilities and advocates for low-income customers support adding fixed charges to recover grid maintenance costs and increase fairness, while opponents, including the solar industry, are against these changes. Proponents of adding fixed charges argue it reduces cost shifting and increases fairness, supported by utilities and some advocates for low-income customers. Opponents, including the solar industry and environmental advocates, believe net metering promotes competition and societal benefits. Determining accurate fixed charges for net metering customers has been complex and controversial. Some states have adopted an avoided cost rate to represent energy costs utilities avoid when customers supply their own energy. An avoided cost rate, also known as an energy rate or wholesale rate, primarily reflects the costs of producing energy. It may be estimated by a regulator or through referral to wholesale electricity markets and is usually lower than retail rates. Net metering customers with solar PV may be compensated based on a value of solar rate, which includes societal benefits like reduced air emissions. Solar advocates support the inclusion of societal benefits in compensation rates. The value of solar (VOS) rate reflects societal benefits of distributed solar PV, such as reduced air emissions. Solar advocates prefer including societal benefits in compensation rates. VOS is typically higher than avoided cost rates but lower than retail rates. New York is one state implementing a related compensation rate for distributed energy resources (DERs) to reflect grid and societal benefits. The debate around alternative compensation approaches for distributed generation (DG) centers on which costs and benefits to consider, and how to quantify them. States vary in their evaluation of net metering, with different assumptions leading to varying results in studies. State net metering policies also differ in aspects like program caps and source eligibility. State net metering policies vary in aspects such as program caps, source eligibility, credit retention, and system ownership, which can impact the deployment of distributed generation (DG). Program caps set limits on the number of participants or generation capacity, affecting the promotion of DG. These caps can mitigate risks to the electricity system but may also hinder achieving other policy goals. State net metering policies vary in aspects such as program caps, source eligibility, and technology type. Solar energy is the dominant source for net metering, but other energy types may participate based on cost and customer factors. Customers may have periods of excess generation or consumption. Net metering customers, including industrial customers and farms, can deliver surplus generation to the grid and receive compensation based on state policies. Credits for excess generation can carry over to the next billing period, potentially reducing electricity costs to $0. Different provisions exist for credit retention, with some states allowing for alternative arrangements beyond single-generator setups. Aggregate net metering can apply to single customers. Net metering customers can have a single generator behind one electricity meter, like a rooftop solar installation. Other arrangements are possible, such as aggregate net metering for customers with multiple meters, and shared net metering for multiple customers with the same generation capacity. Virtual net metering is a version of shared net metering for onsite projects. Some states allow third party participation, where the solar system is owned by a different entity. Legislation has been introduced by some Members of Congress to address state net metering policies. Some Members of Congress have introduced legislation to address states' net metering policies, including limiting state regulators' ability to change compensation rates or add fixed charges. Other proposals require studies on the costs and benefits of net metering, such as a DOE report requested by Congress. Legislation in the 116th Congress aims to study various aspects of net metering through the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The DOE transmitted a report to Congress in 2019 on net metering and distributed solar generation. Legislation in the 116th Congress, S. 346 and H.R. 1009, would require a study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine on alternative incentives for distributed generation, net metering planning techniques, and consumer incentives."
