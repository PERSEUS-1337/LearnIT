    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Berta Caceres Human Rights in Honduras Act\". Congress finds that the Honduran police are corrupt and commit human rights abuses with impunity, including torture, rape, illegal detention, and murder. The New York Times revealed documents showing top officials ordered the killings of drug-crime investigators, and individuals with records of human rights abuses are appointed to high positions. International human rights bodies have reported similar abuses by the Honduran military and police. The Honduran police are reported to commit human rights abuses with impunity, including killings. Efforts to clean up the police have largely failed, with minimal progress made despite separating some officers. Impunity remains a serious problem, with slow prosecution of officials charged with human rights violations. Rights Action documented the involvement of the Fifteenth Battalion of the Honduran Armed Forces in killings of small-farmer activists in the Aguan Valley. Human Rights Watch confirmed the lack of consequences for these killings, with only one private actor convicted so far. Assassinations of activists continue, with the president of the Unified Campesino Movement being killed in 2016. Aguan farmers faced no consequences, with only one private actor convicted. Key activists, including the president of MUCA, were assassinated. Human rights abuses by the military include killings of activists like Tomas Garcia and Amado Maradiaga Quiroz. The Honduran Navy killed two Garifuna men in 2015, with the case remaining unresolved. The Honduran Navy reportedly killed two Garifuna Afro-Indigenous men while they were digging a car out of the sand on a beach. The case remains unresolved over a year later. The government has expanded the military's role in domestic policing, leading to human rights abuses and killings of unarmed individuals. The judicial system in Honduras is known for its corruption. In 2016, two new battalions of the Military Police were created in Honduras. The judicial system in the country is plagued with corruption, with officials linked to organized crime and drug traffickers, leading to widespread impunity. Efforts to reform the institutions responsible for public security have been ineffective, with rampant crime and human rights abuses remaining the norm. The assassination of environmental activist Berta Caceres in 2016 further highlights the challenges faced in Honduras. The assassination of environmental activist Berta Caceres in Honduras in 2016 illustrates the human rights crisis in the country, with government complicity. Eight suspects, including military ties, have been arrested in connection with her killing as of February 2017. As of February 2017, eight suspects linked to the Honduran military have been arrested in the killing of Berta Caceres. Questions arise about the military's involvement and the true masterminds behind the assassination. The Honduran government hinders access to the case file for Caceres' family and refuses an independent investigation by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights despite international calls for transparency. The Honduran government has not allowed an independent investigation by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights into the killing of Berta Caceres. Various activists and critics of the government are at risk of human rights abuses, with past abuses largely going unpunished. The shooting of journalist Felix Molina in 2016 highlighted the ongoing danger faced by activists. Significant funding was allocated to the Honduran police and military in 2016. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 allocated $18,000,000 to the Honduran police and military, with additional funding authorized in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. The Administration's funding request for fiscal year 2017 also includes an increase in security funding for Honduras. The Inter-American Development Bank lent $59,800,000 to the Honduran police in 2012 with U.S. approval. SEC. 3. Suspension of security assistance to Honduras' police and military, including funds for equipment and training. The Secretary of the Treasury to vote against any loans for Honduran police or military at multilateral development banks. SEC. 4 outlines conditions for lifting suspensions and restrictions. The Act will end when the Secretary of State certifies that Honduras has pursued legal action for various murders, prosecuted human rights violators in the military and police, and withdrawn the military from domestic policing. Honduras must ensure that human rights violations have ceased, withdraw the military from domestic policing, protect the rights of various groups, and establish a judicial system capable of prosecuting members of the police and military who commit abuses."
