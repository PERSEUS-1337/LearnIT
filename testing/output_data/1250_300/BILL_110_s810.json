There is consensus in the scientific community that hands-on laboratory experience is essential for learning science. However, the quality of laboratory experiences in high schools is currently poor, hindering research on how to improve them. The National Research Council and Government Accountability Office found that schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students lack adequate laboratory facilities. 40% of college students who left science fields cited problems with high school science preparation, including lack of laboratory experience. It is in the national interest for the Federal Government to invest in research to improve teaching of laboratory science in high schools. The Federal Government should invest in a grant program to improve teaching of laboratory science in high schools. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to establish a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to enhance laboratories in high schools. The 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' program awards grants to partnerships to improve laboratories and provide instrumentation for enhancing math, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level. Grants can be used for equipment, maintenance, teacher training, and integrating laboratory experiences with classroom instruction. The 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' program awards grants for improving laboratories, providing instrumentation, teacher training, integrating laboratory experiences with classroom instruction, and promoting interest in math, science, engineering, and technology among underrepresented individuals. The Opportunities Act aims to support individuals in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology fields for postsecondary studies through partnerships involving higher education institutions, local educational agencies, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The Opportunities Act supports individuals in STEM fields through partnerships with educational agencies, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The Federal share of grant activities cannot exceed 50 percent. The National Science Foundation will evaluate pilot projects funded by the grant program to improve student performance in STEM fields. A report on the evaluation will be submitted to relevant Senate and House committees within 5 years. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2008, with additional funding for the following years."
