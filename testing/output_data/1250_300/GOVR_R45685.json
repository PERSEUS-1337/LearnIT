    "content": "Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides legal relief for victims of sexual abuse and harassment at educational institutions, prohibiting discrimination based on sex in programs receiving federal funding. Schools can be held liable for damages for a deliberately indifferent response to such incidents, including teacher-student and student-on-student harassment. Enforcement of Title IX can occur through private rights of action or administrative agencies like the Department of Education. Title IX enforces antidiscrimination mandates for schools receiving federal funding, covering all levels of education. Compliance is required for participation in federal student aid programs, with liability for sexual harassment instances. The text of Title IX does not explicitly mention sexual abuse or harassment, but the Department of Education has issued guidance on schools' responsibilities in addressing allegations of sexual harassment. Educational institutions have developed procedures to investigate and respond to such allegations, with recent proposed regulations that could change their responsibilities significantly. The proposed Title IX regulations would change educational institutions' responses to sexual harassment allegations. The report provides background on legal interpretations of Title IX, including court cases and agency enforcement. It also discusses constitutional challenges and examines how the proposed regulations would impact schools' compliance with Title IX. The report examines ED's proposed regulations regarding Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs receiving federal funding. However, the statute does not explicitly address private right of action for victims or define sexual harassment as unlawful discrimination. Federal courts have played a key role in interpreting Title IX due to the lack of statutory guidance. Title IX does not define unlawful sexual abuse or harassment, leaving federal courts to establish the remedial scheme for victims seeking relief through a private right of action. The Supreme Court has interpreted Title IX to allow for a private right of action against federally-funded educational institutions for sexual harassment, and has set a high bar for establishing liability under Title IX for sexual abuse or harassment. The judicially created liability standard under Title IX requires a recipient's response to sexual harassment or abuse to not be deliberately indifferent for liability. The private right of action for victims is implied by the Court, providing a legal remedy for sex abuse or harassment cases. The private right of action under Title IX implies a legal remedy for victims of sex discrimination, with liability based on an institution's \"deliberate indifference\" to sexual harassment or abuse. This contrasts with administrative enforcement focusing on institutional policies. Two Supreme Court decisions outline the requirements for an educational funding recipient's liability for damages in such cases. The Supreme Court's decision in Gebser established that educational institutions can be held liable under Title IX for damages in cases of sexual harassment or abuse only if they show deliberate indifference to known misconduct, not for the misconduct itself. Liability is based on the institution's failure to adequately respond to discrimination, rather than the severity of the conduct. This standard was created to reflect how Congress would have addressed the issue. The Supreme Court's decision in Gebser established that educational institutions can be held liable under Title IX for damages in cases of sexual harassment or abuse only if they show deliberate indifference to known misconduct. The Court relied on the statute's administrative enforcement provision to infer legislative intent regarding Title IX liability. This provision allows agencies to suspend or cut funds to a funding recipient for violating Title IX only after advising them of the failure to comply and determining that compliance cannot be secured voluntarily. The Supreme Court's decision in Gebser established that educational institutions can be held liable under Title IX for damages in cases of sexual harassment or abuse only if they show deliberate indifference to known misconduct. The Court reasoned that compliance cannot be secured voluntarily, requiring \"actual notice\" to an \"appropriate person\" to establish liability for damages. Liability under Title IX is determined by a school official's response to the notice, with deliberate indifference being a key factor. This standard is similar to the one found in case law under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The Court emphasized that until Congress directly addresses the issue, school districts will not be held liable. The Supreme Court's decision in Gebser established that educational institutions can be held liable under Title IX for damages in cases of sexual harassment or abuse only if they show deliberate indifference to known misconduct. Compliance cannot be secured voluntarily, requiring \"actual notice\" to an \"appropriate person\" to establish liability for damages. The \"deliberate indifference\" standard does not require funding recipients to \"remedy\" the harassment, but a recipient's response must be clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. The Gebser decision established that funding recipients can be held liable under Title IX for damages in cases of sexual harassment or abuse only if they show deliberate indifference to known misconduct. To prevail in a Title IX suit for damages, a plaintiff must establish \"actual knowledge of discrimination\" by an appropriate person at the funding recipient before proving deliberate indifference. Failure to show this may result in dismissal of the claim. The Gebser decision requires funding recipients to have \"actual knowledge of discrimination\" by an appropriate person before being held liable for damages under Title IX for sexual harassment or abuse. Failure to show this may lead to dismissal of the claim. The liability standard also requires a plaintiff to prove \"deliberate indifference,\" substantial control over the harasser, severe and pervasive harassment, and denial of educational access. Substantive splits exist on what constitutes \"actual\" notice and who qualifies as an \"appropriate person.\" The Davis decision limits a school's liability for damages under Title IX to circumstances where the funding recipient had \"substantial control\" over the harasser and the harassment occurred in a context subject to the recipient's control. The recipient may be liable for deliberate indifference to harassment if the harasser is under the school's disciplinary authority. The harassment must be severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, resulting in denial of educational access. The conduct must effectively deny equal access to resources and opportunities. The plaintiff must show that the conduct is severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, undermining the victims' educational experience and denying equal access to resources. The Court in Davis emphasized the importance of surrounding circumstances and relationships in determining the severity of harassment. Additionally, evidence of a decline in grades can indicate a link between education and harassment, but harassment must be serious enough to have a systemic effect on denying equal access to education. The Supreme Court's Gebser and Davis decisions establish that a school will be liable under Title IX for damages for sexual abuse or harassment only if it acted with \"deliberate indifference.\" Lower federal courts have varied in their formulations of the evidence required to prove a Title IX claim, with some adopting a \"hostile environment\" analysis for teacher-to-student harassment claims. Some courts interpret Gebser and Davis to use a \"hostile environment\" analysis for Title IX claims of teacher-to-student harassment, while others focus on elements like \"actual\" notice of discrimination and \"deliberate indifference\" by the funding recipient. For student-to-student harassment claims, additional requirements include proving the severity of the harassment, denial of equal access to resources, and the recipient's control over the harasser. Federal courts of appeals vary in their interpretations and requirements for evidence in Title IX cases. Federal courts of appeals vary in their interpretations and requirements for evidence in Title IX cases, particularly regarding the elements needed to prove a claim. One key element is showing that the funding recipient had \"actual\" notice of the discrimination, which requires more than just knowledge of potential misconduct. The type of allegations reported to a school that constitute \"actual\" notice is a point of contention, with questions about whether knowledge of a substantial risk of abuse or specific allegations of harassment are sufficient. Additionally, previous acts of sexual harassment or abuse by a perpetrator may also constitute actual notice of their conduct to others. Federal courts differ on the question of actual notice in Title IX cases, particularly regarding evidence needed to prove a claim. In Doe v. School Board of Broward County, the Eleventh Circuit ruled that complaints from two students about the same teacher were sufficient to alert the principal to the possibility of sexual assault. The reports detailed multiple instances of sexual propositions, touching, and comments. The court held that the principal had actual notice of a pattern of harassment involving a teacher's sexual misconduct towards students. In contrast, in Baynard v. Malone, the Fourth Circuit found that the principal did not have actual notice of a teacher's sexual abuse despite prior reports of molestation. The principal had met with a former student who reported being sexually molested by a teacher, another teacher also reported allegations of sexual misconduct. The school librarian witnessed inappropriate behavior between the teacher and a student. The court found that the principal should have been aware of potential abuse but dismissed the Title IX claim due to lack of evidence of actual notice of abuse. The court dismissed the Title IX claim due to lack of evidence of actual notice of abuse by the principal, despite indications that the principal should have been aware of potential abuse. The liability standard for Title IX requires actual notice to an appropriate person with authority to address the discrimination. Federal appellate case law focuses on whether the individual had the ability to address the misconduct or held a high enough position within the funding recipient's hierarchy. In cases involving Title IX liability, courts determine if an individual had the authority to address misconduct or held a high position within the funding recipient's hierarchy. The definition of \"appropriate person\" varies among federal courts, especially in the context of elementary or secondary schools. Some courts consider a principal as an \"appropriate person\" to address discrimination and institute corrective action. In Title IX cases, courts differ on who qualifies as an \"appropriate person\" to address misconduct. The Third Circuit considered a school principal as appropriate due to her authority to investigate teacher misconduct. However, the Fourth Circuit disagreed, stating that a principal lacked the authority to take corrective measures. The Fifth Circuit ruled that a principal engaging in sexual abuse cannot be considered an \"appropriate person.\" In Salazar v. South San Antonio Independent School District, the Fifth Circuit interpreted Gebser to hold that a school official who sexually abuses a student cannot be considered an \"appropriate person.\" The court reasoned that the official's actions would not lead to corrective measures or reporting of the abuse, thus not fulfilling the goals of Title IX. The Fifth Circuit ruled that in the context of Title IX liability, certain individuals may not be considered \"appropriate persons\" for a private right of action, even if they hold positions of authority within a university. This was exemplified in Ross v. University of Tulsa, where campus security officers were deemed not suitable for providing actual notice of on-campus sexual assault. In Ross v. University of Tulsa, the Tenth Circuit held that campus security officers were not considered \"appropriate persons\" for providing actual notice of on-campus sexual assault under Title IX liability. The court rejected the argument that mandatory reporting of sexual assaults or participation in investigations made them suitable, emphasizing the need for characteristics indicative of an \"appropriate person\" as determined by the court. In determining liability under Title IX, courts consider the characteristics of an \"appropriate person\" to receive notice of discrimination. After establishing actual notice, a plaintiff must prove deliberate indifference in the funding recipient's response, requiring more than mere negligence. The response must be clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances, with courts analyzing the recipient's knowledge and actions taken in response to determine liability. In determining liability under Title IX, courts analyze the recipient's knowledge and response to allegations of sexual harassment or abuse. Deliberate indifference is shown when the recipient fails to take appropriate action despite being aware of the situation, such as not investigating serious allegations or disciplining offenders. Federal case law sets a high bar for proving deliberate indifference, requiring more than mere negligence. Federal appellate courts have set a high bar for proving deliberate indifference in cases of sexual harassment or abuse under Title IX. In a specific case, despite evidence of a deficient response by a school district to allegations of sexual abuse by a teacher, the court ruled that it did not amount to deliberate indifference. The evidence included the principal dismissing the allegations, failing to report to authorities, and not taking further action until the teacher was arrested. The court ruled that evidence of a school's response to allegations of teacher sexual misconduct did not amount to deliberate indifference. Despite serious deficiencies in the school's actions, the court found that the principal's interview with the student, conversation with the student's mother, and warning to the teacher were not inadequate responses. In a similar case, the Eleventh Circuit found that a school's response was deliberately indifferent when the principal failed to take significant action after receiving multiple complaints about the same teacher. The principal's response to the second complaint of teacher sexual misconduct was deemed inadequate by the court, as he failed to take appropriate corrective measures despite being aware of a possible pattern. The court highlighted the failure to notify the investigative unit about the previous investigation involving the same teacher, indicating deliberate indifference towards addressing the issue. This lack of action could be seen as condoning the teacher's behavior, as some courts have noted in similar cases. In Simpson v. University of Colorado, Boulder, the Tenth Circuit addressed allegations of deliberate indifference by the university in failing to provide adequate training or guidance despite prior knowledge of sexual assaults involving football players and recruits. The court highlighted evidence of ongoing sexual assaults and a lack of action by the coaching staff, leading to the assault of plaintiffs during a football recruiting visit. The court emphasized evidence that the university coaching staff had prior knowledge of sexual assaults during football recruitment, including a rape two months before the plaintiffs were assaulted. The head coach resisted recruiting reforms, and players lacked guidance on appropriate behavior. Despite this knowledge, the university maintained an unsupervised player-host program. The court found evidence of deliberate indifference by the university regarding sexual assaults during recruiting visits, with no changes made to the program to prevent such incidents. Title IX enforcement includes private rights of action and federal agency oversight, with potential sanctions of termination or suspension of federal funds for violations. In the context of Title IX enforcement, federal agencies have the authority to issue regulations and orders to ensure compliance with the statute, with the ultimate sanction being the termination or suspension of federal funds for violators. The Secretary of Education and the Attorney General play significant roles in enforcing Title IX, with the former responsible for promulgating regulations against sex discrimination in educational programs receiving federal assistance, and the latter coordinating enforcement efforts. The Department of Education (ED) is a key enforcer of Title IX against educational institutions that receive federal assistance. The Attorney General coordinates enforcement efforts across the executive branch, with the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division and OCR collaborating in enforcing Title IX. ED has regulations that apply to all levels of educational institutions receiving federal assistance, prohibiting sex discrimination in any education program or activity. The Department of Education enforces Title IX regulations in educational institutions receiving federal assistance, prohibiting sex discrimination in all education programs. Institutions must designate a Title IX Coordinator and establish grievance procedures for complaints. OCR conducts reviews and investigations to ensure compliance, seeking informal resolution through resolution agreements for violations. The Office for Civil Rights enforces Title IX regulations in educational institutions, investigating allegations of violations. If informal resolution is not reached, formal enforcement measures may be taken, including funding suspension or termination. Title IX does not directly address sexual harassment, but OCR guidance documents interpret it to prohibit such behavior and outline institutions' responsibilities. ED's approach to assessing Title IX liability for harassment differs from Supreme Court case law on private rights of action for damages. ED applies a constructive notice requirement for schools to respond to allegations, rather than the \"actual notice\" standard in lawsuits for damages. The Office for Civil Rights enforces Title IX regulations in educational institutions, investigating allegations of violations. If informal resolution is not reached, formal enforcement measures may be taken, including funding suspension or termination. ED has applied a constructive notice requirement for schools to respond to allegations of sexual abuse or harassment under Title IX. In 1997, OCR released a guidance document stating that sexual harassment of students by school employees, other students, or third parties is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. The 1997 guidance on Title IX regulations defines two types of sexual harassment: quid pro quo harassment and hostile environment harassment. Quid pro quo harassment involves a school employee conditioning a student's participation in an education program on unwelcome sexual advances, while hostile environment harassment creates a pervasive hostile or abusive educational environment. Schools can be held liable for harassment by employees in positions of authority or with apparent authority. In cases of hostile environment harassment by employees, a school would be liable if the employee acted with apparent authority or was aided in carrying out the harassment due to his or her position. For sexual harassment by other students or third parties, a school would be liable if a hostile environment exists, the school knows or should have known of the harassment, and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. Title IX holds schools responsible for their own discrimination in failing to remedy harassment once they have notice. The Supreme Court established a different standard for liability in a private suit for damages directly against a school in cases of harassment committed by a teacher. The Supreme Court established a different standard for liability in a private suit for damages directly against a school in cases of harassment committed by a teacher. In Gebser, the Court ruled that a school district is liable only when it has actual knowledge of allegations by an \"appropriate person\" and responds with deliberate indifference. In Davis, it was further held that the conduct must be \"severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\" to deny the victim equal access to educational opportunities. The Court distinguished between actions that could result in Title IX liability for damages and administrative requirements imposed by federal agencies. The Supreme Court established a different standard for liability in private suits for damages directly against a school in cases of harassment committed by a teacher. Agencies have the authority to enforce requirements that effectuate Title IX's mandate, even if they do not define discrimination under the statute. Following these decisions, the Department of Education issued guidance documents reaffirming its position on Title IX responsibilities and liability standards for sexual harassment violations. The Department of Education has issued guidance documents outlining a school's responsibilities under Title IX for compliance with the statute and vicarious liability. The liability standard for Title IX sexual harassment violations differs between administrative enforcement and private damages actions. OCR's Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance reaffirms the agency's standards for enforcing Title IX regulations, applying to all educational institutions receiving federal funds. Schools must adopt grievance procedures to address sexual harassment allegations. The OCR's guidance on Title IX compliance applies to all educational institutions receiving federal funds. Schools must have grievance procedures for resolving sexual harassment complaints promptly and equitably. Prompt and effective action must be taken to end harassment, prevent recurrence, and remedy its effects. The guidance documents, issued by the Department of Education, inform the public about enforcement approaches but do not carry the force of law. The OCR's guidance on Title IX compliance for educational institutions receiving federal funds includes grievance procedures for resolving sexual harassment complaints promptly and equitably. The guidance documents inform the public about enforcement approaches but do not have the force of law. The 2001 Guidance defines sexual harassment as \"unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature\" and emphasizes the impact on a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the school's program based on sex. It outlines quid pro quo harassment and hostile environment harassment as types of harassment triggering a school's responsibilities under Title IX. The 1997 Guidance outlines two categories of harassment under Title IX: quid pro quo harassment and hostile environment harassment. Quid pro quo harassment involves a teacher or employee conditioning benefits on a student's submission to unwelcome sexual conduct, while hostile environment harassment requires an investigation into whether the conduct is serious enough to limit a student's participation in the school's program. Student-on-student harassment is typically considered hostile environment harassment. The 2001 Guidance emphasizes that all circumstances, including whether the conduct was welcome, are considered when evaluating hostile environment harassment. The 2001 Guidance explains that hostile environment harassment by teachers or employees in the scope of their job responsibilities must be addressed by the school, regardless of whether they have notice of the behavior. The school is responsible for stopping the behavior, preventing its recurrence, and remedying the effects of harassment on the victim. In cases of sexual harassment, a school must address and remedy the effects of harassment on the victim, regardless of whether they have notice of the behavior. The scope of an employee's job responsibilities can determine if harassment occurred within that context. The school is responsible for stopping and preventing harassment, even if it occurs outside of an employee's job responsibilities. In cases of student-on-student harassment creating a hostile environment, schools must take prompt and effective action to eliminate and prevent its recurrence. The school is responsible for ending the harassment, preventing its recurrence, and remedying its effects. Schools are also responsible for addressing harassment by teachers or employees, even without notice. Recipients are considered to have notice of a sexually hostile environment if a responsible school employee knew or should have known about the harassment. A responsible employee, with the authority to address harassment, must report any misconduct. Schools must act promptly upon knowing or should have known about a hostile environment. Immediate and effective corrective action is required to investigate and end harassment, prevent recurrence, and eliminate a hostile environment. Schools must promptly investigate reports of harassment by students, parents, or responsible employees, and take appropriate steps to resolve the situation. Informal mechanisms may be used to resolve complaints if agreed upon, but certain procedures like mediation are not suitable for cases like alleged sexual assault. Title IX rights must be interpreted consistently with federal guaranteed due process. The 2011 OCR Dear Colleague Letter supplemented the 2001 Guidance on Title IX obligations for schools regarding peer-to-peer harassment. It defined sexual harassment as unwelcome sexual conduct, including advances, requests, and violence. Schools must ensure due process rights do not delay Title IX protections for complainants. The 2011 OCR Dear Colleague Letter expands on Title IX obligations for schools regarding sexual harassment, including sexual violence and creating a hostile environment. Schools must take immediate action to address harassment, even if it occurs off-campus. Students filing complaints must have them processed according to school procedures. Schools should consider the effects of off-campus conduct when evaluating a hostile environment on campus. The 2011 OCR Dear Colleague Letter emphasizes that schools must consider off-campus conduct when evaluating a hostile environment on campus. It clarifies that a criminal investigation into sexual violence does not exempt a school from conducting a Title IX investigation. Schools are advised to not delay their own investigation until the conclusion of a criminal proceeding and to take immediate steps to protect students. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter emphasizes the importance of schools promptly conducting their own fact-finding for Title IX purposes after police investigations. It also highlights the need for schools to use a preponderance of the evidence standard in their grievance procedures for sexual harassment complaints, discouraging personal cross-examination during hearings. The 2014 Q&A provided more specific instructions to schools on handling student-on-student sexual violence allegations under Title IX, emphasizing the immediate investigation of possible incidents and clarifying violations of Title IX in such cases. The 2014 Q&A clarified that schools must promptly investigate allegations of sexual violence under Title IX, take effective steps to end the violence, and protect complainants. It also outlined the responsibilities of a school's Title IX Coordinator and the requirements for written grievance procedures. The 2014 Q&A outlined the responsibilities of a school's Title IX Coordinator, the elements expected in written grievance procedures for sexual violence complaints, and the requirements for conducting investigations. It emphasized the need for additional remedies beyond sanctions to eliminate hostile environments and prevent recurrence. The document also highlighted that Title IX investigations do not require the same procedural protections as criminal proceedings. In Title IX investigations, schools must conduct their own investigations of sexual violence, even if a criminal investigation is ongoing. Schools are not required to hold hearings but if they do, they cannot require the complainant to attend. The OCR discourages personal cross-examination and suggests using a trained third party to ask questions on behalf of the parties. Schools have developed various procedures to comply with ED guidance and OCR oversight between 2011 and 2016. In response to guidance from ED and increased OCR oversight between 2011 and 2016, schools developed procedures to ensure compliance with Title IX in investigating sexual assault allegations. The specific procedures for handling complaints vary among educational institutions, with ED having discretion to enforce Title IX but constrained by due process protections for state actors like public universities. Students facing disciplinary sanctions challenged the constitutionality of these procedures in state and federal courts. In the public university context, students challenged disciplinary procedures as unconstitutional, particularly in Title IX cases involving sexual misconduct. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to follow specific procedures when depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property. Protected property interests must show a legitimate claim of entitlement from an independent source like state or federal law. The Due Process Clause requires specific procedures for state actions that deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property. Protected property interests must show a legitimate claim of entitlement from an independent source like state or federal law. Courts balance factors to determine the process due, considering the private interest affected, the risk of erroneous deprivation, and the value of additional procedures. In determining what process is due, courts balance factors including the private interest affected, the risk of erroneous deprivation, and the government's interest. Individuals with a protected interest are entitled to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before deprivation. Due process is flexible and requires procedural protections as the situation demands. The severity of the deprivation is a key factor in determining required procedures, with stronger private interests necessitating more formal procedures. Goss v. is the only Supreme Court case focusing on procedural due process in student discipline. The Supreme Court case Goss v. Lopez established that students facing suspension must be given notice and a hearing. Public universities must comply with constitutional standards when disciplining students, while private universities are not required to do so. Public universities must comply with constitutional standards when suspending or expelling students, as they are considered state actors under the Due Process Clause. Federal courts have ruled that students in public universities have liberty and/or property interests in their education, and due process requires schools to provide notice, evidence, and a fair hearing. The procedures needed to satisfy due process may vary depending on the circumstances of each case. Public universities must adhere to constitutional standards when disciplining students, as they are considered state actors under the Due Process Clause. Recent judicial rulings have addressed challenges to disciplinary procedures in the context of sexual misconduct investigations. These challenges include claims that universities failed to provide adequate notice of charges, denied the accused student the right to confront and challenge witnesses, and other due process violations. Recent judicial rulings have addressed challenges to disciplinary procedures in public universities regarding sexual misconduct investigations. Claims include lack of notice of charges, denial of the right to confront witnesses, biased decision-makers, and unfair review processes. Some rulings focus on the sufficiency of a student's claim to survive a motion to dismiss, rather than conclusive determinations of due process violations. Students accused of sexual misconduct argue that universities failed to adequately notify them of charges, but courts generally find no violation if timely notice of charges and a chance to prepare for the hearing are provided. Recent judicial rulings have addressed challenges to disciplinary procedures in public universities regarding sexual misconduct investigations. Claims include lack of notice of charges, denial of the right to confront witnesses, biased decision-makers, and unfair review processes. Some rulings focus on the sufficiency of a student's claim to survive a motion to dismiss, rather than conclusive determinations of due process violations. In one case, a student alleged lack of notice of sexual misconduct charges, leading to a three-year suspension, which the court deemed a potential due process violation. Another case involved inadequate notice of the scope of charges, resulting in expulsion for misconduct related to other incidents. The accused student in another case claimed inadequate notice of the charges against him, leading to his expulsion for sexual misconduct related to incidents not initially mentioned. The court found that the limited scope of focus prejudiced his defense, depriving him of due process. Similarly, in a separate case, a student suspended for suspected sexual assault alleged a due process violation when the university did not provide the evidence used in its disciplinary decision. The Title IX investigator's report was not made available to the student, impacting the fairness of the adjudication process. The court ruled that a university violated due process by not providing a student with the evidence used in a disciplinary decision. Students have raised due process claims for lack of cross-examination opportunities in disciplinary hearings, with courts being more receptive when witness credibility is at stake. Courts have been more willing to entertain due process claims when students are denied the opportunity to challenge witness credibility in disciplinary hearings. Cross-examination is not always considered necessary for due process in civil cases. The Due Process Clause does not guarantee the right to cross-examination in school disciplinary proceedings. Recent cases have seen due process challenges in sexual harassment allegations, where students were not allowed to directly cross-examine witnesses. Despite this, courts have rejected due process challenges in some instances. The Sixth Circuit and Fifth Circuit rejected due process challenges in university disciplinary hearings where students were not allowed to directly cross-examine their accusers. Instead, students were permitted to submit written questions to a panel, but follow-up questions were not allowed. The courts reasoned that the limited cross-examination satisfied the requirements, as the burden on the school outweighed the marginal benefit of allowing follow-up questions. In university disciplinary proceedings, due process challenges have been raised when students were denied the ability to effectively cross-examine witnesses and confront their accuser. Courts have ruled in favor of due process challenges when credibility determinations were critical to the outcome. For example, the Sixth Circuit found a violation when a university based its decision solely on hearsay without allowing any form of cross-examination. The court emphasized the importance of providing some method for the adjudicative body to assess credibility. In university disciplinary proceedings, due process challenges have been raised when students were denied the ability to effectively cross-examine witnesses and confront their accuser. Courts have ruled in favor of due process challenges when credibility determinations were critical to the outcome. The court concluded that some method must be made available to the adjudicative body to \"assess the demeanor of both the accused and his accuser\" to comply with due process. Additionally, the absence of a live hearing may sometimes form the basis of a viable due process claim, as seen in a case where a university was ordered to provide an accused student with a live hearing to ensure due process. The court found that the university violated the accused student's right to due process by not allowing cross-examination in a case where credibility was crucial. The Sixth Circuit ruled that a live hearing and the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses are essential for a fair process in university disciplinary proceedings. The Sixth Circuit ruled that in university disciplinary proceedings, due process requires a live hearing and the opportunity to cross-examine accusers and adverse witnesses. Some students have claimed they were denied the chance to present exculpatory evidence, leading to concerns of bias in decision-making. The Sixth Circuit ruled that in university disciplinary proceedings, due process requires a live hearing and the opportunity to cross-examine accusers and adverse witnesses. Students challenging bias in decision-making must show evidence of actual bias, such as statements by decisionmakers or a pattern of biased decisionmaking. For example, a Fifth Circuit panel rejected a bias claim in a sexual assault case due to lack of evidence undermining the proceedings' integrity. The school investigated charges against the accused and provided evidence to the panel for a disciplinary decision. The court found that bias in decision-makers' behavior or statements could lead to a due process challenge. The Sixth Circuit ruled that a student's due process claim was valid when a panel member acted as investigator, prosecutor, and judge, showing bias in the proceedings. The court found that bias in decision-makers' behavior could lead to a due process challenge. A student alleged that a panel member dominated the proceedings and made prejudiced remarks, indicating lack of impartiality. Courts have addressed claims of bias based on institutional pressures, such as unbalanced sexual assault training for university officials. The university aims to raise awareness of sexual assault and increase sensitivity to victims' experiences. Plaintiffs' unsupported belief that the school unfairly treated accused students to maintain federal funding was dismissed. However, a court found a due process violation in a case where biased training materials may have influenced the decision against an expelled student. Several federal court cases have addressed due process violations in university disciplinary proceedings. The court found due process violations in university disciplinary proceedings, including cases where biased training materials influenced decisions against students. In one case, a student was cleared of sexual assault but faced a new hearing without adequate evidence. In another case, a student was initially found not responsible but later found guilty without proper notice or time to respond to new evidence. The school failed to provide the defendant with a fair hearing during the administrative appeal stage, leading to a reversal of the initial determination of sexual misconduct without proper explanation or opportunity for the defendant to defend himself. Another student was expelled for sexual assault despite being found not responsible initially, after a rehearing was permitted and conducted unfairly. The school failed to provide a fair hearing during the administrative appeal stage, resulting in the expulsion of a student who was initially found not responsible. The individual overseeing the appeal conducted off-the-record meetings with the accuser, prejudging the case and violating due process. As a result, the court ruled that these procedural inadequacies constituted a due process violation. In response, OCR withdrew previous guidance and began the rulemaking process to codify schools' responsibilities under Title IX. The Department of Education (ED) is in the process of codifying schools' responsibilities under Title IX. They have issued a new Question and Answer document addressing sexual misconduct, allowing for mediation in certain cases and outlining appeal procedures. A proposed rulemaking would narrow the definition of sexual harassment, require \"actual notice\" for Title IX responsibilities, and change how schools respond to allegations. The proposed regulation under Title IX would define sexual harassment more narrowly, require \"actual notice\" for schools' responsibilities, and only consider a school's response a violation if it shows deliberate indifference. It also includes new procedural requirements to ensure due process during investigations. The proposed regulations under Title IX would establish a higher threshold for showing a violation based on hostile environment harassment, requiring conduct to be severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive to deny equal access to education programs. The proposed regulations under Title IX would define a hostile environment as conduct that is severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, denying equal access to education programs. Schools would only have a duty to respond to allegations of sexual harassment when they have \"actual knowledge\" of the harassment. The proposed regulations under Title IX define a hostile environment as severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive conduct that denies equal access to education programs. Schools are only obligated to respond to sexual harassment allegations when they have \"actual knowledge\" of the harassment. The regulations reject imputing knowledge to a school based on respondeat superior or constructive notice, and compel schools to respond only to sexual harassment within their education program or activity. This contrasts with past guidance that sometimes held schools responsible for harassment occurring outside their programs. The proposed regulations under Title IX outline that schools are responsible to respond to harassment occurring outside their education program or activity, with a focus on not being \"deliberately indifferent.\" The regulations provide a safe harbor from deliberate indifference in certain situations, such as when a formal Title IX complaint is made. The proposal outlines three situations where a school is provided a safe harbor from a finding of deliberate indifference under Title IX: when a formal complaint is made, when there is actual knowledge of harassment from multiple complainants, and when supportive measures are offered to the complainant in higher education institutions. Compliance with grievance procedures in these situations would negate any inference of deliberate indifference. The proposed regulations outline situations where a school is not considered deliberately indifferent under Title IX, including when a formal complaint is made, when there is actual knowledge of harassment from multiple complainants, and when supportive measures are provided to the complainant. Schools must respond to sexual harassment in a manner that is not deliberately indifferent, including removing the accused on an emergency basis after a risk and safety analysis. Accused individuals must be given notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision, and nonstudent employees may be placed on administrative leave during an investigation. Due process for accused students is a significant concern in the proposal. The proposed regulations emphasize due process protections for accused students during investigations of sexual harassment. Schools must investigate formal complaints, provide written notice to relevant parties, and ensure equitable treatment for both complainants and respondents. The proposal emphasizes equitable treatment for both complainants and respondents in school grievance procedures related to sexual harassment. It requires objective evaluation of evidence, unbiased individuals in the decision-making process, training on student safety and due process, a presumption of innocence for respondents, and outlines possible sanctions and remedies. The proposed regulations emphasize equitable treatment in school grievance procedures related to sexual harassment.
