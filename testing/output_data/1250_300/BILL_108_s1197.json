    "content": "The Act titled \"Consumer Assurance of Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003\" is cited as the short title. Congress finds that over 300 million medical imaging exams and radiation therapy treatments are conducted annually in the US, with 7 out of 10 Americans undergoing these procedures each year. The impact of these procedures on public health and safety, as well as interstate commerce, is significant. It is crucial to minimize unnecessary radiation exposure by ensuring that personnel have proper education and credentials. Additionally, maintaining a supply of well-educated individuals and state-administered accreditation and certification programs is essential for public health and safety. The importance of having properly educated and credentialed individuals in medical imaging and radiation therapy is crucial for public health and safety. Both State and Federal Governments have responsibilities in ensuring competence and efficacy in these procedures, as facilities conducting them impact interstate commerce. In 1981, Congress passed the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act to set federal standards for accrediting education programs for medical imaging and radiation therapy. Some states still do not require licensure for individuals performing these procedures, despite the interstate impact of facilities offering these services. The Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 aims to ensure accreditation of education programs and licensure for individuals performing medical imaging and radiation therapy. It highlights the varying state regulations for radiographers, radiation therapists, nuclear medicine technologists, medical physicists, and medical dosimetrists. The Act's purposes include guaranteeing safety and accuracy in these procedures. The Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 focuses on accrediting education programs and licensing individuals for medical imaging and radiation therapy. It addresses state regulations for radiographers, radiation therapists, nuclear medicine technologists, medical physicists, and medical dosimetrists to ensure safety and accuracy in procedures. Additionally, Section 3 introduces quality standards for medical imaging and radiation therapy. The Secretary will establish standards for the safety and accuracy of medical imaging and radiation therapy, including licensure, certification, accreditation, and other requirements. Exemptions apply to physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Individuals must pass a national exam approved by the Secretary and meet additional requirements before performing imaging or therapy. Approved bodies will be certified by the Secretary. The Secretary will certify private nonprofit organizations or State agencies as approved bodies for accrediting educational programs or administering exams for medical imaging or radiation therapy. Minimum standards and assurances must be met for certification. The Secretary certifies private nonprofit organizations or State agencies as approved bodies for accrediting educational programs or administering exams for medical imaging or radiation therapy. Organizations must comply with standards, notify the Secretary of any changes, and provide required information. The Secretary can withdraw certification if standards are not met. The Secretary can withdraw certification of an approved body if standards are not met. Accreditation or examination completion by the body remains valid for a reasonable period. Existing State standards are deemed compliant unless determined otherwise by the Secretary. Periodic evaluation of approved bodies is required by the Secretary. The Secretary evaluates approved bodies periodically and includes the results in reports to relevant committees. Regulations will ensure that medical imaging and radiation therapy programs meet established standards. Alternative standards may apply to rural areas for payment of these services. The Secretary may develop alternative standards for rural areas to ensure access to quality medical imaging and radiation therapy. Regulations must be implemented within 18 months of enactment. An approved body is defined as a certified nonprofit organization or State agency. In this section, an approved body is defined as a nonprofit organization or State agency certified by the Secretary to accredit individuals in medical imaging or radiation therapy. Medical imaging refers to procedures for diagnosing or treating medical conditions, excluding ultrasound. Performing medical imaging involves exposing patients to radiation or magnetic fields and positioning them for the procedure. The term 'plan' in medical imaging or radiation therapy refers to preparing for a procedure by evaluating site-specific information to customize it for the patient. Radiation therapy involves procedures or articles intended for curing, mitigating, treating, or preventing disease through radiation emission."
