    "content": "Public and private health care spending is increasing due to factors like rising enrollment in health insurance and demographic changes. The tax subsidies in the Internal Revenue Code for health care provision are often overlooked in budget discussions. These subsidies, known as tax expenditures, confer preferential tax status to certain forms of income, resulting in foregone revenue. Congressional attention to health-related tax expenditures raises questions about their value, changes over time, impact of the ACA, and comparison to total revenue collected. The report analyzes historical data on health-related tax expenditure estimates published by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to understand the changes in the value of health tax expenditures relative to total revenue collected. It also examines the size of health tax expenditures compared to discretionary and mandatory outlays on health programs in past years, and whether federal support for health has grown more through direct outlays or indirectly through revenue losses attributable to tax expenditures. For more detailed information on individual tax expenditures, readers can refer to CRS Committee Print CP10001 and CRS Report R44012 for broader analysis of tax expenditures. The report discusses tax expenditures defined by the Joint Committee on Taxation as revenue losses from special provisions in federal tax laws. These provisions deviate from the modified Haig-Simons baseline definition of income. Certain tax provisions result in revenue forgone from this baseline, causing a diversion from measured income. Tax expenditures are considered revenue losses from special provisions in federal tax laws that deviate from the modified Haig-Simons baseline definition of income. The Joint Committee on Taxation categorizes these provisions by budget function, such as health, commerce, and housing, energy, etc. The Department of the Treasury also has its own list of tax expenditures organized by budget function. JCT publishes estimates of tax expenditures during each session of Congress. The Joint Committee on Taxation categorizes tax expenditures by budget function, which may differ from how agencies like the Office of Management and Budget organize spending. This discrepancy is due to historical practices and the complexity of cross-cutting health provisions. The Congressional Budget Office analyzes tax expenditures based on forms outlined in the 1974 Budget Act, while academic researchers categorize them in various ways. Economists evaluate tax expenditures based on economic efficiency, equity, and other criteria. Tax expenditures are categorized by the Joint Committee on Taxation based on budget function, which may differ from how spending is organized by agencies like the Office of Management and Budget. Economists evaluate tax expenditures based on economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity criteria, providing insights for Congressional decision-making. Tax expenditures in the form of exclusions and deductions could impact tax progressivity, while using the tax code for social policy targeting lower-income households may increase complexity in tax filing. Administering social policy through the tax code could benefit lower-income households by utilizing information from tax forms. However, this approach may increase tax filing complexity and administration costs. The Joint Committee on Taxation identifies various health tax expenditures, excluding Medicare-related provisions since December 2015. In FY2016, health tax expenditures are estimated at $234.0 billion, with the largest being the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance. The largest health tax expenditure in FY2016 amounted to $234.0 billion, with the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance being the largest provision. Other significant health tax expenditures include subsidies for insurance purchased in the exchanges, serving various purposes and having a long history in the tax code. Some health tax provisions effectively subsidize private health insurance or supplemental benefits. Certain provisions reduce costs of private activities with positive spillover benefits. Older provisions in the tax code have origins in legal doctrine or income definitions at the time of adoption. The ESI tax exclusion has historical roots. The ESI tax exclusion, originating in 1918, was expanded post-World War II to exclude employer health contributions from income. The Internal Revenue Code Act of 1954 solidified this exclusion. Analysis of JCT data from FY1974 to FY2019 shows changes in health-related tax expenditures over time. The analysis of JCT data from FY1974 to FY2019 shows changes in health-related tax expenditures over time, with the number of provisions fluctuating and the value of these expenditures increasing after adjusting for inflation. After adjusting for inflation, health-related tax expenditures have increased over time. From FY2004 to FY2014, these expenditures increased by 43.0% in real terms. The annual value of health tax expenditures in nominal dollars has increased by 11.5% from FY1974 to FY2014. Post-ACA in 2010, growth rates fluctuate but remain positive. The estimated annual value of health tax expenditures is projected to increase from $210.4 billion in FY2015 to $296.2 billion in FY2019. Health tax expenditures are estimated to increase from $210.4 billion in FY2015 to $296.2 billion in FY2019. The growth is attributed to factors like changes in demographics, private and government-provided health costs, and policy changes affecting the cost of health-related tax expenditures. Medicare-related tax expenditures increased due to changes in how benefits were calculated. Tax expenditures for Medicare (Part A, B, or D) exceeded enrollees' payments, indicating the value of insurance was higher than premiums. From FY1987 to FY2014, Medicare-related tax expenditures increased by 10.2% (nominal) and 7.7% (real) annually. JCT estimated these provisions accounted for 26.8% of health tax expenditures in FY2014, up from 1.9% in FY1974. The value of health-related tax expenditures has increased significantly over the years, from 1.9% of total revenue in FY1974 to 8.4% in FY2014. In FY2019, health tax expenditures are estimated to be 7.7% of total revenue collected. Various taxes imposed by the ACA, such as the Cadillac tax and the individual mandate, contribute to revenue but are small compared to the total value of health tax expenditures. The ACA imposed various taxes, including the individual mandate, employer mandate, and medical device tax. Additionally, a 3.8% unearned income Medicare contribution tax was imposed on higher-income taxpayers. The revenue raised by these provisions is small compared to total health tax expenditures. The comparison between outlays and tax expenditures can track federal support to the health sector over time. Health-related tax expenditures historically exceeded health discretionary outlays but were less than health mandatory outlays. Mandatory health outlays increased from 1.0% of GDP in FY1974 to 3.8% in recent years. Health-related tax expenditures have grown over time, from 0.3% of GDP in FY1974 to 1.5% in FY2014. Health discretionary outlays remained between 0.3% and 0.5% of GDP from FY1974 to FY2014. The appendix provides a description and legislative origins of each health tax expenditure provision identified by the Joint Committee on Taxation. Some provisions in the Internal Revenue Code have historical origins in past legal definitions or administrative rulings.
