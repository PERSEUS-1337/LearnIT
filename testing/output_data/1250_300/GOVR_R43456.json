    "content": "Airline passenger screening in the United States has evolved significantly since 9/11, with new technologies and policies overseen by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) under the Aviation Transportation and Security Act. TSA is mandated to provide comprehensive security screening for all passengers and property, with the authority to implement trusted traveler programs and expedite screening for certain passengers. The TSA has implemented technologies to expedite security screening for airline passengers, focusing on those who require more extensive screening. Despite challenges in implementing risk-based screening, TSA has mainly relied on a uniform approach, leading to issues. Efforts to improve screening have centered on technology like whole-body imagers and advanced X-ray equipment, enhancing threat detection capabilities. The TSA has primarily focused on technology to improve airport screening capabilities, but constraints such as budget limitations and space constraints have hindered a solely technology-driven approach. This has led to sometimes cumbersome procedures for passengers, potentially affecting public perception of TSA. The TSA has faced criticism for inflexible security methods and public perceptions. Former TSA Administrator Kip Hawley criticized the agency for creating a security system that is rigid. TSA has shifted towards risk-based screening, which has sparked controversy. There are differing views on how to assess and mitigate security risks. The dilemma of where to focus security efforts can be informed by Frederick the Great's advice to prioritize and mitigate the worst risks. Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff emphasized the impossibility of perfect security in a free society. Understanding security risks and implementing strategies to minimize them is crucial, with risk defined as the probability of incurring loss. In aviation security, risk is often seen as complex. In aviation security, risk is a complex interaction of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Risk-based practices use categorical techniques to quantify security risk. Passenger screening focuses on detecting and managing threats by identifying individuals and using detection technologies. Vulnerabilities are assessed to mitigate all elements of risk. The focus in aviation security is on detecting and managing threats by identifying individuals and using detection technologies. Vulnerabilities are assessed through various techniques and addressed with multiple security layers. Consequences are primarily mitigated by emergency management and response activities, not a principal concern of TSA. Defining the risk environment and specifying acceptable levels of risk are key challenges in establishing an effective risk-based strategy for aviation security. The TSA focuses on detecting and managing threats in aviation security. Risk assessment for air cargo involves extensive use of risk scoring, while passenger risk assessment is primarily categorical. Behavioral indicators are used for deriving risk scores, but their validity is questioned. There is complexity in determining specific risks to mitigate in a risk-based security strategy. The TSA's risk-based security strategy involves using behavioral indicators to derive risk scores, but the validity of these methods is questioned. There was controversy over the proposal to allow passengers to carry small knives and sports equipment onboard aircraft in 2013, with critics arguing that the risks posed by unruly passengers wielding these items were not adequately considered. Legislation was introduced to prevent TSA from lifting the ban on small knives. The TSA's risk-based security strategy involves using behavioral indicators to derive risk scores. Critics, including airlines, argued that TSA failed to consider risks posed by unruly passengers with knives and golf clubs. Legislation was introduced to prevent TSA from lifting its ban on small knives, and TSA announced it would not proceed with the proposal. Former TSA administrator Hawley and Israeli expert Ron raised concerns about the focus on prohibited items lists and detection technology, stating it hinders the security system's ability to adapt to evolving threats. Ron criticizes the reliance on prohibited items lists and detection technology in TSA's security system, pointing out that they limit the ability to respond to changing threat landscapes. He argues that detection technology gives terrorists a sense of what to expect, and that no terrorist attack has been prevented solely through the detection of threat items. Ron and others suggest integrating detection capabilities with other measures to assess threats and minimize vulnerabilities, emphasizing flexibility and unpredictability in screening passengers. Advocates of risk-based security point to Israel's successful approach, which includes demographic profiling, intelligence databases, and extensive security interviews to identify high-risk passengers. Despite ongoing threats, Israel has not experienced major terrorist attacks in over 40 years. However, adopting a similar approach in the United States is seen as legally and practically challenging. Research suggests that a tailored risk-based approach to passenger screening in the US would be more effective and politically feasible. Research by TSA's Kenneth Fletcher suggests that a risk-based approach to passenger screening tailored to the US aviation security framework would be more effective, politically feasible, and legally defensible than the Israeli airport security model. Risk-based screening is part of a multi-layered approach that allows TSA to focus resources on unknown and elevated risk passengers, modify security postures based on threats, and inform decisions on behavioral detection officers and air marshals deployment. TSA uses risk-based programs to adjust security measures based on threats, including deploying behavioral detection officers and air marshals. Risk-based passenger screening has been used since the 1970s, initially using rudimentary passenger profiles before transitioning to more advanced techniques. FAA continued to use profiling tools to analyze passenger name records for potential threats. In the late 1980s, FAA required airlines to ask passengers basic security questions to target elevated-risk checked baggage, heightening awareness of potential threats posed by bombers trying to deceive individuals into carrying devices aboard aircraft. TSA later eliminated the use of these questions. After the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing in 1988, the Computer-Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening (CAPPS) system was developed to identify potential security threats based on flight reservation data. CAPPS, now overseen by TSA, uses algorithms that may flag passengers buying one-way tickets or paying with cash. Additionally, a \"no-fly\" list was created by FAA and FBI to deny boarding to known terrorists, but on 9/11, only 12 names were on the list, none of them the hijackers. After the 9/11 attacks, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) directed TSA to establish trusted traveler programs and use technology to expedite screening for passengers. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 further mandated the use of CAPPS or its successor system to evaluate all passengers before boarding, focusing on risk-based screening. This approach was recommended by the Department of Transportation Airport Security Rapid Response Team formed after 9/11. The Department of Transportation Airport Security Rapid Response Team recommended risk-based screening after 9/11, leading to the development of CAPPS II for passenger vetting and security. This system aimed to integrate identity authentication, watch list checks, and enhanced risk assessments for all flights. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) developed CAPPS II for passenger screening, which aimed to categorize passengers based on threat assessments using various databases. Despite controversy over privacy issues, TSA scrapped CAPPS II in 2004 and focused on screening all passengers against terrorist watchlists. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving the \"no fly\" and \"automatic selectee\" lists, urging TSA to conduct screening instead of air carriers and utilize a larger set of watchlists maintained by the federal government. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated TSA to take over passenger watchlist screening from air carriers. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated TSA to assume passenger watchlist screening from air carriers, establishing the Secure Flight program in 2008. This program screens passenger information against the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) for domestic and international flights, with the TSDB containing fewer than 400,000 names. The TSDB, including the \"no fly\" and \"selectee\" lists, contains fewer than 400,000 names. The TIDE database, a source for foreign identities in the TSDB, has grown to include about 875,000 names. The TSDB has expanded to over 500,000 identities as of September 2012, with a focus on improving watchlist practices for timeliness and accuracy. The TSDB has expanded to over 500,000 identities as of September 2012, with a focus on improving watchlist practices for timeliness and accuracy. Secure Flight compares passenger data against watchlists to determine access at airport checkpoints and retains potential matches for 7 years. The TSA's Secure Flight program compares passenger data against watchlists to determine access at airport checkpoints. Records are destroyed within seven days if no potential watchlist match is found, while potential matches are retained for 7 years and confirmed matches for up to 99 years. The program benefits from experience with the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) and CBP's Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) for risk assessments on international travelers. CBP relies on its Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) to assess inbound and outbound international travelers by comparing passenger data against terrorist and law enforcement databases. The passenger module of ATS does not use risk scoring but looks for red flags like suspected use of lost or stolen passports. Data in ATS may be retained for up to 15 years, with passenger name record data depersonalized within six months per an agreement with the European Union. Passenger data in the ATS may be retained for up to 15 years, with depersonalized name record data retained for up to five years in an active database before transferring to a dormant database for up to 10 years. Travelers from Visa Waiver Program countries must submit biographical information through ESTA before boarding a U.S.-bound flight, which is checked against various databases for potential threats. Secure Flight uses government and airline data for risk analysis, while TSA's SPOT program observes airport behavior to identify potential threats. The TSA's Screening Passengers by Observational Techniques (SPOT) program aims to identify potential threats by observing behavior at airports. The program has faced controversy due to concerns over its cost, scientific validity, and operational utility. TSA asserts that SPOT is based on scientifically validated behaviors and law enforcement techniques, but there are nuanced differences between SPOT and traditional law enforcement behavior analysis methods. The TSA's SPOT program utilizes behavior detection techniques that have been used in law enforcement, customs, and security. SPOT differs from traditional law enforcement methods by focusing on large groups of individuals and interpreting non-verbal cues like facial expressions. This unique approach includes a formal scoring system to rate suspicion based on behavioral indicators. The TSA's SPOT program utilizes non-invasive observation techniques and a formal scoring system to rate suspicion based on behavioral indicators. Despite questions about its effectiveness, the program has not led to the arrest of any terrorists according to the Government Accountability Office. The Government Accountability Office found that the TSA's SPOT program, which utilizes behavior detection techniques, had been implemented without proper validation or cost-benefit analysis. TSA conducted validation studies showing its techniques were effective in detecting high-risk travelers, but has not publicly released the results for independent review. TSA has taken steps to address GAO recommendations and collaborate with international partners to improve the SPOT program. Despite positive validation study results, doubts about behavior detection techniques in the TSA's SPOT program persist. The GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General question the program's effectiveness in deterring terrorism due to inadequate metrics for evaluation. Developing suitable metrics to assess the program's impact on mission objectives remains a challenge. The effectiveness of the TSA's SPOT program in deterring terrorism is questioned due to inadequate metrics for evaluation. GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General found discrepancies in BDOs' referrals and metrics used to support SPOT's effectiveness. Lapses in records-keeping and lack of consistent refresher training for behavior detection officers were also identified. The TSA's SPOT program, aimed at behavior detection, lacks consistent refresher training for officers and performance evaluation for instructors. Questions persist about the program's effectiveness, despite some Members of Congress seeking to eliminate funding for it. In contrast, TSA's Pre-Check program, designed for low-risk passengers, has received more positive feedback since its full implementation in 2012. TSA's Pre-Check program, aimed at expediting processing for low-risk passengers, began in 2011 and fully operational in 2012. It is available at no cost to select frequent flyers and trusted traveler program members, with others able to apply for a fee. The program is similar to the former Registered Traveler program, which was discontinued in 2009. The Registered Traveler program, which involved biometric data collection and background checks, was launched in 2007 but dismantled shortly after expanding in 2008. In contrast, the Pre-Check program, started in 2011, resurrected extensive background checks for low-risk passengers without issuing biometric credentials. The Pre-Check program, unlike the Registered Traveler program, does not issue biometric credentials. Approved individuals receive a known traveler number for expedited screening, but random thorough physical screenings can still occur. TSA faces challenges in authenticating boarding passes, potentially compromising access to Pre-Check lanes. Pass Scanning Systems for Pre-Check program faces technical and managerial challenges. TSA collects biographic and biometric data for security threat assessments. Eligible applicants include U.S. citizens, nationals, and legal permanent residents. Ineligibility criteria are based on specified time periods. The TSA Pre-Check program conducts criminal history checks through the FBI for U.S. citizens, nationals, and legal permanent residents. Applicants may be rejected based on specific criminal convictions, watchlist information, and must pay an $85 processing fee. Approved travelers receive a Known Traveler Number valid for five years, while those deemed ineligible can appeal within 30 days. The TSA Pre-Check program requires applicants to undergo criminal history checks and pay an $85 processing fee. Approved travelers receive a Known Traveler Number valid for five years, while those rejected can appeal within 30 days by providing supporting records. TSA has opened enrollment centers nationwide for applicants to provide identification and fingerprints. Early feedback from frequent travelers has been positive. The TSA Pre-Check program requires applicants to undergo criminal history checks and pay an $85 processing fee. Approved travelers receive a Known Traveler Number valid for five years, while those rejected can appeal within 30 days by providing supporting records. Early feedback from frequent travelers has been positive. The program has expanded rapidly, with over 100 airports offering expedited screening by January 2014. However, the growth in popularity may lead to increased wait times in Pre-Check lanes for participants, while non-participating travelers could potentially benefit from shorter lines as more people join the program. The TSA Pre-Check program allows approved travelers to use expedited screening lanes, potentially saving time as more people join. Non-participating travelers may also benefit from occasional selection for Pre-Check lanes through managed inclusion. This initiative involves real-time threat assessments to identify low-risk individuals for random selection. Canine teams and behavioral detection officers perform initial screenings, with passengers triggering a directional arrow for further instructions at the kiosk. Passengers can be randomly selected for Pre-Check screening lanes based on an elevated risk or managed inclusion. Military personnel, including active duty, reservists, and National Guard members, are also eligible for Pre-Check. Family members under 12 can use Pre-Check with cleared military personnel, while those over 12 must qualify independently. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense and Coast Guard can participate in expedited screening without enrolling in Pre-Check. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard, along with military personnel, can participate in expedited screening without enrolling in Pre-Check. Airline crewmembers undergo background screening equivalent to Pre-Check applicants for expedited screening eligibility. Airline crew, military personnel, and defense personnel undergo extensive background screening for expedited screening eligibility, considered lower risk by TSA. Random selection for standard screening adds unpredictability. TSA uses random selection for screening certain sub-populations, adding unpredictability in line with a risk-based security approach. Various forms of data are collected and retained for risk-based screening programs, including biographic and biometric information. Data from intelligence sources and investigations are also kept. TSA deletes data no longer needed, but records matching terrorist or criminal databases are retained longer. Individuals matching terrorist or criminal databases are kept for extended periods, while other records are deleted after travel completion. Voluntarily submitted data, like Pre-Check applications, is retained unless updated. TSA uses commercial databases for validation but doesn't share with consumer agencies. Personal data can be shared among DHS agencies for counterterrorism efforts and with law enforcement for investigations. The Privacy Act of 1974 protects data handled by law enforcement agencies for investigating violations. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established appeals procedures for individuals identified as security threats. The 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 required DHS to establish an Office of Appeals and Redress for individuals wrongly identified as threats. The DHS established the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) to address situations where individuals claim they were wrongly identified as a threat and delayed from boarding a commercial aircraft. The program allows passengers to file complaints online or by mail, and if an investigation finds a misidentification issue, steps are provided to resolve it. The DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) was established to address misidentification issues causing delays for travelers. Steps are provided to resolve the issue, including retaining a copy of the DHS response letter for check-in. Passengers can appeal decisions, but TSA decisions under the Secure Flight program are mostly exempt from judicial review. TSA sought information in 2013 to expand expedited screening using third-party prescreening for assessing risks to the aviation system. The TSA sought information in 2013 to expand expedited screening using third-party prescreening for assessing risks to the aviation system, including the use of large commercial databases. Concerns have been raised about privacy and data accuracy in passenger risk assessments. Non-federal government and private databases may already be used for passenger prescreening, with details of specific programs not publicly disclosed. The TSA sought information in 2013 to expand expedited screening using third-party prescreening for assessing risks to the aviation system, including the use of large commercial databases. Concerns have been raised about privacy and data accuracy in passenger risk assessments. Non-federal government and private databases may already be used for passenger prescreening, with details of specific programs not publicly disclosed. Congress had previously restricted the use of commercial data in airline passenger prescreening, but systems like CBP's ATS, Secure Flight, Pre-Check applications, and TSA's Transportation Security Enforcement Records System may still utilize commercial data for risk assessments. Congressional oversight and possible legislative action may be needed related to TSA systems using commercial data for risk-based purposes. Congressional oversight and possible legislative action may be necessary regarding TSA's use of commercial data for risk-based passenger screening, as details of the programs cannot be publicly discussed for security reasons. The effectiveness, efficiency, and data security of TSA's risk-based approach need to be reviewed by Congress to ensure a comprehensive strategy addressing security risks. The effectiveness and efficiency of TSA's risk-based programs need to be reviewed by Congress to ensure a comprehensive strategy addressing security risks. Experts suggest that risk-based screening should be part of a broader approach to security, with the ability to adapt to evolving threats and incorporate new methods. The risk-based approach to passenger screening, including the Pre-Check program, terrorist watchlists, and behavioral profiling techniques, lacks public disclosure on its adaptability and evolution. Changes made in response to security threats, such as the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253, have not been publicly acknowledged. The evolution of behavioral detection methods under TSA's program also remains undisclosed. Congressional oversight may need to address how TSA's risk-based strategy and intelligence practices have adapted to new threats, resources, procedures, and technologies. The selection of appropriate metrics is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of TSA's risk-based programs. The effectiveness of TSA's risk-based strategies is a key issue for congressional oversight. Identifying suitable metrics is challenging due to security secrecy and limited encounters with individuals tied to terrorism. Concerns arise over false alarms singling out innocent individuals as potential threats. TSA's choice of metrics for programs like Pre-Check has been questioned, emphasizing efficiency over security effectiveness. The limited number of terrorist encounters raises concerns about false alarms singling out innocent individuals as potential threats in aviation passenger pre-screening. Efforts to reduce false positives may create gaps in threat detection capabilities, while high false alarm rates can misdirect screening resources and complicate the lives of falsely targeted individuals. Initiatives to reduce false alarms have focused on improving terrorist databases and implementing a redress process for those wrongly targeted. The effectiveness of these steps in reducing false alarm rates has not been publicly disclosed. The effectiveness of steps to reduce false alarm rates in aviation passenger pre-screening has not been publicly disclosed. TSA anticipates risk-based security efficiencies will save $120 million and reduce staffing by 1,500 positions in FY2015. Congressional oversight may examine if these gains compromise security. Privacy protections and data security measures are also of concern. TSA's implementation of risk-based security is moving forward. As TSA implements a risk-based approach to passenger screening, concerns persist about the integration of various programs and elements, adaptation to changes in the threat landscape and resource availability, identification of appropriate metrics for program effectiveness, addressing impacts of false positives, and ensuring privacy and data protections. Despite elaborate security measures post-9/11, the threat to aviation remains. Balancing privacy with effective security strategies is a key issue for aviation security policy and potential congressional oversight."
