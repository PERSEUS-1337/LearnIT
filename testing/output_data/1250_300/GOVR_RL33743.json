    "content": "The 112th Congress used TPA authority to pass implementing bills for U.S. FTAs with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea in 2011. TPA allows Congress to consider trade agreements quickly and vote on them without amendments, as long as certain conditions are met. Other trade negotiations that may require TPA include the Doha Development Round, TPP, TTIP, and TISA. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) allows Congress to quickly consider trade agreements without amendments, providing additional negotiating leverage to the President. However, the expiration of TPA raises questions about its renewal, as trade negotiations have become more complex and partisan. TPA is the result of decades of debate and compromise between Congress and the executive branch, balancing constitutional powers and the need for cooperative flexibility in trade policy. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) is the result of decades of debate and compromise between Congress and the executive branch, balancing constitutional powers and the need for cooperative flexibility in trade policy. The evolution of TPA shows that the congressional-executive partnership on trade policymaking can be strengthened or strained as it adjusts to evolving political and economic conditions. The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress express authority over the regulation of foreign trade, while the President has exclusive authority to negotiate treaties and international agreements. The President has exclusive authority to negotiate treaties and international agreements under Article II, exercising broad authority over foreign affairs. Both legislative and executive authorities are involved in developing and executing U.S. trade agreements. Congress historically set tariff rates on imported products for the first 150 years of the United States, with tariffs being the main trade policy instrument and a key source of federal revenue. The President's role in trade policy included negotiating bilateral treaties of friendship, commerce, and navigation with the Senate's advice and consent, ensuring most-favored-nation treatment for treaty partners. In the 1930s, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act set high tariff rates, leading to retaliatory tariffs and trade restrictions. This prompted the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, allowing the President to reduce tariffs through reciprocal trade agreements on a most-favored-nation basis. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 (RTAA) authorized the President to enter into trade agreements reducing tariffs within pre-approved levels on a most-favored-nation basis. Congress delegated expanded trade authority to the President to lessen political pressure from special interests. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was the last general tariff legislation passed by Congress, now only applied to imports from Cuba and North Korea without most-favored-nation status. Congress retained broader trade authority and limited the time frame for the trade agreements authority to prevent executive branch overreach. Under the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, the President was authorized to reduce tariffs on a most-favored-nation basis. Congress maintained broader trade authority and limited the time frame for trade agreements to prevent executive overreach. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reductions for five years, expanding Congress's role in the process. The establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947 shifted trade negotiations from bilateral to multilateral forums. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reductions for five years and expanded Congress's role in the process by requiring congressional review of agreements. This act allowed the President to conclude the GATT Kennedy Round, which focused on reducing tariffs and addressing nontariff barriers. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reductions and address nontariff barriers. Congress became concerned about potential changes in U.S. law required by trade agreements, leading to the creation of fast track authority. Congress debated legislative options as the tariff modification authority expired in 1967. The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 granted the President authority to negotiate tariff reductions and address nontariff barriers. Congress debated legislative options as the tariff modification authority expired in 1967. The Nixon Administration sought new authority to negotiate the Tokyo Round in the GATT, which Congress granted in the Trade Act of 1974. This act provided the President with the authority to enter into trade agreements that reduced or eliminated tariffs within certain parameters. Congress stipulated that nontariff barrier agreements could only enter into force if implementing legislation was passed. Some argued that subjecting implementing legislation to ordinary congressional debate would defeat the purpose of delegating trade agreements authority to the President. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President authority to negotiate trade agreements with limited congressional debate and amendment procedures to reduce special interest pressures. Congress agreed to give trade agreements expedited treatment to provide assurances to U.S. trading partners for timely consideration. The Trade Act of 1974 granted the President fast track trade negotiating authority, allowing for expedited treatment of trade agreements with limited congressional debate and amendment procedures. This authority led to the conclusion of the Tokyo Round of the GATT, resulting in agreements on non-tariff barriers such as government procurement practices, product standards, customs regulations, and antidumping procedures. The Tokyo Round of the GATT (1973-1979) resulted in agreements on non-tariff barriers like government procurement practices, product standards, and customs regulations. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 was the first trade implementing bill passed by Congress under expanded trade agreements authority. The fast track trade negotiating authority granted in the Trade Act of 1974 was in effect until January 2, 1980, with residual presidential authority extended to January 2, 1982. Congress has revised the expedited legislative procedures over the years. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until January 2, 1988. It allowed for negotiation and implementation of bilateral free trade agreements, including the U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs. The act waived the 90-day notification requirement for the U.S.-Israel FTA but required notification to Congress for negotiations with other countries. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 extended presidential authority to enter into agreements on nontariff barriers until January 2, 1988. It allowed for negotiation and implementation of bilateral free trade agreements, including the U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Canada FTAs. The act waived the 90-day notification requirement for the U.S.-Israel FTA but required notification to Congress for negotiations with other countries. For negotiations with other countries, the President had to notify specific committees 60 days prior to entering FTA negotiations and agreements with tariff modifications beyond a certain threshold required congressional approval via implementing legislation. The OTCA extended the President's authority to enter into trade agreements before June 1, 1993, and expedited procedures for agreements entered into before June 1, 1991. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (OTCA) of 1993 extended presidential authority for trade agreements until June 1, 1993, and allowed for expedited procedures for agreements entered into before June 1, 1991. Congress could withhold trade agreements from fast track consideration by passing a resolution of disapproval if the USTR failed to consult adequately. The OTCA expanded trade negotiation objectives and implemented NAFTA in 1993. H.R. 1876 extended authority for the Uruguay Round until April 16, 1994. After the expiration deadline, Congress passed H.R. 1876 in 1993, extending trade authority until April 16, 1994 for the Uruguay Round. The law received strong support in both the House (295-126) and the Senate (76-16). Fast track authority was not renewed until the Trade Act of 2002, marking the longest hiatus since its initial approval in 1974. In 1998, a House vote on fast track authority legislation failed to pass (180-243), with reasons for Congress's decision including lack of support and other factors. In 1998, Congress failed to pass fast track authority legislation (180-243) due to disagreements on negotiating objectives for labor and environmental issues. The WTO's failure to launch new negotiations in 1999 also contributed to the lack of urgency in renewing trade agreements authority. President George W. Bush later requested a renewal of fast track authority, which was renamed as \"trade promotion authority (TPA)\" in the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002. The legislation renamed fast track authority to \"trade promotion authority (TPA)\" in the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002. TPA included new provisions for labor and environmental objectives but did not require enforceable labor standards in trade agreements. It also established the Congressional Oversight Group for consultation. The House version of the bill passed narrowly along party lines. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 (H.R. 3005) passed narrowly in the House along party lines. It was combined with other trade-related legislation in the Senate and ultimately resulted in the Trade Act of 2002 (H.R. 3009). The 2002 version of TPA allowed for implementing legislation for Free Trade Agreement countries. The proposed Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act (BCTPA) was introduced in 2015. The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002 (H.R. 3005) narrowly passed in the House along party lines and was combined with other trade-related legislation in the Senate to form the Trade Act of 2002 (H.R. 3009). The proposed Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act (BCTPA) was introduced in 2015 as TPA-2015, which contains updated negotiating objectives on various trade aspects and will expire on July 1, 2021 if enacted. The negotiating objectives in TPA-2015 include provisions on labor, environment, currency manipulation, localization, state-owned enterprises, and human rights. TPA-2015 may be used for agreements like TPP, T-TIP, TISA, EGA, and Doha Round. It will expire on July 1, 2021 if not extended. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to reduce barriers on goods to promote the environment and consider agreements from the Doha Round of WTO negotiations. Congress uses TPA to define trade policy priorities, ensure adherence to objectives, set terms for trade agreements, and reaffirm its authority over trade. This includes procedural precedents outside the formal TPA process. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) aims to reduce barriers on goods to promote the environment and consider agreements from the Doha Round of WTO negotiations. Congress uses TPA to define trade policy priorities, ensure adherence to objectives, set terms for trade agreements, and reaffirm its authority over trade. The process for implementing trade agreements changed when negotiations expanded to include nontariff barriers (NTBs), leading to the establishment of \"fast track trade negotiating authority\" by Congress. This authority includes expedited procedures for moving trade implementing legislation through Congress, as outlined in the Trade Act of 1974 and Trade Act of 2002. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) allows for expedited procedures to move trade implementing legislation through Congress. To qualify, the trade agreement must meet TPA's negotiating objectives, and the implementing bill must only contain provisions necessary to implement the agreement. Congress has the right to change the rules governing these expedited procedures at any time. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants Congress the power to control the approval and implementation of trade agreements. Congress authorizes the President to put the agreement into effect through a presidential proclamation, after ensuring the partner country has complied with the agreement's provisions. The requirements for this authority are outlined in Section 2105 of the Trade Act of 2002, including notifying Congress 90 days before signing the agreement and providing a list of required actions within 60 days of signing. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants Congress the power to control the approval and implementation of trade agreements. Congress authorizes the President to put the agreement into effect through a presidential proclamation, after ensuring the partner country has complied with the agreement's provisions. The President must notify Congress 90 days before signing the agreement and provide a list of required changes to U.S. law within 60 days of signing. Congress follows expedited legislative procedures if the requirements are met. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) grants Congress the power to control the approval and implementation of trade agreements. Congress follows expedited legislative procedures outlined in Sections 151-154 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, if certain requirements are met. These procedures include mandatory introduction of the implementing bill, automatic discharge from committees, limited floor debate, and no amendments allowed. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in TPA legislation to emphasize the importance of trade in U.S. foreign economic and security policy. Congress defines trade negotiation objectives in TPA legislation to emphasize the importance of trade in U.S. foreign economic and security policy. These objectives are definitive statements of U.S. trade policy that the Administration is expected to honor to expedite trade agreement implementing legislation. The objectives are categorized into overall objectives, principal objectives, and other priorities, guiding the direction of trade negotiations towards enhancing the U.S. and global economies. The objectives in trade negotiations are divided into three categories: overall objectives, principal objectives, and other priorities. Overall objectives focus on enhancing U.S. and global economies, while principal objectives include specific goals like reducing trade barriers and protecting intellectual property rights. These objectives are crucial in guiding trade negotiations and have been a source of controversy in the past. The controversy surrounding negotiating objectives in trade agreements, particularly in the context of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), has been a key issue. The inclusion of labor provisions in TPA objectives has sparked debates and contentious discussions, leading to challenges in passing trade agreements like the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). The structure of trade agreements mirrors TPA objectives, and disputes over FTAs based on those objectives have faced opposition but ultimately survived challenges. The renewal of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) is crucial for Congress, as it aligns with the structure of trade agreements like the CAFTA-DR. The President must consult with Congress, including the Congressional Advisory Groups, before negotiations begin, following specific notification and consultation requirements outlined in each renewal of authority. Before negotiations begin, the President must notify Congress and consult with relevant committees and advisory groups. Specific consultations are required for agriculture, import-sensitive products, fishing, and textiles. After agreements are signed, the President must notify Congress, consult on the agreement's nature and effects, and inform revenue committees of potential changes to trade remedy laws. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) requires the President to notify Congress and consult with relevant committees before negotiations begin. Specific consultations are needed for various sectors. After agreements are signed, the President must inform Congress, consult on the agreement's impact, and notify revenue committees of potential changes to trade laws. The consultation process is crucial for Congress to influence trade negotiations, although its effectiveness has been questioned. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluated the consultation process between USTR and Congress on trade negotiations. Despite frequent meetings, congressional staff felt they lacked sufficient time for input, with consultations often being briefings rather than exchanges of views. Last-minute changes to draft FTA texts were also not always included, leading to concerns about the effectiveness of the consultation process. The consultation process between USTR and Congress on trade negotiations lacked sufficient time for input, with briefings instead of exchanges of views. Concerns were raised about the effectiveness of the process, leading to calls for greater congressional input into the drafting of FTAs. Congress adopted TPA procedures to prevent delays in trade implementing bills and protect fragile consensus between trade partners. Congress did not surrender its constitutional authority over trade matters when crafting TPA, including provisions to limit expedited procedures. Renewals of trade agreements authority have set time limits for these procedures to ensure congressional oversight. TPA-2015 allows expedited procedures for agreements before July 1, 2021, with no deadline for implementing legislation submission. Previous FTAs were signed years before bills were passed, highlighting the flexibility of TPA legislation. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation requires the President to request an extension of authority, which can be denied by Congress if dissatisfied with trade agreement negotiations. Congress retains oversight by setting time limits for expedited procedures and ensuring consultation and reporting obligations are met before finalizing agreements. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation requires the President to fulfill consultation and reporting obligations to preserve congressional oversight on trade agreements. Congress can influence the agreement before finalization and may reject the implementing bill if requirements are not met. The new CCR procedure in TPA-2015 allows either chamber to withdraw TPA procedures for failure to consult with Congress on a trade agreement. The Trade Act of 1974 ensures expedited procedures for trade implementing bills as rules of procedures for each house, with the recognition of the constitutional right to change the rules at any time. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation allows Congress to withdraw or override expedited procedures for trade implementing bills with a vote. Cooperation between legislative and executive branches is crucial for TPA's success. Bipartisan agreement on TPA has been lacking since 1993. Congress, with executive branch support, defines expedited procedures for trade bills. Since 1993, bipartisan agreement on Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has been absent. Congress, with executive branch support, follows specific procedures during the consideration of trade agreement implementing bills. Three key procedures include reviewing the trade agreement before introducing the implementing bill, holding hearings and informal markup sessions, and conducting a mock conference to gauge congressional response. The informal draft version of the implementing bill and final text of the trade agreement are reviewed by Congress in a test run of congressional response. Committee members raise concerns, offer amendments, and reconcile differences in informal markups to signal changes they want in the actual bill. The Administration may make clarifications or translations of key points in the final bill, but can choose whether to accept Congress's suggested changes. The Administration can exercise discretion in accepting suggested changes from Congress regarding trade agreements. Congress has at times encouraged additions or clarifications to agreements, leading to side agreements or side letters, such as the environment and labor side agreements of NAFTA. Side agreements and side letters are additional obligations accepted by all parties after the original trade agreement is signed. Side agreements, like the environment and labor side agreements of NAFTA, may not be subject to fast track procedures. Side letters clarify specific issues and are common in bilateral FTAs, often addressing congressional concerns. They do not change the agreement's text and require official signatures from all negotiating parties to be enforceable. Informal commitments from the executive branch may address issues raised in mock markups, relying on goodwill between Congress and the administration. The Bush Administration made accommodations to secure congressional support for the CAFTA-DR implementing bill. TPA expired on July 1, 2007, and there have been criticisms of delays in requesting its renewal. President Obama requested TPA renewal in 2013 and reiterated the request in his 2015 State of the Union address. Congress may consider revamping parts of the 2002 law to address emerging policy issues and technical changes. Congress may consider revamping parts of the 2002 law, including the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which some view as outdated. TPA helps build consensus on trade policy, signals congressional support for Free Trade Agreements (FTA), and ensures Congress's role in trade policy by defining negotiating objectives and consultation requirements. The timing of TPA renewal is also an important question. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) plays a crucial role in the trade policy agenda by defining negotiating objectives and consultation requirements. The timing of TPA renewal is a key question, with suggestions to wait until negotiations for a specific Free Trade Agreement (FTA) are near completion. Congress may need to consider updating TPA to address the evolving structure of trade and complex issues. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) is crucial for defining negotiating objectives in trade agreements. Current negotiations, like the TPP, address new complex issues such as state-owned enterprises, regulatory cooperation, and trade effects on small businesses. Congress may need to update TPA to reflect these evolving trade dynamics. The Trade Act of 2002 led to a partisan vote on passage, with approval of FTAs withheld until a bipartisan agreement was reached in 2007. The \"May 10th Agreement\" included changes in labor, environment, and intellectual property rights commitments for trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Some Democrats want to include these commitments in TPA negotiating objectives, while some Republicans have reservations. Some Republicans have reservations about the May 10th Understanding and TPA-2015, particularly regarding labor, environmental, and IPR provisions. Members of Congress are dissatisfied with the consultation process for trade negotiations, especially with the TPP. They seek clearer procedures for congressional influence on FTAs and access to draft texts during negotiations. Congress may aim to clarify negotiation and consultation procedures further. Members of Congress are concerned about their access to draft texts of trade agreements during negotiations. They want clearer procedures for congressional influence on FTAs and to be kept current on negotiations to influence the agreement text. Bipartisan interest exists in enforcing trade commitments, with separate legislative efforts and the creation of the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center. Congress may also consider language on trade agreement enforcement in TPA. Technical issues from the 112th Congress's use of TPA expedited procedures may need reevaluation. The Trade Enforcement Center and Congress may need to reevaluate language on trade agreement enforcement in the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). Technical issues from previous uses of TPA expedited procedures in the 112th Congress, such as the interpretation of \"necessary or appropriate\" provisions and time limitations on introducing implementing bills, may need clarification. Some Members may want a more precise definition of the language, while others argue for flexibility in applying the standard. The Trade Enforcement Center and Congress may need to reevaluate language on trade agreement enforcement in the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). Some argue for flexibility in applying the standard, while others suggest clarifying technical issues from previous uses of TPA expedited procedures. Congress may consider time limits for introducing implementing bills after negotiations conclude and addressing text changes in FTAs that could impact approval on technical grounds. The power of TPA lies in the political compact between Congress and the President, rather than its statutory guarantees. The real power of fast track (TPA) lies in the political compact between Congress and the President, rather than its statutory guarantees. Congress seeks bipartisan consensus on trade policy, with TPA being a key element. Congress has options for renewing TPA, including renewing and revising TPA authority or extending it for specific agreements like the TPP. Representative Levin proposed a modified grant of TPA for TPP negotiations. The TPA-2015 legislation offers options for renewing TPA, including extending it for specific agreements like the TPP or granting permanent TPA authority. Without TPA, trade policy can still progress through other means like TIFAs and trade enforcement measures. Some Members do not see the need for TPA renewal. The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2015 renewed TPA for four years with a possible three-year extension. It includes expanded requirements for executive branch consultation with Congress and private sector advisers, along with trade negotiating objectives. The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2015 renewed TPA for four years with expanded requirements for executive branch consultation and trade negotiating objectives, including new provisions on currency and human rights. The bill also included new objectives reflecting current trade policy issues such as digital trade, state-owned enterprises, and localization barriers. The 2002 act included a category of trade negotiating objectives called \"capacity building and other priorities.\" Before the formal TPA expedited procedures, mock markups are held by House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees. The President sends a final legal draft text of the trade agreement and a draft implementing bill to Congress. Identical bills are subject to expedited procedures. The President sends a final legal draft text of the trade agreement and a draft implementing bill to Congress for review. Identical bills are introduced in both houses of Congress and referred to relevant committees. Committees have 45 days to report the bill, or it is automatically discharged. The implementing bill is likely a revenue bill, requiring Senate action. After reporting or discharge, any Member can motion to consider the bill, with limited debate time. After the implementing bill is reported or discharged in each house, any Member may offer a non-debatable motion to consider it. Debate is limited to 20 hours, and the measure cannot be amended. If floor action is not completed within 15 days, any Member may bring it to a vote. The bill passes by a simple majority, with the second house typically taking the final vote on the bill received from the first house. The agreement enters into force for the United States when the President implements it by proclamation. After the implementing bill is signed, the agreement enters into force for the United States when the President implements it by proclamation, typically after ensuring partner countries have met all obligations under the trade agreement."
