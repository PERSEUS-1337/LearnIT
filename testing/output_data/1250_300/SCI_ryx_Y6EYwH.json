A differentially private estimator is proposed to address this issue, providing strong privacy guarantees while maintaining good utility. The method is extended to provide confidence intervals and test statistics without extra privacy budget. Additionally, differentially private estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence function is explored. Empirical evidence from clinical datasets supports the effectiveness of the proposed method. The survival function estimates in clinical research can lead to sensitive information disclosure. This is a serious issue, especially in the healthcare domain. Kaplan-Meier's non-parametric method is commonly used for survival function estimation. Personal healthcare information is highly sensitive and protected by law. In the healthcare domain, information leakage is a serious issue. The focus of this study is on estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier's non-parametric method, which is widely used in clinical research. Existing models do not provide formal privacy guarantees for this method. The study focuses on estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method in a differentially private manner. While generative models like GANs can be used for this purpose, they do not perform well with small sample sizes and constrained data. The proposed method ensures differential privacy in estimating the survival function, along with providing confidence intervals and test statistics. Our method guarantees differentially private estimation of the survival function, extends to provide private confidence intervals and test statistics without extra privacy cost, and also estimates the competing risk cumulative incidence function. Empirical evidence from nine clinical datasets shows good utility and strong privacy guarantees. The method is released as an R package for accessibility and adoption. The survival function estimation involves accounting for censored observations in data, where the event of interest may not have occurred yet. Various methods, including parametric and non-parametric approaches like the Kaplan-Meier method, can be used to estimate the survival function. The focus of this paper is on the Kaplan-Meier method, which is widely used in clinical literature for survival models. The Kaplan-Meier method is a non-parametric approach widely used in clinical literature for survival models. It estimates the survival function by accounting for censored observations and focuses on the set of distinct failure times, number of failures, and individuals \"at risk\" before each failure time. Differential privacy provides a provable privacy notion for randomized algorithms. The Kaplan-Meier method is used for survival models, accounting for censored observations and distinct failure times. Differential privacy ensures privacy for randomized algorithms, with post-processing not increasing privacy loss. Our method ensures differentially private estimation of the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method. By following basic principles of differential privacy, we can estimate various statistics in a private manner without additional privacy budget. The dataset includes information on events and subjects at risk for unique time points. Our method ensures differentially private estimation of the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method. A dataset is created with event and at-risk subject information for unique time points. The algorithm involves adding noise to the dataset to achieve differential privacy, with minimal changes to the original estimation procedure. This approach enhances accessibility and can be implemented using standard software packages. Our method ensures differentially private estimation of the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier method. The estimation procedure involves adding minimal noise to the dataset, making it computationally cheap and easily implementable. The formal privacy guarantees and extension for differentially private estimation of other associated statistics are provided. The L1 sensitivity of the method is established, ensuring -differential privacy. Theorem 2 proves Algorithm 1 is -differentially private by adding Laplace noise to ensure privacy of individual components. The approach easily extends to other essential statistics like confidence intervals and test statistics for group comparison. Theorem 2 proves Algorithm 1 is -differentially private by adding Laplace noise for privacy. Confidence intervals for survival function estimates are calculated in a \"point-wise\" fashion, ensuring differential privacy. The focus is on Greenwood's linear-point-wise confidence intervals. Theorem 3 states that confidence intervals for survival function estimates are -differentially private using Greenwood's linear-point-wise intervals. By utilizing Algorithm 1, the estimates become differentially private without additional privacy costs. This allows for hypothesis testing between groups, such as comparing infection rates in clinical trials. The Logrank test for hypothesis testing is made differentially private using Algorithm 6. The test statistic Z is made differentially private by replacing sensitive information with its private counterparts. This ensures privacy in comparing survival function estimates between groups. The Logrank test for hypothesis testing is made differentially private using Algorithm 6, ensuring privacy in comparing survival function estimates between groups. Competing events in clinical data require specialized estimates to avoid biased estimates, such as the competing risk cumulative incidence estimate. Using Algorithm 1, differential privacy can be extended to competing risk scenarios, ensuring that the competing risk cumulative incidence estimate is -differentially private. This method also allows for the privacy of associated statistics like confidence intervals, hazard function, and hazard ratios. The method extends differential privacy to competing risk scenarios, ensuring privacy of statistics like confidence intervals, hazard function, and hazard ratios. The differentially private version of the Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard is also obtained. Empirical evaluation on nine clinical datasets shows the effectiveness of the proposed method. Further details are provided in the Appendix. Comparisons are made with the non-private version to establish an upper bound. The evaluation of the differentially private survival function and its extensions is presented, showing good utility with little loss in estimation accuracy. The results on nine real-life datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the non-private version. The differentially private survival function estimation shows good utility with little loss in accuracy, deteriorating with increased privacy budget. Small datasets perform worse than larger ones, with the method providing good results for moderate to medium-sized datasets. The estimation's utility decreases with smaller dataset sizes due to the need for larger noise to protect privacy. Median survival time and confidence intervals are important estimates associated with the survival function. Our differentially private estimation provides good results for moderate to medium-sized datasets, even in the high privacy regime. The median survival time and its confidence intervals are important estimates reported with the survival function. Our method estimates the median with high precision, especially for larger datasets. In some cases, upper bounds on confidence intervals cannot be estimated due to high survival rates. Our estimation performs comparably to the original non-noisy estimation, even in the high privacy regime. Our differentially private estimation performs well even in the high privacy regime, with results comparable to the original non-noisy estimation. The test statistic follows a \u03c72 distribution with one degree of freedom, and none of the private estimates change the statistical significance threshold. The method also provides accurate estimation for cumulative incidence with competing risk information, demonstrating good utility while protecting individual privacy. Many works have explored statistical modeling and differential privacy, proposing various methods for regression modeling and survival analysis. Differentially private generative models have also been developed but are not suitable for survival function estimation. A new method for differentially private estimation of the survival function has been introduced, showing promising results even in high privacy settings. The first method for differentially private estimation of survival function and other statistics like confidence intervals and test statistics has been presented. Extensive evaluation on real-life datasets, including cancer, Gehan, and kidney patient data, shows a good privacy-utility trade-off. The dataset includes information on recurrence times to infection for kidney patients using portable dialysis equipment, natural history of subjects with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, a trial in acute myeloid leukemia, survival in a randomized trial for ovarian cancer, and Stanford Heart Transplant data. Time is converted into months and groups compared include males and females, maintenance chemotherapy, treatment arms, different treatment groups, and age groups. The dataset contains information on different treatment groups for Stanford Heart Transplant data and a randomized trial for lung cancer. Two datasets are used for empirical evaluation in a competing risk scenario, one from a clinical trial for primary biliary cirrhosis of the liver and the other on liver transplant waiting list subjects from 1990-1999. The event of interest is liver transplant, with death as a competing event. The study focuses on differentially private estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence in liver transplant patients. The results show that the method provides strong privacy guarantees while accurately estimating the cumulative incidence function. The algorithm used is proven to be -differentially private. The method accurately estimates competing risk cumulative incidence with strong privacy guarantees, using differential privacy."
