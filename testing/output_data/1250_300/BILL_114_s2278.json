The \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" defines key terms including \"appropriate committees of Congress,\" \"Assistant Secretary,\" \"Commission,\" \"Federal entity,\" \"Spectrum Relocation Fund,\" and \"unlicensed operations.\" The \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" defines \"unlicensed operations\" as the nonexclusive use of spectrum without protection from interference under specific regulations. The \"Promoting Unlicensed Spectrum Act of 2015\" defines \"unlicensed operations\" as the nonexclusive use of spectrum without protection from interference under specific regulations. Federal Communications Commission allocation and allotment of spectrum is addressed in Section 3. The Commission must ensure a balance between exclusive licensing through auctions and unlicensed operations in spectrum allocation. Within 18 months of the Act's enactment, rules must be established for future allocation, including the possibility of unlicensed operations in auctioned spectrum. These rules must be included in service rules for spectrum auctions and reflected in reports to Congress. The National Strategy for Unlicensed Spectrum is outlined in Section 4 of the Act, which aims to establish rules for future spectrum allocation, including the potential for unlicensed operations in auctioned spectrum. The policy of the United States is to maximize spectrum utility, promote innovation in wireless broadband, and ensure a balanced spectrum policy for licensed and unlicensed technologies. The Commission must develop a national strategy within a year to make additional radio frequency bands available for unlicensed operations, including clearing bands for unlicensed devices and considering spectrum sharing rules. The Commission is considering a balanced approach to provide consumers access to low-, mid-, and high-band radio frequency spectrum for unlicensed operations. This includes exploring spectrum sharing rules to expand opportunities for unlicensed operations and improve spectrum utilization. Additionally, they are examining ways to improve accuracy in spectrum allocation. The Commission is exploring ways to expand opportunities for unlicensed operations in spectrum bands and improve spectrum utilization. They are also examining ways to enhance the accuracy and efficacy of databases and access systems for spectrum sharing. Additionally, they are considering harmonizing additional bands for unlicensed operations to achieve greater economies of scale. A report describing the strategy developed must be submitted to Congress within one year of the enactment of the Act. The Commission will make the report publicly available on its website when submitting recommendations for legislative change. SEC. 5. MAKING FEDERAL SPECTRUM AVAILABLE FOR UNLICENSED OPERATION. The Assistant Secretary, along with the Commission and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, must submit a report to Congress within 270 days on designating additional radio frequency bands for unlicensed operations by Federal entities without causing interference. Recommendations include reforming the Spectrum Relocation Fund and ensuring its solvency if used to cover costs related to sharing bands with unlicensed technologies. Consideration is given to permitting unlicensed operations in spectrum bands used by Federal entities without interference. The report to Congress will address the possibility of permitting unlicensed operations in spectrum bands used by Federal entities without causing harmful interference, including impacts on homeland security or national security communications. It will also explore other spectrum sharing techniques to facilitate access by radio technologies conducting unlicensed operations to Federal spectrum."
