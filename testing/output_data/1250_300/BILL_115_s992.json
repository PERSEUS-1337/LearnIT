    "content": "The Act titled \"Veteran Overmedication Prevention Act of 2017\" mandates an independent review by the Department of Veterans Affairs of certain veteran suicides. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must seek an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences to review all covered veterans' suicides in the past five years, including violent and accidental deaths. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must seek an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences to review covered veterans' deaths in the past five years, including violent and accidental deaths, along with detailed information on the deceased veterans such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as a list of prescribed medications and substances found in toxicology reports. The summary includes medical diagnoses leading to prescribing medications for post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, and anxiety/depressive disorders in covered veterans. It also covers instances of veterans concurrently on multiple medications for these conditions and the number of veterans not taking any medications. The summary covers the treatment of covered veterans for post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, and anxiety/depressive disorders.

The curr_chunk discusses the Department's guidelines for treating covered veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, and anxiety/depressive disorders. It includes information on the use of non-medication first-line treatments and the prescribing of medications when these treatments are ineffective. Additionally, it mentions how the Department determines and updates clinical practice guidelines for medication prescribing and the analysis of pain score measurement protocols at medical facilities. The curr_chunk discusses the Department's analysis of pain score measurement protocols at medical facilities and efforts to maintain appropriate staffing levels for mental health professionals. It includes evaluating the relationship between pain score measurements and the number of veterans on multiple medications. The curr_chunk focuses on addressing impediments to education, training, and hiring of mental health counselors and marriage and family therapists in the Department. It also outlines strategies for increasing their representation in the behavioral health workforce, including reviewing eligibility criteria and comparing them to other professions in the Department. The curr_chunk assesses the participation of counselors and therapists in the mental health professionals trainee program, development of hiring guidelines, identification of gaps in the supply of mental health professionals, and determination of staffing ratios in the Department.

The curr_chunk discusses the percentage of covered veterans with combat experience, identification of medical facilities with high prescription and suicide rates, and analysis of Department programs collaborating with Medicaid agencies and CMS by State. An analysis by State of Department programs collaborating with Medicaid agencies and CMS includes sharing prescription and behavioral health data for veterans, checking with State prescription drug monitoring programs before prescribing medications, coordinating with external prescribers to prevent overprescribing, and taking action when a veteran is overprescribed. The Department collaborates with medical centers and local jurisdictions to determine veteran mortality and cause of death. They also identify best practices for sharing veteran death certificate data and assess patterns in data reported by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Recommendations for further action are provided based on the review conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine assess patterns and provide recommendations for improving veterans' safety and well-being. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs compiles data in a way that allows for analysis across all fields to inform clinical practice guidelines. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will compile data on covered veterans, disaggregated by year. They will complete a review and submit a report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs within 180 days. The Secretary will then report the results to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives within 30 days.
