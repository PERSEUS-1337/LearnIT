    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013\". Congress finds that a significant amount of energy is wasted in the United States, with a large portion being released as waste heat from power plants and other facilities. This waste heat can be recovered and used for various purposes such as heating buildings, cooling systems, or generating electricity. Additionally, utilizing local renewable energy resources can help meet energy needs and improve the reliability and resiliency of energy supplies in the country. District energy systems are crucial for tapping waste heat and renewable energy resources, enhancing industrial competitiveness, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, increasing energy supply resiliency, and keeping energy dollars in local economies to create jobs. They also provide infrastructure for implementing combined heat and power systems. District energy systems play a vital role in utilizing waste heat and renewable energy sources, serving various institutions and areas, reducing peak power demand, and addressing power transmission constraints through thermal storage and CHP systems. The evaluation and implementation of district energy systems involve technical, economic, legal, and institutional complexities. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy resiliency, reduce air pollution, strengthen competitiveness, and keep energy dollars in local economies. Lack of funding is a major barrier to utilizing local waste heat and renewable energy resources. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy resiliency, reduce air pollution, strengthen competitiveness, and keep energy dollars in local economies. It also aims to facilitate the implementation of local energy infrastructure through technical assistance and low-cost financing. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy resiliency, reduce air pollution, strengthen competitiveness, and keep energy dollars in local economies. It also aims to facilitate the implementation of local energy infrastructure through technical assistance and low-cost financing. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines terms related to energy systems, including combined heat and power system, district energy system, Loan Guarantee Program, and local energy infrastructure. These definitions aim to promote the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy, reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy resiliency, and facilitate the implementation of local energy infrastructure. The program established under section 5 defines terms related to local energy infrastructure and microgrids. Local energy infrastructure includes systems that recover energy from waste or renewable resources, generate electricity using combined heat and power, distribute electricity in microgrids, store thermal energy, and distribute thermal energy via district energy systems. A microgrid is a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources that can operate independently or connect to the main grid. The term \"renewable energy resource\" includes biomass, geothermal energy, municipal solid waste, and solar energy. \"Renewable thermal energy\" refers to heating or cooling energy from renewable sources. The term \"renewable thermal energy\" includes heating or cooling energy from renewable sources such as natural cooling sources or other renewable thermal energy sources as determined by the Secretary of Energy. The term \"thermal energy\" refers to heating energy in the form of hot water or steam for space heating, domestic hot water, or process heat, and cooling energy in the form of chilled water, ice, or other media for air conditioning or process cooling. \"Waste energy\" is energy contained in exhaust gases, exhaust steam, or condenser. The term \"waste energy\" refers to energy contained in various sources like exhaust gases, hot liquids, or waste gas from industrial processes that would otherwise be wasted. This energy is not being utilized in existing facilities. The term \"waste energy\" refers to energy from sources like exhaust gases or hot liquids that would otherwise be wasted. It is not being utilized in existing facilities or conventionally used in new ones. The technical assistance program is outlined in Section 4. The Secretary will establish a program to provide technical assistance for identifying, evaluating, planning, and designing local energy infrastructure. Assistance will include waste energy and renewable energy opportunities, technical and economic assessments, utility interconnection, contract negotiations, permitting, marketing, business planning, and engineering design. The program established by the Secretary provides technical assistance for identifying, evaluating, planning, and designing local energy infrastructure. Eligible entities, both nonprofit and for-profit, can receive grants to cover costs such as initial assessments and feasibility studies for local energy opportunities. The information dissemination includes case studies and computer software for infrastructure assessment and design. The program offers technical assistance for identifying, evaluating, planning, and designing local energy infrastructure. Eligible entities can receive grants to cover costs such as initial assessments, feasibility studies, guidance on overcoming barriers, and detailed engineering. Applications for technical assistance must be submitted to the Secretary following specific guidelines. The Secretary seeks applications for technical assistance on a competitive and periodic basis, prioritizing projects that maximize fossil fuel elimination, enhance energy reliability, minimize environmental impact, promote renewable energy, boost industrial competitiveness, and create local jobs. Rules and procedures must be adopted within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will adopt rules and procedures within 180 days of the Act's enactment for a program prioritizing fossil fuel elimination, energy reliability, environmental impact reduction, renewable energy promotion, industrial competitiveness, and local job creation. $150,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 for this program. SEC. 5. LOAN GUARANTEES FOR LOCAL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. This section introduces the Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program, introduced under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, allows the Secretary to provide loan guarantees for commercial or innovative projects defined as 'local energy infrastructure'. The Secretary must reserve $4 billion of loan guarantee authority for this program and utilize unobligated funds from section 1703 for loan guarantees. The definition of investment area under the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994 is amended to include the potential for implementation of local energy infrastructure as defined in the Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013."
