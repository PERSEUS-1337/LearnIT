    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Missing Mercury in Manufacturing Monitoring and Mitigation Act\". Congress recognizes the highly toxic nature of mercury and its compounds to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife. It acknowledges the risks posed to pregnant women and unborn babies from mercury exposure, primarily through contaminated fish consumption. The long-term solution to mercury pollution involves minimizing global mercury use and releases to reduce environmental contamination levels. Mercury pollution from sources like mercury cell chlor-alkali plants is a transboundary issue. Mercury pollution from mercury cell chlor-alkali plants is a transboundary issue, affecting bodies of water globally. In the United States, only 8 out of 30 chlorine plants use the obsolete mercury cell process, with cost-effective alternatives available for the remaining 90 percent of production. The chlor-alkali industry acknowledges that mercury contamination can occur in products manufactured at mercury cell facilities, leading to direct and indirect mercury release. Despite this, neither the industry nor the EPA can accurately track the disposition of mercury used at these facilities or estimate current mercury emissions. It is crucial for the United States to address this issue. The United States must work aggressively to minimize mercury supply, demand, and releases domestically and internationally, as accurate tracking of mercury disposition and emissions is lacking in the chlor-alkali industry. Congress declares the need to develop policies to reduce mercury use and emissions in the United States, including reducing exposures to mercury for women of childbearing age and young children. Additionally, there is a focus on reducing mercury use in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. The manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States starting January 1, 2012. Owners of chlor-alkali facilities must report mercury-containing hazardous waste generated annually to the Administrator and the State. The report identifies types and quantities of mercury-containing hazardous waste and nonhazardous solid waste generated by the chlor-alkali facility, the mercury content of the wastes, how each waste was managed, volume of mercury released into the air or water, and estimated accumulation of mercury in pipes and plant equipment. The report details the types and quantities of mercury-containing waste generated by the chlor-alkali facility, methods of accumulation, and the forms of mercury in products. The Administrator may allow combining this report with others to avoid duplication. For facilities ceasing operations after July 1, 2008, a comprehensive mercury inventory must be conducted within a year of closure. After a chlor-alkali facility ceases operations, the Administrator, in consultation with the State, conducts a comprehensive mercury inventory covering the facility's life and closure. This includes tracking mercury purchases, remaining mercury in equipment, estimated mercury in waste generated, and aggregate mercury releases. The Administrator obtains mercury purchase records for this inventory. The Administrator conducts a comprehensive mercury inventory of chlor-alkali facilities post-closure, tracking purchases, remaining mercury, waste generation, and aggregate releases into the environment. An advisory committee, the Mercury Storage Advisory Committee, is established with 9 members appointed jointly by congressional leaders. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee consists of 9 members appointed jointly by congressional leaders, including representatives from the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the majority leader of the Senate, the Administrator, the Secretary of Defense, State environmental agencies, State attorneys general, and the chlorine industry. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee is composed of 9 members appointed by congressional leaders and includes representatives from State environmental agencies, State attorneys general, the chlorine industry, the mercury waste treatment industry, and a nonprofit environmental organization. The Administrator appoints members within 45 days of enactment, with the Committee holding its initial meeting within 30 days of all appointments. Meetings are called by the Chairperson, with a majority of members constituting a quorum. The Committee will hold its initial meeting and subsequent meetings as called by the Chairperson. A majority of members will constitute a quorum. Within 1 year of enactment, a report will be submitted to Congress detailing environmental, health, and safety requirements to prevent mercury release and worker exposure, along with the cost of storing mercury and optimal characteristics of Federal facilities. The report to Congress will include details on storing elemental mercury, the estimated quantities from various sources, and the need for storage to comply with export prohibitions. The report to Congress will cover storing elemental mercury from recycling unwanted products and other wastes, addressing barriers to private sector storage, advantages of consolidating storage, optimal storage plans, and additional research needed for long-term disposal options. The Committee will address excess mercury from public and private sources and conduct additional research for long-term disposal options. Members will be compensated based on their status as federal or non-federal employees. The Committee members, whether federal employees or not, will serve without additional compensation. They will be reimbursed for travel expenses while performing Committee duties. The Administrator will provide necessary funding and personnel for the Committee to function. The Committee will terminate after 180 days. The Committee will receive funding and personnel to carry out its duties and will terminate 180 days after submitting its report. Regulations for transferring and storing mercury from closed chlor-alkali facilities must be established by July 1, 2008. Elemental mercury from closed facilities must be transferred to a storage facility by that date. A health assessment must be completed by July 1, 2009. The Administrator will conduct a health assessment of employees at chlor-alkali facilities still operating by July 1, 2009. Additional regulations may be promulgated as necessary to implement this section. Use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing."
