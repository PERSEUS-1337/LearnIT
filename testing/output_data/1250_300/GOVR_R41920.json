    "content": "Both House and Senate bills for the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 address detainee issues at Guantanamo Bay and counterterrorism measures. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, incorporating provisions from S. 1253. Differences between the House and Senate versions will be resolved in conference. The White House has criticized aspects of both bills and threatened a veto. The House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 address detainee issues at Guantanamo Bay and counterterrorism measures. The White House has criticized aspects of both bills and threatened a veto if they challenge the President's intelligence collection and detainee transfer authorities. The bills aim to confirm or expand the detention authority granted to the President after 9/11. The detainee provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 aim to confirm or expand the detention authority granted to the President after 9/11, allowing for preventive detention of individuals captured during U.S. operations to prevent future acts of terrorism. Some have been tried in military commissions or civilian courts for terrorism-related crimes. The Supreme Court has recognized preventive detention as a necessary incident to the Authorization for Use of Military Force. In 2004, the Supreme Court ruled in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld that the President can detain enemy combatants captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens, for the duration of hostilities. The D.C. Circuit has generally supported the government's detention authority under the AUMF, especially in cases involving Guantanamo detainees challenging their detention. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has been favorable to the government's position on detention authority under the AUMF. It is uncertain if the Supreme Court will review these rulings and endorse or reject them. Congress has not passed any laws to clarify detention authority under the AUMF, but the D.C. Circuit has looked to post-AUMF legislation for guidance. In 2010, the circuit court determined that the government could detain individuals associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban under the AUMF. Persons subject to military commissions under the Military Commissions Acts of 2006 and 2009 are those associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, including supporters in hostilities against U.S. Coalition partners. Most detainees under the AUMF are combatants from Afghanistan or other locations, with many held at Guantanamo Bay or Parwan, Afghanistan. Future captures outside Afghanistan are handled ad hoc, and individuals suspected of terrorist activity in the U.S. are also detained. The current practice for handling future captures outside of Afghanistan is ad hoc. Persons suspected of terrorist activity in the U.S. are usually prosecuted in federal court instead of being placed in military detention under the AUMF. There have been instances where individuals were initially transferred to military custody as \"enemy combatants\" but were eventually returned to civil authorities for trial in federal court. There is controversy over how to handle suspected terrorists in U.S. custody, with debates on whether they should be held in military custody or transferred to civilian law enforcement for trial. Some argue for executive discretion in deciding the best approach for each case. The debate over handling suspected terrorists in U.S. custody continues, with disagreements on whether military or traditional law enforcement methods should be used exclusively. Congress passed funding restrictions to prevent Guantanamo detainees from being transferred to the U.S. for trial in civilian courts, leaving the decision to executive discretion based on individual cases. The prohibition on transferring Guantanamo detainees to the United States has been extended through FY2012, limiting options for prosecuting detainees. Attention has been focused on the handling of terrorist suspects, such as the case of Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, who was brought to the U.S. for trial in a civilian court after being detained on a naval vessel for interrogation. Controversy surrounds whether suspects should be held in military or civilian custody. The handling of terrorist suspects like Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame has sparked controversy over whether they should be held in military or civilian custody. The 2012 NDAA is expected to address the disposition of persons apprehended in the conflict with Al Qaeda, with provisions in H.R. 1540 defining the conflict's scope and imposing restrictions on detainee transfers. H.R. 1540, passed by the House of Representatives, reaffirms the conflict with Al Qaeda and imposes restrictions on detainee transfers. The White House criticized provisions on detainee matters and threatened to veto the bill. S. 1253 from the Senate Armed Services Committee authorizes detention of certain persons and requires military detention for some. S. 1253, reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee, authorized detention of certain persons and required military detention for some. After objections from the White House and Senate committees, a revised version, S. 1867, was reported with updated detainee provisions. The Department of Defense and White House opposed the revised provisions, threatening to veto any bill challenging the President's authorities. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, with an amendment for clarification. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, with an amendment clarifying detainee provisions. The White House reiterated its veto threat for any bill challenging the President's authorities. The House and Senate versions of the FY2012 NDAA will be reconciled in conference to address detainee matters. The current status of U.S. policies and legal authorities regarding detention under the AUMF and initial status determinations is discussed. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, with an amendment clarifying detainee provisions. The White House reiterated its veto threat for any bill challenging the President's authorities. The House and Senate versions of the FY2012 NDAA will be reconciled in conference to address detainee matters. The current status of U.S. policies and legal authorities regarding detention under the AUMF and initial status determinations is discussed. The first section of the FY2012 NDAA addresses the scope of detention authority under the AUMF as viewed by the Administration and developed in court cases. It discusses current practice regarding initial status determinations and periodic reviews of detainee cases, as well as recidivism concerns underlying restrictions on transferring detainees from Guantanamo. The AUMF is the primary legal basis for detaining persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda and affiliated entities, but the scope of detention authority it confers is subject to differing interpretations. The Obama Administration framed its detention authority under the AUMF in a court brief as the authority to detain persons involved in the 9/11 attacks or who supported Taliban or al-Qaida forces. The President has the authority to detain individuals involved in the 9/11 attacks, supported Taliban or al-Qaida forces, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the US. Questions arise regarding the breadth of \"associated forces\" and the criteria for \"substantial support\" under the AUMF. The Supreme Court's interpretation in Hamdi referenced law of war principles, leading to debates on indefinite detention based on support to belligerent forces. The AUMF grants detention authority based on law of war principles, with debates on indefinite detention for supporting belligerent forces. The government has not clarified the criteria for \"substantial support\" or \"associated forces,\" similar to the Bush Administration's definition of \"enemy combatant.\" Recent court decisions have focused on detainee ties to Al Qaeda or the Taliban. Recent court decisions have not provided clarity on the \"substantial support\" requirement for detention eligibility, focusing on detainee affiliation with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces. The AUMF grants authority to detain individuals linked to groups involved in international terrorism to prevent future attacks against the United States. The AUMF grants the United States authority to detain individuals affiliated with groups like Al Qaeda or the Taliban to prevent future acts of international terrorism. Recent court decisions have focused on detainee affiliation with these groups and associated forces, with criteria including engagement in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. The court did not find that the government's evidence supported the second and third prongs of detainee affiliation with associated forces like Al Qaeda or the Taliban. The government argued that ETIM is covered by the AUMF due to its close association with these groups, but the court noted that this would require a closer operational nexus in the current armed conflict. The court did not find sufficient evidence to establish ETIM as an \"associated force\" of Al Qaeda under the government's definition. The term \"associated forces\" has only been interpreted to cover armed groups assisting Al Qaeda or the Taliban in Afghanistan in habeas cases. For example, \"Zubayda's militia\" and Hezb\u2013i\u2013Islami Gulbuddin (\"HIG\") have been considered \"associated forces.\" The AUMF has been applied to groups like \"Zubayda's militia\" and Hezb\u2013i\u2013Islami Gulbuddin (\"HIG\") as \"associated forces.\" There is uncertainty about extending detention authority to persons captured outside Afghanistan, especially U.S. citizens or those with ties to the U.S. The AUMF's detention authority applies to individuals captured outside of Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens or those with significant ties to the United States. The U.S. Court of Appeals has interpreted the AUMF to allow the detention of individuals affiliated with Al Qaeda, even if captured outside the U.S. The Fourth Circuit upheld the military detention of a U.S. citizen and resident alien captured in the U.S. as enemy combatants, who were later transferred for criminal prosecution before the Supreme Court could review the cases. The AUMF's detention authority extends to individuals captured in the United States as enemy combatants, who are transferred to civilian law enforcement for prosecution before Supreme Court review. The establishment of Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs) at Guantanamo determined the status of detainees, with 539 confirmed as enemy combatants between 2004 and 2009. The CSRTs confirmed the status of 539 enemy combatants between 2004 and 2009. The process has been largely defunct since 2007, but new detainees at Guantanamo would go before a CSRT. Non-citizen detainees in Afghanistan have fewer procedural rights. Guantanamo detainees can challenge their detention in federal court, but this privilege does not extend to detainees in Afghanistan. President Obama issued executive orders shortly after taking office. President Obama issued executive orders to study Guantanamo detention facility issues and U.S. detention policy. New review systems were implemented for detainees at Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan. Executive Order 13567 established a process for periodic review of continued detention of persons. President Obama issued Executive Order 13567 on March 7, 2011, establishing a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess the continued detention of Guantanamo detainees. The PRB determines if detention is necessary to protect against a significant threat to the US security. If not warranted, efforts are made to transfer detainees outside the US. The Executive Order establishes a Periodic Review Board (PRB) to assess the continued detention of Guantanamo detainees. The PRB determines if detention is necessary to protect against a significant threat to US security. Detainees may challenge their detention and present evidence on their behalf. The process is discretionary and does not create additional detention authority. Congress has placed limits on detainee transfers due to concerns about potential terrorist activity post-release. Detainees released from Guantanamo have engaged in terrorist activities post-release, leading to debates on the significance of such activities and the fairness of long-term detention without trial. In 2007, the Pentagon reported that 30 former detainees had participated in militant activities or anti-U.S. propaganda. Congress has imposed limits on detainee transfers to address concerns about potential terrorist activity after release. The Pentagon reported in 2007 that 30 former Guantanamo detainees engaged in militant activities or anti-U.S. propaganda post-release. Researchers at Seton Hall University challenged the data, noting discrepancies and lack of identifying information for verification. They argued that post-release terrorist conduct could be due to radicalization during internment, not necessarily recidivism. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) reported in 2008 that 36 ex-Guantanamo detainees were confirmed or suspected of returning to terrorism. In 2009, the Pentagon stated that 74 out of 534 transferred prisoners were believed to have engaged in terrorism or militant activity. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 required the Director of National Intelligence to release a report on recidivism rates of Guantanamo detainees, which revealed that out of 598 transferred detainees, some had engaged in terrorist activities post-release. The report released in December 2010 assessed the likelihood of Guantanamo detainees engaging in terrorism post-transfer. Out of 598 transferred detainees, 81 were confirmed and 69 suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities. Of the 150 recidivist detainees, 13 are dead, 54 in custody, and 83 remain at large. Since Executive Order 13492, 66 detainees were transferred, with 2 confirmed and 3 suspected of terrorist activities. The accuracy of these numbers has been challenged, with estimates suggesting a lower threat level of around 6%. The New America Foundation analyzed Pentagon reports and estimated that around 6% of released Guantanamo detainees posed a threat. The discrepancy between the DNI's report and publicly available sources remains unclear. The House of Representatives passed subtitle D of H.R. 1540 on May 26, 2011, defining \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" as non-U.S. citizens or non-U.S. Armed Forces members in Department of Defense custody. The provision in H.R. 1540 defines an \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" as a non-U.S. citizen or non-U.S. Armed Forces member in Department of Defense custody, including detainees held despite not being enemy belligerents. The term \"effective control\" of the Department of Defense may cover situations where detainees are supervised by DOD but technically in the custody of another agency. This broad definition includes foreign nationals brought to Guantanamo for reasons unrelated to hostilities. The term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" is broadly defined to include foreign nationals brought to Guantanamo for reasons unrelated to hostilities. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 allows guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions, amending the Military Commissions Act of 2009 to permit the death penalty in such cases. Section 1033 of H.R. 1540 amends the Military Commissions Act to allow the death penalty in cases where the accused has pled guilty, with unanimous approval from military commission panel members. Section 1034 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda and grants the President authority to detain captured belligerents. The President is authorized to use necessary force in armed conflict with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces. The authority includes detaining belligerents until hostilities end. This provision in H.R. 1540 is controversial, with supporters arguing it confirms the ongoing armed conflict since the 2001 AUMF. The controversial provision in H.R. 1540 regarding the termination of hostilities has sparked debate. Supporters argue it confirms the ongoing armed conflict since the 2001 AUMF, while opponents fear it could expand the conflict to cover any new terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda. Concerns about the breadth of the language and the apparent removal of limits on identifying parties to the armed conflict are key points of contention. The controversial provision in H.R. 1540 regarding the termination of hostilities has sparked debate. Some argue it confirms the ongoing armed conflict since the 2001 AUMF, while others fear it could expand the conflict to cover any new terrorist group associated with Al Qaeda. Concerns about the breadth of the language and the removal of limits on identifying parties to the armed conflict are key points of contention. Additionally, Section 1034 of the AUMF appears to broaden the scope of belligerent parties beyond Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces. The controversial provision in H.R. 1540 raises concerns about the broad scope of belligerent parties in the ongoing armed conflict since the 2001 AUMF. Section 1034 could potentially expand targeting decisions beyond Al Qaeda and affiliated groups, although the legislative history suggests it aims to reaffirm the current interpretation of the AUMF in detainee cases. The House Armed Services Committee supports the Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force to address the evolving threat posed by Al Qaeda and affiliated groups. This affirmation does not limit the President's existing authority under the AUMF. The Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force, as described in a 2009 filing, aligns with Congress's authorities. The term \"associated forces\" may not expand the use of force beyond what is already permitted under the AUMF. Congress's codification of the language could supersede the AUMF's interpretation, leading courts to apply a plain-text interpretation of \"associated.\" The language in paragraph (3) echoes the criteria used by Combatant Status Review Tribunals at Guantanamo for detaining individuals associated with Taliban or al Qaida forces. This includes those who have committed belligerent acts or supported hostilities against the US. The White House opposes section 1034, stating it would redefine the scope of the conflict. The White House strongly objects to section 1034, arguing that it would redefine the scope of the conflict and create confusion. Section 1036 requires a review process for Guantanamo detainees, with differences from previous procedures. The initial review panel consists of military officers, stricter criteria for detention assessment, and limited assistance from private counsel. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report as per Section 1036. The review process for Guantanamo detainees under Section 1036 includes detailed criteria for detention assessment, limits on private counsel assistance, and periodic full reviews every three years. The process is conducted by a panel of military officers with expertise in operations, intelligence, and counterterrorism. A report must be submitted to Congress by the Secretary of Defense within 180 days. The review process for Guantanamo detainees under Section 1036 involves a panel of military officers with expertise in operations, intelligence, and counterterrorism. The detainee is entitled to be assisted by a \"military personal representative\" with the appropriate security clearance, who advocates on their behalf. The detainee can present a statement, introduce evidence, respond to questions, and call witnesses. They are provided with an unclassified summary of information considered by the panel and their representative receives a copy of the government's submission. Outside parties, including private counsel, may be authorized to participate in the process. The military panel may order a substitute for classified information if necessary for national security. Outside parties, including the detainee's private counsel, can provide written submissions with authorization. The panel reviews new information on the threat posed by the individual for a full review if warranted. Relevant information from military commission cases is required for assessing a detainee's internment. Factors considered include the likelihood of terrorist activity or ties to hostile organizations upon release. The military panel considers various factors when assessing detainees, such as the likelihood of resuming terrorist activity or reestablishing ties with hostile organizations. An interagency review board is responsible for reviewing the panel's recommendations for clear errors and can reject them by majority vote if necessary. The interagency review board reviews the military panel's recommendations for errors and can reject them by majority vote. If a detainee is recommended for release, the board identifies a suitable country for transfer based on various factors. The decision can be sent back for reevaluation or forwarded to the Secretary of Defense for approval. The interagency review board can reject recommendations made by the military panel under Section 1040 of the bill. The detainee does not have the right to seek redress in U.S. courts. The White House expressed concerns about Section 1036 potentially leading to a presidential veto due to its impact on the periodic review process. Section 1039 limits transfer or release into other countries. Section 1039 limits the transfer or release of non-citizen detainees held abroad in U.S. military custody into the United States, hindering the closure of the Guantanamo detention facility. Congress enacted funding measures to restrict executive discretion in transferring detainees into the country. The 2012 Minibus and Section 1039 of House-passed H.R. 1540 funding limitations prohibit the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose, including criminal prosecution. This has effectively made military commissions the only viable forum for the criminal prosecution of Guantanamo detainees until the end of FY2012. The funding restrictions in Section 1039 of House-passed H.R. 1540 for FY2012 cover a broader category of detainees than the 2012 Minibus. It prohibits the transfer or release of non-citizen detainees held by military authorities at foreign locations other than Guantanamo into the United States. These restrictions expire at the end of FY2012, but other provisions of H.R. 1540 apply beyond that, including a permanent bar on prosecuting enemy belligerents for terrorist offenses. The White House strongly opposes Section 1039 of House-passed H.R. 1540, which limits the transfer of detainees into the United States. The Obama Administration argues that this provision interferes with executive discretion to prosecute detainees in Article III courts. They believe it undermines national security efforts and challenges the Executive branch's authority. The Obama Administration opposes restrictions on transferring detainees into the US, arguing it hinders national security efforts and executive authority. Section 1037 of H.R. 1540 prohibits using funds to construct facilities for Guantanamo detainees in the US. Section 1040 limits funds for transferring detainees to foreign countries unless certain criteria are met. These restrictions do not apply if a court orders the transfer. Section 1040 imposes restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries or entities, except when ordered by a court. These restrictions aim to prevent detainees from engaging in terrorist activities upon release. No detainee has been transferred since the 2011 NDAA and CAA. Since the 2011 NDAA and CAA, no Guantanamo detainee has been transferred or released from U.S. custody. The Secretary of Defense must certify to Congress that the destination country meets certain criteria for a transfer to occur. The Secretary of Defense must certify that a country meets specific criteria for transferring a Guantanamo detainee, including preventing terrorism and sharing relevant information with the United States. This certification process is similar to the requirements established in the 2011 NDAA and CAA, with an additional requirement for the foreign entity to allow access to the transferred individual by U.S. authorities. Section 1040 prohibits funds from transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign governments if there is a confirmed case of terrorist activity post-transfer. The White House opposes these restrictions, stating they interfere with foreign policy decisions. Section 1035 mandates the Secretary of Defense to submit a national security protocol for Guantanamo detainees' communications within 90 days. Section 1035 mandates the Secretary of Defense to submit a detailed national security protocol for Guantanamo detainees' communications within 90 days of enactment. The protocol must outline limitations and privileges for detainee communication, including monitoring procedures for legal materials while preserving their privilege for legal proceedings. Additionally, Section 1038 prohibits DOD funds from allowing family visits to Guantanamo detainees, and Section 1043 restricts certain rights for detainees repatriated to specific countries. Section 1043 prohibits Guantanamo detainees repatriated to certain countries from receiving rights and benefits under the Compact of Free Association, potentially restricting their travel to the United States. This provision applies to detainees returned to Micronesia, Palau, or the Marshall Islands, but not to those resettled in these countries. It also requires consultation among key officials for detainee matters. Section 1042 requires consultation among key officials before prosecuting a non-citizen for an offense that could be tried by a military commission. The consultation involves deciding whether to prosecute in a U.S. district court or before a military commission, and whether the individual should be transferred to military custody for intelligence interviews. The White House opposes this provision, stating that it could hinder existing interagency coordination in terrorism-related prosecutions. Section 1046 mandates that foreign nationals involved in terrorism-related conduct must be tried by military commission. The provision lacks clarity on defining terms like \"terrorist attack,\" potentially causing confusion on its application to prospective attacks. The provision in Section 1046 mandates that foreign nationals involved in terrorism-related conduct must be tried by military commission. However, there is ambiguity in defining terms like \"terrorist attack,\" which could lead to confusion regarding its application to potential attacks. The military commission jurisdiction under Section 1042 requires establishing the offense is related to an attack that can be tried by military commission, and the accused is subject to its jurisdiction. The offense must be committed in the context of hostilities, meaning any conflict subject to the laws of war. The accused must be a non-US citizen and an unprivileged enemy belligerent for the military commission to have jurisdiction. The bill outlines criteria for determining an accused as an unprivileged enemy belligerent, excluding those who qualify as prisoners of war. Military commissions have jurisdiction to make these determinations, but Article III courts could also be involved. The provision applies to foreign nationals engaged in hostilities against the US or its partners, with implications for cases involving terrorism charges. The bill outlines criteria for determining an accused as an unprivileged enemy belligerent, excluding prisoners of war. It applies to foreign nationals engaged in hostilities against the US or its partners, potentially affecting cases involving terrorism charges. The provision may complicate extradition efforts and trials for those arrested. It does not require government action unless specified, but could face habeas challenges. The bill does not rule out trials in Article III courts for individuals. The bill outlines criteria for determining an accused as an unprivileged enemy belligerent, excluding prisoners of war. It applies to foreign nationals engaged in hostilities against the US or its partners, potentially affecting cases involving terrorism charges. The provision may complicate extradition efforts and trials for those arrested. It does not require government action unless specified, but could face habeas challenges. The bill does not outright preclude trials in Article III courts for the individuals it describes, nor does it require a military commission trial; it merely states that the individuals shall only be tried for certain offenses in military commissions. If \"offense\" is understood by reference to the statute defining its elements, the operation of the provision may be avoidable simply by framing the offense as one under a terrorism-related provision of title 18, U.S. Code rather than one that is subject to the jurisdiction of a military commission. This reading is supported by Section 1042, which appears to contemplate broader discretion among the executive branch officials over prosecutorial decisions than Section 1046 appears to permit. In the event a federal criminal offense is charged, however, a defendant could challenge the Article III court's jurisdiction based on the language of the provision. If the court were to agree and there is some impediment to trial before a military commission, for example, in a situation. Section 1032 extends the authority to provide rewards for information related to military operations against terrorism for two years, with a maximum of $5 million. Section 1041 requires the Secretary of Defense to provide quarterly briefings to congressional defense committees. Executive branch officials have criticized a provision that limits their discretion in choosing the prosecution forum for detainees. Section 1041 extends the authority for quarterly briefings to congressional defense committees on global Department of Defense counterterrorism operations, including legal issues and limitations. Section 1044 expresses Congress's approval of DOD anti-terrorism efforts. Section 1045 addresses the need for improved interagency strategic planning to deny safe havens to Al Qaeda and strengthen \"at-risk states,\" requiring the President to issue planning guidance and submit copies to Congress within 15 days. The President is required to review and update guidance documents, submitting copies to Congress within 15 days. Agencies must enter into a memorandum of understanding to carry out the guidance. Senate bill S. 1867 covers \"Detainee Matters\" and was passed with revisions addressing Administration concerns. The bill clarifies legal authority to detain persons captured in conflict with Al Qaeda without modifying existing authorities for detaining U.S. citizens or lawful residents. The Senate passed H.R. 1540 with provisions replaced by Senate-passed S. 1867, affirming the AUMF authority to detain \"covered persons\" as enemy belligerents. \"Covered persons\" are defined as those involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces in hostilities against the U.S. The Senate passed H.R. 1540 with provisions replaced by Senate-passed S. 1867, affirming the AUMF authority to detain \"covered persons\" as enemy belligerents. Section 1031 of Senate-passed S. 1867 defines \"covered persons\" as those involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces in hostilities against the U.S. The language in the earlier version of Section 1031 was objected to by the White House for potentially limiting detentions to those captured during military operations. The language in Section 1031 of Senate-passed S. 1867 allows for various options for dispositions under the law of war, including detention without trial, trial by military commission, transfer for trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign country. It does not clarify if U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens can be considered \"covered persons.\" The provision also states that nothing in Section 1031 is meant to limit or expand the President's authority or the scope of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force. S. 1867 allows for detention of individuals in the U.S. based on conduct within the country, without limiting the President's authority under the AUMF. The revised provision aims to reinforce the executive branch's detention authority, particularly for U.S. citizens. There was significant debate on the potential application of Section 1031 to U.S. citizens, with an amendment proposed to bar long-term military detention based on enemy belligerent status. The potential application of Section 1031 to U.S. citizens and others in the United States was debated. An amendment to prevent long-term military detention of U.S. citizens based on enemy belligerent status was rejected. A proviso was added to Section 1031 to clarify that existing laws relating to detention of U.S. citizens and resident aliens are not affected. Detentions of U.S. citizens and resident aliens have been rare and controversial, with no definitive resolution in the courts. The Supreme Court in Hamdi recognized that persons captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan could be militarily detained for the duration of hostilities, regardless of citizenship. Section 1031 does not clarify the circumstances for preventive military detention of U.S. citizens or residents captured in the U.S. The definitional standard for detention authority remains vague, potentially allowing for a broadening of the conflict scope. The revised provision in S. 1867 requires the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on how Section 1031 applies to \"covered persons,\" including \"associated forces\" and \"substantial support.\" The Administration has not objected to the language but cautions against unnecessary codification of existing authorities. Congress must avoid creating new legal questions that could distract from national security efforts. Future legislative action should ensure careful consideration of military detention authority. The current language in the provision of Section 1032 requires temporary military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces captured by the United States. It excludes U.S. citizens but applies to U.S. resident aliens, with limitations based on constitutional rights. The focus is on preventing unintended consequences that could compromise national security efforts. The provision of Section 1032 mandates temporary military custody for Al Qaeda members and associated forces captured by the United States, excluding U.S. citizens but applying to U.S. resident aliens. Detention is required for individuals involved in planning or carrying out attacks against the U.S. or its coalition partners, with options for military detention, trial before a military commission, or transfer to another country. Additional requirements must be met before transfer is allowed. Section 1032 of S. 1867 mandates temporary military custody for Al Qaeda members and associated forces captured by the United States, excluding U.S. citizens but applying to U.S. resident aliens. Detainees can be held in military detention until hostilities under the AUMF are terminated, tried before a military commission, transferred for trial by another court, or transferred to a foreign government if transfer requirements are met. The provision specifies that covered forces are those that act in coordination with or pursuant to the direction of al-Qaeda, without explicit reference to the Taliban unless their actions are sufficiently coordinated or directed by al-Qaeda. Section 1032 of S. 1867 mandates temporary military custody for Al Qaeda members and associated forces captured by the United States, excluding U.S. citizens but applying to U.S. resident aliens. The provision specifies that covered forces are those that act in coordination with or pursuant to the direction of al-Qaeda, without explicit reference to the Taliban unless their actions are sufficiently coordinated or directed by al-Qaeda. The interpretation of this section raises questions about the mandatory detention of individuals associated with Al Qaeda and the Taliban, depending on their level of coordination with Al Qaeda in planning attacks. It is clarified that Section 1032 would not apply to a \"lone wolf\" terrorist with no ties to Al Qaeda or any associated force. The provision in Section 1032 of S. 1867 mandates temporary military custody for Al Qaeda members and associated forces captured by the United States, excluding U.S. citizens but applying to U.S. resident aliens. The interpretation of what constitutes an \"attack against the United States coalition partners\" is unclear, as it could cover attacks in military theaters or terrorist acts against civilian targets. The reference to lawful resident aliens being detained based on conduct in the U.S. supports a broader interpretation of the term \"attack.\" The provision in S. 1867 mandates temporary military custody for Al Qaeda members and associated forces captured by the United States, excluding U.S. citizens but applying to U.S. resident aliens. The interpretation of what constitutes an \"attack against the United States\" is unclear, as it could cover attacks in military theaters or terrorist acts against civilian targets. S. 1867 includes a new requirement for the President to submit a report to Congress within 60 days of enactment, detailing procedures for implementing the provision. The procedures described include preventing interruption of ongoing surveillance or intelligence gathering for individuals not in US custody, ensuring determination process after interrogation, and allowing waiver authority for transfer from a third country. Interaction with procedures under Section 1036 is unclear. The bill does not specify a single process for determining if someone qualifies for mandatory military detention under the AUMF, potentially allowing for multiple procedures depending on custody status. Constitutional due process requirements would likely apply, especially for detainees in the US. The Obama Administration opposes Section 1032, which allows for mandatory military detention of covered persons. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta doubts its advantages for national security and criticizes its lack of clarity in scope and definition of \"associated force.\" The Obama Administration opposes Section 1032, criticizing its limitations on the President's authority to defend against terrorist threats. The White House objects to the extension of transfer certification requirements and doubts that revisions will address fundamental issues with the provision. The revised text of Section 1032 does not fix fundamental problems but directs the President to develop procedures to address issues. Section 1033 extends restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees and imposes criteria for such transfers. Section 1033 extends restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees, requiring certification from the Secretary of Defense before any transfer to a foreign country can occur. The destination country must not sponsor terrorism, must maintain control over the detainee, and take measures to prevent terrorism. The Secretary of Defense must certify before transferring Guantanamo detainees to a foreign country to prevent terrorism and ensure control over the detainee. The certification includes measures to avert threats to the United States and sharing relevant information with the U.S. authorities. Unlike previous bills, the Senate bill does not require access for U.S. authorities to the transferred individual. The Secretary of Defense must certify before transferring Guantanamo detainees to a foreign country to prevent terrorism and ensure control over the detainee. The certification includes measures to avert threats to the United States and sharing relevant information with the U.S. authorities. Section 1033 prohibits transfers from Guantanamo to any foreign country or entity if there is a confirmed case of a detainee engaging in terrorist activity after transfer. Waivers can be issued by the Secretary of Defense in consultation with other officials if alternative actions will address the risks effectively. The Secretary of Defense can issue a waiver for transferring Guantanamo detainees if alternative actions will mitigate the risk, and the transfer must be in the national security interests of the United States. The waiver must be submitted to congressional defense committees with an explanation of why all risks cannot be eliminated and a summary of the alternative actions planned. The transfer restrictions apply to any individual detained at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens or servicemembers. Transfer restrictions generally apply to individuals detained at Guantanamo, excluding U.S. citizens or servicemembers. The scope may cover foreign refugees at the Migrant Operations Center at Guantanamo. The White House and Department of Defense disapprove of the transfer restriction provisions in the 2012 NDAA. Section 1034 prohibits the use of DOD funds to construct or modify facilities in the U.S. or its territories for housing individuals. The Senate provision in Section 1034 imposes a prohibition on using DOD funds to construct or modify facilities in the US or its territories for housing Guantanamo Bay detainees without congressional authorization. The White House objects to this restriction, which is similar to previous years but not included in the Senate bill. The Senate bill in Section 1034 allows for the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to civilian law enforcement for criminal prosecution and does not prohibit the release of cleared detainees into the US. It only restricts transfers for continued military detention if new facilities are needed. Section 1035 clarifies aspects of detention reviews at Guantanamo without replacing the existing periodic review process. The Senate bill in Section 1035 clarifies procedures for review panels established under Executive Order 13567 at Guantanamo. It emphasizes that the purpose of periodic reviews is to assess if a detainee poses a threat to US security, not to review the legality of their detention. The Secretary of Defense has the final decision on detainee release or transfer, considering factors like the likelihood of terrorist activity resumption or rehabilitation support. The Administration objects to a provision in the Senate bill that shifts responsibility for detainee status determination to the Defense Department. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit a report within 90 days explaining procedures for determining detainee status under the AUMF. It is unclear whether this refers to determining if a detainee is a \"covered person\" under Section 1031 or their disposition under the law of war. The provision also outlines procedures for long-term detention of unprivileged enemy belligerents. The provision in the Senate bill outlines procedures for determining detainee status under the AUMF, including the appointment of a military judge and representation by military counsel for unprivileged enemy belligerents. This provision applies regardless of the detainee's location and may afford greater privileges to detainees held in Afghanistan compared to those at Guantanamo. The provision in the Senate bill outlines procedures for determining detainee status under the AUMF, including the appointment of a military judge and representation by military counsel for unprivileged enemy belligerents. It is unclear how this provision would impact detainees currently held at Guantanamo, especially regarding habeas challenges. The implications of Section 1036 may depend on whether it applies to all detainees in U.S. custody designated for long-term detention or only to those detained after the bill's enactment. The provision does not clarify how to determine a detainee's status before a hearing. The provision in the Senate bill outlines procedures for determining detainee status under the AUMF, including the appointment of a military judge and representation by military counsel for unprivileged enemy belligerents. It is unclear how this provision would impact detainees currently held at Guantanamo, especially regarding habeas challenges. The provision does not explain how to determine a detainee's status before a hearing, particularly in the case of new captures. \"Long-term detention\" could refer to enemy belligerents held for the duration of hostilities to prevent their return to combat, as allowed under Sections 1031 and 1032 of the bill. This raises questions about when the disposition determination should be made and whether a second status determination is required for those designated for long-term detention. Captured unprivileged enemy belligerents destined for trial or transfer would not be entitled to military counsel or a military judge at their status determination proceedings. The provision in the Senate bill outlines procedures for determining detainee status under the AUMF, including the appointment of a military judge and representation by military counsel for unprivileged enemy belligerents. It is unclear how this provision would impact detainees currently held at Guantanamo, especially regarding habeas challenges. The White House has expressed disapproval of this provision, claiming that it establishes \"onerous requirements [and] conflicts with procedures.\" Section 1037 of the MCA allows plea agreements in capital cases, similar to a provision in House-passed H.R. 1540. The White House opposes this, citing conflicts with established military review processes."
