    "title": "AB 2514",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 34171 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define terms related to administrative budget and administrative cost allowance for successor agencies. The administrative cost allowance is set at 5% of property tax allocated to the successor agency for a specific period, with a minimum amount specified unless reduced by oversight board or agreement with the successor agency. Starting July 1, 2016, the administrative cost allowance for successor agencies is up to 3% of property tax distributed by the county auditor-controller, with a minimum of $250,000 per fiscal year unless reduced by oversight board or agreement. Starting July 1, 2016, a successor agency's annual administrative costs cannot exceed 50% of the total Redevelopment Property Tax Trust Fund distributed to pay enforceable obligations in the previous fiscal year. This limit applies regardless of whether the costs are paid within the administrative cost allowance or not, but excludes costs paid from bond proceeds or grant funds. The administrative cost allowance is the sole funding source for legal expenses related to civil actions. Employee costs for project implementation activities are not considered administrative costs. \"Designated local authority\" refers to a public entity formed under Section 34173. An \"enforceable obligation\" includes specific criteria. The \"designated local authority\" is a public entity formed under Section 34173. An \"enforceable obligation\" includes bonds, loans, and payments required by the federal government or state law. Payments required by the federal government, preexisting obligations to the state, and obligations imposed by state law, including federal base reuse obligations for the former Norton Air Force Base as confirmed by agreements. Costs incurred for fulfilling collective bargaining agreements related to layoffs or terminations of city employees who worked directly for the former redevelopment agency are considered enforceable obligations payable from property tax funds. These obligations remain payable if the employee is transferred to the entity assuming the housing functions of the former agency. The successor agency must reimburse the housing entity for any employee-related costs. The oversight board, along with the successor agency, has the authority to appeal judgments or settlements against the former redevelopment agency. They can also terminate agreements or contracts with approval and provide compensation if needed. Titles or headings in documents do not determine enforceable obligations. Contracts or agreements necessary for the administration or operation of the successor agency, including litigation expenses, settlements, office space, equipment, supplies, and insurance costs, shall be paid out of the administrative cost allowance starting January 1, 2016. A sponsoring entity may provide funds to a successor agency for legal expenses related to civil actions. If the successor agency wins the case, the funds provided will be repaid as an enforceable obligation. If the successor agency loses, the funds will be considered a grant and not eligible for repayment. Repayments from amounts borrowed from the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund of a redevelopment agency must be approved by the oversight board and transferred to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund for affordable housing purposes. For the purpose of this part, an \"enforceable obligation\" excludes agreements between the city, county, or city and county that established the redevelopment agency and the former agency. Written agreements related to indebtedness obligations issued by December 31, 2010, or for refunding existing obligations by June 27, 2011, may be considered enforceable obligations. Loan agreements between the redevelopment agency and the creating entity within two years of agency creation may also be deemed enforceable obligations. Loan agreements entered into between the redevelopment agency and the creating entity within two years of agency creation may be enforceable obligations. Agreements related to state highway infrastructure improvements committed by the agency prior to June 28, 2011, are also considered enforceable obligations. Additionally, agreements requiring the former agency to repay or fulfill outstanding obligations imposed by a federal agency are enforceable obligations. Contracts or agreements between the former redevelopment agency and other public agencies outside of redevelopment project areas that were not properly authorized under Part 1 shall be void, except for housing-related contracts. \"Indebtedness obligations\" refer to bonds or other debt issued to finance redevelopment projects. An \"oversight board\" is established pursuant to Section 34179. The \"Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule\" outlines minimum payment amounts and due dates for enforceable obligations. A \"school entity\" is defined in the Revenue and Taxation Code. A \"successor agency\" replaces the former redevelopment agency. \"Taxing entities\" include cities, counties, special districts, and school entities receiving property tax payments. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to property taxes and redevelopment agencies, including taxing entities, property taxes, department, sponsoring entity, and final judicial determination. The curr_chunk defines a \"final judicial determination\" as a conclusive decision made by a state court or appellate jurisdiction. It also specifies the \"housing entity administrative cost allowance\" as an amount up to 1% of property tax allocated to the Redevelopment Obligation Retirement Fund from July 1, 2014, to July 1, 2018, with a minimum of $150,000 per fiscal year. If a local housing authority assumes housing functions from a former redevelopment agency, the housing entity administrative cost allowance must be listed on the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule and remitted on January 2 and July 1. If funds are insufficient, the unpaid amount can be carried over to subsequent schedules without a five-year limit."
