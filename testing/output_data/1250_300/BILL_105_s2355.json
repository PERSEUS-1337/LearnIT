The findings of Congress highlight the significance of truancy as a warning sign for youth at risk. Truancy is linked to high dropout rates, increased likelihood of welfare dependence and unemployment, and is a common characteristic among criminals. High rates of truancy are associated with daytime burglary and vandalism, with a significant portion of violent juvenile crimes occurring during school hours. Arrested children often have a history of truancy, with some cities reporting high levels of unexcused student absences. Truancy is a significant issue with high social and economic costs. Many students skip school, leading to high rates of unexcused absences. This behavior can result in lower educational attainment, increased crime rates, and a loss of earnings for the nation. Effective prevention and intervention programs are needed to improve school attendance and reduce crime. However, there is a lack of targeted funding for these programs in current law. \"Grants are provided to support prevention and intervention programs aimed at improving school attendance and reducing crime rates.\" In this section, definitions are provided for terms like \"eligible partnership,\" \"local educational agency,\" \"qualified unit of local government,\" and \"unit of local government.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding the requirements and criteria for partnerships applying for grants to support prevention and intervention programs in schools. The Prevention Act of 1974 allows for grants to eligible partnerships to reduce truancy and juvenile crime. Grants are awarded on a competitive basis, with a maximum amount of $100,000 per fiscal year. At least 25% of the grant must be allocated to the local educational agency. Grants can be renewed for up to 2 additional fiscal years. The Prevention Act of 1974 allows grants for eligible partnerships to address truancy and juvenile crime. Grants can be renewed for up to 2 additional fiscal years and must be used to comprehensively address truancy through various methods involving parental involvement, sanctions, accountability, in-school programs, and collaboration with local entities. The Prevention Act of 1974 allows grants for partnerships to address truancy and juvenile crime through various methods, including in-school programs, involvement of local entities, technology, and model programs like the Truancy Intervention Project of Fulton County, Georgia. The Prevention Act of 1974 allows grants for partnerships to address truancy and juvenile crime through various methods, including model programs like the Truancy Intervention Project of Fulton County, Georgia, and other programs such as the TABS program of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the Roswell Daytime Curfew Program of Roswell, New Mexico, and the Stop, Cite and Return Program of Rohnert Park, California, among others. The Prevention Act of 1974 allows grants for partnerships to address truancy and juvenile crime through various model programs like the Truancy Reduction Program of Bakersfield, California, the Grade Court program of Farmington, New Mexico, and other programs determined appropriate by the Attorney General. $25,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year 1999, 2000, and 2001 to carry out this section."
