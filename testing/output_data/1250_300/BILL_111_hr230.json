    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Housing Opportunity and Mortgage Equity Act of 2009\". It includes provisions for affordable refinancing mortgages and new mortgages. The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation are required to carry out a program to purchase and securitize qualified refinancing mortgages and new mortgages on single-family housing. The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency will establish policies and procedures for this program. Lenders can offer mortgages for purchase, and if they meet the requirements for qualified mortgages, the enterprises will commit to purchase them. The Director will also require enterprises to establish a procedure for approving lenders. The enterprise commits to purchasing qualified mortgages, including qualified refinancing mortgages and new mortgages on single-family housing. Lenders must receive advance commitments for the purchase of such mortgages. Qualified refinancing mortgages must meet specific requirements, including being on one- to four-family dwellings. The mortgage must be on a one- to four-family dwelling, including a condominium or cooperative ownership. The mortgagor must occupy the property as their principal residence. The loan amount must be used to pay off existing indebtedness on a first mortgage for the same property originated before January 1, 2008. The mortgage must have a fixed interest rate for the entire term. The mortgage must have a fixed interest rate not exceeding 4.0 percent annually for 30 to 40 years. Underwriting standards set by the Director must be met, and all prepayment penalties and fees related to default must be waived. The qualified new mortgage must meet specific requirements, including being used for purchasing the property, originating after the enactment of the Act, and conforming to underwriting standards. Enterprises are allowed to establish exceptions to underwriting standards, such as downpayment and credit rating requirements. Each enterprise can establish exceptions to underwriting standards to purchase and securitize qualified refinancing mortgages and new mortgages. Securities based on qualified mortgages can be issued in the form of debt obligations or trust certificates with maturities and interest rates determined by the enterprise with approval. Securities issued under this subsection by an enterprise must have approved maturities and interest rates. They are considered exempt securities similar to those guaranteed by the United States. Mortgages set aside for this purpose must always be sufficient to cover principal and interest payments on the securities. Each security issued must clearly indicate its nature. The Federal Reserve will establish a credit facility to provide credit to enterprises at interest rates comparable to Treasury securities. The requirement for enterprises to purchase mortgages will not apply to mortgages offered after December 31, 2010. Securities issued by enterprises under this subsection are not guaranteed by the United States and do not constitute a debt of the United States. SEC. 3.
