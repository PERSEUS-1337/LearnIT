    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Medicare and Medicaid Fraud Prevention and Control Act of 2009.\" It introduces enhanced program and provider protections in the Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs. The Act \"Medicare and Medicaid Fraud Prevention and Control Act of 2009\" introduces enhanced program and provider protections in the Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP programs, including authorization for the Secretary to impose requirements on providers or suppliers in response to significant risk of fraudulent activity. The Act \"Medicare and Medicaid Fraud Prevention and Control Act of 2009\" allows the Secretary to impose requirements on providers or suppliers under title XVIII, XIX, or XXI, including screening, enhanced oversight periods, enrollment moratoria, and periodic validations of authorizations. States may also be required to implement these provisions in their State plans under title XIX or the child health plan under title XXI. The Act allows the Secretary to impose requirements on providers or suppliers under title XVIII, XIX, or XXI, including screening procedures such as licensing board checks, exclusion list screenings, background checks, site visits, and heightened disclosure of affiliations. Actions taken under these provisions are not subject to judicial review. The Secretary can impose requirements on providers or suppliers under titles XVIII, XIX, or XXI, including background checks, site visits, and heightened disclosure of affiliations. Enhanced oversight procedures may include unannounced site visits, prepayment review, and enhanced claims review for a period of 30 to 365 days. Additional oversight may be extended if deemed necessary. The Secretary can impose enhanced oversight for suppliers of durable medical equipment if fraudulent activity is suspected, withholding payment for a specified period. Additionally, a program for periodic review of physician authorizations will be established. The Secretary will establish a program for oversight of excessive prescribing by healthcare professionals. Physicians will receive quarterly lists of claims based on their prescriptions, and must validate the legitimacy of these claims within 90 days. Failure to do so will result in claims being rejected. The Secretary may impose a moratorium on provider enrollment in certain cases of ongoing fraud within Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP programs to prevent adverse impacts on patient care access. This does not limit a State's authority in any way. The Secretary can impose a moratorium on provider enrollment to prevent fraud in Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP programs without impacting patient care access. States can still conduct provider screening activities. Additionally, a probationary period is established for new providers to undergo heightened review to validate their legitimacy. The Secretary can review claims to determine provider legitimacy and validate physician prescriptions. If a significant number of claims are found to be illegitimate, the Secretary may suspend or terminate the provider's participation. This suspension or termination follows the same procedures as an exclusion under section 1128. Failure to cooperate in prescription validation can result in consequences for physicians or professionals. The Secretary can impose a civil monetary penalty of up to $10,000 on physicians or professionals who fail to cooperate in prescription validation. Amendments are made to Prompt Pay Provisions regarding claims of providers or suppliers in cases of identified patterns.

The State is required to enforce determinations made by the Secretary regarding fraudulent activity by providers or suppliers and carry out necessary activities for program integrity. Amendments to Medicaid regulations aim to ensure compliance with these requirements. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must consult with the Inspector General to identify providers or services at risk of fraudulent activity under Medicare, Medicaid, or the State children's health insurance program. Additional funding may be appropriated for this purpose. The amendments made by this section will have an effective date for expedited implementation. The amendments made by this section will take effect upon the enactment of the Act, with regulations to be implemented within 6 months. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will promulgate regulations for providers and suppliers approved for participation after 6 months from the enactment date.
