The Court of Appeals affirmed, stating the city's actions were protected under Title VII. The Supreme Court granted review to consider the claims. The Supreme Court granted review to consider Title VII and equal protection claims, which prohibit two types of discrimination: disparate treatment and disparate impact. Employers can defend against disparate impact by showing job necessity, but plaintiffs can still succeed by proving the availability of less discriminatory alternatives. The Equal Protection Clause ensures equal protection under the law. The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits discriminatory government actions, requiring different levels of scrutiny for classifications based on race. Strict scrutiny is the most stringent form of review, requiring the government to show a compelling interest for any classification.
