    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fracturing Regulations are Effective in State Hands Act\". Congress acknowledges the long history and effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing in the US, with over 1,000,000 wells in operation for over 60 years. Reports from the Ground Water Protection Council and the EPA confirm that current state regulations are proactive in protecting water resources, with no evidence of drinking water contamination from hydraulic fracturing. The EPA and other reports have found no evidence of drinking water contamination from hydraulic fracturing, with state regulations being proactive in protecting water resources. Activities related to hydraulic fracturing are regulated at the Federal level under various environmental statutes, including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Clean Air Act. EPA and other reports have not found evidence of drinking water contamination from hydraulic fracturing. In 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced plans for new Federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing on Federal land. A 2012 study by the Energy Institute at the University of Texas found no evidence of chemicals from hydraulic fracturing fluid in aquifers. In 2014, the Ground Water Protection Council released information on hydraulic fracturing. The Ground Water Protection Council and State Oil and Gas Regulatory Exchange released a report in 2014 stating that no evidence of chemicals from hydraulic fracturing fluid has been found in aquifers as a result of fracturing operations. The report also highlighted the improvements in groundwater protection laws and regulations in states over the past five years. The term \"Federal land\" in this Act includes public lands, National Forest System land, Bureau of Reclamation land, and Corps of Engineers land. State authority is also addressed in the Act. State authority is granted to regulate the treatment of wells using fluids under pressure with propping agents for fracturing in order to enhance oil, gas, or geothermal production on State and Federal lands."
