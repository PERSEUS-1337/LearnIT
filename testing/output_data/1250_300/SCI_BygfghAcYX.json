    "content": "In this work, a novel complexity measure based on unit-wise capacities is proposed for two layer ReLU networks, providing a tighter generalization bound. The capacity bound correlates with test error behavior as network sizes increase, partially explaining the benefits of over-parametrization. Additionally, a new lower bound for Rademacher complexity is presented, improving upon previous capacity lower bounds for neural networks. Deep neural networks have been successful in various tasks, with over-parametrization being common practice to achieve better test performance. Increasing the size of neural networks has led to better test performance, even though they are over-parametrized and can fit random labels easily. This phenomenon contradicts traditional wisdom in learning, where increasing model capacity usually leads to overfitting. However, in the case of neural networks, larger models have shown to improve generalization error, even without explicit regularization techniques. Studies have observed that training on models with more hidden units can decrease test error in image classification tasks. Complexity measures based on total number of parameters do not explain the generalization improvement seen with over-parametrization in neural networks. Different measures like norm, margin, and sharpness have been proposed to capture this phenomenon. Even when a network is large enough to fit the training data perfectly, generalization still occurs. In practice, generalization behavior in neural networks remains unexplained by traditional complexity measures. Even with over-parametrization, test error decreases for larger networks. Unit capacity and unit impact play crucial roles in network output, shrinking faster than 1/ \u221a h. Bartlett et al. (2017) introduced a margin-based generalization bound, but it fails to capture network complexity accurately. The text discusses how traditional complexity measures fail to explain why over-parametrization helps in neural networks. It mentions that existing complexity measures increase with the size of the network, even for two-layer networks. To further analyze this phenomenon, the study simplifies the architecture by choosing two-layer ReLU networks, which exhibit similar behavior with over-parametrization as more complex networks like pre-activation ResNet18. The study focuses on the architecture of two-layer ReLU networks, proving a tighter generalization bound and correlating capacity with test error. It characterizes complexity at a unit level, showing that unit level measures decrease as network size increases. The generalization bound depends on layer norms and the closeness of learned weights to initialization in the over-parametrized setting. The study discusses the architecture of two-layer ReLU networks, emphasizing the relationship between capacity and test error. It highlights that unit level measures decrease as network size increases and the closeness of learned weights to initialization in the over-parametrized setting. The norm of the hidden layer weights decreases with network size, suggesting that as networks are over-parametrized, optimization algorithms require less tuning of weights to find the right solution. The study investigates the impact of over-parametrization on generalization in neural networks, focusing on two-layer ReLU networks. It compares different complexity measures and generalization bounds, showing that existing measures do not fully explain the behavior with over-parametrization.

The study investigates the effect of over-parametrization on generalization in neural networks, particularly in two-layer ReLU networks. It introduces new complexity measures and generalization bounds, improving upon existing measures. The network's input dimension d, output dimension c, and number of hidden units h are considered, with the margin operator \u00b5 defined for c-class classification tasks. The ramp loss is defined for any distribution D and margin \u03b3 > 0, with the expected margin loss bounded between 0 and 1. The study explores the impact of over-parametrization on generalization in neural networks, focusing on two-layer ReLU networks. It introduces new complexity measures and generalization bounds, with the expected margin loss bounded between 0 and 1. The Rademacher complexity is used as a capacity measure to assess the ability of functions in a function class to fit random labels, leading to a bound on the generalization error for neural networks. The study investigates the impact of over-parametrization on generalization in neural networks, focusing on two-layer ReLU networks. It introduces new complexity measures and generalization bounds, with Rademacher complexity used as a capacity measure. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 dataset show behavior of network layers with increasing hidden units. The Frobenius norm of learned layers increases with h, while the distance Frobenius norm decreases w.r.t. initialization. The study explores the impact of over-parametrization on generalization in neural networks, focusing on two-layer ReLU networks. It introduces new complexity measures and generalization bounds, with Rademacher complexity as a capacity measure. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 dataset show that the Frobenius norm of learned layers increases with hidden units, while the distance Frobenius norm decreases relative to initialization. The behavior of different measures in the second layer is also analyzed, showing a shift in the distribution of angles between learned weights and initial weights. In the second layer of two-layer neural networks, the Frobenius norm and distance to initialization decrease with increasing hidden units, indicating a limited role of initialization. The norm of outgoing weights from hidden units decreases faster than 1/\u221ah, impacting the final decision-making process. Unit impact is defined as the magnitude of outgoing weights from a hidden unit, denoted as \u03b1i = vi^2. The unit impact, defined as the magnitude of outgoing weights from a hidden unit, is denoted as \u03b1i = vi^2. Empirical observations suggest that real data networks have bounded unit capacity and impact. Studying the generalization behavior of neural networks can provide a better understanding of these networks. A generalization bound for two-layer ReLU networks is proven by bounding the Rademacher complexity in terms of the sum of unit capacity and impact. This analysis helps in understanding the generalization properties of neural networks. The Rademacher complexity of the class F W is bounded by the sum of unit capacity and unit impact. A new technique decomposes the complexity of the network into complexity of hidden units, providing a tighter bound on the Rademacher complexity of two-layer neural networks. This generalization bound holds for any function in the function class defined by specific choices of \u03b1 and \u03b2. The generalization bound for two-layer ReLU networks is derived by covering all possible values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 and taking a union bound. The bound improves over existing ones and decreases with increasing network width. An explicit lower bound for Rademacher complexity is also provided, matching the first term in the generalization bound and showing its tightness. The additive term in the bound is small in practical regimes and does not dominate the main term. The generalization bound for two-layer ReLU networks is derived by covering all possible values of \u03b1 and \u03b2, showing its tightness. The additive factor in the bound is small in practical regimes and does not dominate the main term. The generalization bound is extended to p norms in Appendix Section B, providing a finer tradeoff between terms. Comparisons with other bounds show similarities in behavior, with differences mainly in the key complexity terms. The study explores the behavior of two-layer ReLU networks with varying sizes on CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets. Larger networks show better generalization even without regularization. Unit capacity and impact decrease with increasing network size. Larger networks require fewer epochs to achieve a low cross-entropy loss. The study compares the behavior of different capacity bounds over networks of increasing sizes. Generalization bounds typically scale as C/m where C is the effective capacity of the function class. The effective capacity C decreases with h and is consistently lower than other norm-based data-independent bounds. The bound even improves over VC-dimension for networks with size larger than 1024. The numerical values are loose but provide insight into relative generalization behavior with respect to different complexity measures. Our capacity bound decreases with network size, potentially indicating properties that help over-parametrized networks generalize. The complexity measure correlates well with generalization behavior when comparing networks trained on real and random labels. A lower bound for Rademacher complexity of neural networks is proven, matching the dominant behavior. The lower bound for the Rademacher complexity of neural networks is proven in this section, matching the dominant term in the upper bound. The complexity measure correlates well with generalization behavior, indicating properties that help over-parametrized networks generalize. The lower bound extends to a larger function class with an additional constraint on the spectral norm of the hidden layer. The lower bound for the Rademacher complexity of neural networks matches the dominant term in the upper bound, showing a gap between the Lipschitz constant of the network and its capacity. This non-trivial result excludes neural networks with rank-1 weight matrices, demonstrating a \u0398( \u221a h)-capacity. The lower bound for the Rademacher complexity of neural networks reveals a \u0398( \u221a h)-capacity gap between networks with ReLU activations and linear networks. This result excludes networks with rank-1 weight matrices and can be extended to more layers by setting intermediate layer weight matrices to the Identity matrix. Theorem 7 in Golowich et al. (2018) also provides a \u2126(s 1 s 2 \u221a c) lower bound for the composition of 1-Lipschitz loss function. The paper presents a new capacity bound for neural networks that decreases with the number of hidden units, potentially explaining better generalization performance of larger networks. It focuses on the role of width in generalization behavior of two layer networks and discusses the interplay between depth and width in controlling network capacity. The study also provides a lower bound for network capacity, improving on existing bounds. In this paper, a new capacity bound for neural networks is presented, which decreases with the number of hidden units. The study focuses on the role of width in generalization behavior of two layer networks and discusses the interplay between depth and width in controlling network capacity. The lower bound for network capacity is improved upon, with experiments conducted on a pre-activation ResNet18 architecture trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The architecture for neural networks on CIFAR-10 dataset includes a convolution layer, 8 residual blocks, and a linear layer. The number of output channels and strides in the blocks are defined by the initial number of channels. Training involves 11 architectures with varying channel sizes. Data augmentation is done through random flips and crops. Training is done using SGD with specific parameters and stopping criteria. The study involved training fully connected feedforward networks on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and MNIST datasets using various architectures. Training was done with specific parameters such as mini-batch size, momentum, and step size. The experiments stopped when the cross-entropy reached 0.01 or after 1000 epochs. Evaluation included calculating exact generalization bounds and adjusting them for multi-class classification. In the study, fully connected feedforward networks were trained on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and MNIST datasets with specific parameters. The experiments aimed to calculate generalization bounds for multi-class classification, adjusting them accordingly. The results showed the behavior of different measures on networks of varying sizes, with comparisons made to other generalization bounds. Theorem 2 was generalized to p norm, with Lemma 11 playing a key role in constructing a cover for the p ball with entry-wise dominance. The generalization error was bounded for any h, p \u2265 2, \u03b3 > 0, \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1), and U 0 \u2208 R h\u00d7d. Lemma 11 constructs a cover for the p ball with entry-wise dominance, leading to a generalization error bound for any h, p \u2265 2, \u03b3 > 0, \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 1), and U 0 \u2208 R h\u00d7d. The bound improves on Theorem 2 by introducing a tighter bound that decreases with h for larger values, particularly for p = ln h. Additionally, a vector-contraction inequality for Rademacher complexities is stated, relating the norm of a vector to the expected magnitude of its inner product with a vector of Rademacher random variables. The curr_chunk discusses the Rademacher complexity of a class of networks and presents a Rademacher Decomposition lemma. It proves an inequality using induction and highlights the Lipschitzness property.

This is used in the proof of Theorem 1 by applying Lemma 9 and Lemma 10. The proof of Theorem 1 involves applying Lemma 9 and Lemma 10, using the Rademacher random variables. Lemma 11 introduces a covering lemma for generalization bounds without knowledge of network parameter norms. Lemma 13 provides a bound on generalization error with specific parameters. Lemma 14 provides a bound on generalization error for a specific case when p = 2, with specific parameters and conditions. The proof involves directly upper bounding the generalization error.

The proof involves directly upper bounding the generalization error. The generalization error bound for any function f(x) = V[Ux] is provided in Lemma 15 for p \u2265 2, with specific parameters and conditions. The proof involves upper bounding the generalization error by utilizing specific values for \u00b5 and p. The dataset is divided into 2k groups with n copies of different elements. A matrix U(\u03be) is defined as the product of a diagonal matrix Diag(\u03b2) and a matrix F(\u03be). The 2-norm of each row of F is bounded by 1, leading to an upper bound on U(\u03be) of max \u03b2 i."
