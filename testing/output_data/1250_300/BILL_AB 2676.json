    "title": "AB 2676",
    "content": "Section 17052.6 of the Revenue and Taxation Code in California is amended to allow a credit against the \"net tax\" for expenses related to household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment. The percentage of the allowable federal credit varies based on adjusted gross income, with different thresholds for different income levels. The adjusted gross income determines the percentage of credit for household and dependent care services in California. Different income thresholds have varying credit percentages, ranging from 0% to 200%. The percentages change for taxable years starting in 2016 and 2019. The adjusted gross income in California determines the credit percentage for household and dependent care services. Income thresholds range from $40,000 or less at 50% to over $100,000 at 0%. The credit is limited to expenses for household services in the state and earned income subject to tax. Compensation for active services in the Armed Forces is also considered. Compensation for active services in the Armed Forces is considered earned income subject to tax in California, regardless of domicile. The definition of a qualifying individual for tax purposes is modified to include children as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. For tax purposes in California, a child is considered a qualifying individual if they receive over half of their support from the parent with custody for the majority of the year. This applies to parents who never married and lived apart for the last six months of the year. The amendments to tax laws regarding child support in California apply to specific taxable years and go into immediate effect as a tax levy."
