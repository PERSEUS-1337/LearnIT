    "content": "The Administration requested $39.510 billion for DHS in FY2013, a slight decrease from the previous year. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved a net discretionary appropriation of $39.514 million for DHS for FY2013. The Senate-reported bill for FY2013 provided less than $4 million above the Administration's request, with adjustments to the discretionary spending cap under the BCA. The House passed H.R. 5855 with amendments, resulting in a net discretionary appropriation of $39,114 million for DHS. Increases were proposed for various DHS activities, including Border Security Fencing and Urban Search and Rescue Response programs. The President signed H.J.Res. 117 into law as P.L. 112-175 on September 28, 2012. The President signed H.J.Res. 117 into law as P.L. 112-175 on September 28, 2012, allowing for the federal government to continue operations through March 27, 2013, at an annualized rate of $1.047 trillion. On March 26, 2013, the President signed H.R. 933 into law as P.L. 113-6, providing $39.646 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for the Department of Homeland Security. Two across-the-board cuts reduced the discretionary budget authority by $52.4 million. According to Office of Management and Budget calculations, two across-the-board cuts unrelated to the March 1 sequestration reduced discretionary budget authority by $52.4 million. $38.348 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority was available for DHS to use after the impact of sequestration in FY2013. Data sources include President's Budget Documents, H.Rept. 112-492, S.Rept. 112-169, President's Budget Documents for FY2013, DHS Congressional Budget Justifications, H.R. 5855, S. 2316, H.J.Res. 117, and P.L. 113-6. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred functions, funding, and personnel to the Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS are typically organized into five titles. Funding data is sourced from various documents, with amounts rounded to the nearest million. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred 22 agencies and offices to the new Department of Homeland Security. Appropriations for DHS are organized into five titles, covering various departments and offices within the department. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred 22 agencies and offices to the new Department of Homeland Security, which includes USCIS, S&T, and FLETC. Title V provides congressional direction to the department, with additional titles added as needed. The FY2012 House bill included a sixth title for a $1 billion emergency appropriation for the Disaster Relief Fund. The structure of the FY2013 appropriations bills varied slightly between House and Senate versions, with differences in subcomponents and accounts noted. Congressional budget process determines maximum budget authority, with overall spending totals set in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget. The congressional budget process involves two stages. In the first stage, Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget. These amounts are then allocated among the appropriations committees through 302(a) allocations. In the second stage, the appropriations committees allocate the discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each appropriations bill through 302(b) allocations. These allocations must not exceed the 302(a) discretionary allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations can be made during the year by the Appropriations Committee. The Budget Control Act (BCA) established discretionary spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013. For FY2013, a separate cap of $686 billion was set for security spending, with all other spending capped at $361 billion out of a total of $1.047 trillion. Adjustments can be made for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, and other purposes. The Budget Control Act (BCA) set discretionary spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013, with a separate cap of $686 billion for security spending and $361 billion for all other spending out of a total of $1.047 trillion. The BCA allows for adjustments for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, and other purposes. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction was tasked to develop a deficit reduction plan by January 15, 2012, but automatic spending reductions were triggered when no legislation was enacted, including sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps starting on January 2, 2013. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established automatic spending reductions through sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps, set to begin on January 2, 2013. The sequestration process required across-the-board spending cuts at the account and program level to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding. The American Taxpayer Relief Act delayed the implementation of the sequester until March 1, 2013, and reduced the dollar amount of the sequester. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established automatic spending reductions through sequestration and lower discretionary spending caps, set to begin on January 2, 2013. The sequestration process required across-the-board spending cuts at the account and program level to achieve equal budget reductions from both defense and nondefense funding. The American Taxpayer Relief Act delayed the implementation of the sequester until March 1, 2013, and reduced the dollar amount of the sequester by $24 billion. President Obama ordered the joint committee sequester to be implemented on March 1, 2013, with sequestration applied at the program, project, and activity level within each account. The post-sequestration numbers in the report are derived from the FY2013 DHS operating plan. The FY2013 DHS operating plan includes post-sequestration numbers derived from P.L. 113-6, with across-the-board rescissions for \"nonsecurity\" and \"security\" budget authority. DHS falls under the \"security\" category and receives a 0.1% cut to align with FY2013 discretionary spending limits. The FY2013 DHS operating plan includes across-the-board rescissions for \"nonsecurity\" and \"security\" budget authority. Additional rescissions of 0.032% of \"security\" budget authority and 0.2% of \"nonsecurity\" budget authority were required to avoid exceeding spending limits. The FY2013 DHS operating plan includes across-the-board rescissions for \"nonsecurity\" and \"security\" budget authority to reduce discretionary budget authority. Funding for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror and disaster relief under the Budget Control Act are not subject to these cuts. DHS's initial 302(b) allocations for FY2013 are outlined in Table 2, with adjustments made for emergency spending and overseas contingency operations. Disaster relief adjustments are limited under the BCA. For FY2012, $258 million was provided for Coast Guard overseas contingency operations under P.L. 112-331. The allowable adjustment for disaster relief is determined by OMB using a formula. For FY2013, OMB determined the allowable adjustment for disaster relief to be $11,779 million, fully exercised including $6,400 million in pre-sequestration resources through the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund in P.L. 113-6. Table 3 summarizes funding in the FY2012 regular DHS appropriations bill, the Administration's FY2013 appropriations request, and the final DHS appropriations legislation in Division D of P.L. 113-6 before sequestration. The House and Senate versions of the FY2013 appropriations bill for DHS, along with the final appropriations legislation in P.L. 113-6, are broken down by title. The Administration proposed a 0.5% pay increase for civilian federal employees, which was rejected by the House. The Senate recommended funding the pay raise, but neither the continuing resolution nor P.L. 113-6 provided resources for it. Breaking down the DHS bill by title does not offer much transparency into how appropriated resources are allocated due to the wide variation in budgets across DHS components. The DHS bill lacks transparency in allocating appropriated resources, with varying budgets across its components. Table 4 and Figure 1 display DHS's FY 2013 discretionary budget authority, showing adjustments for disaster relief and overseas contingency operations. The bill's general provisions include rescissions of prior-year budget authority, impacting the net budget authority. The left column in Table 4 compares discretionary budget authority in P.L. 113-6 against the bill's allocation, while the right column includes adjustments to the discretionary budget cap under the Budget Control Act. The DHS budget for FY 2013 includes discretionary budget authority from P.L. 113-6 and adjustments under the Budget Control Act. Figure 2 shows that a significant portion of DHS's budget is funded through fee income rather than direct appropriations. Figure 2 compares the Administration's FY2013 budget request with the enacted budget for FY2013, showing discretionary and mandatory appropriations, adjustments under the Budget Control Act, and total budgetary resources for DHS. Table 5 presents DHS appropriations for FY2003 through FY2013 in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation or sequestration. The appropriations amounts in Table 5 are presented in current dollars and are not adjusted for inflation or sequestration. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees marked up the DHS appropriations bills in May 2012, with P.L. 113-6 representing the second-latest enactment of annual appropriations for the department. Title I of the DHS appropriations bill provides funding for the department's management activities, Analysis and Operations (A&O). The DHS appropriations bills for FY2013 allocated funding for management activities, Analysis and Operations, and the Office of the Inspector General. The House-passed bill proposed a decrease in funding compared to the requested level, while the Senate-reported bill also fell below the request. After across-the-board cuts, the final appropriations for Title I were reduced, with sequestration further impacting the budget. Sequestration reduced funding to $1,026 million, impacting various components of Title I for FY2012 and FY2013. The departmental management accounts cover administrative expenses, including offices like OSEM, USM, OCAO, OCHCO, OCPO, OCSO, OCFO, and OCIO. The Administration typically requests funding for headquarters consolidation in this section. The Administration usually requests funding for the consolidation of its headquarters, including offices like OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO. The FY2013 request compared to the FY2012 enacted appropriations as follows: OSEM, $134 million, an increase of $1 million (0.7%); USM, $222 million, a decrease of $14 million (5.9%); OCFO, $55 million, an increase of $5 million (9.0%); and OCIO, $313 million, an increase of $55 million (21.5%). Total request for departmental management activities in Title I for FY2012 was $724 million, not including $89 million for the consolidation of DHS headquarters. The Administration requested $134 million for OSEM, with proposed program changes including funding for the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman. Additionally, $222 million was requested for the USM with several program changes proposed. The Administration requested $222 million for the USM to enhance policy advice, investigations, and training for ICE Secure Communities and 287(g) programs. Program changes include transferring the Directives function to the OUSM, allocating funds for salaries, expenses, and HR IT in the OCHCO, and improving the Nebraska Avenue Complex. Additionally, $55 million was requested for the OCFO, with $6.7 million designated for Financial Systems Modernization at FEMA. The OCFO justification requested money to complete the implementation of a new core financial system at FEMA in FY2013. The new financial system is necessary for accurate accounting, tracking, and reporting of FEMA resources. The OCIO account requested $122 million for Infrastructure and Security Activities, including $65 million for data center migration activities for CBP, TSA, and USCIS. H.R. 5855 proposed appropriations that were lower than the President's request for OSEM, USM, OCFO, and OCIO. The House Appropriations committee recommended reduced funding for management activities compared to the President's request, citing the need to cover unrealized funding proposals and failure to comply with statutory requirements. Amendments during floor consideration further reduced the budget by almost $33 million. During floor consideration, amendments passed to decrease funds for management by almost $33 million. The largest reductions were for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management, with increases to agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. This left the USM with $180 million, $41 million less than requested. The House passed amendments to decrease funds for the Office of the Under Secretary for Management by $5 million and increase funds for Firefighter Assistance Grants by $5 million. This would leave the USM with an appropriation of $180 million, $41 million less than requested. Representative Flake proposed reallocating reception and representation expenses to increase U.S. Customs and Border Protection Salaries and Expenses. Additionally, provisions were made to withhold $71 million from obligation until all required reports were submitted. The House proposed withholding $71 million from obligation until all required reports were submitted with the FY2014 budget request. Additionally, funding of $5 million was proposed to be withheld for the Office of General Counsel until a final overseas aircraft repair station security regulation is published. More than $124 million would have been withheld from obligation under the USM appropriation until all required reports were received. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a $7 million reduction for OCPO for failure to comply with statutory reporting requirements. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a $7 million (10%) reduction for OCPO due to non-compliance with statutory reporting requirements. They also proposed withholding over $29 million from the OCFO account until all required reports and plans were submitted. The Committee emphasized direct communication from relevant components regarding their areas of responsibility. $242 million was allocated for the Office of the Chief Information Officer, with $117 million for salaries and expenses and $125 million for development and acquisition of IT equipment and software. The House recommended a $242 million appropriation for the Office of the Chief Information Officer, with $117 million for salaries and expenses and $125 million for IT equipment, software, and related activities. The Senate-reported bill proposed different appropriations compared to the President's request, with a total funding of $655 million for departmental management in Title I. The Senate-reported bill proposed a total funding of $655 million for departmental management in Title I, representing a decrease of $69 million (9.5%) from the President's request. The bill included a requested programmatic increase for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, but funding for the office was still down by roughly $1 million (3.5%) from FY2012 levels. The committee report also mentioned the discontinuation of funding for the DHS historian and encouraged the Secretary to fill the position again using funds provided in FY2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $35 million appropriation for the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer, which was $1 million below the requested amount. Funding for reception and representation expenses was reduced by 15% for FY2012 and proposed to be further reduced by 10% for FY2013 due to budget constraints. The committee emphasized the need for robust oversight of major acquisitions, recruitment of skilled workforce, and security measures to safeguard DHS personnel and facilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $35 million appropriation for the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer, $1 million below the request, with reductions in Salaries and Expenses. For the Office of the Chief Information Officer, a $248 million appropriation was recommended, including $121 million for salaries and expenses and $127 million for technology investments. $65 million for data center migration was included in a general provision, aligning with the Administration's request. The committee highlighted expected savings of nearly $3 billion by 2030 from data center consolidation. The committee report highlighted expected savings of nearly $3 billion by 2030 from data center consolidation. The law provides appropriations for various departments, with a total funding of $643 million for departmental management, representing a decrease of $170 million from the President's request. Only the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) was subject to a funding reduction based on sequestration. The P.L. 113-6 law included directives for the DHS CIO to submit a multi-year investment and management plan for IT projects funded under the CIO or by multiple components. The Senate's explanatory statement also directed the Secretary to report travel costs, submit a contingency plan for user fee collections, and the USM to submit a Comprehensive plan with the President's FY2014 budget proposal. The DHS is required to submit budgeted collections of user fees to appropriations committees, a Comprehensive Acquisition Status Report with the President's FY2014 budget proposal, a detailed report on workforce strategy implementation, and justification for insourcing or outsourcing initiatives. The CFO will provide semiannual briefings on financial systems modernization efforts. Funding levels for management accounts are outlined in Table 7, reflecting spending cuts but not sequestration impact. The \"DHS Plan\" column shows the department's assessment of budgetary resources available. The funding levels for existing management accounts under P.L. 113-6 reflect spending cuts but not sequestration impact. The DHS Plan column shows budgetary resources available after sequestration. The House and Senate Appropriations committees identified issues including separate line items for three offices, new revenue assumptions, late submissions of required plans, and conference spending by the department. The Administration's budget proposed separate line items for three offices\u2014the Office of International Affairs (OIA), the Office of State and Local Law Enforcement (SLLE), and the Private Sector Office (PSO)\u2014currently funded under the Office of Policy. The proposal to have these offices report directly to the OSEM was rejected during the legislative process. The House committee recommended establishing an external affairs office to consolidate and streamline functions currently dispersed among various offices within the department. The Senate committee report questioned the need for stand-alone external affairs offices within DHS, suggesting that these functions could be adequately performed within the Office of Policy. The Administration's budget proposed increasing resources through aviation security fee hikes, customs fee revenue use authorization, and CBP reimbursement agreements. The House rejected these proposals, while the Senate included them. The House committee report criticized the President's budget for relying on unrealistic revenue assumptions and rejected proposals for aviation security fee increases. The report emphasized the need for realistic budgeting and stated that such proposals would not be considered relevant until enacted into law. The House committee report criticized the President's budget for unrealistic revenue assumptions and rejected proposals for aviation security fee increases. P.L. 113-6 allowed CBP to start pilot projects for reimbursable agreements for customs services. The report expressed concern about late submission of required plans and reports to Congress, withholding funding from departmental management accounts. The Department's failure to comply with statutory requirements was deemed unacceptable by the Committee. The House committee criticized the President's budget for unrealistic revenue assumptions and late submission of required reports. The Committee expects the Department to comply with statutory requirements for reports and plans, with some currently more than three months late. The Senate-reported bill proposed withholding 59% of budgets for OSEM, USM, and CFO until all required expenditure reports are submitted. The majority of statutorily required reports and plans are over three months late. The Senate-reported bill suggested withholding 59% of budgets for OSEM, USM, and CFO until all required expenditure reports are submitted. Section 562 of P.L. 113-6 withholds 20% of the budgets until all reports and plans due by May 1 are submitted. The House committee emphasized the need for better oversight of expenditures and required the Office of Inspector General to report on compliance with Federal laws. The House and Senate bills emphasize the need for better oversight of conference spending. The Office of Inspector General is required to report on compliance with Federal laws related to travel, conferences, and employee awards programs. Quarterly reports on events costing over $20,000 are mandated, with restrictions on using grants or contracts for unrelated conferences. Compliance with government-wide spending directives is also required. The House and Senate bills aim to improve oversight of conference spending by requiring compliance with government-wide directives on travel and conference expenses. They also limit the number of employees allowed to attend overseas conferences, with the House capping attendance at 50 employees unless for law enforcement purposes, and the Senate capping attendance at 50 employees per DHS component unless deemed important for national interest. The Department of Homeland Security's headquarters occupies over 7 million square feet in 45 locations in the DC area, leading to inefficiencies and high costs. To address this, a $3.4 billion plan was approved to create a new unified headquarters at St Elizabeths in Anacostia, which would be the largest federal office construction since the Pentagon. The General Services Administration (GSA) approved a $3.4 billion master plan to build a new DHS headquarters at St Elizabeths in Anacostia, the largest federal office construction since the Pentagon. $1.4 billion would be funded through the DHS budget and $2 billion through the GSA. $1,366 million has been invested in the project so far. Phase 1A, a new Coast Guard headquarters facility, is nearing completion. The Administration has sought funding for consolidation of other offices to save on lease costs. $89 million was requested for activities related to the project, including a highway interchange for increased traffic. The Administration requested $89 million for activities related to the St. Elizabeths DHS headquarters project, including a highway interchange for increased traffic. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for the highway interchange, noting the irregularity of funding it through the Homeland Security bill. Additionally, $24.5 million was requested for moving the Coast Guard into its new facility. No other funding requests for the project were included in the budget submission to Congress. The House Appropriations Committee recommended no funding for the highway interchange or Departmental Headquarters Consolidation expansion at St. Elizabeths project. Instead, $10 million was allocated through the Coast Guard's construction budget for the move to the new facility. Additional funding was provided for site access improvements and analysis for future work. The Committee allocated $10 million under the Coast Guard construction budget for the move to the new facility at St. Elizabeths. The Department is exploring options to modify current leases due to delays in permanent headquarters construction. The Committee encourages continued efforts in consolidation and requests progress updates within 90 days. The bill lacks $89 million for site access to the new DHS headquarters, causing delays and cost increases. The Coast Guard may be the only tenant for the next 3-5 years. No funding for Phase 2 construction for DHS central headquarters and FEMA. Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for highway interchange. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $89 million for the highway interchange as part of the DHS headquarters consolidation. The committee also recommended full funding for the Coast Guard's move under Coast Guard operating expenses, with no funding provided through the Coast Guard construction budget. An attempt to use the $89 million as an offset for an unrelated amendment failed, and the funding remained in the reported version of the legislation. The Under Secretary is required to submit an expenditure plan within 90 days detailing the allocation of funds for headquarters and mission support consolidation. An updated plan is being developed to complete the headquarters consolidation project in smaller segments for better fiscal management. $29 million is provided for this purpose, with quarterly briefings required on consolidation activities. The Under Secretary is required to submit an expenditure plan within 90 days detailing the allocation of funds for headquarters and mission support consolidation. $29 million is provided for necessary expenses to plan, acquire, design, construct, renovate, equip, furnish, improve infrastructure, and occupy buildings and facilities for the department headquarters project and associated mission support consolidation. Funds included in the Analysis and Operations account support both the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) and the Office of Operations Coordination and Planning (OPS). The Analysis and Operations account within DHS manages the National Operations Center and coordinates domestic incident management. The FY2013 budget request was $322 million, a decrease from the previous year. H.R. 5855 proposed $317 million for the account, below the President's request. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended a further decrease in funding. The President's FY2013 budget request for the Analysis and Operations account was recommended at $21 million less than FY2012. The House Committee on Appropriations denied proposed salary increases and funding changes, while the Senate Committee recommended $324 million, a decrease from FY2012 but an increase from the President's request. The Senate also required an expenditure plan from DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer. The Senate Committee on Appropriations required DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer to submit an expenditure plan for FY2013 within 60 days of the appropriations bill enactment. The plan should focus on I&A's unique expertise and intelligence customers not supported by other components. P.L. 113-6 allocated $322 million for the Analysis and Operations account, falling between H.R. 5855 and S. 3216. The figure matches the President's FY2013 request, 4.7% lower than FY2012. The operating plan indicates sequestration reduced this to $306 million. The Senate Committee on Appropriations required DHS's Chief Intelligence Officer to submit an expenditure plan for FY2013 within 60 days of the appropriations bill enactment. Concerns have been raised about I&A's mission, with some Members of Congress noting a lack of focus in its mission. Representative Sue Myrick stated that vague or overlapping authorities have contributed to this challenge. The Aspen Institute report suggested that DHS's intelligence activities should avoid duplication of efforts by other agencies. The Aspen Institute report recommended that DHS's intelligence activities should focus on specific homeward-focused areas where it has unique strengths and value, avoiding duplication of efforts by other agencies. Concerns were raised about potential duplication of intelligence efforts by I&A and the need for an expenditure plan centered around its functions. The DHS Office of the Inspector General conducts audits and investigations to prevent waste in department activities. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) is an independent body that conducts audits and investigations to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse within the department. They requested $144 million in funding, including $2.6 million to conduct audits of states receiving FEMA grant funds for disaster preparedness. This new appropriation will allow the OIG to complete all 61 audits by the deadline. The DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) requested $144 million in funding to conduct audits and investigations related to disaster preparedness and response. The House-passed bill allocated $109 million for the OIG, with a $10 million reduction due to dissatisfaction with communication on border corruption investigations. The Senate-reported bill included $123 million for the OIG, with $24 million expected to come from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. The Senate-reported bill allocated $123 million for the DHS OIG, with $24 million from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. The funding increase is intended for investigating corruption at CBP and ICE, completing audits mandated by P.L. 110-53, and grants under the Urban Area Security Initiative by August 20, 2014. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provides $121 million in net budget authority for the OIG for FY2013, a 3.4% increase from last year's appropriation. The DHS OIG received a $4 million increase (3.4%) from last year's appropriation and a $23 million decrease (15.6%) from the President's request. The legislation also includes a $24 million transfer from the Disaster Relief Fund to align with the request. Sequestration reduced OIG budget authority by $7 million. Both House and Senate bills required the OIG to conduct various reviews and reports, including ensuring compliance with federal laws. The House directed the DHS OIG to report on compliance with federal laws on travel, conferences, and employee awards programs, conduct TSA screening inspections, assess fraud detection reforms by USCIS, and review delays in FEMA's public assistance programs. The Senate directed a review of FEMA's application of rules for awarding public assistance funds for debris removal. The explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 113-6 reiterates provisions for the OIG, emphasizing compliance with House and Senate reports. No additional funding is allocated for new tasks, except for integrity investigations of ICE and CBP officers. Concerns about OIG's independence and reporting efficiency are highlighted, prompting a GAO review of its organizational structure and reporting functions. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) reports on audits and investigations, with concerns about its independence and reporting efficiency. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for agencies like CBP, ICE, TSA, USCG, and USSS. The requested budget for FY2013 was $30,759 million, with slight variations in the House-passed and Senate-reported bills. After cuts, the final appropriations for Title II were $31,267 million. The DHS appropriations bill for FY2013 provided $31,267 million for Title II, which was 1.7% above the requested level and 0.8% below FY2012. Sequestration reduced the amount to $30,184 million, impacting various areas within DHS. CBP is responsible for security at ports of entry, inspecting people and goods to prevent terrorism. CBP officers enforce laws and regulations at the border to prevent illegal entries, focusing on preventing the entry of terrorists and terrorism instruments. They inspect people and goods at ports of entry to determine authorization for entry into the United States. CBP's major programs include Border Security Inspections and Trade Facilitation, Border Security and Control between Ports of Entry, Air and Marine Interdiction, Automation Modernization, Border Security Fencing, Infrastructure, and Technology, Facilities Management, and immigration and customs user Fee Accounts. Funding numbers for CBP appropriations reflect spending cuts relative to FY2012 enacted amounts. The Administration requested an appropriation of $10,345 million in net budget authority for CBP for FY2013, an increase of $190 million (1.9%) over the enacted FY2012 level. The total request included $1,626 million in fees, mandatory spending, and trust funds, for a gross budget request of $11,971 million, which is a $320 million (2.8%) increase from the enacted FY2012 level. The Administration's total budget request for FY2013 included a $320 million increase from the FY2012 level, totaling $11,971 million. Program changes included transferring the US-VISIT program to CBP with a $261.5 million increase, additional funding for the Automated Targeting System, Office of Intelligence and Investigative Liaison, National Targeting Center, Container Security Initiative, intellectual property rights enforcement, and expansion of CBP's Centers for Excellence and Expertise. The budget for FY2013 includes increases for cargo security, intellectual property rights enforcement, and CBP's Centers for Excellence and Expertise. There are decreases in funding for Office of Air and Marine Interdictions, management and administration staffing, fleet acquisition, information technology, and nonintrusive inspection operations. The FY2013 budget includes decreases in various areas such as information technology infrastructure, nonintrusive inspection operations, CBP officer overtime expenses, training expenses, and transportation program. The House approved a net budget authority of $10,172 for CBP, which is an increase of $17 million from last year's appropriation and a decrease of $173 million from the President's request. The House-approved FY2013 budget for CBP includes amendments for salary support, communications infrastructure funding, and cuts to environmental mitigation. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed a higher net budget authority of $10,454 million, with increases in various areas compared to last year's appropriation and the President's request. The FY2013 budget for CBP saw an increase in funding compared to last year's appropriation and the President's request. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 provided $10,356 million in net budget authority for CBP, with additional cuts due to sequestration. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected a total spending of $11,298 million for CBP, $353 million less than the FY2012 enacted levels. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected a total spending of $11,298 million for CBP, with various policy issues related to CBP including the US-VISIT program, staffing, reimbursement authority, customs user fees, border surveillance technology, and cargo security. Congress mandated an automated entry-exit data system for foreign visitors in 1996. The United States collects biographic and biometric data from non-citizens entering the country to help identify potential risks. The entry-exit system has been in place since 2006, requiring most non-citizens to provide biometric data upon entry. However, the system does not collect biometric data from non-citizens exiting the country. The United States collects biographic and biometric data from non-citizens entering the country for security purposes. However, no biometric data is collected from most non-citizens exiting the US. The President's FY2013 budget did not include funding for a biometric exit system, focusing instead on an enhanced biographic exit program and an integrated U.S.-Canadian entry-exit system. This program involves air and sea carriers providing passenger manifest data to DHS for checks against immigration, criminal, and national security databases to identify overstays and high-priority individuals. Additionally, Citizenship and Immigration Canada provides biometric records of third country nationals entering Canada through land ports, which are treated as U.S. exit records for the entry-exit system. The U.S. entry-exit system collects biometric records of third country nationals entering Canada through land ports, treating them as U.S. exit records. Congress has urged DHS to implement a comprehensive exit system, with the system's organizational structure changing multiple times since its creation in 2003. BTS proposed placing US-VISIT within a new Screening Coordination Office (SCO) under DHS, but funding was not allocated. US-VISIT became a stand-alone office in FY2006 and was later transferred to the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD). In FY2013, there were proposals to divide US-VISIT's work between CBP and ICE for operational and cost efficiencies, but Congress did not fully support the move. The House bill would transfer some funding to CBP and ICE, while the Senate recommended transferring US-VISIT to CBP as a stand-alone appropriation. The US-VISIT Program was replaced by the Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM) within NPPD, with a budget of about $191 million. The President's FY2013 budget requested funding for CBP officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents. Concerns were raised about DHS staffing levels and infrastructure investments, as well as the lack of increased inspection fees for about ten years limiting funds for CBP officer salaries. The House report suggested changes to reduce staffing requirements at POEs. The House report expressed concern about the lack of increased inspection fees for about ten years, limiting funds for CBP officer salaries. It recommended changes to reduce staffing requirements at POEs, including automation, risk-based targeting, and technology utilization. Additionally, there were requests for specific staffing plans for border patrol agents and Northern Border ports of entry. User fees fund 37% of CBP officer salaries, and efforts to reduce CBP staffing may face opposition. The House report expressed concern about the lack of increased inspection fees for about ten years, limiting funds for CBP officer salaries. Efforts to reduce CBP staffing may face opposition, as some argue that increased enforcement between ports of entry has encouraged illegal migrants and drug smugglers to enter through POEs. Supporters of increased OFO staffing argue that officers increase security while facilitating legal admissions. With the implementation of sequestration in 2013, DHS officials warned of furloughs for frontline CBP personnel and decreased hiring to backfill positions. With sequestration implemented on March 1, 2013, DHS officials warned of potential furloughs for frontline CBP personnel, reduced overtime hours, and decreased hiring. The impact of the sequester on frontline operations is being minimized by eliminating performance awards, reducing outside contracts, and working with appropriators to reprogram funds. CBP plans to rely on reductions to overtime and hiring freezes to avoid or minimize employee furloughs, despite the likelihood of reduced staffing through a combination of reduced overtime and furlough days. With over 90% of Border Security and Control between POEs Account going to salaries and benefits, CBP frontline staffing may face reduced overtime hours and furlough days. The administration has considered public-private partnerships for funding staffing and infrastructure at ports of entry, despite restrictions on fee-for-service immigration or customs services. Section 560 of P.L. 113-6 allows CBP to enter into up to five public-private partnerships in FY2013 for additional services at POEs, new facilities, and expansion at land ports of entry. User fees, including those paid by passengers, are collected by CBP. The costs of providing additional services at POEs, including officer overtime, provision of CBP services at new facilities, and expansion at land ports of entry are funded through various user fees, such as COBRA fees. These fees reimburse CBP for customs functions, overtime compensation, benefits, and premium pay for officers, preclearance services, and officer salaries. Merchandise processing fees are deposited in CBP's Customs User Fee Account for additional customs revenue functions, subject to appropriations acts. A portion of COBRA fees, known as merchandise processing fees, is deposited in CBP's Customs User Fee Account to fund additional customs revenue functions. However, this funding is only available through discretionary appropriations. Recent examples include the temporary fee increase for all passengers entering the US under the NAFTA Implementation Act of 1993 and the elimination of a passenger fee exemption under the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act of 2011, resulting in significant increases in COBRA fees. The Agreement Implementation Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-42) eliminated a passenger fee exemption for certain countries, leading to increased COBRA fees. Funds raised were directed to the Customs User Fee Account but have not been used for customs revenue collection. Questions have been raised by Congress about the disposition of these fees, with the House Appropriations Committee requesting a report from CBP. CBP's budget justification for FY2013 included these fees for officer salaries and expenses, but no appropriation bill made the funds available to CBP. The Agreement Implementation Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-42) increased COBRA fees, but the funds were not made available to CBP, resulting in a budget shortfall. The House proposed shifting funds to CBP officer salaries, while the Senate awaited a resolution from the department. P.L. 113-6 appropriated $110 million to cover the shortfall and directed CBP to include COBRA fees in future budget requests. DHS uses technology to monitor the Southwest Border and detect illegal entries. The use of technology to monitor the border and detect illegal entries has faced challenges in delivering desired surveillance levels. Previous initiatives like America's Shield Initiative and SBI net were criticized for contracting practices and cost overruns. The Obama Administration replaced SBI net with the Arizona Border Technology Plan, emphasizing rapid deployment of existing technology and different approaches for various border regions. House and Senate appropriations reports expressed frustration with DHS' implementation of the new plan. The House and Senate appropriations reports criticized DHS for not procuring and implementing new surveillance equipment for the border as part of the Arizona Border Technology Plan. Both chambers recommended fully funding the President's request for the border surveillance mission but also called for rescinding unobligated balances from the account, with the House calling for $40,412,000 in rescissions and the Senate calling for $92,000,000. P.L. 113-6 includes $73,232,000 in rescissions of prior year unobligated balances in the account. The President's FY2013 budget request for the Office of Air and Marine Interdiction (OAM) supported 277 aircraft for drug interdiction and border surveillance. OAM reported 81,045 flight hours in FY2012 and projected 65,000 hours in FY2013. CBP operated a total of 10 unmanned aerial systems (UAS) as of November 2012, with UAS accounting for 5,737 flight hours in FY2012. Some Members of Congress support aircraft use for border surveillance, including UAS, while concerns about privacy remain regarding UAS in border security. In FY2012, OAM reported 81,045 flight hours, up from 4,406 hours in FY2011. Some Members of Congress support aircraft use for border surveillance, including UAS. Concerns about privacy and cost effectiveness of UAS in border security persist. A DHS Inspector General report criticized CBP's UAS program for inadequate planning and under-utilization of assets. Both appropriations committees recommended budget increases for OAM, with P.L. 113-6 appropriating about $799 million for Air and Marine Operations. In FY2012, OAM reported 81,045 flight hours, up from 4,406 hours in FY2011. P.L. 113-6 appropriated about $799 million for Air and Marine Operations, including a shift of $284 million from CBP's Salaries and Expenses account. CBP is responsible for screening cargo at U.S. ports of entry for contraband. The SAFE Port Act requires all maritime cargo to be scanned before loading. The 9/11 Act set a deadline for DHS to exclude cargo not scanned by July 1, 2012, which was extended by Secretary Napolitano. The 100% scanning requirement for U.S.-bound cargo has raised concerns about balancing security benefits with costs. DHS officials suggest focusing on high-risk cargo and a random sample of lower-risk cargo to cut costs and make efficient use of resources. The FY2013 budget included a $13 million increase to the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and $78 million in proposed increases for cargo security screening programs. Congress provided funding levels above the President's request for FY2013, including increases to the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and Automated Targeting System. House and Senate Appropriations Committees supported these programs, acknowledging concerns about the costs of a 100% scanning program at foreign ports. ICE focuses on enforcing immigration and customs laws within the United States, developing intelligence to reduce illegal entry and investigating violations. ICE enforces immigration laws, including alien smuggling and unauthorized worker hiring. They locate and remove overstayed visa holders, illegal entrants, and deportable aliens. ICE also combats terrorist financing, money laundering, and enforces export laws. Funding for ICE in FY2013 was $5,332 million, a decrease of $218 million from FY2012. In FY2013, ICE requested $5,644 million in gross budget authority, a decrease of $218 million (3.7%) from FY2012. The budget included increases for Alternatives to Detention program, personnel consolidation, video conferencing, and US-VISIT Program, while reducing funding for 287(g) program, Office of Principle Legal Advisor, and detention beds. The House-passed H.R. 5855 and Senate-Reported S. 3216 proposed budget reductions for various programs within ICE for FY2013, including cuts to the 287(g) program, Office of Principle Legal Advisor, detention beds, and Secure Communities. The House bill would have provided ICE with $5,786 million in total funding authority, while the Senate bill recommended $5,330 million in net budget authority. These figures represented decreases from the FY2012 enacted level and the Administration's request. The House-passed H.R. 5855 and Senate-reported S. 3216 proposed budget reductions for ICE in FY2013. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6) provided $5,426 million in net budget authority for ICE, a decrease from last year's appropriation but an increase from the President's request. Sequestration further reduced ICE budget authority by roughly $200 million. The FY2013 budget for ICE was $5,426 million, a decrease from the previous year but an increase from the President's request. Sequestration further reduced the budget by $200 million. ICE is responsible for various activities related to civil and criminal violations of law, leading to ongoing debates on resource allocation. One key aspect of ICE's mission is locating and removing deportable aliens, with an estimated 10.8 million unauthorized aliens in the US. ICE's budget for FY2013 was $5,426 million, with ongoing debates on resource allocation due to sequestration cuts. There are an estimated 10.8 million unauthorized aliens in the US, with 1.9 million having committed a crime. ICE can remove 400,000 aliens annually, sparking debate on prioritizing removal. H.R. 5855 directs ICE to prioritize removing aliens convicted of crimes, with $1,600 million allocated for this purpose. ICE's ERO manages custody of aliens in removal proceedings or ordered removed from the US. ICE's Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) manages the custody of aliens in removal proceedings or ordered removed from the US. Concerns have been raised about the lack of detention space leading to decisions on which aliens to release based on space availability rather than individual cases. Some policymakers advocate for alternatives to detention programs for noncriminal alien detainees as a cost-effective and proportional treatment option. ICE maintained 34,000 detention bed spaces in FY2012, with a proposed reduction to 32,800 beds in FY2013. In early 2013, ICE released 2,228 aliens. ICE released 2,228 detainees in early 2013 due to budget constraints and sequestration requirements, sparking controversy over the political motives behind the release. Critics accused ICE of using the release as leverage to pressure Congress. Despite the release, P.L. 113-6 mandates that ICE maintain 34,000 detention beds for FY2013. There is interest in developing alternatives to detention for certain non-criminal aliens with final removal orders. ICE's Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program offers less restrictive monitoring options, such as electronic devices and home visits, for aliens awaiting removal proceedings. The Administration requested a decrease in detention bed space but an increase in ATD funding. The House maintained bed space and increased ATD funding by $20 million, while the Senate decreased bed space by 600 beds and increased ATD funding by $24 million. P.L. 113-6 funds 34,000 detention beds and increases ATD funding by $19 million. The Administration's request included $139 million for Secure Communities, an information sharing program between DHS and the Department of Justice. ICE has deployed Secure Communities to 89% of all jurisdictions nationally and is seeking resources to expand the system nationwide by the end of FY2013. House and Senate appropriators support the continued expansion of Secure Communities. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease of $17 million from the FY2012 enacted level. The Secure Communities screening process is seen as more efficient and cost-effective in identifying and removing criminal and priority aliens. ICE plans to expand Secure Communities nationwide by the end of FY2013. The Administration requested $51 million for 287(g) agreements, a decrease of $17 million from the FY2012 enacted level. ICE plans to discontinue less productive 287(g) task force agreements in jurisdictions where Secure Communities is active. H.R. 5855 funded the 287(g) program at the FY2012 level of $68 million. ICE created the Public Advocate Office in 2012 to address concerns about ICE operations and policies. ICE created the Public Advocate Office in 2012 to assist individuals with concerns about ICE operations. Some argue that the program is not productive and a misuse of resources. P.L. 113-6 prohibits funding for the Public Advocate position within ICE. TSA, established in 2001, is responsible for protecting transportation systems in the US. The TSA's responsibilities include protecting the aviation system against terrorist threats, sabotage, and violence through passenger and baggage screening, detection systems for explosives and weapons, and other security technologies. They also assess the risk of terrorist attacks on non-aviation transportation assets, issue regulations to improve security, and serve as a liaison to law enforcement and intelligence communities. The TSA budget is complex, with various fees offsetting costs for security measures. The TSA's budget includes airline security fees to offset aviation security costs, with $250 million allocated for screening technology investments. Other fees cover transportation threat assessment and credentialing costs. The President's budget request for TSA in FY2012 included $7,645 million in gross budget authority, offset by $2,515 million in proposed collections and fees, resulting in a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,130 million. This represents a 2.5% decrease in gross funding from FY2012, but a 7.1% drop in net appropriations. Of the requested amount, $5,099 million was for aviation security, a 3.0% decrease from FY2012. Due to proposed increases in passenger security fees, only $2,914 million in net appropriations would have been provided, a 9.6% decrease. The President's budget request for TSA in FY2012 included a decrease in funding for aviation security and Surface Transportation Security. The proposed decreases reflected planned reductions in procurement for baggage and passenger checkpoint technologies, screening technology maintenance costs, and a 50% reduction in the Federal Flight Deck Officer program. Funding for transportation threat assessment and credentialing would increase under the request, including a one-time increase for infrastructure modernization. The requested funding for Transportation Security Support was set at $970 million, a decrease of $62 million (6%) from FY2012 levels. The Federal Air Marshals Service (FAMS) specified $930 million, a decrease of $36 million (3.8%). House-passed H.R. 5855 included gross budget authority of $7,498 million for TSA, offset by $2,400 million in collections and fees, for a net direct discretionary appropriation of $5,098 million. This represents a $147 million (1.9%) decrease from the gross funding requested by the administration. The House-passed bill specified $5,041 million in gross budget authority for aviation security, $57 million (1.1%) less than requested. The House-passed bill for aviation security specified $5,041 million in gross budget authority, $57 million less than requested. The bill also recommended cuts to screening operations and specified $126 million for surface transportation security, $2 million above the request. Additionally, the bill allocated $929 million for transportation security support, $41 million below the request, and $880 million for FAMS, $50 million below the request. The House-passed bill specified $929 million for transportation security support, $41 million below the request, and $880 million for FAMS, $50 million below the request. The Senate-reported bill specified gross budget authority of $7,633 million for TSA, with a net discretionary appropriation of $4,919 million, a $211 million reduction from the requested amount. The Senate accepted the proposed increases in passenger security fees, resulting in a $211 million reduction in net appropriations for aviation security. The Senate accepted the Administration's proposed increases in offsetting passenger security fees, leading to a $211 million reduction in aviation security appropriations from the Administration's request. This included cuts to checkpoint equipment procurement, explosives detection systems procurement, and screener staffing. The FFDO program received $24 million, $12 million above the request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding surface transportation security, TTAC, transportation security support, and FAMS at requested levels. TSA was provided with $7,551 million in total gross budget authority, $290 million less than the FY2012 enacted level, with sequestration further reducing budget authority by roughly an additional $339 million. The DHS FY2013 expenditure plan projected a reduction in TSA budget authority due to sequestration, with total spending for FY2013 estimated to be $7,212 million. Passenger security fees under ATSA remain at $2.50 per flight segment, raising concerns about accuracy in reflecting passenger usage. Airlines have not seen an increase in these fees since 2001. The passenger security fee has not been increased since 2001, leading to concerns about its accuracy in reflecting passenger usage. The Administration proposed changing the fee structure to a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip in FY2013, estimating a revenue increase of $317 million. Both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations have previously proposed fee increases, with little congressional support. The current proposal was supported by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported a proposal to increase passenger security fees to $5.00 per one-way trip in FY2013. The House Appropriations Committee did not include the proposal, citing jurisdictional issues. Ultimately, the fee increase was not implemented, with TSA identifying over $100 million in savings from improved management efficiencies. TSA identified over $100 million in savings from improved management efficiencies in FY2013, including reductions in travel, conferences, and overtime pay. Efficiency improvements are seen as crucial in addressing budget sequestration impacts at TSA. TSA has also implemented risk-based screening initiatives like the PreCheck trusted traveler program. TSA has initiated risk-based screening initiatives to address budget sequestration impacts, including the PreCheck trusted traveler program. Various trial programs for modified screening procedures are being tested for efficiency and potential savings. PreCheck is modeled after CBP programs and is currently available on a trial basis to select groups at limited airports, with plans for further expansion in FY2013. The PreCheck program, part of TSA's risk-based screening initiatives, is being expanded to increase screening efficiency and reduce workforce requirements. The Senate committee supports the program's expansion and has directed TSA to report on its plans, including statistics on eligible population growth, passenger satisfaction, public awareness efforts, time savings, and security measures for verifying low-risk enrollees. The committee also wants TSA to expand the known crew member pilot program to include flight attendants. The TSA's known crew member pilot program is limited to pilots, but there is a push to include flight attendants. The effectiveness of TSA's behavioral-based screening of passengers is under scrutiny, with concerns about the increase in Behavior Detection Officers. The House committee calls for a cost-benefit analysis of the program and a risk-based strategy for deployment. Additionally, there is a budget cut for the Federal Flight Deck Officer program. TSA is required to provide updates on trusted traveler approaches and any obstacles to their implementation. The House Appropriations Committee recommended keeping the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program at the FY2012 level, with an additional $10 million funding increase proposed. This increase is offset by reductions in other areas. The House also directed the TSA to revisit the use of FFDOs and other federal law enforcement assets on commercial aircraft. The Senate Appropriations Committee also disagreed with the proposed reduction in FFDO funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $24 million for the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program, disagreeing with the proposed reduction in funding. The Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for maritime homeland security, responsible for security in U.S. ports and waterways. The Coast Guard, under the Department of Homeland Security since 2003, received $8,377 million in discretionary appropriations, with differences in funding allocations between the President's request, House, and Senate. The Senate provided about $282 million more than the President's request, mainly for vessel procurement. P.L. 113-6 allocated a total of $10,400 million to the USCG. The Coast Guard received $10,400 million in total gross budget authority, with differences in funding allocations compared to the President's request. Sequestration reduced the budget authority by $268 million, leading to projected spending of $10,132 million in FY2013. Table 13 outlines funding levels for operating expenses and acquisition functions. The DHS Plan column shows budgetary resources available after sequestration, subject to potential transfers and reprogramming. Sequestration was applied on April 26, 2013, affecting the Coast Guard's funding levels. Differences in funding recommendations for FY2013 included vessel and aircraft acquisition. The President requested $139 million for two new fast response cutters, while the House and Senate bills funded more vessels and aircraft. The House provided funds for additional Response Boat Medium vessels and aircraft, while the Senate did not request funds for these aircraft under the Coast Guard's appropriation. P.L. 113-6 requires a future-years capital investment plan for FY2014. The DOD's budget request for the Coast Guard did not include funds for MH-60 helicopters. The DHS's sequestration operating plan allocated $1,030 million for vessel acquisitions, including $646 million for a national security cutter and $319 million for fast response cutters. The House bill proposed $56 million for Coast Guard housing and aids to navigation, exceeding the President's request and Senate committee recommendation by $41 million. The House bill proposed $56 million for Coast Guard housing and aids to navigation, exceeding the President's request and Senate committee recommendation by $41 million. This included $31 million for shore facilities backlog and $10 million for the Coast Guard's new headquarters. P.L. 113-6 provided $30 million for housing and aids to navigation, reduced to $29 million due to DHS's sequestration plan. The House Appropriations Committee called for implementing card readers for TWIC, while the Senate Committee requested a briefing on Interagency Operations Centers at ports. The Senate Committee on Appropriations requested a Coast Guard briefing on actions taken regarding Interagency Operations Centers at ports in light of a GAO report critical of the agency's development of these centers. The U.S. Secret Service has two main missions: criminal investigations and protection. Criminal investigation activities include financial crimes, identity theft, counterfeiting, computer fraud, and attacks on financial infrastructure. The protection mission covers the President, Vice President, their families, candidates for those offices, and foreign missions in the District. The U.S. Secret Service's protection mission is its primary focus, encompassing the President, Vice President, their families, and candidates for those offices, as well as the White House and Vice President's residence. Additionally, the Service provides security for foreign missions in the District of Columbia, designated individuals like the DHS Secretary, and visiting foreign dignitaries. They are also responsible for security at National Special Security Events (NSSE), such as national conventions and international conferences. The requested appropriation for the USSS in FY2013 was $1,601 million, with $988 million allocated for the protection mission. The Administration requested $1,601 million for the USSS in FY2013, with $988 million for its protection mission. The House-passed version of the DHS appropriations bill recommended $1,613 million, a decrease of $54 million from FY2012. The reduction in budget was due to the conclusion of the 2012 Presidential campaign season. The Senate-reported version included specific funding restorations and increases for Electronic Crimes programs. The Senate recommended an appropriation of $1,613 million for the USSS in FY2013, which was $12 million above the Administration's request. They restored $8 million for USSS support for the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and provided $4 million for priority domestic investigations. Congress ultimately appropriated $1.611 billion for USSS in FY2013, $56 million less than the previous year. In FY2013, Congress appropriated $1.611 billion for the Secret Service, which was $56 million less than the previous year. Following the sequester, the Service plans to expend $1.527 billion, with a reduction primarily in appropriations for its protection and investigation mission. One potential ongoing issue for Congress is balancing the investigative and protective missions of the Service. The USSS's protection mission receives more resources and attention from Congress compared to its investigative mission. Recent focus has been on agent misconduct and potential threats to the President, leading to increased protection activities. Advocates suggest enhancing protection through better threat investigations. The DHS appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies, with a request for $5,911 million. The DHS appropriations bill contains funding for various agencies, with a request for $5,911 million in FY2013. The House-passed bill would have provided $5,930 million, while the Senate-reported bill would have provided $5,971 million. Additionally, both versions included $5,481 million for disaster relief, with adjustments under the Budget Control Act. P.L. 113-6 ultimately provided $5,920 million and $6,400 million for disaster relief. The Appropriations Act (P.L. 112-77) provided $5,920 million in funding for FY2013, a 0.2% increase from the requested level and 4.3% above FY2012. It also included $6,400 million for disaster relief offset by adjustments under the Budget Control Act. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) was established in response to the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006, encompassing various offices including Infrastructure Protection and Cybersecurity. The National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) includes the Office of Infrastructure Protection, Office of Cybersecurity and Communications, and the US-VISIT program. The Administration proposed relocating US-VISIT activities. The House suggested keeping some functions in a new Office of Biometric Identify Management. The FY2013 budget request for NPPD was $1,217 million, a decrease from FY2012. Management and Administration budget request was $50 million, similar to FY2012 levels. The Administration requested $1,217 million for NPPD activities in FY2013, $29 million less than FY2012. The FY2013 Management and Administration budget request was $50 million, reflecting a transfer of functions to the DHS Office of Policy. The FY2013 request for IPIS was $1,167 million, with a significant increase directed towards securing federal information systems. This included a $202 million initiative for Federal Network Security and a $116 million increase for Network Security Deployment. The FY2013 budget request for NPPD activities included a $116 million increase for the Network Security Deployment project, supporting the expansion of the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS). This funding would enhance deployment of the 3.0 version for active defenses against intrusions and development of version 2.2 for threat visualization and information sharing. Additional funding was allocated for US-CERT for data analysis and for the Multi-State Information Security and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) to support state and local cybersecurity efforts. The FY2013 budget request for NPPD activities included a decrease in funding for infrastructure protection and communications. The reduction in infrastructure protection was mainly due to a decrease in the budget for the Infrastructure Security Compliance project. This project ensures compliance with Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards at covered facilities. The reduction in funding was considered a baseline adjustment, with some funds being attributed to NPPD's ability to obligate funds. Additionally, there were reductions in contract support for incident planning exercises, with activities and personnel being transferred to other infrastructure protection projects. The House proposed a budget of $1,347 million for NPPD, with reductions in funding for Management and Administration, IPIS, and the Security Compliance project. Concerns were raised about the department's compliance with statutory requirements and ability to obligate funds for the NCPS deployment. The House proposed a budget of $1,347 million for NPPD, with reductions in funding for various projects including the NCPS deployment. They also directed NPPD to work with the Coast Guard on program implementation and consider using alternative security programs. Other reductions were made in different projects, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,220 million for NPPD. The House proposed a budget of $1,347 million for NPPD, with reductions in funding for various projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,220 million for NPPD, with specific allocations for security capabilities and continuous monitoring. The Committee recommended funding adjustments for various cybersecurity projects within the Federal Network Security initiative, including withholding $120 million until an expenditure plan is provided. They also emphasized the importance of cybersecurity education and improving the cybersecurity posture of state and local governments. The Committee recommended funding adjustments for cybersecurity projects, including increases for emergency communication-related projects. P.L. 113-6 provides $1,439 million for NPPD/IPIS and OBIM, with $1,337 million after sequestration. Management and Administration receive $50 million, IPIS program $1,157 million, and Biometric Identity Management $232 million. The operating plan allocates $1,337 million to NPPD/IPIS and OBIM for FY2014. Specific allocations include $48 million for Management and Administration, $1,065 million for IPIS, and $224 million for Biometric Identity Management. Funds for IPIS cover various areas such as cybersecurity education, CFATS, and Federal Network Security program. Additional instructions were provided for CFATS in the Consolidated and Further. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act provides instructions for federal agencies to acquire monitoring equipment and software without supplanting agency funds. GAO and the Coast Guard will assess DHS progress on the CFATS program, including inspection quality and training. NPPD must report semiannually on compliance and present alternative security program briefings. Agencies must submit cybersecurity expenditure plans and quarterly reports to OMB. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act instructs federal agencies to improve cybersecurity by submitting expenditure plans and quarterly reports to OMB. The DHS is assessing post-sequester resources and addressing issues with CFATS compliance. Congress is closely monitoring cybersecurity efforts. The DHS is reviewing the CFATS program and working on solutions. Congress is interested in oversight. Cybersecurity has been a focus in Congress, with bills addressing various aspects. Legislation expanding DHS's role may require additional resources. The Federal Protective Service is responsible for security of federal property. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for the protection and security of federal property, personnel, and buildings. FPS operations focus on security and law enforcement activities to reduce vulnerability to criminal and terrorist threats. They conduct risk assessments, implement countermeasures, provide law enforcement response, and assist federal agencies with security. FPS is the lead agency for the National Infrastructure Protection Plan and employs approximately 1,225 law enforcement officers and administrative personnel. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) employs 1,225 law enforcement officers and administrative personnel, along with 13,000 contract security guards. The President's FY2013 budget request included $1,302 million for FPS, $40 million more than FY2012. FPS's budget is funded by security fees from GSA building tenants. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended no specific changes to the FPS budget but required a briefing on management and budget improvement efforts. The Senate Appropriations Committee report required the Office of Under Secretary for NPPD, in conjunction with the FPS Director, to brief the committee on FPS management and budget improvement efforts. No specific changes to the FPS budget were recommended in P.L. 113-6 or the accompanying explanatory statement. FPS was directed to brief the appropriations committees on their progress in implementing recommendations made in GAO report GAO-12-852. Congress continues to express concern over certain aspects of the FPS mission and how FPS is funded. Several pieces of legislation were mentioned to improve training of contract guards, federalizing contract guards, developing standards for checkpoint detection technologies, and coordinating DHS efforts with the Interagency Security Committee for building security standards. In the 113th Congress, legislation such as H.R. 735, the Federal Protective Service Improvement and Accountability Act of 2013, has been introduced to enhance federal building security by setting staffing levels in the FPS inspector force and exploring the use of federal employees instead of contract guards. The Office of Health Affairs oversees programs like the BioWatch program and the National Biosurveillance Integration Center, as well as coordinating DHS programs with public health or medical components. The Office of Health Affairs (OHA) oversees various programs including BioWatch, NBIC, and occupational health and safety programs. OHA received $167 million in FY2012 and requested $166 million for FY2013. The proposed allocation includes funding for BioWatch, NBIC, Chemical Defense Program, Planning and Coordination, and Salaries and Expenses. The House-passed bill would have provided $132 million for FY2013, with a decrease largely reflecting a decrease for the BioWatch program. The House-passed bill for FY2013 allocated $132 million, $35 million less than FY2012, and $34 million less than the President's request. The Senate-reported bill proposed $168 million, $1 million more than FY2012 and $2 million more than the President's request. The Senate committee recommended amounts requested for BioWatch, with small increases for Planning and Coordination and Salaries and Expenses, and $2 million for the Chemical Defense Program. After across-the-board cuts, P.L. 113-6 provided $132 million for OHA, 21.0% less than FY2012, and 20.5% less than the President's request. The OHA budget for FY2013 saw reductions in total enacted budget authority, largely due to decreased funding for BioWatch as recommended by the House. The enacted funding amounts for OHA components for FY2013 under P.L. 113-6 reflected across-the-board cuts, with the DHS Plan column providing the department's assessment of post-sequester resources. The House Appropriations Committee noted the separation of activities to monitor threats posed by weapons of mass destruction, including the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. The House Appropriations Committee recommended merging the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) and the Office of Health Affairs (OHA) into an Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Defense for FY2014. The Senate also called for a comprehensive review of WMD operations, including potential cost savings from an OHA/DNDO merger, to be submitted to Congress by September 1, 2013. The BioWatch program deploys sensors in over 30 U.S. cities to detect bioterrorism threats. The BioWatch program, which detects bioterrorism threats in large U.S. cities, is a major part of OHA's budget. There have been challenges with deploying more advanced sensors, known as \"Gen-3,\" due to technical and management issues. The estimated cost for Gen-3 is $5.8 billion, raising questions about its justification. Congressional appropriators have shown interest in BioWatch's performance and have at times limited funding or called for reviews. The BioWatch program's performance has drawn attention from Congress, leading to funding limitations and program reviews. The decreased funding for FY2013 hinders the development of Gen-3 capability. FEMA's primary mission is to reduce loss of life and property from all hazards, executing this through various activities and grant programs. The Administration requested a total discretionary appropriation of $4,528. The Administration requested a total discretionary appropriation of $4,528 million for FEMA for FY2013, primarily funded through the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) and Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund. The budget increase of $261 million (6.1%) over FY2012 was proposed, with an additional $5,481 million for the DRF. House-passed H.R. 5855 would have provided $4,451 million for FEMA, a decrease from the President's request. Senate-reported S. 3216 also proposed funding for FEMA. The House and Senate proposed different funding amounts for FEMA in FY2013, with the House providing $4,351 million and the Senate offering $4,582 million. The final amount allocated after sequestration was $4,150 million, with additional funds for the Disaster Relief Fund. After sequestration, FEMA would receive $4,150 million from Title III provisions and $6,076 million from the disaster relief cap adjustment under the BCA. State and local governments may reduce public safety resources due to budget constraints, impacting homeland security preparedness. State and local governments may reduce resources for public safety and homeland security preparedness due to budget constraints. President Obama issued a directive for the development of a national preparedness goal, superseding a previous homeland security directive. The national preparedness goal supersedes a previous homeland security directive and aims to define core capabilities for preparing against various threats. The goal focuses on enhancing the nation's ability to prevent, respond to, and recover from domestic terrorist attacks, disasters, and emergencies. The Secretary of DHS released the first National Preparedness Goal in 2011, emphasizing a whole community approach to preparedness. Several additional homeland security grant programs were added post-9/11 to ensure state and local preparedness, including SHSGP, CCP, UASI, REAL ID, Stonegarden, RCPG, Transit Grants, Port Security Grants, and Over-the-Road Bus Security Assistance. The federal government provides various grant programs for state and local government homeland security preparedness, including REAL ID, Stonegarden, RCPG, Transit Grants, Port Security Grants, Over-the-Road Bus Security Assistance, BZPP, IECGP, and EOC. However, these grants account for less than one percent of the total $218 billion spent annually by state and local governments on public safety. The President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for state and local government homeland security preparedness for FY2013. The President requested $1.8 billion in federal grants for state and local government homeland security preparedness for FY2013, including funding for a National Preparedness Grant Program. However, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concerns about consolidating state and local preparedness grant programs without proper authorization and stakeholder participation. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the lack of stakeholder participation in the development of the proposal to consolidate state and local preparedness grants. The House recommended $1.7 billion for State and Local Programs, rejecting the consolidation proposal and recommending the continuation of the grant structure enacted in FY2012. Grant funding would be distributed at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security under various grant programs. The House recommended $1.7 billion for various homeland security grant programs, including Operation Stonegarden, high-risk areas, and education/training/exercises. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.6 billion for FY2013, with allocations for State Homeland Security Grant Program, Urban Area Security Initiative, and Public Transportation Security Assistance. The State Homeland Security Grant Program received $55 million for Operation Stonegarden, $676 million for Urban Area Security Initiative, $132 million for Public Transportation Security/Bus Assistance, $132 million for Port Security Grants, and $234 million for education, training, and exercises. The total funding for state and local programs was $1,467 million, a decrease of 20.3% from the requested level. Sequestration further reduced budget authority by $77 million, resulting in $1,400 million for state and local programs. P.L. 113-6 removes a transfer from grant programs paying FEMA's administrative costs, increasing total funding by $132 million compared to FY2012. The DHS Plan assesses post-sequester resources, with $670 million proposed for firefighter assistance grants. A percentage of AFG funding may be set aside for grant program management. Grant administration would shift to the State and Local Programs under the Administration's FY2013 budget proposal. The Administration proposed shifting grant administration to the State and Local Programs office for AFG funding. SAFER grants could be used to maintain firefighter staffing levels. The House-passed bill funded firefighter assistance at $675 million, denying the request to shift AFG and SAFER grants. The Senate-reported bill also proposed $675 million for firefighter assistance. The Senate-reported bill proposed $675 million for firefighter assistance, with $337.5 million each for AFG and SAFER grants. It denied the Administration's request to shift AFG and SAFER into the State and Local Programs account. Post-sequestration, P.L. 113-6 funded firefighter assistance at $642 million, with administrative costs derived from the FEMA Salaries and Expense account. DHS was granted SAFER waiver authority for FY2013. The DRF is the main account used to fund various emergency and disaster assistance programs. It is often depleted before the end of the fiscal year due to ongoing recovery efforts from major events. There has been a reliance on supplemental funding due to underfunding the DRF, with the Administration requesting $6,088 million for FY2013, a decrease from the previous year. The Administration requested $6,088 million for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) for FY2013, a decrease from the previous year. The request included $608 million for non-disaster activities and $5,481 million for disaster relief costs. This reflects the impact of the Budget Control Act, allowing disaster costs to be paid through an \"allowable adjustment\" to discretionary spending caps. The FY2013 request was more than three times the size of the previous year's request. The FY2013 request for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) was adjusted downward by $1,200 million to account for projected recovery of funds not needed for past disasters. Both the House-passed bill and the Senate-reported bills carried the same level of funding for the DRF as the Administration requested for FY2013. Additionally, both pieces of legislation included an unrequested transfer of $24 million out of the DRF to the DHS Office of Inspector General for audits and investigations on disaster-related spending. After the across-the-board cuts, P.L. 113-6 funded the DRF at $7,007 million, with $24 million allocated for audits on public assistance projects exceeding $10 million. Prior to sequestration, P.L. 113-6 funded the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) at $7,007 million, with $24 million allocated for audits by the DHS Office of Inspector General. This amount was $918 million more than the Administration's initial request. Sequestration later reduced the funding to $6,653 million. The Budget Control Act included provisions for an \"allowable adjustment\" for disaster relief to prevent triggering a sequestration due to federal spending exceeding allocation. The Budget Control Act allows for an \"allowable adjustment\" for disaster relief to prevent sequestration from federal spending exceeding allocation. Funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is separate from disaster relief funding under the BCA, with access to roughly $7.3 billion during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) received additional pre-sequester resources in FY2013 through the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013. The Administration and Congress provided emergency funding designations to cover the relief exceeding the allowable adjustment. FY2013 marked the first time the DRF received all available funding under the Budget Control Act's allowable adjustment for disaster relief. In FY2013, the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) received all available funding under the Budget Control Act's allowable adjustment for disaster relief. The Administration proposed eliminating the Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) program, stating it duplicated the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) and other mitigation programs. PDM awards grants prior to disasters, unlike HMGP, and covers all hazards, unlike NFIP programs which only address flood hazards. Despite having unobligated balances, the program was suggested for phase-out without legislative language in the House-passed or Senate-reported bills. In FY2013, the PDM program had over $174 million in unobligated balances, allowing for continued grant awards despite proposed phase-out. The House and Senate bills did not include language to end the program, but proposed reduced appropriations due to slow award pace and large unobligated balance. Challenges arise with funding at just under $25 million, making it difficult to fund state minimum awards and conduct a new round of applications and awards. In FY2013, funding for the EFS program faced challenges due to reduced award amounts and difficulties in funding state minimum awards. The Administration proposed $100 million for the program, a reduction from previous levels. Congress funded the program at $120 million in FY2012, but the post-sequester funding level for FY2013 was just under $114 million, the lowest since FY2000. Concerns also arose over delayed program funding. The post-sequester funding level for the EFS program in FY2013 is just under $114 million, the lowest since FY2000. Concerns also arose over delayed distribution of funds during FY2012. Title IV of the DHS appropriations bill includes funding for USCIS, FLETC, S&T, and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. The Administration requested $1,561 million for these accounts in FY2013, with the House-passed bill providing $1,510 million and the Senate-reported bill providing $1,535 million. After across-the-board cuts but prior to sequestration, P.L. 113-6 provides $1,520 million. The Senate-reported bill provides $1,535 million, 1.7% below the request and 15.2% above FY2012. P.L. 113-6 provides $1,520 million, a decrease of 0.5% from the requested level and 2.2% above FY2012. USCIS activities include adjudication of immigration petitions, naturalization petitions, and refugee/asylum claims. The USCIS is responsible for processing work authorizations, travel documents, naturalization petitions, refugee/asylum claims, and citizenship benefits. They receive funding through direct appropriations and fees from immigration benefit applications. The agency has received annual appropriations for specific projects like reducing backlogs and the E-verify program. The USCIS receives funding through direct appropriations and fees from immigration benefit applications, with a requested gross budget authority of $3,005 million for FY2013. This includes funding for specific projects like reducing backlogs and the E-verify program, as well as adjudication services, information and customer services, and administration expenses. The House-passed H.R. 5855 proposed a USCIS budget of $3,004 million for FY2013, with $112 million from direct appropriations and $2,892 million from fee collections. The recommended level did not include funds for a requested pay increase and directed USCIS to use fee revenues for all costs except E-Verify. The Committee recommended allocating $20 million for the SAVE program and at least $29 million for digital conversion of immigration records. The Committee directed USCIS to allocate $20 million for the SAVE program and at least $29 million for digital conversion of immigration records. It also recommended no direct appropriations for military naturalizations, proposing USCIS budget authority for FY2013 at $2,999 million with $117 million from direct appropriations and $2,882 million from fee collections. The Committee expressed concerns about USCIS adjudication procedures and fraud detection, directing USCIS to provide a progress report on corrective actions and OIG to brief on its assessment. The Committee recommended no direct appropriations for the SAVE program, instead directing USCIS to allocate $20 million of user fee revenues. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $112 million for the E-Verify program. Additionally, $5 million was recommended for Immigrant Integration grants in direct appropriations, with an additional $5 million available via fees. The Committee expressed concerns about the costs of administering the grant program and directed that no more than 5% of the funding be used for administration. The FY2013 grant award total was $114 million, a decrease from the requested level but an increase from the FY2012 enacted level. Sequestration would reduce this to $109 million. Potential issues for Congress included concerns about fee-generated funding and immigrant integration. For FY2013, potential issues for Congress included concerns about fee-generated funding, immigrant integration grants, USCIS Transformation program, E-Verify operability, paper record digitization, and refugee processing. USCIS must monitor fee revenues to avoid backlogs. Congress is debating how to fund immigrant integration grants. The Administration requested $11 million in appropriations for immigrant integration grants in FY2013, but Congress decided that program funding should come from fee revenue. USCIS was required to allocate $7.5 million from the Immigration Examinations Fee Account funds for the grants, with an additional $2.5 million in appropriations. The House Committee expressed disappointment with the lack of progress on the USCIS Transformation program, questioning the justification for continued investment in the current contract. The Committee questioned the investment in the current contract for immigration benefits, directing USCIS to provide updates on the application form release. Congress extended E-Verify authorization and directed USCIS to create a review process for final non-confirmations. The Senate Committee requested reports on expanding E-Verify and its use in the agricultural industry. The House Committee directed USCIS to report on the cost of expanding E-Verify and its use in the agricultural industry. They emphasized the need to increase efficiency, reduce expenses, and convert immigration records to digital format. Additionally, USCIS and CBP were instructed to brief Congress on progress towards eliminating paper forms like USCIS Form I-94. The Committee expressed concerns about coordination issues affecting the processing of vulnerable individuals. The House Committee directed USCIS to report on expanding E-Verify in the agricultural industry and converting immigration records to digital format. They also emphasized the need to eliminate paper forms like USCIS Form I-94 and expressed concerns about coordination issues in processing vulnerable individuals. The Senate Committee urged DHS to use parole authority for urgent humanitarian needs and allocate resources for responding to natural disasters. The Committee urged the Secretary to allocate resources for responding to natural disasters. The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center provides training to federal, state, and local law enforcement entities. The Administration proposed a budget of $258 million for FLETC, a reduction of $13 million from the previous year. The Administration proposed a budget of $258 million for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), a reduction of $13 million from the previous year. The budget includes two appropriations - Salaries and Expenses at $229 million and Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses at $29 million. Reductions were made in basic training and construction work, with the House-passed bill allocating $256 million for FLETC. The House Appropriations Committee reduced the Acquisition, Construction, Improvements, and Related Expenses appropriation for FLETC by $2 million (6.8%) due to reliance on unauthorized fee increases. The Senate-reported bill included $258 million for FLETC, matching the President's request. The DHS FY2013 operating plan indicated sequestration would decrease funding to $245 million for FLETC. The DHS Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) is the primary organization for research and development within DHS. The Administration requested $831 million for the S&T Directorate for FY2013, a 25% increase from FY2012. The largest increase in funding was for disaster resilience R&D. There was a reduction in funding for Laboratory Facilities due to the lack of construction funding for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). The requested funding for the DHS Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) for FY2013 saw a significant increase, with a focus on disaster resilience R&D. However, there was a reduction in funding for Laboratory Facilities, specifically due to the lack of construction funding for the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF). The House-passed bill allocated $826 million for the S&T Directorate, slightly less than the request, with a directive to allocate reductions across different areas and an increase in funding for NBAF construction. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding levels for the DHS Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) that matched the Administration's request. They specified separate amounts for each of the six thrust areas within RDI. The committee did not recommend funding for NBAF construction, citing a total cost estimate of $1.138 billion. After adjustments, the S&T Directorate received $834 million, with $28 million less than requested for RDI. The committee directed DHS to provide a breakdown of RDI funding by thrust area. Additionally, $37 million more than requested was allocated for Laboratory Facilities, to be used for NBAF construction. The post-sequester total for the S&T Directorate was reported as $801 million. The DHS Plan column outlines post-sequester resources for the S&T Directorate, totaling $801 million. The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is responsible for nuclear detection research and received a requested increase of 13% for FY2013. The Administration proposed a $328 million budget for DNDO, with a significant increase for Transformational R&D. The FY2013 budget request for DNDO included an increase of $44 million for Transformational R&D, with no proposed transfer to S&T. There was a reduction of $23 million for Systems Development. The House-passed bill would have provided $316 million for DNDO, with a focus on the Transformational R&D program. The House Appropriations Committee advocated for consolidation of DNDO with the DHS Office of Health Affairs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended an annual requirement for a plan to merge DNDO with the DHS Office of Health Affairs for cost savings and better coordination in efforts against WMDs. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported DNDO funding levels and requested an updated implementation plan for domestic nuclear detection. The Senate report did not mention annual requirements or consolidation of DNDO and OHA. The Senate Appropriations Committee report did not address the House language about an annual requirement for a plan to merge DNDO with the DHS Office of Health Affairs. The committee provided $318 million for DNDO before sequestration, $9 million less than requested for Transformational R&D. The act directs DHS to update its implementation plan for the domestic portion of the global nuclear detection architecture. The explanatory statement also instructs DHS to review its WMD programs and consider the benefits of consolidation, including merging DNDO and OHA. The post-sequester total appropriation for DNDO is $303 million. The post-sequester total appropriation for DNDO, as reported by DHS, is $303 million. The DHS appropriations bill contains general provisions that may include rescissions of funding from previous years and appropriations for special initiatives. The Administration generally requests rescissions in specific accounts rather than through general provisions. The Administration proposed rescissions and changes to general provisions in the FY2013 DHS Appropriations bill, including not carrying forward certain provisions from the previous year and adding new provisions such as extending the termination deadline for E-Verify. The Administration proposed adding new general provisions in the FY2013 DHS Appropriations bill, including extending the termination deadline for E-Verify, allowing FEMA to use earmarked grant funds, establishing an outreach program for dam safety, making certain fees available for customs inspectors, and allowing CBP to enter into fee agreements for services. The House-passed H.R. 5855 includes $292 million in rescissions in Title V, impacting the bill's score. The House concurred with dropping 22 general provisions but disagreed on 13 others. The House concurred with the Administration's request to drop 22 general provisions in the FY2013 DHS Appropriations bill. They added one provision to extend the termination deadline for E-Verify and included 13 new provisions during floor action, such as prohibiting funds for certain activities related to racial profiling and ICE rules for undocumented aliens. The curr_chunk discusses various actions that the government should enforce or restrict, such as prohibiting the use of alternative transportation fuels that produce more greenhouse gases than conventional petroleum fuel, using CBP funds for operations in Puerto Rico, restricting the sharing of immigration status information, and following laws related to immigration and deportation. The curr_chunk outlines restrictions on activities such as operating armed unmanned aerial vehicles, enforcing executive orders for limited English proficiency access, implementing ICE policy memos, and terminating local immigration officer agreements. It also includes $192 million in rescissions and other provisions impacting the bill's scoring. The Senate bill, S. 3216, includes $192 million in rescissions and various provisions affecting the bill's scoring. It offsets its cost by $68 million and modifies funding for DHS initiatives for FY2013. The Senate concurred with dropping 15 general provisions but disagreed on 17 others. Additionally, the Senate Appropriations Committee added a provision allowing CBP to enter into reimbursable fee agreements. The Senate Appropriations Committee added a provision allowing CBP to enter into reimbursable fee agreements for providing services. P.L. 113-6 includes $307 million in rescissions in Title V, offsetting the cost of the act by $202 million. The enacted bill dropped ten general provisions sought by the Administration and included funding for various DHS initiatives. The Senate Appropriations Committee added provisions for CBP to enter into reimbursable fee agreements. The enacted bill included funding for various DHS initiatives, such as reimbursement of security costs for National Special Security Events, migration and consolidation of DHS data centers, and DHS headquarters consolidation. Federal government spending involves a process of budget authority, obligations, and outlays, with budget authority established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than enacted budget authority. The Antideficiency Act restricts federal agencies from exceeding budget authority enacted by Congress, which can be one-year, multi-year, or no-year. Obligations are incurred when agencies use funds for personnel, contracts, etc., while outlays are the actual spending. Outlays may not always align with budget authority due to multi-year obligations. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary spending appropriated yearly by Congress and mandatory spending provided in laws other than appropriation acts. The federal budget includes discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is appropriated annually by Congress, while mandatory spending is provided in laws outside of appropriation acts. Mandatory spending includes entitlements that must be appropriated each year. Offsetting collections are funds collected by the government through business-type transactions, not counted as revenue but as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority is the total funds appropriated by Congress each year, composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset spending. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retirement pay accounts, funded by permanent or annual appropriations. Additionally, there are offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds not appropriated by Congress, used to calculate gross budget authority. The DHS budget includes offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, not appropriated by Congress, for calculating gross budget authority. Homeland security funding analysis has become more refined over the years, making year-to-year comparisons less strictly comparable. The DHS budget includes Trust and Public Enterprise Funds not appropriated by Congress for calculating gross budget authority. DHS funding for homeland security in FY2012 accounted for 52% of total federal funding, with the Department of Defense at 26%, Department of Health and Human Services at 6%, Department of Justice at 6%, and Department of State at over 3%. These top five agencies collectively made up 93% of federal spending on homeland security. Not all DHS funding is classified as homeland security-related. The DHS budget for FY2012 accounted for 93% of federal spending on homeland security, totaling $35.1 billion. However, the total budget authority for DHS was $52.5 billion, including non-homeland security activities. Inconsistencies exist between homeland security budget authority and total budget authority, with no authoritative data available for FY2013 due to budget release timing."
