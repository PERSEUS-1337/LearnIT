    "content": "The PACT Act requires remote retailers to pay state and local taxes before delivering cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Three retailers challenged the Act, claiming it violates the Due Process Clause. Courts have granted preliminary injunctions, suggesting the Act may violate due process. The PACT Act's requirement for remote retailers to pay state and local taxes may violate due process, as courts have granted preliminary injunctions in favor of the plaintiffs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld one injunction, while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will consider another on appeal. The federal district court in Musser's Inc. v. United States rejected the due process argument, stating that the PACT Act is a federal statute requiring compliance with state and local laws. The court found that the plaintiff had minimum contacts with the jurisdictions it shipped tobacco products to through its interactive website. The Supreme Court stated in Quill that Congress cannot authorize violations of the Due Process Clause when regulating interstate commerce. The constitutionality of the PACT Act for remote retailers depends on minimum contacts with jurisdictions. In Quill, the Court emphasized that minimum contacts are based on purposeful availment of an economic market in a state. The PACT Act requires remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to comply with state laws, increase tax collection, deter smuggling, and reduce youth access. It deems interstate sales as intrastate sales to boost tax revenue. The PACT Act deems interstate sales as intrastate sales, requiring compliance with all state laws and tax obligations. Remote sellers must pay all applicable taxes and apply required stamps before delivery. State taxation of out-of-state businesses is governed by the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause. The PACT Act deems interstate sales as intrastate sales, requiring compliance with all state laws and tax obligations. State taxation of out-of-state businesses is governed by the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause. The Due Process Clause prohibits states from imposing taxes on foreign businesses without a sufficient connection to the state and taxes that reasonably relate to the value received. The remote retailers have challenged the PACT Act under the Due Process Clause, citing the Supreme Court's opinion in Quill regarding physical presence requirements for tax collection. The Supreme Court's opinion in Quill addressed whether an out-of-state retailer could be required to collect a use tax in North Dakota without a physical presence. The Court cited Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz to support the idea that jurisdiction can be established even without physical presence due to modern business practices involving mail and wire communications across state lines. In modern commercial life, business conducted solely by mail and wire communications across state lines can establish jurisdiction without physical presence. The Supreme Court's ruling in Quill emphasized that directing activities towards residents of another state, such as sending catalogues, provides fair warning of potential tax liability. The key issue is whether the out-of-state business has purposefully directed its activities at the taxing state, satisfying the requirement for minimum contacts. The issue at hand is whether an out-of-state business has sufficient minimum contacts with a taxing state to be liable for taxes. In the case of Red Earth, members of the Seneca Nation of Indians who own tobacco retail businesses sought to block the enforcement of the PACT Act's tax requirements. The plaintiffs argued that the Act violated due process by subjecting them to taxing jurisdiction without adequate contacts. The court rejected the argument that maintaining a website alone provided minimum contacts, noting that not all plaintiffs had websites. The court rejected the argument that maintaining a website alone provided minimum contacts for out-of-state businesses to be liable for taxes. The court also found that shipments into a state did not satisfy the minimum contacts requirement. The court rejected the argument that maintaining a website alone provided minimum contacts for out-of-state businesses to be liable for taxes. It also rejected the United States' argument that a shipment into a state satisfied the minimum contacts requirement, stating that a single sale may not be enough to subject a seller to a foreign jurisdiction. The court emphasized that a continuous and widespread solicitation of business within a state, rather than a single sale, is more likely to establish minimum contacts. The court ruled that the PACT Act violated the Due Process Clause by broadening the jurisdictional reach of states without considering minimum contacts. The district court granted a preliminary injunction, which was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The issue was whether Congress can require a vendor to submit to the taxing jurisdiction of any state with at least one sale, regardless of the extent of the vendor's contact. The Court of Appeals upheld the district court's preliminary injunction on the PACT Act, which requires a seller to collect state and local taxes based on one delivery. The Supreme Court has never determined if a single sale satisfies due process requirements, but previous holdings suggest otherwise. The district court's decision on this close legal question was reasonable, so there is no need to decide on the merits at this stage. The district court upheld the preliminary injunction on the PACT Act, which requires sellers to collect state and local taxes based on one delivery. The plaintiff in Musser's sought an injunction on the grounds of the PACT Act violating the Due Process Clause. The court rejected the injunction under two alternative analyses, stating that the tax-payment requirement is imposed by Congress, not by states unilaterally. The court upheld the preliminary injunction on the PACT Act, which requires sellers to collect state and local taxes based on one delivery. Congress, not states unilaterally, imposes the tax-payment requirement, ensuring compliance with state and local laws for interstate businesses. The court's analysis distinguishes Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause from state taxation issues. The plaintiff had minimum contacts in all 50 states. The court concluded that the plaintiff had minimum contacts in all 50 states due to the interactive nature of its website, using the sliding scale approach to determine personal jurisdiction over online activities. The court determined that an interactive website with commercial transactions can establish minimum contacts for personal jurisdiction. In Musser's case, the plaintiff's website allowed customers to place orders, make payments, and have products delivered to different states, satisfying due process concerns. This suggests that even a single sale through an interactive website can meet the minimum contacts requirement. The court's reasoning suggests that a single sale through an interactive website can establish minimum contacts for personal jurisdiction. Gordon, a member of the Seneca Nation of Indians, sought to challenge the PACT Act's tax requirements on the grounds of due process. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's decision, stating that the motion was timely and offering observations on Due Process violations. The Court of Appeals reversed the district court's decision on Gordon's challenge to the PACT Act's tax requirements, stating that the motion was timely. They noted that Due Process violations can still occur even with Congress authorizing state levies based on minimum contacts. The government argued that Gordon only needed minimum contacts with the United States, not individual states, and that Quill's analytical approach is relevant to the case. The government argued that Gordon only needed minimum contacts with the United States, not individual states, to comply with the PACT Act. They also claimed that each of Gordon's tobacco sales into a state satisfied minimum contacts with that state. The court distinguished previous cases where interstate businesses were not subject to the jurisdiction of any particular states, stating that the PACT Act imposed a new duty on delivery sellers. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit had rejected the argument that Congress had plenary power to regulate commerce among the States. The court discussed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's rejection of Congress's plenary power argument in relation to state and local taxes. They also reviewed the due process cases and minimum contacts law, citing International Shoe Co. v. Washington. The court reviewed due process cases on personal jurisdiction, citing International Shoe Co. v. Washington and Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz. Personal jurisdiction is found when a defendant's activities create a substantial connection with the forum state. The court emphasized that personal jurisdiction is established when a defendant's activities create a substantial connection with the forum state, as noted in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz. The focus is on foreseeability, where the defendant should reasonably anticipate being haled into court in that forum. This provides predictability to the legal system for potential defendants. The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of foreseeability in establishing personal jurisdiction, providing predictability to the legal system for potential defendants. In Quill, the Court found that minimum contacts with a state were sufficient for due process purposes, as the defendant purposefully directed activities at residents of the state. The district court found that the Quill standard was not met in Gordon, as it did not purposefully avail itself of the benefits of the economic market of the states it sold products in. The court also did not find a rational connection between the tax on Gordon's products and the values of the taxing state. The PACT Act may violate due process as it authorizes state taxation of out-of-state businesses without considering protection or benefits received from the state. This could conflict with the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause requirements. The PACT Act may not comply with the Due Process Clause if it subjects out-of-state businesses to state taxation without minimum contacts. Courts have analyzed its constitutionality under the Due Process Clause, questioning if a single sale into a jurisdiction meets the minimum contacts requirement. The opinion in Musser's may have mixed the Commerce Clause and due process analyses. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit noted that this issue is a \"close question.\""
