    "content": "A biologic or biological product is a therapeutic drug or vaccine made from living organisms, while a biosimilar is a similar but not identical version of a brand-name biologic. Unlike biologics, most drugs are synthesized chemically and generic drugs are identical to their brand-name counterparts. The molecular structure of chemical drugs is simpler compared to biologics. The FDA regulates both biologics and chemical drugs. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) regulates traditional biologics, gene therapy products, and human tissue used in transplantation. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) regulates prescription and over-the-counter drugs, as well as most therapeutic biologics. Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade, was approved by the FDA in April 2016. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) regulates prescription brand-name and generic drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and most therapeutic biologics. Examples of therapeutic biologics include monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, growth factors, and enzymes. Monoclonal antibodies like infliximab are used to treat various conditions. Cytokines are proteins that control the immune system, growth factors regulate cell division, and enzymes speed up chemical reactions in the body. Biologics, including hormones and enzymes, play a crucial role in cell functions and cancer treatment. They require special handling and are often administered via injection or infusion. Specialty drugs, like biologics, can be expensive due to their unique requirements. The term specialty drugs refers to expensive drugs that require special handling, such as biologics like Soliris and Vimizim. Spending on biologics in the US totaled $105.5 billion in 2016, with a 13% increase over 2015. Biologics spending has been increasing by 10% annually since 2011, driven by Medicare Part B program. Spending on biologics in the Medicare Part B program has been increasing significantly, with biologics accounting for 63% of prescription drug spending in 2014. Biologic drugs are more expensive in the US compared to Europe and Canada, where the introduction of biosimilars has led to price reductions. Congress has passed acts like the Hatch-Waxman Act to provide lower-cost alternatives for chemical drugs and biologics. The Hatch-Waxman Act, passed in 1984, allows FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, lowering drug costs by 60-90%. Generic drugs must demonstrate sameness to the original product, relying on FDA's safety and effectiveness findings. This interchangeability allows for cost savings by avoiding clinical trials and initial research costs. The FDA's approval of generic drugs is based on the safety and effectiveness of the reference drug. The biotechnology industry developed its first biologics for human therapeutic use in the 1980s, with products like human insulin and growth hormone. Biological products are regulated by the FDA through a biologics license application under the Public Health Service Act. The FDA regulates biological products through a biologics license application (BLA) under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). In 1972, regulatory responsibility was transferred to the FDA from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Hatch-Waxman Act allowed for the approval of generic drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), but did not provide a mechanism for follow-on biologics/biosimilars under the PHSA. Companies were limited in submitting follow-on biologics applications for FDA review. In 1941, Congress gave the FDA authority over the marketing of insulin, a small protein that regulates sugar metabolism. Despite being similar to other biologics, insulin was regulated as a drug by FDA. Other natural source biological products like glucagon, human growth hormone, and certain hormones were also regulated as drugs under the FFDCA instead of as biologics under the PHSA. The FDA lacked clear regulatory authority to approve biosimilars for specialty biologic drug products, leading to limited market competition. In contrast, Europe had fewer barriers for marketing biosimilars, with the European Medicines Agency authorizing several biosimilar products. FDA approval of the first biosimilar product, Omnitrope, in the United States was announced in June 2006. In 2006, the FDA approved the biosimilar product Omnitrope, a human growth hormone, using the 505(b)(2) pathway created by the Hatch-Waxman Act. This approval followed a court ruling in favor of Omnitrope's sponsor, Sandoz, who alleged that the FDA had violated its statutory obligation to act on the application within 180 days. The FDA indicated that this approval did not establish a pathway for other follow-on biologic drugs. In 2006, the FDA approved Omnitrope, a biosimilar human growth hormone, using the 505(b)(2) pathway. This approval did not establish a pathway for other follow-on biologic drugs. Congress later established an abbreviated licensure pathway for biosimilar and interchangeable biological products under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. Under the BPCI Act, a sponsor may seek approval of a \"biosimilar\" product if it is demonstrated to be \"highly similar\" to the reference product with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. To meet the standard of interchangeability, the biosimilar product must produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any patient. Interchangeable products can be substituted without the intervention of the prescribing healthcare provider. FDA held a public meeting in 2010 to gather perspectives from industry and the public. The FDA held public meetings in 2010 to gather perspectives on biosimilars. Guidance documents were released in 2012 and finalized in 2015, with additional guidance on various topics related to biosimilars. Companies must submit applications demonstrating biosimilarity based on analytical, animal, and clinical studies to market biosimilar products in the US. States must submit an application to FDA demonstrating biosimilarity through analytical, animal, and clinical studies. FDA may deem certain studies unnecessary. Any changes to the manufacturing process require a demonstration of comparability to ensure product quality and safety. FDA and the drug industry have dealt with variability in biological products for years. The FDA and drug industry have coped with variability in biological products for years. FDA approved seven biosimilars in the US, but sales of five have been delayed by brand-name manufacturers' actions. Patent infringement lawsuits have delayed the launch of three biosimilars, and anticompetitive tactics have impacted sales of others. The FDA approved seven biosimilars in the US, but sales of five have been delayed by brand-name manufacturers' actions, including anticompetitive tactics. One of the biosimilars approved is Zarxio, marketed by Sandoz Inc., which is biosimilar to Neupogen by Amgen Inc. In March 2015, FDA approved Zarxio, the first biosimilar in the US, marketed by Sandoz Inc. It is biosimilar to Neupogen by Amgen Inc. Neupogen was discovered by scientists at Sloan Kettering, and Zarxio is approved for the same indications. In April 2016, FDA approved Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade by Janssen Biotech, Inc. Inflectra is made by Celltrion, Inc. for Pfizer and was priced 15% lower than Remicade. In late November 2016, Pfizer began marketing the biosimilar Inflectra in the United States at a price 15% below Remicade. Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J in September 2017 for alleged anticompetitive practices related to biosimilar-exclusion contracts. The lawsuit claimed that J&J threatened to withhold rebates from insurers unless they agreed to block coverage for Inflectra and other biosimilars. This tactic aimed to maintain market dominance for Remicade. The rebate trap is a financial incentive for insurers to prefer brand-name biologics over biosimilars. If a biosimilar manufacturer offers a price discount to insurers, the brand-name manufacturer can withdraw rebates, doubling costs for patients on the brand. Even with a 60% cheaper biosimilar, costs can increase if only 50% of patients switch. Switching to biosimilars requires a near-complete patient conversion to avoid the rebate trap. The rebate trap incentivizes insurers to prefer brand-name biologics over biosimilars, leading to increased costs for patients. Pfizer's lawsuit revealed that providers have been reluctant to purchase Inflectra, with minimal coverage from national commercial health insurers. Despite FDA approval in 2016, Inflectra only secured less than 4% of total infliximab unit sales in the US. Since FDA approved Inflectra in April 2016, J&J has raised the list price of Remicade by close to 9% and increased the amount the U.S. government reimburses for Remicade by more than $190 per infused dose. Pfizer states in the lawsuit that J&J's anticompetitive practices will hinder biosimilar competition. J&J's president of Janssen Biotech, Scott White, argues that competition is bringing down the overall cost of Remicade and will continue to do so in the future. In August 2016, FDA approved a third biosimilar, Erelzi (etanercept-szzs), manufactured by Sandoz, which is biosimilar to the brand-name drug Enbrel (etanercept) by Amgen. Enbrel is one of the top-selling drugs globally and in the US. Erelzi is approved for all indications on the Enbrel label, based on clinical data confirming its similarity to the reference product. Erelzi is highly similar to the US-licensed reference product Enbrel, with clinical studies confirming this. A release date for marketing has not been set due to a lawsuit filed by Amgen against Sandoz. Amjevita, a biosimilar to Humira, was approved by the FDA in September 2016. In 2002, Abbott Laboratories was licensed by FDA to market Humira. Amjevita was approved for 7 indications, while Humira is approved for 10 indications. Due to patent infringement litigation, Amjevita may not be available until 2018. FDA approved Renflexis, a biosimilar to Remicade, in April 2017. Samsung partnered with Merck to launch Renflexis in the US at a 35% lower price. In August 2017, FDA approved Cyltezo, a biosimilar to Humira, manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim. AbbVie filed a lawsuit against BI for patent infringement. In September 2017, FDA approved Mvasi, a biosimilar to Avastin, manufactured by Amgen. The lawsuit against BI on August 2, 2017, alleged infringement of eight Humira patents, delaying the launch date for Cyltezo. In September 2017, FDA approved Mvasi, a biosimilar to Avastin. Avastin is a top-selling drug in the US. The Purple Book lists licensed biological products, including biosimilars, with proprietary and nonproprietary names. The FDA released guidance on the nonproprietary naming of biological products in August 2015, finalized on January 12, 2017. The guidance provides the FDA's rationale for naming conventions for biosimilars, using a proper name consisting of a core name and a distinguishing suffix. An example of a core name is filgrastim. The FDA guidance on naming biological products includes using a proper name with a core name and a distinguishing suffix. The core name is adopted by the USAN Council for originator biological products, while biosimilars use the INN naming system. The WHO released a Biological Qualifier proposal for biosimilar naming in January 2016. The WHO selects INNs based on expert advice from a panel. In January 2016, the WHO proposed the Biological Qualifier (BQ) for biosimilar naming, using a code with four random consonants to uniquely identify biological substances. Industry groups support nonproprietary names for biosimilars, while innovator companies prefer a naming scheme that distinguishes between reference biologics and biosimilars. The Federal Trade Commission expressed concern that FDA's naming proposal could lead to misconceptions about biosimilars, hindering their market development. The FTC expressed concern that differences in nonproprietary names for biosimilars could lead to misconceptions among physicians, deterring them from prescribing biosimilars and impeding market development. The addition of unique suffixes may mistakenly imply clinically meaningful differences between biosimilars and their reference biologics. Participants at an FTC workshop on biosimilars argue that the term \"identical\" is misused to create fear and confusion among physicians. Biosimilars are inherently not identical to their reference biologics due to variability in biologics. FDA labeling provides information on a drug's safety and effectiveness for healthcare providers to determine suitability for patients. The FDA issued a final rule in 2006 on the content and format of labeling for prescription drug products, including biological products. The FDA-approved labeling contains necessary information for safe and effective use, written for healthcare practitioners. It includes a highlights section with warnings, indications, dosage, contraindications, warnings, adverse reactions, drug interactions, and more. The FDA issued a final rule in 2006 on the content and format of labeling for prescription drug products, including biological products. The FDA-approved labeling contains necessary information for safe and effective use, written for healthcare practitioners. It includes a highlights section with warnings, indications, dosage, contraindications, warnings, adverse reactions, drug interactions, and more. FDA released draft guidance on biosimilar labeling in March 2016, recommending a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in the highlights section. The biosimilar product is not required to have the same labeling as the reference product, and comparative data demonstrating biosimilarity are not included in the labeling to avoid confusion. The FDA guidance on biosimilar labeling has sparked differing views from the generic and brand-name industries. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association believes the Biosimilarity Statement is unnecessary and confusing, while BIO advocates for more information in labeling to ensure transparency for prescribers. The debate centers on the need for access to all relevant nonclinical and clinical data supporting biosimilarity findings in labeling. The BPCIA provision under the FDA guidance requires transparent labeling for prescribers to distinguish between studies conducted with biosimilar or reference products. This provision affects a small set of biological products transitioning to biological licenses under the PHSA in March 2020. FDA released draft guidance in March 2016, outlining the requirements for marketing applications for biological products. The FDA guidance requires transparent labeling for prescribers to distinguish between biosimilar and reference products. This affects biological products transitioning to licenses under the PHSA by March 2020. FDA's interpretation states that applications for biological products approved under the FD&C Act will be replaced by approved BLAs under the PHSA by March 23, 2020. The FDA will no longer approve applications for biological products under the FFDCA after March 23, 2020, and suggests they be resubmitted under the PHSA. Industry representatives are concerned about delays in the approval of biosimilar products. Exclusivity associated with approved NDAs will cease to have effect, except for orphan drug exclusivity which will continue after March 23, 2020. The FDA will no longer approve biological products under the FFDCA after March 23, 2020. Orphan drug exclusivity will continue to apply to protected uses. Industry groups have raised concerns about FDA's exclusivity policy. Transitional biological products will not be eligible for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period. The FDA will no longer approve biological products under the FFDCA after March 23, 2020. Orphan drug exclusivity will continue to apply to protected uses. Industry groups have raised concerns about FDA's exclusivity policy. Transitional biological products will not be eligible for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period. Biosimilar or interchangeable products can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient. Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product by a pharmacist without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider. Assessing interchangeability for biosimilars is a separate process from generics. The FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability in January 2017, with the comment period extended to May 19, 2017. FDA has not yet approved an interchangeable product. In Europe, the EMA evaluates biosimilar medicines for authorization but does not make determinations on interchangeability. Individual member states decide their own policy on interchangeability, with some allowing interchangeability unless proven otherwise. In the United States, interchangeability is assessed separately from generics. In the United States, FDA regulates drug products while states regulate pharmacies. States have varying legislation on biosimilar substitution. FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers in 1992 through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) allowed FDA to negotiate performance goals with industry and use fees for new product application reviews. User fees made up 43% of the FY2016 FDA budget and similar authority was added for medical devices and generic drugs. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) authorized FDA to collect fees for biosimilar reviews. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) allowed FDA to collect fees for biosimilar product development programs from October 2012 to September 2017. The program included fees for products in the development phase to generate revenue and provide assistance to industry sponsors. Companies could choose to discontinue participation but would have to pay a reactivation fee. The biosimilar biological product application fee could be waived for the first application from a small business. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) allowed FDA to collect fees for biosimilar product development programs until September 2017. The program included fees for products in the development phase and a reactivation fee for companies choosing to discontinue participation. The biosimilar biological product application fee could be waived for the first application from a small business. FDA held public meetings and negotiation sessions for the reauthorization of the program\u2014BsUFA II. Congress reauthorized the biosimilar user fee program via the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 (BsUFA I) was reauthorized by Congress via the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017. FDA faced challenges in meeting BsUFA I goals due to lack of staff, but new hiring authorities from the 21st Century Cures Act are expected to strengthen capacity. These enhancements aim to help FDA meet performance goals, save time and resources for applicants, and encourage price competition to lower healthcare costs under BsUFA II. Under BsUFA II, the FDA has made enhancements to meet performance goals and save time and resources for applicants. The supplement and establishment fees have been dropped, while the BsUFA Program fee has been introduced with a limit of five fees per application per fiscal year. The agency estimates needing $45 million in FY2018 to cover program costs, with a possible adjustment of up to $9 million. The federal government focuses more on basic research, while the pharmaceutical industry directs more funding towards clinical trials. The federal government, such as NIH, focuses on basic research while the pharmaceutical industry funds clinical trials. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements is challenging, with studies showing a small percentage of new drugs originating from non-industry sources. Concerns over high drug costs have led to scrutiny of the federal role in developing new therapeutics. Between 1990 and 1999, 6.7% of new drugs originated from sources other than private industry. Studies have shown that a significant percentage of truly innovative new drugs, known as new molecular entities (NMEs), have originated from publicly funded research. A comprehensive study by Stevens et al. in 2011 found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from work conducted in publicly funded labs. Additionally, 19% of drug applications granted priority review by the FDA were a result of publicly funded research. The FDA granted priority review to 348 out of 1,541 drug applications, with 19% resulting from publicly funded research. Public-sector research institutions had a higher rate of priority reviews compared to private-sector research, indicating a greater clinical impact. The methodology of the Stevens study excluded certain factors in determining drug discovery participation by PSRIs. The Stevens study excluded platform technologies developed with public funds from the analysis, as they were not used to develop specific drug candidates. These technologies, such as recombinant DNA technology and methods for producing antibodies, played a crucial role in enabling the development of many FDA-approved products during the study period. The study excluded platform technologies developed with public funds as they were not used to develop specific drug candidates. These technologies played a crucial role in enabling the development of many FDA-approved products. The 36 biologic drugs listed in Table 6 were discovered at least in part by PSRIs in the past 40 years. Biological products are regulated under the Public Health Service Act, while chemical drugs are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Major laws on biologics regulation are discussed, including the Biologics Control Act of 1902. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was the first national regulation for biologics, focusing on premarket approval and manufacturing processes. It was passed in response to deaths from contaminated vaccines. This act predates the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906, which did not include biologics regulation. The Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906 did not include premarket control over new drugs for safety. It was replaced by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938, which required drug manufacturers to submit a new drug application before marketing. The Biologics Control Act was revised under the Public Health Service Act in 1944, specifying regulation of biological products under the FFDCA. Biological products licensed under the PHSA are regulated under the FFDCA but do not require approval. They include viruses, vaccines, blood products, and similar items for disease prevention or treatment. The FDAMA of 1997 mandated a single BLA for biological products. The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) was amended by the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 to require a single biological license application (BLA) for biological products. The PHSA also provides authority to suspend a license immediately if there is a danger to public health. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009 created a licensure pathway for biosimilar products and authorized the FDA to collect associated fees. Additionally, the BPCIA established periods of regulatory exclusivity for certain brand-name biologics and biosimilar products, as well as procedures for resolving patent disputes. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009 established FDA-administered regulatory exclusivity periods for brand-name biologics and biosimilar products, along with procedures for resolving patent disputes. Regulatory responsibility for biologics has evolved from the Hygienic Laboratory to the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). Jurisdictional issues arise due to biotechnology products straddling boundaries between biologics, drugs, and devices. In 2002, the FDA reorganized review responsibilities, transferring most therapeutic biologics from CBER to CDER. This allowed CDER to focus on new pharmaceutical products while CBER concentrated on vaccines, blood safety, gene therapy, and tissue transplantation. Biological products transferred to CDER are regulated as licensed biologics. On June 30, 2003, most therapeutic biologics were transferred from CBER to CDER, allowing CBER to focus on vaccines, blood safety, gene therapy, and tissue transplantation. CDER now regulates products like monoclonal antibodies, growth factors, and cytokines, while CBER oversees traditional biologics such as vaccines and blood products."
