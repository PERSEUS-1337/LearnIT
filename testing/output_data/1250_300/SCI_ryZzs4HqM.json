The method outperforms previous models by achieving lower root-mean-squared prediction errors and enables real-time multi-horizon forecasts for practical applications in the evolving smart grid. The modern power grid faces challenges with strong fluctuations due to uncertainty, requiring real-time observability and improved renewable generation forecast accuracy. ISOs with high renewable penetration are struggling with short-term forecasting errors, leading to increased costs. Integrating wind and solar forecasts into unit commitment could result in significant savings for the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. The increased grid penetration levels of solar pose problems with grid reliability and cost of operating the grid. Solar power generation forecast accuracy is crucial for effectively incorporating solar energy resources. Very-short-term solar forecast errors can cause strain to the grid by inducing voltage-flickers and real-time balancing issues. Research on robust forecasts for all timescales is critical for integrating solar energy globally. Solar power generation forecast is crucial for integrating solar energy resources into the grid. Improving forecast accuracy is cost-effective and essential for the evolution of the smart grid. The paper reviews current forecasting approaches, introduces a unified architecture with a novel algorithm, and discusses the proposed RNN-based architecture. Results and interpretations are presented in Section V, with conclusions in Section VI. The paper discusses forecasting methods for solar power generation, including regressive methods, artificial intelligence techniques, numerical weather prediction models, sensing methods, and hybrid models. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models are based on physical laws governing the weather. Hybrid models like neuro-fuzzy systems, ANN, and satellite-derived cloud indices are used for solar forecasting. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models are powerful tools for forecasting solar radiation where ground data is lacking but have limitations in predicting precise cloud positions due to coarse spatial resolution. Regional NWP models are downscaled for improved site-specific forecasts. NWP also has limitations in temporal resolution for predicting short-term fluctuations. The temporal resolution of NWP models for solar forecasting is limited, with output variables ranging from 3-6 hours for GFS and 1 hour for mesoscale models. Satellite-based irradiance measurement is useful in areas without ground-based data, but has limitations in accurately determining radiance values under different sky conditions. Solar irradiance forecasting using satellite remote sensing relies on empirical or statistical algorithms, which may not require precise parameters for modeling solar radiation attenuation. The algorithms for short-term solar forecasting are based on statistical regression between surface measurements and satellite data, requiring ground-based solar data. These statistical techniques include linear stationary models, nonlinear stationary models, and linear nonstationary models. They offer advantages over NWP and sensing methods but are limited by assumptions of normality and linearity. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are effective in modeling complex non-linear relationships between variables like humidity, temperature, pressure, and Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) for solar forecasting. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with multiple hidden layers have shown efficiency in solving complex problems in various fields. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have not been explored for solar forecasting yet. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have not been explored for solar forecasting yet, despite their ability to capture the dynamics of sequences using feedback connections. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs exhibit dynamic temporal behavior by using internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs, enabling prediction of irradiance for the next time step based on previous inputs. Recent advances in parallelism, network architectures, optimization techniques, and GPUs have made large-scale learning with RNNs successful, overcoming traditional limitations. Recent advances in optimization techniques and GPUs have enabled successful large-scale learning with RNNs for solar forecasting. This paper proposes two approaches using RNNs: a single algorithm for forecasting solar irradiance for different time horizons and a unified architecture for multi-time-horizon forecasting. The proposed method can provide real-time forecasts based on live measured data. The proposed method using RNNs enables real-time multi-time-horizon forecasting for industrial applications with high renewable energy penetration. The RNN architecture allows the network to utilize past information in sequential data, with input and target sequences denoted by real-valued vectors. The RNN architecture enables real-time multi-time-horizon forecasting for industrial applications with high renewable energy penetration. The input of the RNN consists of three dimensions: Mini-batch Size, Number of columns in the vector per time-step, and Number of time-steps. In a multilayer feedforward neural network, the input vector is fed to neurons at the input layer, multiplied by the activation function to produce the intermediate output, which becomes the input to the next layer. The net input to the next layer is the weight on connections multiplied by the previous neuron's output with the bias term. The RNN architecture uses weight matrices and bias terms to process input data through activation functions like ReLU. It unfolds the network over time steps and trains using backpropagation through time (BPTT) with Mean Squared Loss (MSE) as the loss function. Gradients are computed using back-propagation-through time and stochastic gradient descent optimizer updates weights to minimize loss, with RMSE used for benchmarking. The motivation for using RNN is to learn complex patterns in data. The RNN architecture uses weight matrices and bias terms with activation functions like ReLU to process input data over time steps. Gradients are computed using back-propagation-through time and stochastic gradient descent optimizer updates weights to minimize loss. The RMSE is calculated for benchmarking. The RNN is used to identify complex relationships between sequences of exogenous variables impacting solar irradiance, recognizing non-linear contributing factors like atmospheric conditions. The algorithm was trained and tested on data from NOAA's SURFRAD sites, with input features including various solar and infrared measurements. Global solar measurements such as GHI are crucial for understanding solar irradiance. Clear sky GHI and global downwelling solar show a positive correlation at SURFRAD sites. The Bird model is used to calculate clear sky GHI. The Bird model is used to calculate clear sky GHI at SURFRAD sites. The algorithm uses Mean Squared Error to measure the difference between target and output values in a neural network. The Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture algorithm is divided into three main blocks. The proposed Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture algorithm involves importing site-specific data and clear sky global horizontal irradiance values from the Bird Model. The dataset is split into train and testing sets, and the clear sky index parameter is calculated. Missing values are replaced, outliers are eliminated, and a Recurrent Neural Network model is defined with specified architectural parameters. The model is trained and tested through multiple epochs. The proposed Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture algorithm involves training and testing the model using data from SURFRAD observation sites in various locations. The model is trained to predict for different time horizons, and hyperparameters are adjusted until a satisfactory RMSE is achieved. The algorithm is evaluated using data from the year 2010 and 2011, with results compared to previous studies. The proposed RNN architecture and algorithm predict for 1-hour, 2-hour, 3-hour, and 4-hour time horizons at seven SURFRAD sites. Results show lower RMSE values compared to other machine learning algorithms. This method involves developing one model per site for all four time horizons simultaneously, a unique approach not seen in previous literature. The proposed method utilizes a multitime-horizon approach for forecasting solar energy. It outperforms existing methods by achieving lower RMSE values across all short-term forecasting horizons. This capability makes it highly relevant for industry applications, allowing for real-time data input and efficient predictions for multiple time horizons. Short-term solar forecasting is crucial for smart grid optimization due to increasing uncertainties in power systems. Various methods have been developed with some success, but they are limited by specific temporal and spatial resolutions. Recent advances in AI, particularly deep neural networks, offer promising solutions with the abundance of available solar data. The Unified Recurrent Neural Network Architecture proposed aims to create a high-fidelity solar forecasting engine that can handle real-time data input and produce multi-time-scale predictions. The proposed AI architecture for solar forecasting can generate high-quality predictions across different time scales, outperforming traditional methods. While a deeper neural network may have more capacity, it can lead to reduced generalization power. Improvements can be made through hyper-parameter tuning and architectural changes. Future research could explore incorporating LSTM cells and intra-hour forecasting horizons."
