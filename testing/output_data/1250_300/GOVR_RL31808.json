    "content": "President Bush signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, which included funding for transportation and election reform projects. The Act also included an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%. Congress passed a continuing resolution for FY2004 funding, extending funding for programs to January 31, 2004. The Senate passed its version of the FY2004 Transportation, Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill with a recommended $91.0 billion, $5.1 billion more than the Administration requested. The House of Representatives passed the FY2004 Transportation, Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill with $85.8 billion, including additional funding for highways and the deletion of airport grants-in-aid. This bill differs from the Administration's request. Beginning with the FY2004 budget, Congress consolidated appropriations for the Department of Transportation, Department of the Treasury, and other related agencies into a single bill. This change was due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, which led to the reorganization of subcommittees in the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. As a result, the United States Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Customs Service, United States Secret Service, and Office of Homeland Security were transferred to DHS from their respective departments. The FY2004 budget consolidated appropriations for the Department of Transportation, Department of the Treasury, and related agencies into a single bill. The House divides its appropriation bill into six titles, while the Senate has five titles. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution included a 0.65% across-the-board rescission for the Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury. The Administration's FY2004 budget request for these departments was $85.9 billion. The FY2003 figures in this report reflect a rescission and differ slightly from P.L. 108-7. The Administration's FY2004 budget request for Transportation, Treasury, and related agencies was $85.9 billion, $740 million below FY2003. Table 2 shows funding allocation. The Senate puts the Postal Service in \"Related Agencies\" title. The Senate divides the budget differently from the House, placing the Postal Service in the \"Related Agencies\" Title. During House deliberations on H.R. 2989, funding for two programs was struck due to disputes over funding provision methods. This resulted in a reduction in total transportation funding in the bill. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 includes an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%. Funding trends for Transportation/Treasury Appropriations from FY1999-FY2004 are shown in Table 3. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 includes an across-the-board rescission of 0.59%. Funding trends for Transportation/Treasury Appropriations from FY1999-FY2004 are shown in Table 3, with adjustments made for comparison purposes. The Transportation/Treasury Appropriations for FY1999-FY2003 included various agencies such as the Department of Transportation, Customs Service, Secret Service, and Law Enforcement Training Center. The FY2004 budget proposed a DOT budget of $54.3 billion, which was 2.6% lower than the previous year. The budget request aligned with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century and the Wendell Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act, with some proposed changes to highway and transit funding structure. The Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act of the 21st Century (FAIR21 or AIR21; P.L. 106-181) proposed changes to the highway and transit funding structure in line with the Administration's reauthorization proposal. The Department of Transportation Appropriations for FY2004 were detailed in Table 4, with figures from an FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill Conference Report Budget Authority table. Funding for two programs was struck during House deliberations on H.R. 2989 due to disputes over the way funds were being provided. During House deliberations on H.R. 2989, funding for two programs was struck due to disputes over the way funds were being provided: FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program ($3.425 billion) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement program ($47 million). This reduced total transportation funding in the bill by those amounts. Funding for these programs may be restored in conference. Additionally, there were across-the-board rescissions and additional funding provided for motor carrier safety activities under FHWA miscellaneous appropriations. The FY2004 transportation funding included additional grants for motor carrier safety activities and a transfer of $100 million from FHWA to NHTSA. Congress also postponed Amtrak's loan repayment and there were $14 million in permanent appropriations for RSPA. Rescissions of previous years' contract authority were subtracted from the total resources available. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 provides the FAA with $13.93 billion in funding, an increase of $440 million from FY2003. The majority of the increased funding would be used for Operations & Maintenance expenses, with no major new initiatives proposed. The funding in P.L 108-199 and other bills for FY2004 would mainly be used for Operations & Maintenance expenses. The majority of FAA funding comes from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, with only O&M funding using a mix of trust fund and Treasury general fund money. The Administration proposed a general fund contribution of almost $3.3 billion for FY2003, which was ultimately agreed upon by both the House and Senate at $3.4 billion. The FY2004 Act raised the general fund contribution to approximately $3.5 billion. The FY2004 Act increased the general fund contribution to $4.5 billion, which is higher than the $3.5 billion proposed in the Senate bill. Additionally, $7.5 billion was allocated for Operations and Maintenance spending, representing a significant increase over the previous year. Funding for Facilities and Equipment was also provided, with $2.96 billion allocated in FY2003. The FY2004 Act provides $2.91 billion for Facilities and Equipment (F&E), slightly less than the previous year. Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) receives $119.4 million, below the FY2003 level. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program is operated through the Office of the. The FY2004 Act provides $102 million for the Essential Air Service (EAS) program, with $50 million from its regular authorization and $52 million from the aviation trust fund. This funding level is the same as proposed by the Senate and $11 million less than the House proposal. The EAS program receives funding from designated user fees collected from overflights of U.S. territory by foreign aircraft. The FY2004 Act provides $102 million for the Essential Air Service program, funded by $50 million from its regular authorization and $52 million from the aviation trust fund. This funding level aligns with the Senate proposal and is $11 million less than the House proposal. The Act rejects the Bush Administration's calls to reduce the EAS program size and require local contributions at airports. Additionally, the Act does not include a provision for DOT to request improvement reports from EAS-assisted communities. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) is allocated $3.4 billion, consistent with the FY2003 budget, with the House recommending $3.425 billion and $20 million for Small Community Air Service. The FY2004 budget proposal requested $3.4 billion for the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), with the House recommending $3.425 billion and $20 million for the Small Community Air Service Program. The House-passed bill did not include funding for AIP, but the Senate-passed bill provided $3.5 billion for AIP, including a $100 million transfer from the facilities and equipment account. The bill also directed the FAA to prioritize projects at 241 airports and prohibited the use of AIP grants for certain airport improvements. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (P.L. 108-199) provides $3.4 billion for the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) and prohibits certain airport improvements using AIP grants. The Act does not include a $100 million transfer from the facilities and equipment account as in the Senate-passed bill. Additionally, it prohibits the implementation of a ten-city Essential Air Service local participation pilot program. The report language of the conference report names nearly 150 airports for projects totaling just under $258 million. The conference report (H.Rept. 108-401) lists nearly 150 airports for projects totaling just under $258 million in funding from the FHWA budget for airport projects. The President's FY2004 budget requested $30.2 billion for FHWA, a decrease from the previous year. The proposed obligation limitation was set at $29.3 billion, with funding for exempt programs increasing to $931 million. The budget included a new $1.0 billion Infrastructure Performance and Maintenance initiative. The Administration's surface transportation reauthorization proposal included a new $1.0 billion Infrastructure Performance and Maintenance initiative. Funds would be distributed based on the Surface Transportation Program formula for \"ready-to-go\" projects addressing congestion. States had to commit funds within six months, with unobligated funds reallocated. The budget proposed redirecting revenues from the gasohol excise tax to the highway trust fund, adding $600 million in FY2004. The House-passed FY2004 Appropriations bill provided $34.6 billion for FHWA, $2.2 billion over FY2003 levels and $4.4 billion above the President's request. The obligation limitation was set at $33.4 billion. The House-passed FY2004 Appropriations bill (H.R. 2989; H.Rept.108-243) allocated $34.6 billion for FHWA, exceeding the FY2003 enacted level by $2.2 billion and the President's request by $4.4 billion. The obligation limitation was set at $33.4 billion, with $931 million for exempt obligations. The Senate-passed bill (H.R. 2989 as amended by S. 1589; S.Rept. 108-146) provided $34.8 billion for FHWA, with a slightly higher obligation limitation of $33.8 billion. Both bills heavily earmarked discretionary programs. The Senate heavily earmarked discretionary programs in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, directing $175 million for surface transportation projects. The total budgetary resources for FHWA were $34.7 billion, slightly higher than the House total and slightly lower than the Senate total. This represented an increase of more than 6% over the FY2003 enacted total. The FY2004 conference agreement heavily earmarked all discretionary programs under FHWA's control. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 earmarked discretionary programs under FHWA's control, including core formula programs like IM, NHS, STP, CMAQ, and Bridge Replacement Program. Over $1 billion of unobligated core program funds were earmarked for projects, drawn from state's distributed core program funds or STP funds if not eligible under core programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 allocated unobligated core program funds for projects, drawn from state's core program funds or STP funds if not eligible. The federal share is 100%, a departure from past practices. Additionally, funds from core formula programs were used for interagency transfers and project earmarks, including allocations for motor carrier safety and highway traffic safety administrations, construction of Pennsylvania Avenue, and Amber Alert grants. These funds have a 100% federal share and are available until expended. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 allocated funds for various projects, including construction of Pennsylvania Avenue and Amber Alert grants. An additional $150 million was provided for the Appalachian Development Highway System. The TEA-21 Funding Framework, which created the largest surface transportation program in U.S. history, continues to operate on extensions while Congress considers reauthorization proposals. TEA-21 created the largest surface transportation program in U.S. history, continuing most highway and transit programs from ISTEA. Major federal-aid highway programs include NHS, IM, STP, BRR, and CMAQ, apportioned annually. Exempt funding includes minimum guarantee and emergency relief funds, not subject to annual obligation limits. The category includes additional annual authorization of minimum guarantee funding and emergency relief funds, not subject to annual obligation limits. There are also allocated programs under the direct control of FHWA or other governmental entities, such as the Federal Lands Highway Program and National Corridor Planning. FMCSA, created by the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999, enforces federal motor carrier safety regulations for interstate commercial truck and bus operations. FMCSA enforces federal motor carrier safety regulations for interstate commercial truck and bus operations, administers grants and programs for truck and bus safety activities, conducts inspections of Mexican-domiciled commercial drivers and vehicles entering the United States, and reviews carriers transporting property and passengers. FMCSA's funds are mainly derived from the federal Highway Trust Fund, with an FY2004 appropriation of $447 million, an increase of $134 million from the previous year. The FY2004 Administration requested $447 million for FMCSA, a $134 million increase from FY2003. The conference committee allocated $366 million, with $176 million for administrative expenses and $190 million for safety grants.

The Strategic Human Resources Policy Division designs policies linked to agency missions, while the Human Capital Leadership and Merit Systems Accountability Division assists agencies in implementing human resources strategies. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) supports agency missions through various divisions such as Strategic Human Resources Policy, Human Capital Leadership, and Human Resources Products and Services. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits and investigations, with a proposed budget of $18.0 billion in FY2004, including funding for salaries, expenses, and government payments for annuitants. The FY2004 budget included $7.5 billion for government payment for annuitants' health benefits, $35.0 million for annuitants' life insurance, and $10.0 billion for civil service retirement and disability fund. Trust fund transfers of $135.9 million for salaries and expenses and $14.4 million for OIG salaries were also included. OPM's budget request of $118.7 million for salaries and expenses aimed at enhancing IT support, competitive sourcing studies, e-Government projects, and program evaluation. The budget also allocated funds for more audit staff and special agent criminal investigators for the OIG. The budget request for OPM includes funding for audit staff, special agents, and improved information systems to reduce audit cycle times and increase recoveries. The request is 8.8% higher than the previous year's appropriation, with specific increases and decreases in various budget categories. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $119.498 million for salaries and expenses. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $119.498 million for salaries and expenses, including funding for the enterprise human resources integration project and modernizing federal payroll systems. Trust fund transfers were also recommended, with adjustments made compared to the President's request. The Committee recommended trust fund transfers for salaries and expenses, including additional funding for the 'retirement readiness' project. OPM is directed to award the money to InFRE and report on the project progress. OPM is also urged to certify the impact of transferring DSS functions and notify Committees of any delays in PBMs research. The OPM is directed to conduct a study to determine the number of Federal employees and retirees eligible for FEHBP but not covered, reasons for lack of insurance, and their agencies and pay grades. The results must be submitted by September 30, 2004. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the same appropriations as the President requested, including funds for automating retirement recordkeeping systems. The Committee also addressed OPM's modernization program for its retirement system, urging OPM to collaborate with GAO for guidance and support, which OPM did not act on. The Committee directed OPM to conduct quarterly meetings with GAO on the IT modernization project progress, but only one meeting occurred in 2002 and none in 2003. The Committee is disappointed by the lack of cooperation and directs GAO to conduct a comprehensive audit on the project's problems and mismanagement. The law provides an appropriation of $119.498 million for salaries and expenses, with a recommendation to include certain counties in Massachusetts in the Hartford, CT pay area. Senator Charles Grassley's amendment prohibits funds from being used under the Act. Senator Charles Grassley's amendment prohibits funds from being used to implement regulations proposed by OPM regarding the detail of executive branch employees to the legislative branch. Grassley argues that the proposed regulation limits the time detailees can spend in Congress and restricts their activities under Congressional supervision, which he deems unacceptable. Additionally, the President's FY2004 budget includes a $500 million appropriation for the Human Capital Performance Fund aimed at creating performance-driven pay systems. The President's FY2004 budget proposed a $500 million appropriation for the Human Capital Performance Fund, which aims to create performance-driven pay systems for employees. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $2.5 million for the fund, significantly less than the President's request. Funding is contingent upon legislation authorizing the fund's creation within OPM. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $2.5 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund, $497.5 million less than the President's request. Funding is contingent upon legislation authorizing the fund's creation within OPM. The Senate did not pass an appropriation for the fund, believing it should be budgeted and administered within individual agencies. The curr_chunk provides an appropriation of $1 million for the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) to investigate federal employee allegations and enforce the Hatch Act. The funds require approval from relevant subcommittees before being transferred to federal agencies. The President's FY2004 budget proposed $13.5 million for the OSC, a 9.2% increase from FY2003. The President's FY2004 budget proposed an appropriation of $13.5 million for the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) to address backlog concerns and enforce the Hatch Act. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations recommended and passed the same appropriation as requested. The report also discusses general provisions related to government-wide policies and specific agencies or programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, includes general provisions related to government-wide policies and specific agencies or programs. The Administration proposed dropping some provisions, which are detailed in Table 11. The Administration recommended dropping several provisions related to General Schedule Pay adjustments. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, resulted in a 4.1% increase, retroactive to January 1, 2004, including a 2% adjustment. Federal white-collar employees under the General Schedule receive annual adjustments based on changes in private sector salaries. The President signed an Executive Order for federal civilian personnel salary schedules in January 2003, with a 4.1% pay increase for the General Schedule. An additional 1% increase was applied to locality-based comparability payments. In January 2004, a 2.0% pay increase was proposed, with a plan for a 1.5% increase in basic pay and a 0.5% increase in locality pay. In January 2004, a 2.0% pay increase was proposed for federal civilian personnel, with a plan for a 1.5% increase in basic pay and a 0.5% increase in locality pay. The President's plan was effective as Congress had not completed action on legislation for other rates. The pending Consolidated Appropriations, 2004 would establish a 4.1% pay increase for civilian employees, with 2.7% for basic pay and 1.4% for locality-based payments. The 4.1% pay increase for federal civilian personnel will be split with 2.7% for basic pay and 1.4% for locality-based payments. The Federal Wage System (FWS) compensates federal blue-collar workers at prevailing local rates. Congress has limited adjustment rates based on General Schedule rates. In FY2004, the Monroney Amendment extended out-of-area survey application to Department of Defense personnel. The National Defense Authorization Act for 2004 changed the Senior Executive Service salary system, capping rates at Level II of the Executive Schedule. Minimum pay is $103,700 and maximum is $145,600. In FY2004, the National Defense Authorization Act capped Senior Executive Service salaries at Level II of the Executive Schedule. Minimum pay is $103,700 and maximum is $145,600, with a potential increase to $158,100 for top performers. Additionally, a $500 million fund was proposed for permanent base pay increases for top performers. Members of Congress, Judges, and other officials are set for a 2.2% pay adjustment in January 2004. In January 2004, federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges, were scheduled for a 2.2% pay adjustment. However, due to legislative limitations, the pay adjustment was temporarily capped at 1.5% until the Consolidated Appropriations Act was passed. The full 2.2% adjustment will be retroactive. The pay adjustment for federal officials in January 2004 was temporarily capped at 1.5% due to legislative limitations, pending the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Judges require specific authorization for annual pay increases, unlike Members of Congress and executive branch officials. The President's salary was increased to $400,000 per annum in 2001, up from $200,000 since 1969. Former Presidents receive a pension equal to Cabinet Secretaries' pay rate. The President's salary was increased to $400,000 per annum in 2001, up from $200,000 since 1969. Former Presidents receive a pension equal to Cabinet Secretaries' pay rate. The Federal Employees Compensation Act provides workers' compensation benefits for Federal employees injured on the job. The Administration proposed changes in FECA to charge administrative costs to each employing agency. The proposal aims to charge administrative costs to each employing agency under the Federal Employees Compensation Act, with the intention of making agencies bear the full cost of their employees' claims to improve workplace safety. The surcharge would be around 3.5% of benefit costs, mainly paid by agencies with the highest FECA claims. The Administration supports competitive sourcing and opposes any hindrance to it, threatening a veto if the bill includes a prohibition on funding for public-private partnerships. The Administration supports competitive sourcing and opposes any hindrance to it, threatening a veto if the bill includes a prohibition on funding for public-private partnerships. The Office of Management and Budget successfully altered or removed some competitive sourcing provisions in H.R. 2673. Competitive sourcing is part of the President's Management Agenda and involves public-private competitions for federal executive agencies' commercial activities. Circular A-76 provides policy and guidance for public-private competitions, with enacted versions found in Section 647 of H.R. 2673 (P.L. 108-199). Section 647(a) imposes conditions on competitions involving more than 10 federal employees, requiring agencies to develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO) and consider the conversion differential in streamlined competitions. Section 647(a) of Circular A-76 imposes conditions on competitions involving more than 10 federal employees, including the consideration of the conversion differential in streamlined competitions. This requirement may conflict with the circular's 90-day deadline for competitions, potentially leading to delays. The conversion differential, which is the lesser of $10 million or 10% of personnel costs, must be taken into account by the competitive sourcing official to determine if contracting out would be more cost-effective for the agency. The cost of contractor performance must be compared to government personnel costs, with a consideration of the conversion differential. Section 647(b) requires executive agencies to submit annual reports on competitive sourcing activities to Congress. Section 647(b) mandates executive agencies to submit annual reports to Congress on competitive sourcing activities. Reports must include completed and ongoing competitions, costs, savings, FTEs, and decision-making processes. This reporting requirement aids congressional oversight and informs OMB policy, but the lack of a standardized methodology may limit its effectiveness. The absence of a methodology for collecting required information may reduce the usefulness of agency reports for informing OMB policy and agency decisions. Section 647(c) allows agency heads to issue letters of obligation to MEOs with performance periods longer than five years, potentially reducing recompetitions. This could lead to different treatment for government agencies and private sector sources in public-private competitions. Allowing agencies to issue letters of obligation with performance periods longer than five years under the Federal Acquisition Regulation could help mitigate recruitment and retention issues among federal government employees. Section 647(d) permits agency heads to use funds for monitoring activities after public-private competitions, potentially enhancing oversight and decision-making. Additionally, Section 647(e) prohibits moving contractor-performed work outside the United States. Section 647(e) prohibits moving contractor-performed work outside the United States, potentially affecting competitive bids and job retention in the country. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill initially included provisions to prevent restrictions on travel-related transactions, but these were dropped in the final Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill initially included provisions to prevent restrictions on travel-related transactions, but these were dropped in the final Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, which also removed two Cuba provisions from the House version of the bill. The White House had threatened to veto any legislation that weakened economic sanctions against Cuba, as U.S. policy towards Cuba has historically focused on isolating the Communist government through sanctions. The U.S. policy towards Cuba has historically focused on isolating the Communist government of Fidel Castro through economic sanctions, including a trade embargo and prohibitions on financial transactions and travel. Congressional initiatives in 1992 and 1996 strengthened these sanctions, with regulations administered by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. There have been debates in the 108th Congress on lifting or easing restrictions, with a broad agreement on the objective of promoting democracy and human rights in Cuba, but differing opinions on the approach to achieve this goal. While there is broad congressional agreement on the overall objective of U.S. policy towards Cuba - to promote democracy and human rights - there are differing opinions on how to achieve this goal. Some advocate for maximum pressure on the Cuban government, others suggest lifting certain sanctions, and some call for a swift normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations by lifting the embargo. The House-approved version of H.R. 2929 included provisions to prevent funds from being used to enforce travel restrictions and remittances, highlighting the contentious issue of travel restrictions in U.S. efforts to isolate Cuba. The Flake amendment prevented funds from enforcing travel restrictions to Cuba, which have been a contentious issue in U.S. efforts to isolate the country. Certain categories of travelers can visit Cuba under general or specific licenses, including government officials, journalists, and those visiting close relatives. Supporters argued that U.S. policy restricts the rights of Americans to travel to countries with authoritarian governments, and that such travel can promote the idea of freedom. The Flake amendment aimed to lift travel restrictions to Cuba, allowing Americans to visit the country more freely. Supporters believed that such travel could promote freedom and expose Cubans to alternative information. Opponents argued that lifting restrictions would financially benefit the Cuban government amidst crackdowns on democracy activists. H.Amdt. 377 (Delahunt) aimed to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on remittances, allowing Cuban Americans to send unlimited financial support to their families in Cuba. Travelers to Cuba can carry up to $3,000 in remittances, with a $300 limit per quarter for Cuban households. The Delahunt amendment aimed to remove the cap on financial support Cuban Americans can send to their families in Cuba. However, opponents argued that lifting the cap would benefit the Cuban regime through inflated prices at government-owned stores. H.Amdt. 382 (Davis) aimed to preserve people-to-people educational exchanges, but restrictions were tightened in 2003, limiting certain types of educational travel to Cuba. Some groups supported the restrictions, while others criticized the decision to limit travel opportunities for ordinary people. Some lauded the restriction of educational exchanges to Cuba as a way to prevent unrestricted travel, while others criticized the decision for limiting opportunities for ordinary people to travel and exchange with counterparts on the island. In Senate action, a provision was approved to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on Cuba travel. Momentum behind legislative proposals to ease U.S. sanctions policy toward Cuba was impacted by Cuba's human rights crackdown in 2003. The House-approved Cuba amendments to H.R. 2989 were approved with less support than in 2002, indicating a decrease in momentum behind easing U.S. sanctions policy toward Cuba after the human rights crackdown in 2003. The Flake amendment to H.R. 2989 was approved by a vote of 227-188, compared to a similar amendment in the FY2003 Treasury Department appropriations bill which had a vote of 262-167.

The curr_chunk provides a list of abbreviations related to transportation legislation and programs, including ATSA, BRR, CG, CMAQ, DOT, EAS, FAA, FHWA, FRA, FTA, Hazmat, HPP, HTF, IM, ITS, MCSAP, and New Starts. The curr_chunk lists abbreviations related to transportation legislation and programs, including NHS, NHTSA, NMCSA, O&M, OIG, OST, RABA, RD&T, RE&D, RSPA, SCASD, STB, STP, TCSP, TEA-21, and TIFIA. The Transportation and Community and System Preservation Program (TCSP), Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program (TIFIA), and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) are key components of the Department of Transportation's budget, funded mainly through transportation trust funds. These funds, including the highway trust fund, airport and airway trust fund, and inland waterways trust fund, are derived from specific taxes and make up a significant portion of federal transportation spending. Highway and transit programs receive the largest share of DOT appropriations, primarily through contract authority. In FY2002, trust funds accounted for over two-thirds of federal transportation spending, with highway and transit funding being the largest component of DOT appropriations. Contract authority allows for funds to be automatically available at the start of each fiscal year without the need for new appropriations. Major legislation during the 105th and 106th Congresses changed the relationships in transportation funding. During the 105th and 106th Congresses, major legislation changed the relationships between transportation trust funds and the federal budget. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century linked annual spending for highway programs directly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund, creating a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs. Additional highway funds can be provided annually through Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA). The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century established a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs, linking annual spending directly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund. The Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) mechanism provides additional highway funds annually. However, there were concerns in FY2003 about a significant drop in highway obligational funding due to adjustments in the RABA process. TEA-21 also changed the role of House and Senate appropriations committees in determining spending levels for highway and transit programs, limiting their discretion over specific core programs or projects. In the FY2000 appropriations act, there were attempts to regain some control over highway spending by redistributing funds among programs. In FY2000, appropriators made changes to highway spending by redistributing funds among programs and adding significant projects. FY2001 saw more funds added for earmarked projects and redirection of funding between programs, with additional funding for TEA-21 programs. FY2002 saw major redistributions of RABA funds and transfers to ineligible agencies. The FAIR21 Act guarantees FAA program spending differently from TEA-21, without creating new budget categories. The FAIR21 Act guarantees FAA program spending differently from TEA-21, relying on two point-of-order rules for the House and Senate. While supporters believe it requires increased spending on aviation programs, observers see the guarantees as weaker than TEA-21. Congress can waive points-of-order during legislation consideration. Enactment of TEA-21 and FAIR21 gives transportation appropriators control over spending for TSA, Coast Guard, Federal Railroad Administration, and smaller DOT agencies, all concerned about funding in constrained budget years. Transportation budgeting uses a complex lexicon of budget authority and contract authority. Prior to TEA-21, changes in transportation budgeting were achieved by combining changes in budget/contract authority and placing limitations on obligations to control outlays in line with congressional budget agreements. Contract authority, a form of budget authority, provides obligational authority for trust fund-financed programs like the federal-aid highway program. Authorized funds are automatically available to states at the start of each fiscal year and can be obligated without appropriations legislation. Appropriations are needed for outlays, but contract authority does not involve entering into a contract to pay for a project in the future. TEA-21 limited the role of appropriations in highway and transit programs by setting obligations levels for FY1999 through FY2003. States pay for projects upfront and receive federal payments after completion. Trust fund balances remain high to cover future commitments. Highway and transit accounts have significant short- and long-term commitments. Trust fund balances appear high because funds must remain available to cover future commitments for highway and transit projects. Apportionments distribute funds to states for formula-driven programs, while allocated funds are distributed administratively to programs under federal control. Federal funds are distributed on an administrative basis to programs under direct federal control, such as the federal lands highway program. Allocation can be to another federal agency, a state, an Indian tribe, or another governmental entity. Recipients may mistakenly assume that a state apportionment is part of the federal budget process."
