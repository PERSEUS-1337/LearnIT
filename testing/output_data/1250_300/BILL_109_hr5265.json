    "content": "The \"Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program Act\" is established in response to the devastating 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia and the potential seismic threat along the west coast of the United States. Scientists predict a 10 to 15 percent chance of a major earthquake and tsunami in the next 50 years along the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Many coastal communities are unprepared for such an event. The Community Hazard Assessment and Mitigation Program (CHAMP) aims to provide one-year grants to emergency management departments for tsunami warning infrastructure and post-tsunami needs. The program's primary goal is to assist departments in tsunami hazard preparedness, mitigation, and response, especially those lacking necessary resources. Improving warning systems for coastal communities will enhance overall hazard capabilities. The Secretary of Homeland Security may provide grants to areas at risk of tsunamis, prioritizing those with a 10% or greater likelihood within 50 years. Grants will be awarded based on financial need, community benefit, and cooperation with other emergency service providers. The emergency management department receiving a grant can use funds for warning systems, rescue equipment, reinforcing buildings, post-tsunami shelters, and outreach programs for tsunami education. Matching funds are also required. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, emergency management departments serving different population sizes must provide a percentage of the total project cost with non-Federal funds. The Secretary can consider in-kind contributions, not exceeding 50% of the department's non-Federal funds. SEC. 7. EVALUATION AND REPORT.\n\nThe Director will assess if grant-receiving emergency management departments meet tsunami readiness standards and evaluate program effectiveness within 180 days of grant award. A report on the findings will be submitted to Congress within 90 days of the evaluation completion. SEC. 8.
