    "content": "The cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana are prohibited under federal law, but several states have legalized medical and recreational use. Colorado and Washington were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana, followed by Alaska, Oregon, and the District of Columbia. Several states, including Colorado, Washington, Alaska, and Oregon, have approved ballot initiatives to legalize, regulate, and tax marijuana for recreational purposes. The District of Columbia also approved measures to legalize the cultivation, possession, and exchange of marijuana. Polls show a majority of Americans support marijuana legalization, leading to increased debate at the federal level. Bills have been introduced in Congress to remove marijuana from the list of Schedule I drugs and impose a federal excise tax on its production and importation. The debate on marijuana legalization includes proposals for a federal excise tax on production and importation. A National Commission on Federal Marijuana Policy would review revenue potential from taxing marijuana. The focus is on economic aspects of legalizing marijuana, including arguments for taxes and tax designs. Marijuana is derived from the Cannabis sativa plant and is used for recreational or medicinal purposes. Marijuana, derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, is used for recreational or medicinal purposes. It contains THC as the main psychoactive ingredient, but other cannabinoids also contribute to its effects. Different strains may have varying levels of cannabinoids, with some sought for non-psychoactive benefits like anxiety relief. The potency of marijuana products can vary based on preparation, with higher concentrations of THC found in the leaves and flowers compared to the stalks and stems. The potency of marijuana products can vary based on the plant parts used. The leaves and flowers have higher THC concentrations, while the stalks and stems have almost no psychoactive content. Female plants grown without pollination produce sinsemilla varieties with 10%-18% THC. Marijuana is typically consumed by smoking, with joints containing less than half a gram of marijuana. Marijuana can be consumed in various ways, such as smoking joints or blunts, with joints containing less than half a gram of marijuana per hit. Other methods include using glass pipes, vaporizers, or consuming edibles like candy or baked goods infused with THC. Excise taxes on marijuana products are discussed in economic analysis. Excise taxes on marijuana products are discussed in economic analysis, suggesting reasons for imposing such taxes including reflecting external costs to society, discouraging use, preventing price falls, funding related programs, and raising revenue. Economic efficiency is achieved when the price of a commodity equals its costs, with the rationale often used for similar commodities like alcohol and tobacco. The level of tax should be based on external costs separate from those borne by the user, such as the value of lost years of life due to substance use. The external costs of substance use, such as early death and lost earnings, should be separate from costs borne by the user. Society bears some costs like lost tax revenue and healthcare expenses, but also gains from lower future costs. A study estimated $30 billion in external costs for alcohol, which can be used to estimate costs for marijuana. Despite no specific study on marijuana, a tax may be necessary to correct for externalities. No U.S. study on marijuana of this nature could be found, but comparing costs of cannabis to alcohol shows lower external harm. Alcohol ranked 72 in harm, while cannabis ranked 20, or 28% of alcohol. Canadian study found health costs per user for marijuana at about 12%. Marijuana's non-health costs are likely lower than alcohol, with evidence suggesting less impairment in driving ability and lower domestic violence rates. Enforcement costs for marijuana are higher, possibly due to its illicit status. The Canadian study found that marijuana has lower external harm compared to alcohol, with evidence suggesting lower domestic violence rates. Marijuana usage is less common than alcohol, with external costs estimated to range from $0.5 billion to $1.7 billion. The 2014 ONDCP report provides estimates of the total market size and price of marijuana in the United States, with total expenditures ranging from $30 billion to $60 billion in 2010. The report also notes a 40% increase in marijuana consumption from 2002 to 2010 and an increase in THC levels during the same period. The estimated external cost implies a tax of 0.8% to 5.3% of the current price. The ONDCP estimates the market size of marijuana in the US at $30 billion to $60 billion, with external cost implying a tax of 0.8% to 5.3% of the current price. The White House's 2014 report shows a constant nominal price of marijuana from 2000 to 2010, suggesting a decrease in inflation-adjusted price over time. Anecdotal prices from anonymous sources and data from priceofweed.com estimate the price of marijuana at $317 per ounce. The price of marijuana can vary depending on location, with estimates ranging from $224 to $317 per ounce. Tax rates of 0.8% to 5.3% are applied, but in a legal market, prices would be lower. External costs range from $1.60 to $16.80 per ounce. In a fully competitive market, prices could potentially drop to as low as $5 per ounce. Estimates suggest that the price of marijuana in a fully competitive market could be as low as $5 per ounce, with taxes ranging from $0.30 to $0.05 per joint. Comparatively, federal taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic drinks are lower than potential marijuana taxes. States and localities also impose taxes on alcohol and tobacco, which may exceed the external costs of marijuana. The external costs of marijuana are already high, suggesting a relatively small tax compared to current prices. Imposing a tax could discourage users, especially underage ones, who may underestimate long-term health costs and dependence risks. Studies show a percentage of users become dependent, with medical marijuana laws increasing abuse probabilities. More research is needed to improve understanding of marijuana risks, with economists debating whether user behavior is suboptimal. Economists debate whether user behavior is suboptimal regarding addiction risk. A tax on marijuana, like alcohol and tobacco taxes, would primarily affect heavy users. A tax on marijuana, similar to alcohol and tobacco taxes, would mainly impact heavy users. Researchers estimate that a small percentage of marijuana users make up the majority of consumption. The regressive nature of a marijuana tax could be seen as undesirable, but current users may benefit from lower prices if marijuana is legalized. The effectiveness of taxes in discouraging consumption depends on how users respond to price changes, with economists using elasticities to measure these responses. If the price elasticity is low, the tax may not significantly alter behavior but still impose a burden on users. Gallet (2014) analyzed 42 studies on illicit drug demand, including 13 on marijuana elasticity. Results show a 1% price increase leads to a 0.15% to 0.31% demand decrease. Users are minimally affected by price changes, making them more likely to be harmed by a tax meant to optimize consumption. Government policies aim to limit drug use by minors, including marijuana. Despite state laws prohibiting purchases by those under 21, youth can still access marijuana through various means. Studies suggest that taxes may effectively reduce youth usage, with estimates of price elasticity being higher for minors. The challenge lies in determining the appropriate tax burden on adult users to deter youth consumption. Setting a tax that prevents a significant price drop post-legalization is crucial, especially for minors who are more sensitive to price changes. The next section explores the potential tax levels needed to achieve this goal. After legalization, the cost of marijuana is expected to decrease significantly due to increased production and reduced enforcement costs. This could lead to a need for a relatively high tax to prevent prices from falling too much, especially to deter youth consumption. The market may evolve in a way that some firms gain market power, impacting pricing dynamics. After legalization, the cost of marijuana is expected to decrease significantly due to increased production and reduced enforcement costs. This could lead to a need for a relatively high tax to prevent prices from falling too much. The market may evolve in a way that some firms gain market power, impacting pricing dynamics. In a competitive market, firms earn no profit above the normal return necessary to attract capital. Prices would fall to reflect lower production costs, providing a range within which a federal tax rate might be considered. The tax should not be set too high to discourage illicit production. Caulkins (2010) estimates the production costs of legalized marijuana, with outdoor production costing less but containing lower THC levels. Processing costs add $20 to $35 per pound. Greenhouse production costs around $215 plus $35 per pound for processing, while outdoor production costs around $10 plus $35 per pound. These costs vary based on THC concentration. The cost of producing marijuana varies depending on the method used. Outdoor production costs around $10 plus $35 per pound for processing, resulting in a cost of about $2.80 per ounce. Government-sponsored marijuana in Canada can be produced at 33 cents per gram, leading to a cost of $5-$18 per ounce. Prices for marijuana in quasi-legal jurisdictions are typically lower than street prices but higher than production costs. In Canada, medical marijuana prices range from $1.80-$5 per gram to the final consumer, with suppliers able to supply for $1-$4 per gram. The price of medical marijuana in Canada ranges from $1.80-$5 per gram to the final consumer, with suppliers able to supply for $1-$4 per gram. Street prices are listed as $10-$15 per gram. The Canadian government set the price of medical marijuana at $7.60 per gram in April 2014. Small growers and homegrown marijuana will no longer be permitted under the new law. Prices in Colorado marijuana shops can be observed through websites like Leafly.com. Leafly.com is a website and app that helps users find marijuana shops and doctors in Colorado. They provide consumer reviews and prices for various marijuana products. Prices range from $9 to $15 per gram, $29 to $40 per eighth of an ounce, and $190 to $350 per ounce. Prices in Colorado are lower than national averages, with high-quality marijuana at $238 per ounce and medium quality at $197 per ounce. Prices of marijuana in Colorado are lower than national averages, with high-quality at $238 per ounce and medium quality at $197 per ounce. However, the prices do not reflect those in a fully legal market due to the quasi-legal status. Producers may face challenges with banking assistance and high federal income taxes due to the federal government's non-recognition of the legality of these operations. In a fully legal marijuana market, businesses could face high federal income taxes without deductions, potential enforcement from federal authorities, and a wide range of projected prices from a few dollars to $100 per ounce. Prices in Colorado, although lower than national averages, do not reflect those in a fully legal market due to the quasi-legal status. In a fully legal marijuana market, prices could range from a few dollars to $100 per ounce. Street prices currently range from $200-$300 per ounce, suggesting room for a tax rate adjustment to align with legalized prices. Taxes should be carefully set to avoid encouraging the illicit market and to fund marijuana research. Lowering tax and observing market conditions may be the best initial strategy in a legal marijuana market. Revenue from a marijuana tax could fund research on medical marijuana, which has been approved by 23 states and the District of Columbia. The American College of Physicians report highlights barriers to marijuana research and urges studying its efficacy and side effects. Legalization would allow for studying a wide range of issues, including externalities and health effects. Revenue could also finance information programs on the risks of marijuana use and discourage consumption by minors. The report discusses the potential revenue from an excise tax on marijuana, which could be used for funding research on medical marijuana and information programs to discourage consumption by minors. The tax could be designed to achieve a specific revenue target, but the actual revenue raised is uncertain due to market uncertainties and the potential entry of casual consumers. The potential revenue from an excise tax on marijuana could increase with the entry of casual consumers into the market. Legalization at the state level may impact federal excise tax revenue, as more states legalizing marijuana could constrain federal tax levies. Analysts have estimated potential revenue from nationwide legalization, considering various economic models and excise taxes. Some analysts estimate that nationwide marijuana legalization could generate $5.8 billion annually in excise taxes, with a 50% tax rate on consumer prices. This assumes a $13.13 billion national market, a 50% price drop post-legalization, and a 25% consumption increase. Additionally, there could be $3.3 billion in annual law enforcement savings. Miron and Waldock suggest a tax of $50-$75 per ounce. Miron and Waldock estimate a tax of around $50-$75 per ounce for marijuana. They note that their market size estimates are smaller compared to others and assume a higher consumer response. The calculation shows how to estimate revenues from an excise tax, considering market conditions, state, and federal taxes. Data on price and quantity are crucial for revenue estimation, with market value ranging from $30 billion to $60 billion. Assuming a $40 billion market and a $250 current price, potential revenue effects are illustrated with a fully legalized industry scenario. In a fully legalized marijuana industry scenario, assuming a pretax price of $50 per ounce and additional state and federal taxes totaling $50 per ounce, the total price would be $150 per ounce. With a price elasticity of -0.25, legalization alone could lead to a 50% increase in quantity due to the price drop. The federal excise tax revenue could reach $8 billion, with potential for higher collections due to increased consumption. Assuming a price elasticity of -0.25, legalization alone could lead to a 50% increase in quantity with a price drop to $50 per ounce. With federal, state, and local taxes totaling $150 per ounce, the projected excise tax collection is $9.1 billion. However, after accounting for income and wage tax losses, the estimated revenue gain is $6.8 billion. The yield will also depend on the extent of legalization and coverage of medical marijuana, with potential for higher revenue if other states tax medical marijuana. Currently, only Colorado and Washington allow recreational marijuana, representing less than 4% of the population, so short-term yield may be less than $300 million. Currently, only Colorado and Washington allow recreational marijuana, representing less than 4% of the population. The short-term yield might be less than $300 million, but more revenue could be gained if medical marijuana in other states were taxed. Tax collection data from Colorado and Washington could serve as early indicators of the potential tax base of a national legalized market. Marijuana sales are subject to several layers of taxation at the state and local level, with effective tax rates between 15% and 25%. The effective tax rate on marijuana products in Colorado ranges from 15% to 25%, with additional local taxes possible. Colorado collected over $37.0 million in sales taxes, excise taxes, and license fees on recreational marijuana from January to September 2014. Extrapolating from this data, the national market for marijuana could be estimated to be between $15.9 billion and $17.0 billion per year for recreational marijuana. Medical marijuana tax data is harder to extrapolate nationally due to incomplete data in some states. The combined medical and recreational marijuana sales in Colorado suggest a market of at least $30 billion annually, with potential issues regarding non-resident sales and the enforcement of medical exemptions. The Colorado market may be underdeveloped, leading to continued illicit sales. The discussion focuses on the design issues of implementing an excise tax on marijuana. It highlights the importance of exempting medical marijuana and the challenges of enforcing such exemptions. The tax is typically levied on manufacturers and imports to reduce administrative costs and tax evasion. Different tax bases, such as per unit measurement or product price, have their own advantages and disadvantages. A tax by weight is compared to the federal excise tax regime for tobacco and is relatively easy to administer. A weight-based tax for marijuana is similar to the federal excise tax for tobacco, easy to administer, and could be based on wet or dry weight. However, a potency-based tax, based on THC content per ounce, could be more complex and costly to enforce due to the need for accurate lab testing. Regulations would be necessary to define sample sizes for testing potency. The accuracy and reliability of testing strains for marijuana potency would require regulations on sample sizes. Lab tests can cost $60-$120 per sample, with potential price reductions due to increased competition. However, measuring THC content accurately may be challenging, leading to potential issues with underestimation. A tax based on THC potency could incentivize consumption of less potent marijuana, potentially impacting public health costs. A tax based on THC potency could incentivize consumption of less potent marijuana, potentially impacting public health costs. An alternative potency calculation could be based on the ratio of THC to cannabidiol (CBD), encouraging consumers to purchase marijuana with more sedative effects. Ad valorem taxes, like those in Colorado and Washington, automatically adjust for price changes and can be easily applied to a wide variety of products. However, the main disadvantage is the need for regulations to specify the taxable price. A manufacturers tax is a simple form of administration imposed at the manufacturer stage for products like tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. Regulations are needed to determine taxable prices for vertically integrated firms. A retail tax regime could capture price markups due to product type or market power. Per unit taxes can be indexed for inflation using measures like the Consumer Price Index. The tax rate for THC could be adjusted for inflation using measures like the Consumer Price Index. Sunset provisions could be included in marijuana tax laws to adapt to changing market conditions. Tax rates could start low to combat the illicit market and gradually increase to limit consumption. Legislation could delegate authority to adjust tax rates based on certain criteria. Various taxation methods could be combined for a comprehensive approach. The tax rate for marijuana could be set high to limit consumption or delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury for adjustments. Different tax methods like price or weight-based levies could be combined, with differential rates for products. Tax rates based on potency and category, similar to alcohol, could shape consumption and reduce negative social costs. However, this could lead to unequal tax burdens among consumers. Lawmakers would need to consider integrating existing marijuana stocks into the tax base. A federal marijuana tax could raise questions about integrating existing stocks into the tax base. This could help producers meet initial demand, reduce complexity between federal and local tax regulations, and increase federal tax revenue. However, some existing products may not comply with new regulations. An alternative option could be to provide ample lead time for producers to comply before the tax takes effect. A federal marijuana tax could raise questions about integrating existing stocks into the tax base, giving producers time to comply with regulations. Colorado and Washington have different approaches to this issue. When federal excise taxes increase, untaxed floor stocks are subject to tax to prevent inventory buildup. Several issues could arise concerning restrictions, exemptions, and special treatment under a federal tax on marijuana. Several issues could arise concerning restrictions, exemptions, and special treatment under a federal tax on marijuana. Policy makers could choose to implement regulations at the federal level or allow states to make their own laws. Age restrictions on recreational marijuana purchases could limit the tax base, but trends may change post-legalization. Excluding younger consumers from the legal tax base could lead to underground production or indirect sales through of-age connections. Under Colorado state law, residents can possess up to one ounce of marijuana and make unlimited transactions as long as they stay within the limit. Non-residents are limited to purchasing one quarter of an ounce in a single transaction to reduce the risk of diversion. Washington has set a target of 80 metric tons for its marijuana market size, with restrictions on production to prevent diversion. Washington has a target of 80 metric tons for its marijuana market size, with restrictions on production to prevent diversion and monitor sales to other states. Production limits could reduce the power of larger producers and generate inefficiency in the market. Mark Kleiman, a Professor of Public Policy at UCLA, suggests that a production limit could also reduce negative social consequences of marijuana consumption. Production limits for marijuana aim to prevent diversion and monitor sales, potentially benefiting larger producers. Tax treatment varies by jurisdiction, with medical marijuana subject to general sales tax. Medical marijuana use is contentious but may reduce prescription drug overdoses. Evidence suggests a negative correlation between medical marijuana and prescription drugs, as deaths from prescription drug overdoses have declined in states with medical marijuana. Differences in the after-tax price of recreational and medical marijuana could incentivize users to seek medical prescriptions. Exempting medical marijuana from federal tax could limit the tax base if strict standards for medical prescriptions are not enforced. Segregation of sales and marking devices may be necessary if medical marijuana is exempt from tax. Rules for home growing of marijuana vary by jurisdiction. Rules for home growing of marijuana vary by jurisdiction. Colorado allows individuals to grow up to six plants for recreational use, while Washington does not permit home growing for recreational use. Federal law prohibits home distilling of alcohol, but allows limited production of wine and beer. Tobacco can be grown without limit. The issue of home production exemption from taxation raises questions about quantity limits, with experts suggesting that a single plant can yield a significant amount of marijuana. Despite concerns, home production is not seen as a major threat to tax revenue. The debate over home production exemption from marijuana taxation suggests that it could undermine enforcement efforts. Small producers may be eligible for lower tax rates, similar to the wine and beer industry. However, a lower tax for small producers may complicate tax collection efficiency. Another proposal is to apply a lower tax to outdoor-grown marijuana due to its lower energy consumption. A small businesses exemption for marijuana taxation could lead to larger evasion, as processing and distribution are easier on a small scale. Lower taxes on outdoor-grown marijuana, which uses less energy, may reduce prices and encourage outdoor cultivation. Concerns exist about negative environmental effects from outdoor cultivation diverting land and water. Incentives for higher-potency marijuana could drive indoor production. Another option is a special occupational tax on businesses involved in marijuana production, distribution, or sales. The federal Special Occupational Taxes (SOTs) are annual flat fees collected from certain businesses in the tobacco, firearms, and previously alcohol industries. The Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013 proposes a $1,000 yearly tax on marijuana producers, importers, and manufacturers, and a $500 tax for others in the marijuana business. Enforcement efforts are crucial for a sustainable federal tax regime on marijuana, as seen in historical examples of alcohol enforcement after Prohibition. Enforcement efforts for marijuana legalization would need to deter consumers from illegal transactions and compel producers to pay taxes. Without adequate resources for tax enforcement, legalizing and taxing marijuana could undermine the federal tax base. Marijuana smuggling may be more prevalent than illegal alcohol production due to its compact nature. Collecting taxes closer to the point of production could reduce the number of taxable entities and increase monitoring efficiency. Tax enforcement for marijuana legalization could be improved by collecting taxes closer to the point of production. This would reduce the number of taxable entities and increase monitoring efficiency. Various methods such as tax stamps, seals on packages, individual marks on joints, or the use of dye could be employed to track tax payments. Colorado has implemented a system that tracks marijuana plants from \"seed to sale\" using RFID tags. New technological developments like genetic markers or tracking systems are also being considered for monitoring production. Marijuana enterprises in Colorado are required to use RFID tags and labels for tracking plants from \"seed to sale.\" The state utilizes a system called Marijuana Inventory Tracking Solutions (MITS) to monitor inventory and ensure compliance. Standardized weights and potency measurements may be necessary for a marijuana tax regime to enhance consumer safety and dosing accuracy. The U.S. Department of the Treasury could establish marketing standards for labeling and branding different strains of marijuana to inform consumers and regulate competition. Different tax rates for medical and recreational marijuana are also being considered. The 113th Congress made changes to U.S. policies regarding industrial hemp during the omnibus farm bill debate. The Agricultural Act of 2014 includes a provision allowing certain research institutions and state departments of agriculture to grow industrial hemp. Hemp has no commercial value as a psychoactive due to its low THC concentrations. Proper enforcement of regulations is crucial for income tax collection from nonprofit medical marijuana dispensaries. The Agricultural Act of 2014 (H.R. 2642) allows research institutions and state agriculture departments to grow industrial hemp if permitted by state laws. Hemp, with low THC levels, could be legalized for industrial production if marijuana is legalized. THC content is used to differentiate hemp from marijuana for tax purposes. Europe and Canada require less than 0.3% THC for legal hemp. Concerns about marijuana hidden in hemp fields are overstated due to cross-pollination weakening marijuana plants. The potential for marijuana to be hidden in hemp fields is overstated, as cross-pollination weakens marijuana plants. The delay in federal legalization could impact state marijuana tax policies, with some states opting for private business licensing over state-based monopolies. State-based monopolies are seen as a way to regulate consumption but are also criticized for being susceptible to corruption and driven by revenue motives. The uncertainties surrounding legalized and taxed marijuana markets, including pricing, market size, consumer response, and revenue projections, make it challenging to determine the effects. This uncertainty also extends to setting tax levels and choosing how to impose the tax due to unknown factors such as spillover and health effects. The uncertainties surrounding legalized and taxed marijuana markets, including pricing, market size, consumer response, and revenue projections, make it challenging to determine the effects. The uncertainty about prices, spillover, and health effects of marijuana complicates setting tax levels and choosing how to impose the tax. The tax base for legalized marijuana sales is more limited compared to alcohol or tobacco, especially if medical marijuana sales are exempt from federal tax. Additionally, the relationship between marijuana and alcohol consumption impacts the social costs of marijuana legalization. The relationship between marijuana and alcohol consumption impacts the social costs of marijuana legalization. Researchers have not reached a consensus on whether marijuana is a substitute for alcohol or if they are consumed together. Marijuana research in the United States is highly regulated, with limited focus on potential medical benefits. The National Institute on Drug Abuse in the United States does not fund research on the medical benefits of marijuana. Colorado and Washington have implemented broad legalization policies, providing researchers with an opportunity to study the effects. The relationship between marijuana and alcohol consumption affects the social costs of legalization. The effects of marijuana legalization in Colorado and Washington could help researchers understand broader legalization policies, including polydrug use and driving under the influence. Studies show marijuana has lower addiction risks compared to other drugs, but some believe it may lead to further illicit drug use. Research on marijuana's impact on traffic fatalities is limited, with some studies focusing on driving abilities and others on actual fatalities. Experiments measure marijuana effects on driving abilities and link to fatalities. Marijuana is most detected non-alcohol drug in drivers, but not directly linked to traffic deaths. Testing technology limited in detecting marijuana intoxication levels. Positive tests indicate use, not impairment. Advanced tests needed for accurate detection. The prevalence of nonalcoholic drugs in the blood may indicate use but not necessarily impairment. Marijuana legalization could potentially lead to savings in criminal justice spending, with estimates varying in size. Some researchers suggest that the impact of legalizing marijuana on criminal incarcerations may be smaller than initially estimated. Sevigny and Caulkins (2004) estimated that 8% of state and federal prison inmates serving sentences for drug law violations were marijuana-only offenders. U.S. Sentencing Commission data shows that 28.4% of federal drug-related sentences were for marijuana offenses, the highest share among drug categories. Legalizing marijuana could potentially lead to 2% fewer prisoners in state and local jails over time. Federal legalization may not impact current inmates serving marijuana-related charges. Legalizing marijuana could result in a 2% reduction in prisoners in jails over time, with marijuana-only violations accounting for a small percentage of incarcerations. Federal legalization may not affect current inmates with marijuana-related charges. The majority of costs associated with the black market for illicit drugs are related to illegal stimulants and opiates, not marijuana. Marijuana transactions often occur indoors among familiar parties, reducing conflict risk compared to outdoor exchanges with strangers. Marijuana businesses cannot deduct expenses like payroll and rent due to IRC Section 280E, resulting in an implicit tax on the industry enforced by the IRS. The IRS enforces IRC Section 280E, disallowing marijuana businesses from deducting expenses like payroll and rent, resulting in a significant tax burden on the industry. Some businesses, like Canna Care marijuana dispensary, have challenged these tax penalties in court, highlighting the discrepancies between federal and state tax treatments for marijuana-related businesses. The current federal tax laws create economic incentives for marijuana businesses to operate in the underground economy due to the inability to deduct business expenses, resulting in implicit taxes up to 39.6% for sole proprietors or partnerships and 35% for corporations. This gives illicit sellers an advantage as they are not subject to direct taxation. The Small Business Tax Equity Act of 2013 aims to exempt compliant marijuana businesses from certain tax restrictions. The estimate of a national marijuana tax base can be calculated by extrapolating tax collection data from Colorado or Washington, with potential underrepresentation of total demand due to pending licenses for more businesses. The most recent tax revenue data from Colorado are used to calculate the state's marijuana tax base, considering the 10% retail marijuana sales tax and the 2.9% general sales tax. The two tax calculations are averaged to determine a monthly aggregate tax base for recreational marijuana sales. The total tax base for recreational marijuana sales is derived from the 10% retail marijuana sales tax and the 2.9% general sales tax in Colorado. The tax base calculations are averaged to estimate $30.0 million in recreational marijuana sales in September 2014. This data can be extrapolated to calculate a national sales tax base by considering each state's population and marijuana usage rates. The sales tax base for recreational marijuana in Colorado can be used to estimate the national sales tax base by considering population and usage rates. The estimated national sales tax base could be $14.5 billion to $15.4 billion per year. Medical marijuana tax base in Colorado is calculated using the 2.9% general sales tax, with sales totaling $31.3 million in September 2014. The medical marijuana tax base in Colorado has been increasing since January 2014, with sales totaling $31.3 million in September 2014. Monthly sales have ranged between $31 million and $35 million from January to September 2014. Before the legalization of recreational marijuana in FY2013, the annual medical marijuana tax base was $314.2 million. It is uncertain if the opening of the recreational marijuana market has impacted the demand for medical marijuana in Colorado. However, extrapolating this data to the general U.S. population is challenging due to incomplete data in some states and potential self-selection bias among medical marijuana patients. Based on Colorado's tax collections data, medical marijuana consumption could double total marijuana consumption amounts, even if regulations were more strictly enforced post-legalization. Users denied a medical card could still purchase marijuana for recreational purposes."
