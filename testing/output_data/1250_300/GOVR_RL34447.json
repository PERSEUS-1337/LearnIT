Violating this rule can lead to revocation of their 501(c)(3) status or taxation on political expenditures. Only two churches have lost their status for campaign intervention, including the Church at Pierce Creek in New York. Other religious organizations like Christian Echoes National Ministry have also faced revocation. The Johnson Amendment, named after Senator Lyndon Johnson, prohibits 501(c)(3) organizations from participating in political campaigns. Some religious organizations, including Christian Echoes National Ministry, have had their 501(c)(3) status revoked for violating this rule. The provision was introduced in 1954 and has been enforced through settlement agreements with the IRS. The Johnson Amendment prohibits 501(c)(3) organizations from participating in political campaigns. While IRC Section 501(c)(3) only prohibits campaign intervention, houses of worship with this status may engage in political activities not related to elections, such as issue advocacy, lobbying, and supporting or opposing appointments to nonelective offices. The line between prohibited and permitted activities can be difficult to discern, with biases needing careful consideration to avoid campaign intervention. Houses of worship with 501(c)(3) status can engage in certain election-related activities as long as they do not show bias for or against any candidate. The IRS warns that even subtle biases in voter education materials or candidate appearances could be considered campaign intervention. Factors like timing, distribution, and equal treatment of candidates are important considerations. Houses of worship with 501(c)(3) status can engage in election-related activities without bias for or against candidates. Factors like equal opportunity for candidates to speak, nonpartisan atmosphere, and clear non-candidate roles are important for permissible activities. Religious leaders can endorse or oppose candidates as individuals, but bias in any form is still impermissible. Religious leaders with 501(c)(3) status can endorse or oppose candidates as individuals, but bias in any form is impermissible. They should not imply they are speaking on behalf of their house of worship, which cannot support campaign activities. IRS has special rules for tax inquiries into churches engaging in campaign activity to avoid First Amendment concerns. IRS has special rules for tax inquiries into churches engaging in campaign activity to avoid First Amendment concerns. IRC Section 7611 provides rules for IRS inquiries into houses of worship that may no longer qualify for 501(c)(3) status. An \"appropriate high-level Treasury official\" must reasonably believe, based on written facts, that an inquiry is necessary. The IRS must provide written notices to the house of worship, explaining the inquiry's subject matter and concerns. If the entity's response is inadequate, the IRS can proceed to examine its records and activities, providing a second notice with details of the examination. The IRS has special rules for tax inquiries into churches engaging in campaign activity to avoid First Amendment concerns. Under IRC Section 7611, an \"appropriate high-level Treasury official\" must reasonably believe that a house of worship may no longer qualify for 501(c)(3) status before an inquiry can begin. The inquiry must include a description of the records and activities being examined, an offer for a conference to resolve concerns, and must be completed within two years. Approval from IRS counsel is required for any revocation of 501(c)(3) status, notice of deficiency, or tax assessment. Further inquiries and examinations are limited within a five-year period. After changes made by the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, the position of \"appropriate high-level Treasury official\" for determining if a house of worship may lose its 501(c)(3) status was shifted to the Director of Exempt Organizations. However, there have been debates on whether this position meets the criteria of being sufficiently high-ranking and independent. The finalization of proposed regulations regarding this issue is still pending. The Director of Exempt Organizations does not meet the criteria to be considered an appropriate high-level Treasury official. Finalization of regulations regarding this issue is still pending, causing concerns about IRS enforcement. Some argue that the political campaign prohibition for churches violates First Amendment rights, although the Supreme Court has not addressed this issue. Two U.S. Courts of Appeals have upheld the prohibition against First Amendment challenges. The Tenth Circuit rejected the district court's ruling that lobbying and campaign activity restrictions violated First Amendment rights for a nonprofit religious organization. The court held that the limitations did not infringe on the organization's Free Exercise Clause rights, only denying tax-exempt status in accordance with compelling interests. The Tenth Circuit upheld the lobbying and campaign activity limitations, stating that they did not violate the First Amendment. The court emphasized that tax-exempt status is a privilege, not a right, and found that the restrictions did not infringe on the organization's free speech rights. The court justified the limitations based on the principle of separation and neutrality between church and state, ensuring that government does not indirectly support organizations involved in legislative goals or candidate elections. In 2000, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the revocation of a church's tax-exempt status for campaign intervention, stating it did not violate the church's free exercise and free speech rights. The church had placed advertisements against a presidential candidate and solicited tax-deductible donations, leading to the IRS revoking its 501(c)(3) status. The court found that the church failed to show its right to freely exercise its religion had been substantially burdened. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the revocation of a church's tax-exempt status for campaign intervention, stating it did not violate the church's free exercise and free speech rights. The court found that the church failed to show its right to freely exercise its religion had been substantially burdened. The church could set up a related 501(c)(4) social welfare organization to establish a political action committee (PAC) for its opinions about candidates. The court rejected the church's claim of viewpoint discrimination by the IRS. The court upheld the revocation of a church's tax-exempt status for campaign intervention, stating it did not violate the church's First Amendment rights. The IRS developed a political activity compliance initiative in 2004 to address concerns of 501(c)(3) organizations violating campaign prohibition. The initiative includes public outreach and a fast-track review process for allegations of campaign activity. The IRS used this initiative for the 2004, 2006, and 2008 election cycles, but has not updated data or discussed it publicly since 2008.

The initiative was used for the 2004, 2006, and 2008 election cycles, but has not been updated or publicly discussed since 2008. The Living Word Christian Center decision led to the suspension of church tax inquiries. In the 2004 initiative, 132 cases were reviewed, with 63 involving houses of worship. Of the 110 remaining cases, 47 were house of worship cases, with 46 closed by 2007. The IRS issued written advisories in 42 cases where campaign activity was found, but no penalties were imposed due to mitigating factors. The IRS investigated campaign activity in churches, finding impermissible actions such as distributing biased voter guides and allowing candidates to use church facilities. In 2006, 44 out of 100 cases examined involved houses of worship, with 14 cases closed by 2007. The IRS also checked state campaign finance databases for 501(c)(3) organizations making campaign contributions from 2003 to 2005, finding 269 apparent incidences.

The IRS also checked state campaign finance databases for 501(c)(3) organizations making campaign contributions from 2003 to 2005, finding 269 apparent incidences. The IRS found 269 apparent incidences of contributions, of which 87 involved church contributions totaling $45,151. As of the 2007 update, 86 of the 87 cases remained open; the IRS determined one case did not merit examination. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) prohibits corporations\u2014including incorporated 501(c)(3) religious entities\u2014from using general treasury funds to make contributions in connection with federal elections. The IRC prohibits all 501(c)(3) organizations, regardless of corporate status, from making such contributions. The Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. FEC invalidated prohibitions in FECA on corporations and labor unions using general treasury funds for independent expenditures and electioneering communications. This decision does not significantly impact houses of worship with 501(c)(3) status due to tax code prohibitions. The activities regulated by FECA and the IRC may differ, such as issue advocacy communication timing. The Citizens United decision does not have a significant impact on houses of worship with 501(c)(3) status. Legislation has been introduced in the 112th Congress to repeal the IRC provision prohibiting these organizations from engaging in campaign activity. If enacted, houses of worship could engage in campaign activity without risking their tax-exempt status, as long as it is not their primary activity. The bill introduced in the 112th Congress aims to allow houses of worship with 501(c)(3) status to engage in campaign activity without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status, as long as it is not their primary activity. This legislation does not change the current reporting requirements for these organizations, meaning they are not required to report campaign activities to the IRS. Additionally, the bill specifies that it does not affect the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971.
