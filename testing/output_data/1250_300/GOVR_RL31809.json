The Administration's budget for FY2004 proposed $1.203 billion for the USPTO, with an additional $201 million to be raised through fee structure changes. The budget authority of $1.404 billion was 19% higher than FY2003 but $100 million less than the estimated fee collection of $1.504 billion. The final budget authority in the FY2004 Omnibus Appropriations Act was $1.222 billion derived from fees collected in FY2004. The FY2004 Omnibus Appropriations Act provided the USPTO with $1.222 billion in budget authority, which was 3% more than FY2003 but $282 million less than anticipated fees for FY2004. The Senate Committee on Appropriations had proposed $1.217 billion in fees for FY2004. The USPTO had a budget authority of $1.182 billion for FY2003, which was $345 million less than expected fees.

The Bush Administration's FY2004 budget requested $496.8 million for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), 30% less than the FY2003 appropriation. This reduction was due to cuts in support for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP). $27 million was allocated for ATP to cover ongoing commitments, while $12.6 million was designated for MEP to support centers lacking 6 years of federal funding. The FY2004 budget for NIST included $27 million for ATP to cover ongoing commitments and $12.6 million for MEP to support centers lacking federal funding. In-house research and development under STRS would be funded at $387.6 million, with a construction budget of $69.6 million. Initially, H.R. 2799 provided $460.1 million for NIST, a 35% decrease from FY2003, with no funding for ATP and reduced support for MEP. However, P.L. 108-199 incorporated H.R. 2799, resulting in NIST being funded at $628.1 million, 12% below the previous year. The FY2004 Omnibus Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-199) funded NIST at $628.1 million, with decreases in funding for STRS, Manufacturing Extension, and ATP. The Senate's proposed funding for NIST was $835.2 million, with significant increases for Manufacturing Extension Program. The Senate's proposed funding for NIST in FY2004 was $835.2 million, with significant increases for the Manufacturing Extension Program and the Advanced Technology Program. The bill also allocated $383.4 million for the STRS account, $106.6 million for MEP, and $259.6 million for ATP, with $50 million designated for homeland security projects. Construction funding was set at $84.6 million. Continued support for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) has been a major funding issue, with opponents calling it \"corporate welfare\" and proponents arguing it assists businesses in developing crucial technologies. Despite initial lack of funding in some appropriation bills, Congress has maintained support for ATP. The Bush Administration's FY2004 budget proposal aimed to eliminate the program, but it was included in P.L. 108-199, the Omnibus Appropriations Act.

The Judiciary's final financial plan for FY2004, based on a 4.7% increase in funding, led to staffing cuts and service curtailments in court units.
