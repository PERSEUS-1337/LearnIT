Congress finds that the Middle Rio Grande bosque in Albuquerque, New Mexico is the largest continuous cottonwood forest in the Southwest, an old inhabited area, home to 6 pueblos, and a critical habitat for migratory birds. It provides water to many in New Mexico and should be maintained to protect endangered species and the river flow while enhancing public access. The Corps of Engineers' mission includes environmental restoration, and they should aim to reestablish hydrologic connections in the area. The Corps of Engineers should reestablish the hydrologic connection between the Middle Rio Grande and the Middle Rio Grande bosque to ensure healthy vegetation growth. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"critical restoration project\" as a project that will provide immediate ecosystem restoration benefits, \"Middle Rio Grande\" as a portion of the Rio Grande in New Mexico, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Army. The Secretary will carry out critical restoration projects along the Middle Rio Grande based on feasibility studies and existing plans. Local participation from public and private entities active in ecosystem restoration in the Rio Grande watershed is required. Cost-sharing agreements must be established before project implementation.
