    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gulf War Veterans' Iraqi Claims Protection Act of 1998\". Adjudication of claims is addressed in the Act. The United States Commission is authorized to receive and determine the validity and amounts of claims by U.S. nationals against Iraq. In deciding claims, the Commission applies applicable substantive law and principles of justice. Priority is given to non-commercial claims related to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the attack on the USS Stark. The International Claims Settlement Act applies where not inconsistent with this Act. The International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 applies to claims under this Act, to the extent they are not inconsistent with its provisions. SEC. 3. CLAIMS FUNDS. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to establish the Iraq Claims Fund for payment of claims. Proceeds from Iraqi asset liquidation will be allocated between the Iraq Claims Fund and other accounts for payment of US Government claims, with a limitation on the amount allocated for US Government claims. The government is limited in exceeding the amount allocated to the Iraq Claims Fund based on certified claims of the United States Government determined to be valid by the Secretary of State. The President is authorized to vest and liquidate Iraqi assets in the US to satisfy claims under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Reimbursement for administrative expenses includes a 1.5% deduction from the Iraq Claims Fund. Payments are to be made accordingly. The United States Commission certifies awards to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment from the Iraq Claims Fund in a specific order of priority. Payments are made towards the principal amount of the award, unpaid balances, and accrued interest, with pro rata distributions. After payment of awards from the Iraq Claims Fund, any remaining funds will be transferred to the US Treasury. Payment of awards does not extinguish unsatisfied claims against the Government of Iraq. The head of any Executive agency may transfer records to the United States Commission for claims adjudication. The Secretary of the Treasury must publish a notice in the Federal Register after 9 years, detailing the statute of limitations for certified claims. Any demand for payment on certified awards will be barred after one year from the publication date. Unused funds must be disposed of within 2 years by depositing them in the Treasury. At the end of a 2-year period, the Secretary of the Treasury will dispose of any unused funds from the Iraq Claims Fund by depositing them as miscellaneous receipts in the Treasury if not used for additional payments. The unused funds are the remaining balance in the Iraq Claims Fund. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. This section defines key terms used in the Act, including \"Executive agency,\" \"Government of Iraq,\" \"United Nations Commission,\" and \"United States Commission.\""
