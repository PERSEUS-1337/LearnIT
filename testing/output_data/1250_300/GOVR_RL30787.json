The House parliamentary procedure is governed by multiple authorities, not just chamber rules. House rules are not self-enforcing, and the House rarely disregards its precedents. The House adheres to many practices that have developed informally. The rules of the House are not the only authority governing parliamentary procedure. The interaction among various authorities affects procedural situations. The House's parliamentary procedure is influenced by various authorities, not just its own rules. The Constitution grants the House the power to establish its procedural rules, which are determined at the start of each Congress.

Procedural regulations can be established through simple resolutions or statutory measures, which require agreement between both houses and the President. These procedures have the same standing as House and Senate rules. Statutory rule-making provisions give each chamber rule-making authority, subject to change through adoption of a simple resolution. These provisions establish procedures for congressional action on specified matters, including expedited procedures for executive branch proposals requiring congressional approval. Statutory rule-making provisions in the House Manual include expedited procedures for congressional action on executive branch proposals and regulations on the congressional budget process. The Legislative Reorganization Acts of 1946 and 1970 contain provisions currently regulating House procedure, with many incorporated into the Rules of the House. The parliamentarian's annotations in the House Manual discuss the origin and effect of these provisions on House procedures. The House Manual for the 110th Congress includes statutory legislative procedures that define special procedures for Congress to follow in disapproving or approving actions of the executive branch or independent agencies. These procedures create expedited processes for enacting joint resolutions of disapproval or approval, known as \"privileged procedures,\" with the force of rules of the House and Senate. The House Manual outlines privileged procedures that establish expedited processes for Congress to approve or disapprove actions of the executive branch or independent agencies. These procedures have the force of rules of the House and Senate and are governed by various statutes, including the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990. The House Manual outlines privileged procedures governed by statutes like the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.

In Deschler's Precedents, topical sections are grouped under broader headings identified by letters. Each chapter begins with an introduction summarizing the principles presented by precedents. Individual precedents are numbered and cited by chapter and number. Subsections are headed by a catchline and bold headnote stating the principle, followed by the proceedings that establish the precedent. If the same proceedings illustrate multiple principles, each will be set forth in its own subsection. Deschler's Precedents contain procedural exchanges establishing precedents with citations to the Congressional Record. Some precedents include a \"Parliamentarian's Note\" for clarification. Each chapter has an index directing readers to relevant precedents. The chapters correspond to Procedure in the House, allowing for easy reference. The House procedures can be easily referenced using the index in Deschler's Precedents and Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents, which provide historical coverage up to 1936. Hinds' Precedents were written by Asher Hinds, while Cannon's Precedents were prepared by Clarence Cannon. Both series cover motions to adjourn and postpone.

Headnotes in bold type state the principle discussed, with some sections illustrating multiple principles in one proceeding. Where several consecutive sections illustrate the same principle, the headnote appears only for the first section. Proceedings that illustrate more than one principle are typically set forth in only one section, but with multiple headnotes. General discussion or background bearing on more than one principle may carry more than one headnote. Specific procedural topics can be located using the detailed table of contents in each volume and the comprehensive index arranged by topic and subtopic. Cannon's Procedure also serves as an index to Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents. Hinds' and Cannon's Precedents is a valuable reference source for House parliamentary procedure, but may be of limited practical value for contemporary practices. It is useful when other sources cite specific precedents from the 11-volume set. Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, also known as Deschler's Procedure, summarizes important House precedents from 1959 to 1980. House Practice was intended to replace Procedure, but knowledge of Procedure remains useful.

When cited, Procedure is referenced by its title, chapter number, section or paragraph number, and page number. Most paragraphs state principles established by precedents or authorities, while some provide general principles or Parliamentarian's notes. A key difference between Procedure and Deschler's Precedents is highlighted. The supplement to Procedure is organized similarly to the main volume, with citations in the Congressional Record for specific precedents. It includes numbered paragraphs that replace corresponding ones in the main volume.

Referral decisions are based on committee jurisdiction statements and relevant precedents, as well as memorandums of understanding. Memorandums of understanding have increased in importance due to rules changes in the House. They clarify jurisdiction over policy issues and designate a \"primary\" committee for referral of measures. Committees develop these agreements to specify jurisdiction, especially after jurisdiction transfers or abolitions of standing committees. An example is a memorandum of understanding between the committees on National Security and Transportation and Infrastructure from the 104th Congress. Memorandums of understanding clarify jurisdiction over policy issues and designate a \"primary\" committee for referral of measures.
