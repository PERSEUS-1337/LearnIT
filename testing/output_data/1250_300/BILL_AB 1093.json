    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature declares that California was ordered by the US Supreme Court to reduce its prison population to 137.5% of design capacity by February 2016. Despite efforts like the 2011 Public Safety Realignment, the prison population exceeded the cap by 2,104 inmates in December 2014. Over 100,000 offenders were diverted to county supervision instead of state prisons. Proposition 47, passed in November 2014 in California, requires misdemeanor sentencing for certain crimes and allows inmates to petition for resentencing. By December 4, 2014, 132 inmates had been released due to resentencing. It is estimated that the prison population will decrease by 1,900 inmates in 2015-16 due to resentencing and reduced new admissions. Research shows that formerly incarcerated individuals benefit from training and job opportunities for successful reentry into society. Workforce training programs provide necessary skills and job placement assistance to reduce repeat offenses and lower incarceration rates. Investing in reentry services aligns with California's workforce goals, as outlined in the Strategic Workforce Development Plan. The State Workforce Investment Board administers grant programs to support these initiatives. The State WIB administers a grant program to support workforce training and education for the supervised population. Criteria for grant selection are developed through a public application process, with a focus on outreach to small and rural counties. Grants are awarded competitively, encouraging evidence-based practices and addressing the education and training needs of individuals with postsecondary education. The grant program administered by the State WIB supports workforce training and education for the supervised population. Grants are competitively awarded through two rounds of funding, with a focus on small and rural counties. The program addresses the education and training needs of individuals with postsecondary education and those requiring basic education for entry-level jobs with career advancement opportunities. Each county can apply, and partnerships with local workforce investment boards are required for joint applications. Each project proposed in the grant application must include an education and training assessment for participants. Eligible uses of grant funds include vocational training, stipends, and apprenticeships. Preference is given to applications with matching funds from local boards, governments, or private foundations. Preference for grant applications will be given to those with matching funds from local boards, governments, or private foundations. Additionally, preference will be given to applications from counties already involved in workforce training programs for the supervised population, and those involving nonprofit community-based organizations. Applications must specify the purpose of the grant funds, the subset of the supervised population to be served, and the industry sectors for training, including workforce projections and education requirements. The grant recipients must define the industry sectors for training, methodology, and monitoring of progress. They are required to report to the State WIB annually on fund usage and program outcomes. The State WIB will submit a report to the Legislature on the overall success of the grant program by January 1, 2018. The State WIB must submit a report to the Legislature by January 1, 2018, based on reports from grant recipients. The report will evaluate the success and effectiveness of the grant program, recommend long-term viability of workforce training programs, and discuss the education and workforce readiness of participants. It will also consider alignment with high-demand sectors of the economy. The State WIB must submit a report by January 1, 2018, evaluating the success of grant programs in aligning with workforce needs, job market availability, certification attainment, job readiness, employment support networks, livable wages, and metric alignment. The requirement for submitting a report is inoperative on January 1, 2021. The metrics used to evaluate grants must align with program objectives. The report submission requirement is inoperative as of January 1, 2021. This act is urgent for cost savings and efficiency in the grant program."
