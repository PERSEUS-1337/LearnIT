It can be used towards qualified health insurance and is refundable and advanceable. Eligibility is based on receiving certain benefits under the Trade Adjustment Assistance program or being between 55 and 64 receiving payments from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

Workers aged 55-64 receiving payments from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation can qualify for TAA benefits. Eligibility for the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) is based on receiving certain TAA benefits like Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA) or Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA). Workers aged 50 and older who were certified for TAA can receive Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance (RTAA) which pays 50% of the wage difference for up to two years. Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance (ATAA) is a similar wage-insurance program. Eligibility for the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) is limited to individuals receiving TRA, RTAA, or ATAA cash benefits.

Automatically qualified health plans, known by statutory letter designations, can be elected without state involvement. These options include coverage under COBRA, a spouse's group health plan, individual health insurance, and coverage funded by a VEBA. State-qualified health plans, established by states, offer categories such as state-based continuation coverage, coverage through a state high-risk pool, and coverage under a state-based plan comparable to state employee plans. State-qualified health plans must provide four consumer protections to qualifying individuals, including guaranteed issue, coverage for preexisting conditions, and equal premiums for all qualifying applicants. These plans are available to HCTC-eligible individuals with prior creditable coverage and no significant breaks in coverage.

Taxpayers must file Form 8885 with proof of payment for qualified health insurance to claim the refundable credit. Taxpayers claiming the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) must include invoices and proof of payment for qualified health insurance on their Form 1040. The credit amount reduces taxes owed and is refundable if it exceeds the tax amount. To receive advance payments, individuals enroll in the HCTC program, pay their share of the premium, and Treasury covers the rest to the health insurance plans."
