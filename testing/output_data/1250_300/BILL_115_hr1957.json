    "content": "The \"Safe Schools Improvement Act of 2017\" may be cited as such. Congress acknowledges that bullying and harassment in schools can have serious negative effects on students' physical and psychological health, leading to academic underachievement and high dropout rates. These behaviors include physical violence, name-calling, social exclusion, and cyberbullying. Schools with anti-bullying policies have higher reporting levels and teacher awareness. Students are targeted for bullying based on various factors like race, gender, and disability. Some experience relational aggression, damaging relationships and social acceptance. Interventions aim to create a positive school climate and implement evidence-based discipline policies. Interventions like Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) aim to create a positive school climate and reduce exclusionary discipline policies. 85% of Americans support a Federal law to prevent bullying in schools. Students, parents, educators, and policymakers are calling for action to address the national crisis of bullying and harassment. The purpose of the Safe Schools Improvement part is to address bullying and harassment in public elementary and secondary schools through anti-bullying policies. The Safe Schools Improvement part addresses bullying, including cyberbullying, in schools by requiring policies that prevent severe, persistent, or pervasive conduct that limits a student's participation or creates a hostile environment. Policies must prohibit bullying based on a student's race or color. The policies required under the Safe Schools Improvement Act include a prohibition of bullying or harassment conduct based on various characteristics such as race, color, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, and other defining traits as determined by the educational agency. Annual notice must be provided to students, parents, and educational professionals regarding the prohibited conduct outlined in the discipline policies. The Safe Schools Improvement Act mandates annual notice of prohibited conduct in discipline policies, including grievance procedures for complaints. Schools must collect accurate incident data and publicly report it at the school level. The Safe Schools Improvement Act requires schools to collect accurate incident data on prohibited conduct and publicly report it at the school and local educational agency levels. Positive and preventative approaches to school discipline should be encouraged to minimize student removal from instruction and ensure fair treatment for all students. State reports are required from the chief executive officer of a State receiving a grant under the Safe Schools Improvement Act. The report should include information from local educational agencies and describe the State's plans to support efforts in addressing prohibited conduct. The Secretary conducts biennial evaluations of anti-bullying programs in schools to assess their effectiveness in reducing prohibited conduct. Data on incidents are collected by the Commissioner for Education Statistics for analysis. A report on the evaluation findings is submitted to the President and Congress every two years. This evaluation does not affect other laws. The text states that federal and state nondiscrimination laws, as well as free speech and expression laws, are not affected by the regulations outlined in this part. The obligations imposed by this part are additional to existing laws protecting against discrimination and ensuring freedom of speech. The text clarifies that state or local entities can enact laws to prevent bullying or harassment of students as long as they are not inconsistent with the regulations outlined in this part."
