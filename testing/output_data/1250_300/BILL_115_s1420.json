    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lavender Offense Victim Exoneration Act of 2017\" or the \"LOVE Act of 2017\". Key findings are also included. During the Lavender Scare in the 1950s and 1960s, over 1,000 Department of State employees were wrongfully dismissed for alleged homosexuality. Many others were also prevented from joining the Department due to discriminatory screening processes. Congress played a role in these actions due to investigations into federal employees' sexual orientation. Between 1950 and 1969, the Department of State fired homosexuals annually due to congressional pressure and investigations into federal employees' sexual orientation. The \"Lavender Scare\" effects persisted into the 1990s, with State personnel being investigated and dismissed as security risks for being gay. The State Department's security office investigated and dismissed gay personnel as \"security risks\" in the past. However, in 1994, Secretary of State Warren Christopher prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation, and in 1998, President Clinton signed an Executive Order barring such discrimination. In 2017, Secretary of State John Kerry apologized for the past practices and reaffirmed the Department's commitment to diversity and inclusion for all employees, including the LGBTI community. The Director General of the Foreign Service and Director of Human Resources, in consultation with the Historian of the Department of State, will review employee terminations since January 1, 1950, to identify wrongful terminations based on sexual orientation. A report compiling this information will be made public within 270 days. Additionally, there will be reports on the reviews conducted. The Secretary of State will review the consistency of Director General's reviews under section 3 and submit reports to Congress within 270 days of the Act's enactment. Additionally, a Reconciliation Board will be established. The Secretary of State will establish an independent Reconciliation Board within the Office of Civil Rights to review reports on the \"Lavender Scare\" firings. The Board will contact affected employees or their families, offer to change employment records, and provide a point of contact for testimonies of discrimination. The Reconciliation Board within the Office of Civil Rights will review reports on the \"Lavender Scare\" firings, receive testimonies of discrimination from affected employees or their families, and provide a grievance process for former employees who believe they were terminated due to their sexual orientation. The Board will review each claim within 150 days and the Department of State will provide necessary information to prove wrongful termination. The Board will terminate 5 years after establishment. The Department of State will provide information to prove wrongful termination for each claim. The Board will terminate 5 years after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 6. ISSUANCE OF APOLOGY. Secretary of State Kerry apologized on January 9, 2017 for past discrimination against LGBTI employees at the State Department, acknowledging the wrongs done in the past and expressing support for the LGBTI community. Congress formally apologizes for its role in the \"Lavender Scare\" and similar discriminatory policies at the Department of State, which were influenced by congressional investigations into the perceived sexual orientation of federal employees. The Department of State also apologizes for past practices and reaffirms its commitment to diversity and inclusion for all employees, including the LGBTI community. The Secretary of State will establish a permanent exhibit on the \"Lavender Scare\" at the United States Diplomacy Center museum to ensure the history of this discriminatory episode is remembered. The exhibit will be installed within a year, provide access to relevant reports, and display material from oral testimonies. Additionally, guidance on issuing visas will be provided. The Secretary of State will submit a report to Congress on countries not issuing visas to the spouses of Foreign Service personnel due to sexual orientation within 100 days of the enactment of this Act. Recommendations may include eliminating visa reciprocity with offending countries to ensure all spouses receive visas. The Secretary of State will establish an Advancement Board within the Department of State to address issues faced by LGBTQI Foreign Service employees and their families. The Board will hear testimony on discrimination faced due to sexual orientation and submit annual reports to Congress with recommendations for improvement. The reports will remain private and accessible only to Members of Congress. The report required under paragraph (1) will only be accessible to Members of Congress, their staff, and members of the Advancement Board."
