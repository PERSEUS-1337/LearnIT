    "content": "The Middle East poses challenges to U.S. foreign policy due to various state and non-state actors aligned against U.S. interests, including Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas. Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability is a major concern, potentially leading to regional and global proliferation consequences. There are fears of a preemptive strike by Israel against Iran, complicating efforts for Israeli-Arab peace. The United States' image in the Middle East has improved under the Obama administration. The Middle East presents challenges to U.S. foreign policy due to Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, and Hamas. Despite some improvements in the U.S. image in the region under the Obama Administration, dissatisfaction with U.S. policy persists. The ongoing war in Afghanistan and failures in the Israeli-Arab peace process have limited U.S. influence. Regional actors like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey are taking more responsibility in resolving disputes. The region also faces domestic challenges such as poverty and income inequality. The Middle East faces challenges including poverty, income inequality, and domestic socioeconomic issues. Lack of respect for human rights and democracy are criticized. The United States advocates for economic and political reform in the region. Congressional considerations include responses to Palestinian divisions, Hamas control, Israeli settlements, and budget constraints for regional initiatives. The United States faces challenges in supporting regional initiatives amidst budget constraints and dealing with radical regimes like Iran and Syria. Congress may need to consider new tools to change their behavior and balance counterterrorism strategies with diplomatic efforts in the Middle East. Members of Congress may also address issues such as the war in Afghanistan, terrorism, foreign assistance, democracy promotion, and human rights concerns. There is a growing international consensus to adopt stricter economic sanctions against Iran to compel it to compromise on its nuclear development. The U.S. and major allies believe sanctions should target Iran's energy sector and isolate it from the international financial system. U.S. efforts to curb international investment in Iran's energy sector began in 1996 with the Iran Sanctions Act. The U.S. has implemented various laws and measures, such as the Iran Sanctions Act and the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, to restrict international investment in Iran's energy sector and isolate Iran from the global financial system. These efforts aim to persuade foreign companies to choose between the Iranian market and the larger U.S. market, while also limiting Iran's ability to import gasoline and access the U.S. market for banking and high technology trade. The U.S. has implemented laws like the Iran Sanctions Act and the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 to restrict international investment in Iran's energy sector. This is part of efforts to isolate Iran from the global financial system and limit its ability to import gasoline. Other major economic powers have also imposed sanctions on Iran, affecting its economy and leading to many international firms exiting the Iranian market. The sanctions on Iran are having a growing effect on its economy, with many international firms exiting the Iranian market. There is debate on whether the sanctions are impacting Iran's nuclear program. The U.S. and Israel have strong bilateral relations based on shared strategic goals and historic ties, with U.S. foreign aid playing a significant role. U.S. foreign aid has played a significant role in cementing the strong bilateral relations between the U.S. and Israel, dating back to U.S. support for Israel's creation in 1948. Despite some differences, successive administrations have viewed Israel as a reliable partner in the region. Critics argue that U.S. aid exacerbates tensions in the Middle East, particularly by indirectly supporting Israeli arms purchases. Congress and administrations have consistently affirmed their commitment to strengthening Israel's security and maintaining its qualitative military edge over neighboring militaries. The Obama Administration reaffirmed its commitment to Israel's security and qualitative military edge (QME) in 2010. Congress may focus on U.S. aid to Israel, including $3 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for FY2011. Defense appropriations for missile defense systems, such as the Iron Dome, have also been supported by Congress. In 2010, the Obama Administration announced $205 million in defense assistance to Israel for the purchase of up to 10 Iron Dome missile defense batteries. Congressional aid appropriations have reinforced peace treaties and enabled the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. President Obama declared Israeli-Palestinian peace a U.S. national security interest. His call for a halt to Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank led to demands from PLO Chairman Mahmud Abbas. In 2010, the Obama Administration offered incentives to Israel for a settlement freeze in the West Bank, aiming to advance final status talks on borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees. Settlements remained a major obstacle to peace negotiations. In 2010, the Obama Administration tried to advance final status talks on borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees by offering incentives to Israel for a settlement freeze. Congress remains interested in the Arab-Israeli peace process due to its oversight role in U.S. foreign policy and support for Israel. Several resolutions in the 111th Congress aimed to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocate the U.S. embassy there. Appropriations legislation emphasized Congress's commitment to an undivided Jerusalem as Israel's capital and required a new Palestinian state to act peacefully and counter terrorism. In the 112th Congress, legislation may revisit moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, conditions for a new Palestinian state, and reactions to possible violent confrontations between Israeli forces and Palestinian groups. Congress may provide additional assistance to Israel and the Palestinians if an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord is achieved. U.S. aid to the Palestinians supports U.S. policy priorities of combating terrorism against Israel. U.S. aid to the Palestinians during the 111th Congress focused on combating terrorism, promoting stability and prosperity in the West Bank, meeting humanitarian needs, and preventing destabilization. The policy was established in June 2007 following the split between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and the regime in the Gaza Strip led by Hamas. Annual U.S. bilateral assistance to the region has averaged over $600 million, reaching nearly $1 billion in 2009. Since the split in 2007 between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza, annual U.S. bilateral assistance to the region has averaged over $600 million, peaking at nearly $1 billion in 2009. This aid includes direct budgetary assistance, non-lethal security assistance, and humanitarian aid for Palestinian refugees, with strict oversight to prevent diversion to terrorist groups. U.S. policymakers urge greater contributions from Arab states, whose pledges often fall short. The Obama Administration proposed sales of military equipment to Saudi Arabia worth over $60 billion over 10 to 15 years to sustain long-term relationships and ensure continued U.S. influence. This raises policy questions for Congress regarding the rationale for the sales and their impact on regional security balance. The proposed sales to Saudi Arabia aim to strengthen their position against Iran and maintain long-term U.S. influence. Policy questions for Congress include the rationale for the sales, their impact on regional security, and effects on Israel's security. Concerns about human rights, terrorism cooperation, and Saudi Arabia's stance on Iran and regional issues persist. Saudi leaders share U.S. concerns about Iranian policies and regional ambitions but remain wary of embracing Iraq's elected government and engaging Israel beyond a standing Saudi peace proposal. In the 111th Congress, committees reviewed proposed arms sales in classified and unclassified settings. Congressional briefings preceded the formal notification of the sales in October 2010. Concerns were raised by 198 members of Congress in a letter to the Obama Administration, which responded by emphasizing the importance of maintaining Israel's qualitative military edge. The U.S. government is also pursuing an initiative to supply Israel with fifth-generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The U.S. government is working on supplying Israel with advanced F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft to maintain its military superiority in the region. Congress may oversee military training, arms sales, and counterterrorism cooperation with Saudi Arabia. The U.S. has a long history of supporting the Saudi military, with ongoing programs for interior security forces and critical infrastructure security. Congress retains the option to block or modify arms sales to Saudi Arabia at any time. The U.S. government is implementing new programs for Saudi interior security forces and critical infrastructure security. Congress has the option to block or modify arms sales to Saudi Arabia, subject to presidential veto. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. counterterrorism policy in Yemen due to the threat of Yemen-based terrorists. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula unsuccessfully attempted to bomb Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on Christmas Day 2009. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. counterterrorism policy in Yemen due to the threat of Yemen-based terrorists, particularly AQAP. Anwar al Awlaki, AQAP's radical ideologue, has attempted to indoctrinate U.S. citizens for terrorist bombings on U.S. soil. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen without overly militarizing the U.S. presence there. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen to counter the threat of Yemen-based terrorists, particularly AQAP. Reports suggest possible CIA drone use or U.S. military involvement overseen by JSOC. Congress may assess the balance between counterterrorism and stabilizing Yemen, with some lawmakers calling for more U.S. military involvement if AQAP carries out an attack on U.S. soil. The 112th Congress may consider new appropriations for Yemen, with the United States providing an estimated $290 million in total aid in FY2010. The Defense Department has proposed increasing security assistance to Yemen to $1.2 billion over a five- or six-year period. Recent large-scale campaigns by Yemeni forces against suspected AQAP strongholds raise questions about the sustainability of U.S.-Yemeni security cooperation. Disagreements may arise over Yemen's policy of releasing alleged terrorists from prison. The sustainability of U.S.-Yemeni security cooperation is a key concern for lawmakers and policymakers. Disagreements may arise over Yemen's policy of releasing alleged terrorists to appease tribal leaders and domestic Islamist politicians. In Iraq, political competition and attempts to form cross-sectarian alliances have been ongoing, but ethnic and factional infighting persists, delaying agreement on leadership of a new government. U.S. intervention helped break the deadlock, leading to agreement on senior positions in the government. Following the March 7, 2010, national elections in Iraq, a new government was formed with U.S. intervention on November 10, 2010. Despite efforts to implement agreements and form a broad-based government, concerns remain about the lack of clear direction and potential conflicts between different factions. The influence of the U.S. is seen as diminishing, with some parties aligned with Iran dominating the government. The ongoing violence and political vacuum contribute to uncertainty and disillusionment among Iraqis, raising questions about stability after the departure of U.S. forces in 2011. Despite the drawdown of U.S. forces and the formal end of the combat mission in Iraq, concerns arise about stability post-2011. Experts fear that without U.S. presence, ethnic and sectarian rifts may widen, potentially leading to Iraq becoming a \"failed state.\" The formation of the government will impact U.S. efforts to secure a long-term strategic partnership and continued security cooperation. Opposition from some Iraqi parties and delays in Iraqi Security Forces meeting benchmarks may complicate these efforts. The U.S. is transitioning from military to civilian leadership in Iraq, with the State Department overseeing an expansion in civilian efforts. The U.S. government is facing challenges in securing lasting cooperation in Iraq as it transitions from military to civilian leadership. Economic assistance to Iraq has decreased significantly since the reconstruction period, with FY2010 seeing $382.5 million in Economic Support Fund (ESF) assistance. The FY2011 request aimed to maintain this level of aid, but Senate appropriators recommended cuts. Funding for Iraq in FY2011 is governed by the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011. The FY2011 funding for Iraq faces potential resistance in Congress due to concerns about Iraq's ability to invest in its own reconstruction and security forces. Iraq's oil revenues are expected to increase, but it still faces challenges with domestic investment needs and financial management. The transition to a civilian-led presence in Iraq opens new avenues for congressional oversight, including reviewing arms sales for U.S.-Iraqi security cooperation. Congressional attention has focused on certain aspects of the complex relationship with long-term U.S. NATO ally, Turkey. Turkey's complex relationship with the U.S. has drawn congressional attention, particularly regarding issues of interest to diaspora communities. Congressional concern increased after Turkey's actions against Iran sanctions and a violent confrontation with Israel. Legislation in the 111th Congress called for Turkey to respect the rights of the Greek Orthodox Church. In the 111th Congress, legislation urged Turkey to respect the rights of the Greek Orthodox Church and recognize the Armenian genocide. The House passed resolutions calling for protection of religious sites in Turkish-occupied Cyprus. Concerns regarding Turkey's treatment of the Greek Orthodox Church and the genocide resolution may resurface in the 112th Congress. Turkey's role in NATO's new missile defense architecture could lead to pressure on the U.S. administration. In the 112th Congress, there may be interest in U.S. policy towards Syria and possible political changes in Turkey following the 2011 national election. Ankara may seek U.S. funding for missiles and radar as part of NATO's new missile defense architecture. Congressional oversight hearings may be prompted unless Ambassador-designate to Turkey Francis J. Ricciardone receives a recess appointment or a replacement nomination is considered. The Obama Administration initially sought to engage Syria diplomatically to secure cooperation on various regional issues but faced criticism for maintaining sanctions. After two years, the administration shifted towards pressuring Syria to play a more constructive role in Lebanon and the Arab-Israeli peace process amidst renewed international concern. The Obama Administration has shifted towards pressuring Syria to play a more constructive role in stabilizing Lebanon and advancing the Arab-Israeli peace process. This comes after renewed international concern about Lebanon and threats from Hezbollah. Congress may consider imposing new sanctions against the Asad regime, while some lawmakers advocate for continued U.S. engagement with Syria. Additionally, H.R. 1206 was introduced during the 111th Congress to impose sanctions on countries and individuals aiding Syria in acquiring weapons of mass destruction. Appropriators may also fund democracy and governance programs for opposition members. The Obama Administration has shifted towards pressuring Syria to play a more constructive role in stabilizing Lebanon and advancing the Arab-Israeli peace process. Congress may consider imposing new sanctions against the Asad regime, including sanctions on countries and individuals aiding Syria in acquiring weapons of mass destruction. There is also a discussion on funding democracy and governance programs for opposition members and human rights activists repressed by the Syrian government. The appointment of Robert S. Ford as Ambassador-Designate to Syria is on hold, with supporters arguing for the need for a high-level U.S. presence in Syria. The current U.S. policy towards Lebanon aims to support the unity government under Prime Minister Saad Hariri and limit Iranian and Syrian influence, including assistance to strengthen state institutions, particularly in the security sector. The United States supports Lebanon's government under Prime Minister Hariri to limit Iranian and Syrian influence and contain Hezbollah. The U.S. provides economic and military assistance to strengthen state institutions, particularly in the security sector. The U.S. also supports the Special Tribunal for Lebanon with an annual contribution of $10 million. Tensions have risen due to pending STL indictments, with Hezbollah rejecting potential indictments and escalating rhetoric. Observers question if U.S. support for Hariri and the STL are at odds. The assassination of Hariri has raised tensions in Lebanon, with Hezbollah opposing STL indictments. U.S. support for Hariri and the STL is questioned, as changes in the Lebanese government could impact U.S. policy and assistance. The LAF's clash with IDF led to congressional holds on FMF appropriations for Lebanon. The clash between the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Israeli Defense Forces led to congressional holds on FMF appropriations for Lebanon. This incident raised questions about the future of U.S. assistance to Lebanon, as some members of Congress questioned the use of U.S. provided equipment against Israel. The hold was eventually lifted in December 2010 after consultations with State Department officials. Egypt, the largest country in the Arab world, is a key partner of the United States in military and diplomatic affairs, particularly in the Arab-Israeli peace process. The domestic politics of Egypt are closely watched by U.S. policymakers, with debates on whether political liberalization or a stable autocratic regime is more beneficial. The recent parliamentary elections in November and December 2010 saw the ruling National Democratic Party win over 90% of seats, with only one independent from the Muslim Brotherhood gaining a seat. The State Department expressed concerns about the election process in a press release. The State Department expressed concerns about the conduct of Egypt's recent parliamentary elections, citing reports of disruptions to opposition candidates' campaigns, arrests of their supporters, and interference by security forces on election day. Congress has provided Egypt with significant military and economic aid, with some members considering using appropriations as a tool to promote democracy in the country. The Egyptian government has opposed foreign support to independent NGOs working on political reform and transparency. During the Bush Administration, some Economic Support Funds were directed towards USAID programming in democracy and governance in Egypt, despite the government's opposition to foreign support for independent NGOs. Congress allocated $25 million for democracy promotion in FY2010, but U.S. democracy assistance has decreased as overall economic aid to Egypt has declined. There are differing views on the effectiveness of U.S. funding for democracy promotion in Egypt, with some analysts suggesting the Obama Administration may want to reduce tensions with the Egyptian government by de-emphasizing democracy assistance. Some analysts believe the Obama Administration may want to reduce tensions with the Egyptian government by de-emphasizing democracy assistance, which accounts for 10% of total economic aid. Critics suggest that U.S. funding for democracy promotion in Egypt has been largely ineffective and should be redirected to areas that have a more immediate impact on the daily lives of Egyptians. There are calls for conditioning portions of U.S. aid on improvements in Egypt's human rights and religious freedom record. Despite efforts to combat Al Qaeda since 9/11, the organization and its affiliates remain persistent threats, with operatives determined to attack the United States. Al Qaeda's persistence in targeting the United States and its citizens, along with the spread of its ideology through sophisticated online outreach, poses challenges for U.S. and allied counterterrorism efforts. In the Middle East, U.S. policymakers face dilemmas in balancing counterterrorism goals with other strategic priorities. The past decade of military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq has shown the costs, benefits, and limitations of targeting Al Qaeda operatives abroad. The U.S. faces challenges in balancing counterterrorism efforts with other strategic priorities in the Middle East. Military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have shown the costs, benefits, and limitations of targeting Al Qaeda operatives abroad. The presence of U.S. forces in the region remains a subject of Al Qaeda rhetoric despite ongoing withdrawals from Iraq. U.S. support for democratic reform risks alienating allies and empowering Islamist parties. Muslim skepticism of U.S. intentions persists despite expanded outreach efforts. The U.S. government's outreach to Muslims has expanded and changed in tone over time, but public opinion polls suggest that Muslims in many countries remain skeptical of U.S. intentions and critical of U.S. policies despite more U.S. outreach. Some suggest direct, robust efforts to destroy Al Qaeda operatives and confront religious extremism, while others propose a containment strategy. Without a positive U.S. agenda for the Middle East beyond security concerns, challenges in the region are likely to persist. The 111th Congress focused on U.S. counterterrorism policy through hearings and legislation like the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009. The 112th Congress may further evaluate U.S. strategy in the Middle East, including partnerships with Iraq, defeating Al Qaeda affiliates, and promoting peace in the region. Congressional interest also extends to securing greater cooperation from Gulf allies and engaging with Muslim countries. Al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen and the Sahel, increasing counterterrorism cooperation from Gulf allies, and promoting peace between Israel and its neighbors.
