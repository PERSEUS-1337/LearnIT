    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment Act\" or the \"SENSE Act\". It establishes standards for coal refuse power plants. The \"SENSE Act\" defines key terms related to coal refuse power plants, including the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, boiler operating day, coal refuse, and coal refuse electric utility steam generating unit. The \"SENSE Act\" defines terms related to coal refuse power plants, including coal refuse-fired facilities and electric utility steam generating units using specific technology and fuel requirements. The \"SENSE Act\" defines terms related to coal refuse power plants, including electric utility steam generating units subject to emission limitations for hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide as hazardous air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The operator can choose to comply with either hydrogen chloride or sulfur dioxide emissions standards, but not both. The Administrator shall require an operator of a coal refuse electric utility steam generating unit to comply with either an emission standard for hydrogen chloride or sulfur dioxide, but not both. The emission standards have specific limits for hydrogen chloride emissions. The Administrator requires compliance with emission standards for hydrogen chloride or sulfur dioxide from coal refuse electric utility steam generating units. The standards specify limits for emissions of hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide. The emission standards for sulfur dioxide from coal refuse electric utility steam generating units require capturing and controlling 93 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions. The standard is measured as a 30 boiler operating day rolling average per unit or group of units. The House of Representatives passed the bill on March 8, 2018. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
