    "content": "The President signed the final version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 on July 29, 2010, which includes $59.2 billion in spending for various purposes. The bill was passed by both the House and Senate, with the House passing it under suspension of the rules. The enacted version of the bill provides $58.8 billion in new Budget Authority, with rescissions and mandatory savings offsetting some of the spending. The House version of H.R. 4899 included $22.1 billion more in domestic spending, offset by $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings over 10 years. The House also debated a resolution to withdraw U.S. troops from Pakistan, which was defeated. The Senate disagreed with the House's amended version of the bill on July 22, 2010. The House passed H.Res. 1566, setting up an hour of debate on H.Con.Res. 301 under the War Powers Act. The Senate disagreed with the House's amended version of the bill on July 22, 2010, leading to the adoption of the Senate version of H.R. 4899 with $59.2 billion for war funding, Haiti relief, foreign aid, and benefits for Vietnam veterans. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 adopts $59.2 billion for war funding, Haiti relief, foreign aid, and benefits for Vietnam veterans. The debate revolved around additional domestic spending proposals and the Administration's new war policy in Afghanistan. Representative David Obey introduced the Senate version of H.R. 4899 for House consideration on July 27, 2010. Representative David Obey opposed the bill H.R. 4899 due to war funding for Afghanistan and Pakistan, lack of support from these governments, and the absence of a proposed House amendment for Congress to vote on war policy continuation. Despite his opposition, Obey believed the process needed to move forward. Representative Obey opposed bill H.R. 4899 due to war funding for Afghanistan and Pakistan and lack of support from these governments. Other members supported parts of the bill, including DOD's war funding and disability benefits for Vietnam veterans. Concerns were raised about corruption in the Afghan government and the role of Pakistani intelligence services. The documents released by Wikileaks highlighted corruption and incompetence in the Afghan Government and the role of Pakistani intelligence services. Concerns were raised about war funding running out in August, leading to a debate in the House on a resolution invoking the War Powers Act to withdraw U.S. troops from Pakistan. Despite discussions on troop presence and aid effectiveness, the resolution was ultimately defeated. The Senate failed to adopt cloture on the House version of H.R. 4899, leading to a final version appropriating $59.2 billion in spending, including funds for FEMA's Disaster Assistance Fund, Vietnam veterans affected by Agent Orange, Department of Defense war-related funding, and Haiti. In the final version, Congress approved $59.2 billion in spending, including funds for FEMA's Disaster Assistance Fund, Vietnam veterans affected by Agent Orange, Department of Defense war-related funding, and Haiti. The chief differences in funding between the enacted version and the Administration's request were highlighted, with adjustments made in various accounts. Congress did not include additional domestic funding for various programs that were not requested by the Administration. Congress did not include additional domestic funding for various programs not requested by the Administration in the final version of the bill. The bill also did not include funding for border security and reducing patent backlogs as requested by the Administration. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212, includes $34.2 billion for the Defense Department and State Department for the Afghan and Iraq wars. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212, allocates $34.2 billion for the Defense Department and State Department for the Afghan and Iraq wars. This includes $31.5 billion for the Afghan war and $2.7 billion for the Iraq war. Total funding for the wars as of the enactment of the FY2010 supplemental is $169.9 billion, with $104.4 billion for Afghanistan and $65.5 billion for Iraq. Additional funding was provided for VA medical costs and foreign aid for Pakistan. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212, allocated $34.2 billion for the Defense Department and State Department for the Afghan and Iraq wars. This included $31.5 billion for the Afghan war and $2.7 billion for the Iraq war. Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010 through various actions between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010, including funding for disaster relief, war-related foreign assistance, Haiti relief and reconstruction, additional benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange, and oil spill recovery funding. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212, allocated $58.9 billion in new funding for various purposes including additional benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange, disaster relief, foreign assistance, and oil spill recovery. The House and Senate went through several versions of H.R. 4899 before finally agreeing on a total spending of $81.8 billion, with $65.1 billion in new funding and $16.7 billion in rescissions and mandatory savings. The bill was signed into law on July 29, 2010. The President signed the bill on July 29, 2010, P.L. 111-212, allocating $64.4 billion in supplemental funding for various purposes including deploying more troops to Afghanistan, replenishing Disaster Assistance Funds, supporting Haiti earthquake recovery, enhancing border security, and settling court cases for American Indians and black farmers. Key requests included replenishing the U.S. Disaster Relief Fund, funding for the Defense Department, foreign assistance for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan, Haiti reconstruction, compensation for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, responses to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, additional border security personnel, and settling land trust claims of American Indians in the Cobell case. The Senate and House considered H.R. 4899, allocating $64.4 billion in supplemental funding for various purposes including deploying more troops to Afghanistan, replenishing Disaster Assistance Funds, supporting Haiti earthquake recovery, enhancing border security, and settling court cases for American Indians and black farmers. Different versions of the bill included varying amounts of rescissions and mandatory savings spending to offset the spending. The Senate and House considered H.R. 4899, allocating $64.4 billion in supplemental funding for various purposes. The bill included offsets to offset the recommended spending, with different versions including rescissions and mandatory savings. Congressional rules require spending to fit within totals set for discretionary and mandatory spending, unless designated as emergencies. Almost all discretionary spending in the final version was designated as emergency, not counting against budget caps. If caps are exceeded, spending could be subject to a point of order. The $64.4 billion supplemental funding in H.R. 4899 includes $46.3 billion in discretionary spending and $18.1 billion in mandatory spending. Emergency supplemental appropriations are not subject to annual budget caps, potentially undermining budget discipline. Emergency supplemental appropriations are not subject to annual budget caps, potentially undermining budget discipline. Congress debates whether to increase spending above the appropriated level for the year and considers the impact on the deficit. Members are concerned about the additional spending and must decide if it warrants increasing the budget deficit or offsetting it by cutting federal spending or increasing revenues. Congress considers all spending or revenue legislation, including supplemental appropriations bills, within rules and procedures intended to address policy options. The FY2010 supplemental appropriations request was considered within budget constraints and rules, such as the Statutory PAYGO Act of 2010. Congress could exempt spending from constraints by designating it as an emergency or overseas deployment. Emergency designation could be subject to a point of order. During consideration of the supplemental appropriation measure, an emergency designation could exempt spending from budget rules but may be subject to a point of order, which can be waived in both houses. Various agencies and plaintiffs have cited deadlines for needed funding, with some flexibility in dates. Admiral Thad Allen and Secretary Janet Napolitano urged Congress to act on raising the cap on funds in a June 4, 2010 letter. In a June 4, 2010 letter, Admiral Thad Allen and Secretary Janet Napolitano urged Congress to raise the cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities due to insufficient funding for Federal response operations within two weeks. The House and Senate passed a bill on June 9 and June 20, 2010, to raise the annual cap on funds that can be drawn from the trust fund for oil spill response activities. The House and Senate passed S. 3473, P.L. 111-191, on June 9 and June 20, 2010, raising the annual cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to $1 billion specifically for the Deepwater Horizon Spill. The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion in bridge funds for war funding in FY2010. In February testimony, the Secretary of the Army stated that war funding could be comfortably funded by the end of June or beginning of July. The Army, Navy, and USMC could cover regular base activities and war operations through August 2010. Secretary of Defense Gates expressed concern about the lack of progress on the supplemental funding and urged passage by July 4 to avoid disruptions in programs. Funding from the overseas contingency fund for the Navy and Marine Corps would run out in July, leading to disruptive planning and actions in August. In mid-July, DOD press spokesman Geoff Morrell warned that the Army and Marine Corps could run out of funding in August. Under Secretary of the Army, Joseph Westphal, testified that the Army had funds through mid-August and could last through the recess with approved reprogramming requests. The latest DOD Cost of War report showed available funds in War Bridge Operation and Maintenance accounts for each service. The services had funds available in their War Bridge Operation and Maintenance accounts: $1.2 billion for the Marine Corps, $1.5 billion for the Navy, $15.3 billion for the Army, and $2.2 billion for the Air Force. Monthly spending was expected to increase by 20% from April 2010 levels as additional troops arrived in theater. The Army and Marine Corps could rely on already appropriated war bridge funds through August, using base budget funding to finance war funding temporarily. Each service could last through the end of July and into August, and longer if funds were transferred from other accounts. In the supplemental, services could have funds until the end of July and possibly longer by transferring funds from other accounts. FEMA limited fund releases, delayed reimbursements, and recovered funds to extend the Disaster Relief Fund. Despite estimates of insolvency by June, FEMA had a balance of $952 million as of June 7, 2010. These funds could last another three months if spent at the normal rate of $350 million per month. FEMA had a backlog of $1.4 billion in projects awaiting payment for existing infrastructure and mitigation projects across the nation. Congress did not enact the $1.15 billion appropriation by the mid-April 2010 deadline to settle the Pigford II court case for black farmers. The settlement of the Cobell suit for government mismanagement of funds and lands held in trust for American Indians has a deadline of August 6, 2010. Congress is considering various issues related to spending on the Afghan War, foreign aid for Afghanistan and Iraq, corruption prevention in Haiti relief, and domestic spending offsets to prevent deficit increase. The Administration requested $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund due to anticipated fund shortage in May or June 2010. FEMA sent guidance to limit expenditures by delaying payments for non-immediate projects. Representative James Oberstar raised concerns about the fund's balance and spending rate. FEMA limited payments to arbitration awards and immediate needs projects, delayed payments for other projects like mitigation work, and recovered funds from previous years to stretch available funds. Congress questioned why FEMA had not requested disaster relief funds earlier, raising concerns about the emergency nature of the situation. Higher spending levels in recent years also raised questions about FEMA's budgeting practices. Members did not raise concerns about limited information provided by FEMA on the low balance of the Disaster Relief Fund or the timing of compensation payments from arbitration rulings. In its first budget blueprint, the Obama Administration criticized previous administrations for unrealistic budgeting practices. The Administration requested $2.0 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) in FY2010, but Congress provided $1.6 billion. In FY2011, the Administration requested $1.9 billion for the DRF due to 59 disasters in 2009 and 18 in 2010. The current supplemental request is mainly for additional arbitration rulings, including those related to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Higher funding levels may be necessary to address the devastation caused by Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005 and 2008. Higher levels of funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) may be necessary to address the devastation caused by Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005 and 2008. Some argue for increased funding to avoid the need for supplemental funding, while others believe disasters are unpredictable emergencies. FEMA's current request lacks sufficient information for Congress to evaluate, with only one example provided of an arbitration ruling awarding $475 million to the Charity Hospital in New Orleans. FEMA's current request lacks sufficient information for Congress to evaluate the need for higher funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The only example provided is an arbitration ruling awarding $475 million to the Charity Hospital in New Orleans. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $5.1 billion for the DRF, with $396 million added for other disaster relief funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the timeliness of information provided by OMB about disaster relief funding requirements. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the timeliness of information provided by OMB about disaster relief funding requirements. The FY2011 request is expected to be $1 billion to $2 billion short of requirements for previous disasters including Hurricane Katrina. Funding for disaster-relief activities in other agencies includes $100 million for community development funds for long-term recovery, $227 million for the Army Corps of Engineers for repair and recovery projects, and $10 million for drought relief. The final version of H.R. 4899 allocated $173 million for federal project repairs, $20 million for flood control, $18.6 million for Mississippi River recovery, and $10 million for drought relief. The Commerce Department received $49 million for economic development, while the Agriculture Department got $18 million for emergency forest restoration. FEMA was directed to create an interagency taskforce to address community concerns on flood maps updates. Additionally, funding was provided for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan and economic assistance to support military operations. The Obama Administration requested $33 billion for FY2010 to deploy 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan to reverse the security situation and target the insurgency. The troops aim to secure population centers, train Afghan forces, and transition responsibility to Afghans by July 2011. As of June 1, almost 94,000 troops were in Afghanistan, with the remaining expected by September 2010. In 2011, troop levels in Afghanistan increased significantly. By the fall, there were expected to be 98,000 U.S. troops deployed, tripling the number from October 2008. The increase in troops began under President Bush in 2009 and continued with President Obama's approval of additional troops. NATO allies also increased their troop levels in response to requests from the United States. The U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan are expected to reach 98,000 by fall 2011, with an additional 4,000 support troops. NATO allies have increased their troop levels to 48,000. The total number of foreign troops in Afghanistan will be around 148,000, with Afghan security forces totaling 243,000. The Defense Department's budget includes $33 billion for additional troops in Afghanistan, training Iraq Security Forces, and fuel costs. Total war spending in FY2010 is $160 billion, with $99 billion for Afghanistan and $61 billion for Iraq. Total DOD appropriations for the Afghan War before FY2010 Supplemental were $284 billion. The FY2010 Supplemental increased total war spending to $160 billion, with $99 billion for Afghanistan and $61 billion for Iraq. The total DOD appropriations for the Afghan War rose to $314.1 billion with the passage of the FY2010 Supplemental. The enacted total for Iraq is now $705 billion, increasing to $706.2 billion with the Supplemental, and potentially to $752 billion with the pending FY2011 request. President Obama's new strategy in Afghanistan includes a timeline for beginning the transfer of forces out of the country in July 2011. President Obama's new strategy in Afghanistan includes a timeline for beginning the transfer of forces out of the country in July 2011. However, there are concerns about the timing of the evaluation, the length of the campaign, and the long-term future of U.S. military involvement. Secretary Gates mentioned that the process could take several years, and General Petraeus characterized it as an 18-month campaign to be evaluated in September 2011. Members of Congress have raised questions about the initial evaluation timing and the overall duration of the campaign. Members of Congress debated and rejected three amendments during House consideration of H.R. 4899 on July 1, 2100, regarding increasing congressional participation in decision making about the U.S. military commitment in Afghanistan. Amendment No. 3 proposed cutting off all funding for Afghanistan, Amendment Number 4 aimed to limit DOD funding to troop withdrawal, and Amendment No. 5 required a new National Intelligence Estimate with a timetable for troop redeployment by April 4, 2010. If the President's plan did not align with starting an orderly troop withdrawal after July 1, 2011, Congress would need to approve funds. These amendments were defeated, raising concerns about the future of U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan. Troops were withdrawn from Afghanistan after July 1, 2011, as announced by the President in December 2009. Concerns arose after operations in Marjah, Helmand Province, and plans for the campaign in Kandahar were delayed. The DOD's supplemental request included $30 billion for Afghanistan, $1 billion for Iraqi Security Forces training, and $2 billion for fuel costs. The $30 billion supplemental request for Afghanistan included funding for military operations, force protection, training of Afghan security forces, higher fuel costs, equipment reconstitution, military and national intelligence, military construction, and defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Some policymakers estimated the cost of deploying 30,000 more troops at $1 million per troop, but this average does not account for the various activities and programs included in the request. DOD developed functional categories for its funding request, including \"Operations\" and Coalition Support Funds. Funding for the Afghan war between FY2009 and FY2011 varied across categories, with DOD estimates differing from CBO's. The per troop cost for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan was $875,000 according to DOD, higher than CBO's estimate of $467,000. The DOD's per troop cost for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan is $875,000, which is higher than CBO's estimate of $467,000. The high cost is attributed to the need to set up and operate more facilities in southern Afghanistan where the US has had fewer troops. In 2009, $5 billion of DOD's Operation and Maintenance funding was transferred to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund due to concerns about accurate budgeting for the Afghan and Iraq wars. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act transferred $5 billion of DOD's Operation and Maintenance funding to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund. Concerns were raised about DOD's estimates being high, as obligations reported in the first five months of FY2010 for operational costs were only 22% of the total amount requested. To accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund, DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion. The DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund. This request was approved, bringing total FY2010 ASFF funding to $9.2 billion, an increase of 63%. Concerns were raised about the need for all the additional funds, the achievability of the ramp-up plan, and oversight issues. The plan aimed to increase Afghan Security forces to 243,000 by October 2010 and 305,600 by FY2011, with the Afghan Army growing to 171,000 and the Afghan Police to 134,000 by October 2011. NATO partners endorsed these increases in January 2010. The Afghan Security Forces saw significant growth from 93,800 in November 2009 to 134,000 in October 2011, with NATO partners endorsing the increases in January 2010. The DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to sustain this growth, bringing total funding to $39.8 billion through FY2011. General Gary McChrystal had proposed doubling the forces, but the ultimate cost and duration of U.S. support remains unclear. DOD has not provided an estimate of the ultimate cost or number of years needed to support Afghan Security forces. General McChrystal proposed doubling the Afghan Army and Police, but this goal has not been endorsed by the Obama Administration. Training of Afghan Security forces is carried out by U.S. military personnel, NATO teams, and private contractors, but has faced challenges such as attrition, leadership deficiencies, absenteeism, logistical limitations, illiteracy, corruption, and attacks by insurgents. The Afghan security forces face challenges in leadership, frequent absenteeism reducing unit strength, limited logistical capabilities, illiteracy, corruption, and attacks by insurgents. Problems in coordinating training efforts, reliance on private contractors with performance issues, shortages of personnel, and inadequate contract oversight have been identified. Despite additional trainers sent by DOD and requests for more from NATO allies, shortages persist, raising concerns about reliance on contractors. Senator Levin highlighted a shortfall in trainers for the Afghan army and police. DOD has sent additional trainers and requested more from NATO allies to address reported shortages, which could lead to increased reliance on contractors. Senator Levin raised concerns about a shortfall in trainers for the Afghan army and police, as noted in DOD's April 1, 2010 report. Members may want to know the number of trainers needed, how the requirement will be met, and the potential impact on DOD's funding if personnel are not available as anticipated. Shortfalls in trainers could hamper the ramp-up of training efforts for the Afghan security forces. DOD's funding could be affected by personnel shortages, potentially hampering training efforts for Afghan security forces. A bid-protest could have delayed contract awards, but Congress allowed the use of previously awarded contracts. DOD still has $3.6 billion in funding from FY2009 and FY2010, with an additional six months available even without the requested $2.6 billion supplemental funding. DOD already had an additional six months available for the rest of FY2010 even without the additional $2.6 billion requested in the supplemental. Some Members have raised concerns about whether emergency supplementals for war are still justified, or whether war spending should be included in regular appropriations acts. DOD's original request for FY2010 was enacted as Title IX in the FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-118). Some argue that an emergency designation for the FY2010 supplemental request is appropriate, but it is up to Congress to decide. Some of DOD's request in the supplemental, such as $1 billion for training in the Iraqi Security Forces Fund (ISFF), $2 billion for fuel increases, and $1.7 billion for equipment reset, may not be directly related to new deployments and could be part of DOD's regular FY2011 appropriation request. Congress has become less willing to fund Iraqi security forces, and arguments can be made against emergency designation for certain expenses like fuel costs. Some argue that the emergency designation for $2 billion in fuel costs for DOD could be covered in its base budget. DOD has historically financed fuel price increases through Working Capital Funds or fund transfers. The $1.7 billion for equipment reset may not be directly tied to new deployments, as the impact on equipment in Afghanistan is expected to be gradual. DOD also has a backlog of war-related procurement that remains unspent. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request. This includes adjustments in particular accounts for funding in excess of requirements, fuel pricing changes, combat losses, and procurement accounts for additional combat losses not known at the time of the request. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request. It included adjustments such as a $400 million cut for Army force protection programs and a $512 million increase for combat losses. Both House and Senate versions approved funding for training Afghan and Iraq security forces. The final version required assessments of threats from Guantanamo detainees but dropped a provision for $300 million for base closure transportation improvements. The Administration requested $529 million for military construction, including $521 million for Afghanistan and $8 million for Air Force family housing utilities. The request includes an additional $521 million for military construction in Afghanistan and $8 million for higher utilities bills for Air Force family housing. This raises questions about whether DOD is building facilities for temporary troop stationing or permanent bases in Afghanistan. The $521 million request aims to create infrastructure to support the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The request for $521 million for military construction in Afghanistan aims to create infrastructure at various locations to support the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops. The construction includes expanding airfield capacity, logistics facilities, and infrastructure necessary for operations in southern and northern provinces. Army projects focus on waste management, fuel storage, utilities, roads, and headquarters at Forward Operating Base Tombstone. Air Force construction is planned for airlift and special operations support in different provinces. The military construction in Afghanistan aims to support the deployment of additional U.S. troops with infrastructure at various locations. Army projects focus on waste management, fuel storage, utilities, roads, and headquarters at Forward Operating Base Tombstone. Air Force construction includes airlift and special operations support in different provinces. Congress is concerned about whether construction spending indicates a long-term U.S. troop commitment to Afghanistan. The FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act and FY2009 Supplemental Appropriation banned the establishment of permanent military bases in Afghanistan to prevent long-term U.S. troop commitment. The United States Government is prohibited from using funds to establish permanent military installations or bases in Afghanistan. However, there is ambiguity in distinguishing between projects for permanent stationing and those for long-term presence, with some projects potentially serving both purposes. Congress has denied funds for projects perceived as indicating a permanent presence in the past. The United States Government is restricted from establishing permanent military installations in Afghanistan. Congress has denied funds for projects seen as indicating a permanent presence. The Department of Defense has been granted flexibility to use funds for temporary facilities to meet urgent military needs in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Department of Defense has been granted flexibility to use funds for construction in Afghanistan to meet urgent military requirements, despite restrictions on establishing permanent military installations. Congress allowed $200 million in O&M funds for projects in U.S. Central Command and an additional $300 million for construction in Afghanistan in 2009. This authority was extended in the FY2010 NDAA, with a total limit of $500 million for projects in Central Command. In FY2009, DOD added $409 million from O&M accounts for construction in Afghanistan to the $900 million appropriated, raising the total to $1.4 billion. The $1.4 billion for construction in Afghanistan in FY2009 nearly equaled the entire amount spent on construction between FY2003 and FY2008. DOD has also submitted a new legislative proposal to use O&M monies for minor construction in support of contingency operations until October 1, 2012. Total funding for military construction in Afghanistan could rise further if the FY2011 proposal is approved by Congress. Total funding for military construction in Afghanistan could increase if the FY2011 proposal is approved by Congress. Key bases like Bagram Air Base, Kandahar Air Base, and Forward Operating Base Tombstone/Bastion have received significant investments. Additionally, DOD has requested new language for FY2011 authorization to use O&M funds for minor military construction projects in support of contingency operations. The FY2011 proposal seeks temporary authority for DOD to use O&M funds for military construction in support of contingency operations worldwide, with no specified limit on funding. The proposal also increases the per project cap for minor construction projects to $3 million. Quarterly reporting to congressional defense committees is proposed, raising questions about the urgency of the $521 million supplemental request given current spending rates in Afghanistan. The $521 million supplemental request for military construction projects in Afghanistan raises questions about its urgency, as DOD had $2.1 billion in unobligated funds from previous appropriations. DOD would need to increase its monthly obligations six-fold to $300 million to spend all available funds by the end of the fiscal year. The $2.1 billion in unobligated funds from previous appropriations includes $700 million that must be obligated by September 30, 2010, and another $1.4 billion by September 30, 2011. To spend all funds before they lapse, DOD would need to increase its monthly obligation rate significantly. Additionally, the $521 million supplemental request for military construction projects in Afghanistan raises questions about its urgency. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 included $657 million for military construction/family housing, with $649 million allocated for war-related construction in Afghanistan and $8 million for non war-related Air Force expenses. The Senate added $127.5 million above the request to accelerate Air Force projects funded through O&M monies. The Senate emphasized the importance of including contingency construction requirements in the budget request. These funds would be available until September 30, 2011. The final version of the bill did not include $16.5 million for a new Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood, TX. The Administration's FY2010 Supplemental request addressed foreign economic assistance for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan, reflecting shifts in military and civilian responsibilities. The Administration's FY2010 Supplemental request addressed foreign economic assistance for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan, reflecting shifts in military and civilian responsibilities. The total international affairs budget request for war-related programs was $4.46 billion, with $1.8 billion allocated to the State Department for personnel and infrastructure. The Foreign Operations segment, amounting to $2.6 billion, aimed to provide aid in support of U.S. security, economic growth, social services, and democratization objectives. Funding was requested in discrete sub-accounts for specific needs, excluding P.L.480 food aid and Global Health/Child Survival accounts. If approved, the total funding for these accounts in the three countries would increase by more than two-thirds. The FY2010 supplemental request for international affairs focused on foreign economic assistance for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The enacted version increased funding to about $9.2 billion, a 55% rise from FY2009. The total international affairs war-related foreign aid and diplomatic operations funding in the enacted version was $3.7 billion, $714 million less than the Administration request. The Administration's strategy for Afghanistan emphasized civilian programs in governance, economic growth, and social services alongside military efforts. The U.S. strategy in Afghanistan focuses on strengthening civilian presence, increasing aid to local government, and providing social services to reduce insurgency. Key concerns include Afghan government's leadership capacity, coordination between military and civilian aid programs, and cooperation from local communities. The U.S. government is concerned about the impact of corruption on aid programs in Afghanistan and is increasing monitoring and accountability measures. The Afghanistan supplemental request aims to boost U.S. international affairs funding for the country, with a significant increase in aid and State support under P.L. 111-212. The Afghanistan supplemental request under P.L. 111-212 significantly raises aid and State support, with total FY2010 levels increasing by 67-90% compared to FY2009. The request includes $1.6 billion in Economic Support Funds and $200 million in International Narcotics and Law Enforcement funding. The ESF request for Afghanistan includes funds for alternative development, conflict mitigation, rule of law, good governance, health, education, macroeconomic growth, and trade and investment. The total request amounts to $211 million in Diplomatic and Consular Programs funds under the State Department. The ESF request for Afghanistan includes funds for various sectors such as health, education, macroeconomic growth, trade and investment, financial sector, agriculture, private sector development, and economic opportunity. The total request amounts to $211 million in Diplomatic and Consular Programs funds under the State Department. The INCLE account is implemented by the State Department, with a focus on supporting the justice sector and counter-narcotics programs. The FY2010 State Department Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP) request of $211 million aimed to expand civilian personnel in Afghanistan, with funds allocated for justice sector and counter-narcotics programs. This included support for corrections programs, model prisons, legal aid, women's justice activities, counternarcotics police, and drug treatment facilities. The FY2010 State Department Diplomatic and Consular Programs requested $211 million to expand civilian personnel in Afghanistan, including hiring 457 positions in addition to the 764 funded in regular appropriations. The expansion involved U.S. direct hires, staff for Kabul ministries and Provincial Reconstruction Teams, and locally employed staff. The rapid expansion raised concerns about management and resource strain.

Resources for Haiti need to be replenished by June 1, 2010, to maintain capacity for future crises. The UN's Revised Humanitarian Appeal for Haiti requested $1.44 billion, with $874 million committed by June 4, 2010. Donor pledges may not always translate into actual support. As of June 4, 2010, $874 million (58%) of the $1.44 billion UN humanitarian appeal for Haiti had been committed. Donor pledges may not always result in actual contributions, and it is unclear if the funds allocated represent new contributions. The international community's response to delivering humanitarian aid in Haiti has been criticized for being too slow, while others argue that the criticism is unfair. Maintaining donor interest and honoring pledges for Haiti's recovery could be challenging, especially with competing funding priorities for other disaster areas worldwide. The international community's response to delivering humanitarian aid in Haiti has been criticized for being slow due to challenges like weakened government capacity and damaged infrastructure. Evaluations and debates on the relief response are ongoing, with concerns about bureaucratic red tape, coordination issues, and the role of the United States.

The U.S. provided substantial assistance to Haiti after the earthquake, focusing on urgent infrastructure repairs, critical health care, governance, and security. Some observers raised concerns about neglecting other areas like education, which other donors are focusing on. Critics question the limited approach to aid. The revised Haitian development strategy, supported by the Inter-American Development Bank, Canada, and France, aims to catalyze economic growth and provide services outside of Port-au-Prince. The strategy addresses the urban-rural imbalance by decentralizing resources and services, focusing on developing new \"growth poles\" in less developed areas. Scientists are assisting in selecting less vulnerable areas for development. The Haitian development strategy aims to promote economic growth and services outside of Port-au-Prince by decentralizing resources and focusing on developing new \"growth poles\" in less developed areas. Scientists are helping to select less vulnerable areas for development, but officials warn that developing neglected areas will be costly and caution against forcibly relocating populations.

Proponents argue for an additional $500 million for SAFER due to budget shortfalls at the state and local level threatening firefighter staffing levels. Opponents argue that current funding levels are sufficient given the need to reduce federal spending. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 did not include most of the proposed funding for various programs, including $32 million for the Department of Agriculture to address credit shortages in the farm loan and rural housing loan guarantee programs. The supplemental funds were necessary due to high demand for government loans since 2008, as banks have made credit less available. Without these funds, qualified loan applications from farmers and rural homebuyers may go unfunded for the rest of FY2010. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 did not include most of the proposed funding for various programs. It offsets $50 million within agriculture by limiting outlays from a bioenergy program.

The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has authority to determine benefits for veterans exposed to hazardous substances, including establishing presumptions of service connection for certain conditions associated with Agent Orange exposure. The VA proposed regulations on March 25, 2010, for veterans exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam, estimating $13.4 billion in costs for new presumptions of service connection. Approximately 86,000 veterans may receive retroactive benefits, with payments starting once final regulations are published. The Secretary of the VA has the authority to compensate veterans under current law, with CBO estimating $5 billion in costs. The VA requested $13.4 billion as a supplemental appropriation for FY2010 in its FY2011 budget for additional veterans benefits related to Agent Orange. CBO estimated that $5 billion would be needed instead. The differences in estimates are due to uncertainties about regulations and processing times. H.R. 4899 included the $13.4 billion, with a provision delaying payments until after Congressional review. The Senate adopted a provision delaying VA payments for Agent Orange claims until after Congressional review. The Administration requested $4.6 billion to settle longstanding cases, including $1.15 billion for the Pigford Black Farmers Discrimination Case and $3.4 billion for the Cobell Indian Trust Litigation Settlement.

Salazar case over mismanagement of Indian trust fund accounts. The settlement includes $1.4 billion for plaintiffs, $2 billion for trust land interests, and $60 million for education scholarships. The deadline for legislative authorization was extended for a fifth time, with uncertainty about further extensions. The Cobell lawsuit stemmed from Interior's inability to accurately account for payments into and from Individual Indian Monies trust accounts. The Interior's management of Individual Indian Monies (IIM) trust accounts, set up in the 19th century, has been challenging due to the splitting of interests in each tract and the creation of 384,000 IIM accounts with a total asset value over $460 million. The Cobell settlement aims to end years of litigation over the mismanagement of these accounts, with some Indian organizations and plaintiffs supporting it while others oppose congressional approval. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 does not include the requested $4.6 billion appropriation for the settlement. The House version of H.R. 4899 included language for direct spending authority from the Judgment Fund to pay for court settlements, but it was dropped in the final version. Senator Reid may propose passing these provisions separately or attaching them to other bills. If funding is included in another bill, offsets or savings in mandatory programs would be required under PAYGO provisions. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include provisions from the earlier House version that identified $4.68 billion in mandatory savings over ten years. These provisions aimed to reduce government medical care expenditures by increasing rebates states receive from drug manufacturers and giving the FTC more authority to limit deals between brand name and generic drug makers. The dropped House version would have also amended Medicaid law to include different forms of outpatient drugs. The July 1 amended House version of H.R. 4899 proposed amending Medicaid law to include injected, infused, and inhaled forms of outpatient drugs in the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) calculation for Medicaid rebates. This change was not included in previous versions of the bill or the Administration's request. The House July 1 amended version of H.R. 4899 proposed changes to Medicaid drug rebates, including injected, infused, and inhaled drugs in the calculation of AMP. The amendment was estimated to reduce federal Medicaid expenditures by $2.1 billion over 10 years. The Senate did not accept these provisions. The Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act aims to prevent pay-to-delay arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry. This practice involves brand-name drug companies compensating generic manufacturers to delay the entry of generic drugs into the market. This act would make such agreements illegal, ensuring timely availability of generic drugs at lower prices. The proposed legislation aims to prohibit pay-to-delay agreements in the pharmaceutical industry, which would prevent delays in the availability of generic drugs and lower costs for consumers. The legislation would make it unlawful for any agreement involving compensation for delaying the research, development, or sales of generic drugs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that implementing this provision would reduce federal spending by $2.42 billion and increase federal revenues by $0.26 billion over the 2010-2020 period. The Senate did not accept the Preserving Access to Generic Drugs provisions included in the July House amended version, nor were they included in the enrolled bill sent to the President. The enacted version also did not include the $538 million for initiatives to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs that was included in the earlier House July amended version. These funds were intended for various federal agencies to conduct activities to prevent, detect, investigate, and prosecute individuals suspected of illegal activity. The $538 million in Waste, Fraud, and Abuse (WFA) funding in the House July amended version was allocated for enhanced tax enforcement by IRS, HHS Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, HHS Office of the Inspector General, Department of Justice, SSA, and DOL for various WFA activities. The House allocated $538 million for enhanced tax enforcement by the IRS, HHS Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, HHS Office of the Inspector General, Department of Justice, SSA, and DOL for various activities. The funds were not designated as emergency funding and would be available until September 2011 for DOL, SSA, and IRS, and until September 30, 2012 for HHS. CBO estimated that the additional funding would increase the federal deficit by $538 million in 2010. The Coast Guard can access up to $150 million annually from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities. A new unemployment assistance program is proposed for those not eligible for other benefits. The fund is supported by an excise tax on domestic and imported petroleum. The Administration suggested a 1 cent increase in the oil barrel tax to replenish the fund and cover spill-related unemployment benefits. The responsible parties under the Oil Pollution Act would reimburse the U.S. Treasury for program costs. The Administration's proposal under the Oil Pollution Act authorized mandatory appropriations as \"advances\" from the trust fund for oil spill response. CBO estimated $125 million in mandatory appropriations, with $150 million in spending offset by $25 million recovered from responsible parties. The proposal would increase the cap for total expenditure on individual incidents from $1 billion to $1.5 billion. The Administration proposed increasing the cap on total expenditure for individual incidents from $1 billion to $1.5 billion to respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Office of Management and Budget estimated $1.575 billion would be available in the trust fund by the end of FY2010. The Coast Guard would need to notify Congress within 7 days of advancing funds for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, while other spills would still require 30 days notice. The final version of H.R. 4899 included provisions for the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. The final version of H.R. 4899 included provisions for the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund that were the same as those in legislation, P.L. 111-191 ( S. 3473 ) that Congress passed separately on June 15, 2010. This legislation raises the cap to $1 billion for the Deepwater Horizon spill and allows $100 million withdrawals with 7-day notifications to Congress. CBO estimated that this legislation would require $50 million in FY2010 offset by $50 million in reimbursements in FY2012. The actual amount available to the Coast Guard would depend on the number of $100 million advances drawn from the trust fund, up to the $1 billion per-incident cap. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include the Administration's proposed new mandatory unemployment compensation program. Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010 multiple times between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010. Congressional action included passing H.R. 4899 with spending for the Disaster Relief Fund, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Department of Labor's summer jobs program, and new Budget Authority. The Senate passed H.R. 4899 on May 27, 2010, with $59.3 billion in spending for various programs including disaster relief, war funding, and Haiti relief. The House later added funds for education, Pell Grants, and other programs, bringing the total spending to $81.8 billion. The Senate failed to pass the amended version, leading to disagreements between the two chambers.

The House later added funds for education, Pell Grants, and other programs, bringing the total spending to $81.8 billion. The Senate failed to pass the amended version, leading to disagreements between the two chambers. The final version of the bill, totaling $16.7 billion in rescissions and mandatory savings, was signed into law by the President on July 29, 2010. The Senate version of the bill included funding for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, war-related activities, Haiti relief, Deepwater Horizon oil spill response, benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange, and other disaster relief and foreign aid programs, totaling $59.3 billion. This was $4.1 billion below the Administration's request due to not addressing funding for two court settlements. The Senate debated H.R. 4899, focusing on amendments for border security, Gulf oil spill response, supplemental spending, disaster funding, and Afghanistan withdrawal. Senators proposed additional funding for National Guard to address border security concerns. The Senate debated various amendments on border security, Gulf oil spill response, and federal funding. Senators proposed additional funding for National Guard to address border security concerns, while other measures were suggested for oil spill relief and deficit financing. Several amendments were proposed in the Senate to address border security concerns, including funding for National Guard deployment and measures to prevent illegal crossings at the southwest border. However, these proposals were ultimately rejected after failing to receive the necessary votes to waive budget point of order raised. Several amendments were proposed in the Senate, including funds for National Guard deployment on the border, a rejected amendment for setting a timetable to redeploy troops from Afghanistan, and an amendment to cut $59 billion in the supplemental bill over 10 years. The Senate later invoked cloture and adopted 16 amendments in a Managers' amendment before passing H.R. 4899. On May 27, 2010, the Senate invoked cloture by a vote of 69 to 20 and adopted 16 amendments in a Managers' amendment for H.R. 4899. The bill was passed by a vote of 67 to 28 and sent to the House. The House passed an amended version of H.R. 4899 on July 1, 2010, adding $22.5 billion for domestic programs and $16.3 billion in rescissions and mandatory savings. On July 1, 2010, the House adopted a rule and several amendments for H.R. 4899, including funding for court cases, a summer jobs program, and changes to transportation grant formulas. The House also passed additional funding for domestic programs not in the Senate bill. Republican members argued for confining spending to FEMA disaster assistance and war funding. The House debated on July 1, 2010, about additional funding for domestic programs not included in the Senate bill. Republicans wanted to limit spending to FEMA disaster assistance and war funding, while Democrats argued for additional spending to prevent layoffs and support various projects. The House also discussed war-related amendments and the Administration's policy in Afghanistan. The House amended the bill to include $10.0 billion for the Education Job. The House amended the bill on July 1, 2010, to include additional funding for various programs such as Education Job Funds, Pell Grants, border security, Program Integrity initiatives, nuclear and alternative energy loans, oil spill recovery, agricultural and farm loans, and mine safety efforts. Additionally, non-defense DOD spending was increased for fuel costs and base closure related transportation improvements. The House version of the bill, amended in July 2010, included additional funding for various programs such as Education Job Funds, Pell Grants, border security, Program Integrity initiatives, and more. It also increased non-defense DOD spending for fuel costs and base closure related transportation improvements. Additionally, the House version included larger offsets from rescissions and savings in mandatory programs compared to the Senate version. The House version of H.R. 4899 included $12.2 billion in rescissions, targeting various unused funds from different programs like DOD, highway contract authority, pandemic flu, American Recovery Act, Education Department, disaster assistance, State Department, and others. The President threatened to veto any version with unobligated Education Department funding for the \"Race to the Top\" initiative and teacher incentive awards.
