    "content": "The Navy scheduled training exercises off the coast of southern California using mid-frequency active sonar. Environmentalists claimed harm to whales, leading to litigation. The district court initially granted an injunction, later modified to allow sonar use with mitigation measures. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the modified injunction. The Supreme Court ruled on November 12, 2008, regarding the Navy's use of sonar in training exercises off the coast of southern California. The Court held that the Ninth Circuit's standard for issuing a preliminary injunction was too lenient, requiring plaintiffs to show a \"likelihood\" of irreparable injury. Despite potential harm to marine life, the Court determined that the Navy's need for effective training outweighed the plaintiffs' concerns. The Supreme Court ruled that the Navy's interest in realistic training outweighed potential harm to marine mammals, leading to the denial of injunctive relief. The Court did not address the merits of the lawsuit but emphasized the national security interest in the training exercises. The Supreme Court denied injunctive relief in a case where the Navy's national security interest in training exercises outweighed potential harm to marine mammals. The Court rejected the Ninth Circuit's test for issuing injunctions and emphasized the importance of realistic training. The Forest Service had promulgated regulations under the ARA, precluding notice, comment, and appeals for projects covered by categorical exclusions under NEPA. The Forest Service regulations under the ARA precluded notice, comment, and administrative appeals for projects implementing forest plans covered by categorical exclusions under NEPA. The Ninth Circuit invalidated the regulations and issued a nationwide injunction against their application, citing injury in fact and deprivation of procedural rights. The Ninth Circuit found that Forest Service regulations conflicted with the ARA, affirming the district court's decision. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the case, focusing on issues of judicial review, standing, and ripeness of challenges to the regulations. The Supreme Court is reviewing a case involving Forest Service regulations conflicting with the ARA, focusing on issues of judicial review, standing, and ripeness of challenges. Environmental groups use site-specific challenges for program-wide reform, with potential large stakes in the decision. A defeat for such groups could increase the burden on public interest groups seeking to invalidate government programs. The case was argued before the Supreme Court in 2008 but has not yet been decided. The Supreme Court is considering a case involving Clean Water Act regulations on cooling water intake structures at power plants. The case addresses the requirement for the best technology available to minimize environmental impact. The EPA rule in question allowed for cost-benefit analysis in determining compliance with the Act. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for environmental groups seeking program-wide reform. In 2004, EPA issued a rule governing cooling water intake structures at power plants, allowing for cost-benefit analysis. The Second Circuit invalidated the use of cost-benefit analysis under section 316(b), stating that facilities must adopt the best technology available without considering cost. The Supreme Court is now considering whether CWA section 316(b) authorizes EPA to use cost-benefit analysis. The Supreme Court is considering whether the Clean Water Act authorizes the EPA to compare costs with benefits in determining the best technology for minimizing environmental impact at cooling water intake structures. There has been a shift towards greater acceptance of cost-benefit analysis, and this case will test whether conservative justices will continue this trend. Industry may welcome a decision that legitimizes cost-benefit analysis in other areas of the Clean Water Act. The Supreme Court is considering whether the Clean Water Act allows for cost-benefit analysis in determining environmental impact at cooling water intake structures. The case involves Coeur Alaska proposing to revive a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest, which would result in the discharge of wastewater killing aquatic life in a nearby lake. Justice Breyer's past views on government regulation and cost considerations have been highlighted in this case. The Coeur Alaska gold mine proposed to discharge wastewater into a nearby lake, which would kill aquatic life and raise the lake bottom by 50 feet. The Corps of Engineers issued a permit under the Clean Water Act, but conflicting regulations led to a legal challenge in Southeast Alaska Conservation Council v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Coeur Alaska gold mine's proposed discharge into a nearby lake raised environmental concerns. The court ruled that the Clean Water Act's Section 306 performance standard must apply, prohibiting such discharges into US waters. The court found that the Corps should not have issued a 404 permit, as waste products subject to performance standards should not be regulated as fill material. The court ruled that waste products subject to performance standards should not be regulated as fill material, leading to the reversal of a 404 permit issuance. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if the Corps of Engineers' permitting authority under CWA section 404 was wrongly reallocated to the EPA. The case's unexpected grant of certiorari could have significant consequences if the Court broadens the Corps' power to remove discharges from the EPA's NPDES program by redefining \"fill material.\" EPA and California sued to recover cleanup costs under CERCLA after cleaning up toxic contamination at an agricultural chemical facility. The EPA and the state sued to recover cleanup costs under CERCLA for toxic contamination at an agricultural chemical facility. Liability was attached to past and present owners, operators, and those who arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at the site. The district court found the railroads and Shell Oil Co. liable, with the railroads responsible for 9% and Shell for 6% of total cleanup costs. In United States v. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co., the Ninth Circuit addressed the liability of the railroads and Shell for cleanup costs at a contaminated site. The court determined that the harm could be apportioned, but neither party provided a reasonable basis for doing so. Additionally, the court examined whether Shell was liable as an \"arranger\" under CERCLA. The court addressed whether Shell was liable as an \"arranger\" under CERCLA, stating that arranger liability is not limited to direct disposal transactions but also includes broader liability where disposal is part of the transaction. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's decision on apportioning responsibility under CERCLA. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's decision on apportioning responsibility under CERCLA, raising questions about liability for \"arranging\" disposal of hazardous substances and joint and several liability for potentially responsible parties. This case is considered one of the most important Superfund cases to reach the Court, challenging the expansive liability scheme designed by Congress. The Supreme Court is reviewing a crucial Superfund case, questioning liability under CERCLA and joint and several liability for responsible parties. The case could impact the government's ability to recover cleanup costs, potentially leading to the federal treasury covering more expenses. The Court's decision on \"arranger\" liability may also have significant implications. The Supreme Court is reviewing a crucial Superfund case that could impact the government's ability to recover cleanup costs. If the Court adopts a tighter standard for \"arranger\" liability, the federal treasury may have to cover more expenses. Industry is concerned about manufacturer liability in selling products, while the environmental community is apprehensive about the outcome of the cases. The Roberts Court, which has split closely on major environmental cases, is set to make decisions on five cases that have industry optimistic and the environmental community apprehensive. The environmental side won in the lower courts for all five cases, suggesting potential reversals in the Supreme Court. The Ninth Circuit, where four of the cases are from, has a high reversal rate in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has historically voted against environmental positions in NEPA cases, and the current Court is less tolerant of regulation and more sympathetic to business concerns. The Supreme Court, with a few exceptions, is less tolerant of regulation and more sympathetic to business concerns than in the 1970s and 1980s. The large number of environmental cases this term may be due to the conservative justices wanting to resolve issues before potential new appointments. Eminent Supreme Court practitioners are also increasing the likelihood of the Court accepting environmental cases. The Court continues to reject difficult cases, including the question of certain issues. The Supreme Court is less tolerant of regulation and more sympathetic to business concerns. The Court rejects difficult cases, including issues related to the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act. The reasons for nonacceptance of cases are speculative, with the justices remaining the same as in previous decisions. The Supreme Court's justices have remained the same since 2006 when the Rapanos case was decided, leading to confusion in lower courts. If a post-Rapanos case were accepted now, a clear majority rationale may still be elusive."
