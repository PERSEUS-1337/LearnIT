The Congress finds that protecting children's health requires a caring adult and a connection to school. Schools are vital for community support and promoting health. Primary care and behavioral health services are crucial for children's well-being. School safety and violence prevention are essential, and good health is necessary for optimal learning. School safety, violence prevention, and early intervention are crucial for student well-being. Good health is essential for academic success, with schools promoting access to medical and mental health care. Children are facing increasing rates of behavioral and physical illnesses, including ADHD, asthma, diabetes, and obesity. New prevention strategies should be community-based. Effective health services in schools can prevent future diseases. Effective school-based health programs must focus on improving behavioral and physical health, including addressing obesity. Schools are ideal settings to provide care for children with limited access to health services, which contributes to the growing rates of disease among children. Prevention strategies should be combined with treatment to reduce illness rates and the need for treatment. Higher disease rates, even with adequate access to health services, lead to loss of vitality and increased disease complications. Community-based prevention programs are essential for reducing disease incidence. School-based health programs should focus on improving behavioral and physical health, including addressing obesity. Effective community-based prevention programs result in significant savings to the Federal Government and States by reducing health services expenditures. Savings from prevention efforts should be reinvested in further prevention programs and not redirected to unrelated purposes. Prevention programs that achieve savings should not have their funding reduced. DEMONSTRATION GRANTS FOR EXPANSION OF SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide demonstration grants to eligible entities to expand school-based health programs. Eligible entities include public or nonprofit private institutions of higher education or local educational agencies. Coordination with various health programs is required. The Act focuses on health disparities and provides grants to eligible entities like public or nonprofit institutions of higher education or local educational agencies to expand school-based health programs.

The Act provides grants to eligible entities like universities and educational agencies to expand school-based health programs in various states, including Maryland, Texas, New Mexico, California, and Connecticut.

A report with findings and recommendations for a national program will be submitted to Congress by December 31, 2004. The Secretary will provide recommendations for a national program to establish and operate school-based health programs, including funding amounts and potential savings in health services programs.
