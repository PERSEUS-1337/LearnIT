    "content": "Foveation is compared to non-foveating deep networks using different variable-resolution downsampling methods in ImageNet recognition with a Densenet-121 network. The best variable-resolution method slightly outperforms uniform downsampling, suggesting that foveation does not significantly impact object recognition in deep networks. Different foveated downsampling approaches perform similarly to each other, with the best method slightly outperforming uniform downsampling. This indicates that foveation may not be crucial for object recognition but can be incorporated into more general vision systems. The study compared foveation to non-foveating deep networks in ImageNet recognition using a DenseNet-121 network. Foveation did not greatly interfere with object recognition, suggesting it could be integrated into more general vision systems. Different foveated downsampling methods performed similarly, with the best method slightly outperforming uniform downsampling.

Foveation did not greatly interfere with object recognition, suggesting it could be integrated into more general vision systems. Different foveated downsampling methods performed similarly, with the best method slightly outperforming uniform downsampling. The training procedure involved random horizontal flips, batch size adjustments, and training each network for 90 epochs using SGD. In cases where the resulting crop went outside the image boundaries, edge pixels were copied. Multiple saliency points were sometimes chosen in a single image, with the highest-saliency points typically close together and containing similar information. To prevent selecting multiple similar points, saliency maps were modified after each selection by subtracting a square-gaussian function. This approach could have potential benefits within more general vision systems."
