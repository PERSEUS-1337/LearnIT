The Commercial Fishermen Safety and Tax Fairness Act of 2000 includes a new section in the Internal Revenue Code for a Fishing Safety Equipment Credit under SEC. 45D. The Fishing Safety Equipment Credit allows eligible taxpayers engaged in a fishing business to claim a credit of 75% of qualified fishing safety equipment expenses, not exceeding $1,500. Qualified expenses include lifesaving equipment required on vessels. The Fishing Safety Equipment Credit pertains to lifesaving equipment required on vessels for fishing businesses.
