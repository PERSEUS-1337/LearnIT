    "content": "Human history began in Africa, with human ancestors evolving into homosapiens around 200,000 years ago. Small bands of modern humans migrated out of Africa 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, becoming ancestors of all human populations. The Bantu people of West Africa expanded their settlement around 2,500-5,000 years ago, becoming the predominant group in sub-Saharan Africa. Nilo-Saharan languages are found in the Sahel grasslands and eastern Africa, with origins possibly in the Nile valley. The Nilo-Saharan languages may have originated in the Nile valley. The term \"Nilotic\" is no longer used due to intermingling with Bantu speakers. Bantu agriculture was not suitable for extreme southern Africa, inhabited by the \"Khoisan\" or \"San\" people. Bantu became skilled in iron smelting by 500 BC, leading to successful agriculture and expansion. African farmers grew a variety of crops, including bananas from contacts with the Indian Ocean region. Farmers adopted New World crops like maize and peanuts after the discovery of America. After the discovery of America, African farmers quickly adopted New World crops like maize and peanuts. By 1500, an estimated 47 million Africans were living in farming communities across the continent. Large towns and cities had not developed in Africa due to disease-causing organisms. Loyalties to large ethnic groups were largely absent in pre-colonial Africa. In pre-colonial Africa, loyalties were not tied to large ethnic groups like \"the Yoruba\" or \"the Tutsi.\" Instead, loyalties were embedded in extended families, clans, and patron-client relationships. Powerful individuals or chiefs, known as \"big men,\" emerged and consolidated authority through conquest and alliances, leading to the development of African kingdoms like the Kongo kingdom to the south of the Congo River estuary. The African kingdoms developed through conquest and alliances, with powerful chiefs ruling provinces. Great artistic achievements characterized these kingdoms, such as bronze castings in Benin and Congolese masks. The Atlantic slave trade began in 1441, with 10-13 million people taken from Africa over 400 years. Most were sent to Brazil and the Caribbean, with smaller numbers going to the United States and British North American colonies. The peak of the trade occurred in the eighteenth century. The Atlantic slave trade peaked in the eighteenth century, with annual totals reaching 100,000 in some years. In 1807, the British parliament voted to end the slave trade, leading to the Royal Navy intercepting over 1,600 ships and freeing 160,000 captives. Despite efforts to halt the trade, many ships evaded patrols, and slavery continued until its abolition in the Americas in the 1850s and 1860s. U.S. participation in the slave trade was banned in 1807 and strengthened in 1819, with limited success in halting the trade. European traders conducted the Atlantic slave trade by purchasing slaves from African owners in exchange for goods. The Atlantic slave trade conducted by European traders on the West African coast involved purchasing slaves in exchange for goods like guns, alcohol, and cloth. Slavery in Africa was practiced through capturing people during wars or as punishment, with some victims being kidnapped. The effects of the slave trade on African societies led to turmoil and outbreaks of war, fueled by the exchange of guns for slaves. Scholars debate the impact on politics and economies, but the era was marked by instability in West Africa. The slave trade in Africa led to turmoil, war, and instability in West Africa. The exchange of guns for slaves fueled conflict, weakening Africa and making it vulnerable to European colonization. Indigenous political entities were expected to develop into nation-states, like the kingdom of Ashanti, which had profited from the slave trade and established a strong central government. In West Africa, the kingdom of Ashanti had a strong central government, advanced roads, defined boundaries, and a national language, profiting from gold and the slave trade. Buganda in East Africa became a naval power on Lake Victoria with a powerful king, a strong army, and growing trade. Secondary empires, relying on European military technology, were emerging in Muslim societies, promoting Islam's spread in sub-Saharan Africa. In the nineteenth century, West Africa saw the rise of a vast Islamic empire centered on Sokoto, while in East Africa, the sultans of Zanzibar extended their power. Egypt also expanded its control in northeastern Africa. In southern Africa, the Boers established a secondary empire by defeating the Zulu and establishing farms in the grasslands. In the 19th century, the Boers migrated inland to escape British influence, defeating the Zulu with modern weapons and tactics. The European scramble for Africa halted indigenous political development, with British forces ending resistance in Somalia by 1920. Sub-Saharan Africa, except for Ethiopia and Liberia, fell under European control. Ethiopia resisted Italian colonization but couldn't oust them from Eritrea. In 1896, Ethiopia defeated Italian troops at Adowa, thwarting Italian ambitions of colonization. Menelik II couldn't oust Italians from Eritrea. Europeans had military advantages due to advances in medicine and technology, leading to successful colonial invasions in Africa. Some African groups resisted colonization, but many did not. Many Africans did not resist colonial invasion due to Europe's military advantages. However, some groups like the Ashanti, Zulu, Boers, Herero, and peoples in French West Africa did launch armed struggles. European leaders were initially hesitant to seize African territory but were pressured by imperialists, nationalists, anti-slavery activists, missionaries, and business interests. The discovery of diamonds in Kimberley and gold in Witwatersrand further fueled colonial expansion in southern Africa. The discovery of diamonds in Kimberley in 1871 and gold in Witwatersrand in 1885 fueled colonial expansion in southern Africa. King Leopold II of Belgium successfully hid his profit motives behind humanitarian concerns while building a vast empire in the Congo River basin with the help of explorer Henry M. Stanley. Leopold's International Association of the Congo gained recognition at the Berlin West Africa Conference in 1884-1885. Leopold's International Association of the Congo (IAC) gained recognition at the Berlin Conference, setting rules for future colonization in Africa. Britain, Germany, and the US supported Leopold's plans to counter French influence. By the First World War, Britain emerged as the dominant power in Africa, with France also holding significant territories. Britain was the dominant power in Africa, with colonies stretching from southern Africa through eastern Africa to Egypt, including the Gold Coast and Nigeria. France also held territories in West and Central Africa. The United States assisted the American Colonization Society in settling former slaves in Liberia in 1820. The settlers declared independence in 1847 and used firearms to conquer indigenous peoples, leading to societal disintegration in the late twentieth century. The effects of colonial rule in Africa, particularly in Congo under Leopold's control, were negative with widespread abuses including forced labor, beatings, mutilations, and starvation as a policy tool. The situation in Congo became an international scandal, leading to reforms and the removal of the colony from Leopold's control in 1908. The colonial era in Africa led to infrastructure development, improved public health, and some education opportunities. Christian missions promoted literacy and education, leading to the rise of African leaders like Jomo Kenyatta, Kwame Nkrumah, and Nnamdi Azikiwe who studied abroad and later became presidents of their countries. European investment in Africa was limited during this time. During the colonial era, African leaders like Nkrumah, Azikiwe, and Kenyatta studied abroad and later became presidents. Colonial economic policies made Africa dependent on exporting primary products, hindering market economies post-independence. Colonial governments did not promote democracy to maintain control with minimal expenditure. During the colonial era, African leaders studied abroad and later became presidents. Colonial economic policies made Africa dependent on exporting primary products, hindering market economies post-independence. Colonial governments did not promote democracy, leading to authoritarian control and setting unfortunate precedents for post-colonial rulers. During the colonial era, traditional authorities played a crucial role in obtaining labor and tax revenues for the colonial regimes. This strengthened big men who relied on kinship ties, favors, and suppression of dissent, contributing to corruption, nepotism, and authoritarianism in independent Africa. Colonial practices shaped present-day ethnic divisions by intensifying language and cultural differences among African peoples, as Europeans viewed the world in terms of \"tribes\" and \"nations.\" The British, in particular, ruled indirectly through tribal chiefs, strengthening tribal loyalties and divisions that persist today. During the colonial era, Africans advanced their interests through tribal organizations, strengthening tribal loyalties. Today, ethnic divisions fuel Africa's violent politics, weaken institutions, and hinder economies. The colonial partition imposed artificial boundaries, disrupting cultural and trade links. The bureaucratic colonial state suppressed indigenous political arrangements, leading to transport difficulties between African countries. The impact of pre-colonial political entities on Africa's current state remains unknown. The end of colonialism in Africa was hastened by World War II, weakening Britain and France. The war promoted democratic ideals and self-government, resonating with Africa's nationalists. The United Nations Charter committed colonial powers to developing free political institutions in their territories. The United Nations Charter committed colonial powers to developing self-government in their territories. African nationalists, influenced by European and American movements, began organizing opposition to colonial regimes. British policymakers saw African independence as inevitable but distant, while France pursued assimilation policies in its colonies. In the early 1950s, nationalist sentiments were rising in African colonies, leading to anti-colonial protests and guerrilla uprisings. British decision-makers accelerated the independence timetable, with Ghana becoming independent in 1957, followed by Nigeria, Tanzania, and Kenya. Meanwhile, political parties were organizing in French colonies, with Guinea voting for independence in 1958, shocking President Charles de Gaulle. In 1960, 14 independent countries emerged from French-held Africa, followed by the Belgian Congo gaining independence the same year. In southern Africa, independence was delayed due to substantial white populations opposing majority rule, leading to armed struggles for freedom. In 1965, Rhodesia's white minority declared independence from Britain, resulting in UN sanctions. In 1965, Rhodesia's white minority declared independence from Britain, leading to UN sanctions. This sparked armed struggles for freedom in Rhodesia, Angola, Mozambique, and Namibia. Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980, while Angola, Mozambique, and Namibia achieved independence in the 1970s and 1990, respectively. In South Africa, the National Party imposed apartheid in 1948, leading to opposition to white minority rule. In 1948, the National Party imposed apartheid in South Africa, leading to protests and violent resistance in the 1970s and 1980s. The government launched military strikes against the African National Congress (ANC) but faced international isolation in the late 1980s. Secret discussions with the ANC led to Nelson Mandela's release in 1990 and constitutional negotiations in 1993, resulting in universal suffrage. In the 1960s, Africa saw a promising future with the departure of colonial governments and the rise of a new educated elite in power. The Organization of African Unity was established in 1963 to promote solidarity and improve living standards among member states. In the early years of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), member states pledged to promote African solidarity and improve living standards while respecting non-interference and territorial integrity. However, challenges emerged with civil wars in the former Belgian Congo and coups in Togo, Ghana, and Nigeria. Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa declined significantly in the 1970s and 1980s, with many countries under authoritarian regimes. Sub-Saharan Africa experienced a sharp decline in economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s, with per capita growth rates falling to negative figures. Authoritarian regimes and civil wars plagued many African countries during this period, leading to widespread suffering and death, exacerbated by droughts in the early 1980s. The impact of colonialism, ethnic divisions, and authoritarian rule were identified as underlying causes of Africa's post-independence challenges. The Cold War exacerbated Africa's challenges by fueling conflicts with arms from the Soviet Union and the US supporting anti-Soviet regimes. This competition strengthened authoritarian governments and led to inefficient economic policies and corruption. Additionally, the end of colonialism left small indigenous elites to face the population growth and independence challenges in Africa. France's active engagement in Africa aimed to maintain great power status during the dominance of the superpowers. Through special relationships with former colonies, France provided military and economic assistance, promising intervention to protect friendly regimes. French troops were stationed in African bases, and French businesses benefited from these ties. In the later 1980s and early 1990s, scholars focused on African state and society characteristics to explain difficulties. Some concluded African states were too weak for societal change and development due to state institutions. In the early 1990s, scholars analyzed African societies and concluded that weak state institutions, corrupt leadership, and economic difficulties hindered societal change and development. Despite some positive developments, such as the end of the Cold War, Africa faced challenges like the \"failed state\" concept and low GDP growth rates. In the early 1990s, positive developments in Africa included the end of the Cold War, leading to hopes for a better future. Changes in South Africa averted a violent revolution, with expectations of becoming an economic powerhouse. Some African countries were implementing free market reforms, resulting in GDP growth rates exceeding population growth. Political reforms were also underway due to demands for democratization. Reforms were beginning in Africa's authoritarian states in the early 1990s due to demands for democratization. National political conferences were held, allowing diverse interests from civil society to be represented. Multiple political parties were permitted in countries that were previously one-party states, leading to generally free and fair elections. However, some authoritarian leaders learned to manipulate the electoral process, creating \"pseudo-democracies\" in countries like Kenya, Gabon, and Cameroon. Some African authoritarian leaders have manipulated the electoral process to create \"pseudo-democracies,\" according to Larry Diamond. Richard Joseph noted disappointingly that Africa's democratic opening resulted in \"virtual democracies\" with surface characteristics of liberal democracy but stifled opposition. Events in Zimbabwe and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire have been discouraging for democratization advocates. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, a military coup in 1999 and exclusion of a qualified candidate from the Muslim north led to ethnic and religious divisions. In Zimbabwe, political violence marred the 2000 elections, with opposition members killed. The government's takeover of white-owned farms raised concerns about the rule of law. Sub-Saharan Africa's AIDS epidemic is worsening, with over 25 million infected, disproportionately affecting the region. Uganda and Senegal have seen success in prevention campaigns. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa has claimed over 17 million lives, with a high infection rate of 8.8%. Uganda and Senegal have had success with prevention campaigns, but some countries in southern Africa have adult populations with over 20% HIV-positive. Armed conflicts in countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo have further complicated the situation, with fears of a wider war looming. The economic performance in Africa has been disappointing, with GDP growth rates lower than population growth rates, leading to economic stagnation. South Africa's economy also showed minimal growth, delaying hopes for sparking economic expansion in the region. Sub-Saharan Africa is described as marginalized in the global economy, with pessimistic views on the continent's political and economic prospects in the coming years. The U.S. National Intelligence Council's study in 2000 predicted that Africa's political and economic prospects are not very bright for the next several years due to demographics, disease, and poor governance. Some observers reject this Afro-pessimism, attributing it to stereotyped views and media focus on violent events. Many observers reject Afro-pessimism, arguing that it stems from stereotyped views and media focus on violence in Africa. Experts highlight progress in governance and economic policies, with some suggesting an African Renaissance is underway. President Thabo Mbeki and former U.S. Ambassador James Joseph have endorsed this concept. The African Renaissance concept has gained support from President Thabo Mbeki and former U.S. Ambassador James Joseph, who believe in the positive political developments in Africa, including successful elections in countries like South Africa and Nigeria. The optimistic view emphasizes the wave of democratization and reconciliation in the 1990s, with a focus on the progress made in governance and economic policies. The optimistic view on Africa's future highlights the wave of democratization through national elections in many countries. Despite economic disappointments, countries like Botswana, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Uganda have shown promising GDP growth rates. With economic reforms, improved governance, and international support, there is potential for increased per capita incomes and quality of life. Debt relief and poverty reduction programs are seen as crucial, along with the continent's natural resources and tourism potential. The Clinton Administration's policy towards Africa had an Afro-optimist tone, with President Clinton emphasizing the continent's potential for growth and transformation during his visits in 1998 and 2000. He acknowledged Africa's economic challenges and conflicts but highlighted the growing economies in countries like Ghana, Mozambique, and Uganda. President Clinton visited Nigeria in August 2000 to show support for its democratic transition and cooperation with the US in combating international crime. He also emphasized the importance of addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa and highlighted the continent's potential as a trading partner, especially in oil imports. The Clinton Administration promoted increased trade and investment with Africa, citing its growing importance as a US oil supplier. The Clinton Administration emphasized the importance of Africa as a trading partner, particularly in oil imports, and promoted initiatives such as the African Growth and Opportunity Act. They also launched assistance programs like the Leland Initiative and the Greater Horn of Africa Initiative to address various issues in the region, including food insecurity and HIV/AIDS. The Clinton Administration launched the LIFE Initiative to combat HIV/AIDS in Africa and globally, involving various U.S. agencies. Challenges arose, notably after U.S. soldiers were killed in Somalia in 1993, leading to hesitation in sending peacekeepers during the Rwanda genocide. The Administration aimed to enhance Africa's capabilities following these events. The Clinton Administration hesitated in sending peacekeepers during the Rwanda genocide in 1994, leading to acknowledgment of delayed action. Efforts were made to strengthen Africa's peacekeeping capabilities through initiatives like ACRI and training Nigerian battalions for peacekeeping duties. Despite some successes in mediating conflicts, ongoing conflicts in Africa frustrated policymakers and hindered economic growth and political reform. Trade results during the Clinton years showed mixed growth in U.S. imports from Africa. Trade results during the Clinton years were mixed, with U.S. imports from Africa growing at a slower pace compared to overall imports. Most trade was with a few countries, particularly oil producers and South Africa. African imports and exports accounted for about 1% of U.S. totals in 1999. Despite this, U.S. firms made significant investments in Africa, such as Southwestern Bell's acquisition in the telecommunications industry and Caterpillar Inc. dealerships in multiple countries. Sub-Saharan Africa gained attention in foreign policy in 1958. In 1958, Sub-Saharan Africa gained attention in foreign policy with the establishment of a Bureau of African Affairs. Successive Administrations faced controversies over issues like apartheid in South Africa and African development. The Eisenhower Administration dealt with the Congo rebellion in 1960, fearing Soviet exploitation. The Kennedy Administration was more supportive of African nationalists during the Cold War. During the Kennedy Administration, the United States supported African nationalists and approved funding for a controversial dam in Ghana. The administration also pressured white regimes in southern Africa for reforms and backed a U.N.-sponsored arms embargo against South Africa. In the Johnson Administration, the focus was on Congo (Zaire), where extensive covert aid was provided to suppress communist-inspired rebellions. Mobutu Sese-Seko solidified his position as Zaire's president with U.S. backing. Limited military assistance was given to Congo, but concerns over another Vietnam prevented further involvement. During the Nixon and Ford Administrations, the focus shifted to southern Africa, particularly Angola, Mozambique, and Rhodesia. Political controversy arose over policymakers' perceived sympathy towards white minority regimes. Henry Kissinger believed the Soviet Union was pursuing aggressive policies in Africa. President Jimmy Carter's Administration emphasized human rights, advocating for majority rule in Zimbabwe. The Carter Administration in the late 1970s focused on human rights in U.S. foreign policy, pushing for majority rule in Zimbabwe and independence for Namibia. They criticized apartheid in South Africa and pressed for reforms in Zaire. The Administration faced challenges in sub-Saharan Africa, including a pro-Soviet regime in Ethiopia and the 1977-1978 \"Ogaden War\" involving Somalia and Cuba. The Carter Administration focused on human rights in U.S. foreign policy, pushing for majority rule in Zimbabwe and independence for Namibia. They also criticized apartheid in South Africa and pressed for reforms in Zaire. In sub-Saharan Africa, the Administration faced challenges with a pro-Soviet regime in Ethiopia and the 1977-1978 \"Ogaden War\" involving Somalia, Cuba, and potential U.S. military involvement. Cold War concerns influenced the Administration's opposition to sanctions against South Africa and the deployment of Cuban troops in Angola, which became a major concern for Africa policymakers in the Reagan Administration. Reagan's Administration supported covert aid to UNITA in Angola to secure Cuban withdrawal in exchange for independence. The covert aid program was launched in 1986 after Congress repealed prohibiting legislation in 1985. Chester Crocker favored a policy of \"linkage\" to secure Cuban withdrawal from Angola in exchange for independence for Namibia. Despite political opposition, a regional peace agreement was negotiated in 1988 under U.S. leadership. In 1986, Congress enacted sweeping sanctions legislation over President Reagan's veto. The George H.W. Bush Administration focused on the Horn of Africa, successfully arranging a peaceful transition in Ethiopia in 1991. Somalia, however, descended into clan violence. In 1992, Somalia faced clan violence, drought, and famine, leading to a humanitarian disaster. President Bush sent U.S. troops for a humanitarian intervention, saving many from starvation despite American casualties in 1993. The Bush Administration also pushed for reforms in Africa to promote democracy and economic liberalization. In 2000, the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) aimed at boosting U.S. trade with Africa became law, along with the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act authorizing $300 million in FY2001. In recent decades, several acts were enacted by Congress to support Africa, including the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) in 2000, the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act in 2000, the Africa: Seeds of Hope Act in 1998, the African Conflict Resolution Act in 1994, the South African Democratic Transition Support Act in 1993, and the Development Fund for Africa in 1990. In 1980, Congress created the Development Fund for Africa (DFA) to protect aid levels in Africa post-Cold War. In 1985, a large emergency appropriation was passed for African famine relief. In 1986, the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act set policy objectives for the US in South Africa. In 1990, Congress committed to supporting democracy in South Africa. In 1992, the Horn of Africa Recovery and Food Security Act was passed to promote democracy in the region. In 1976, the Clark Amendment prohibited aid for military operations in Angola, sponsored by Senator Dick Clark. In 1971, the Byrd Amendment exempted the US from UN sanctions against white-ruled countries. The \"Byrd Amendment,\" passed in 1971, partially exempted the US from UN sanctions against white-ruled Rhodesia by prohibiting the President from enforcing the UN trade embargo on imports of critical materials like chromium and nickel. The curr_chunk discusses various books and issue briefs related to Africa, including topics such as foreign policy, AIDS, Congo, Nigeria, Sudan, and U.S. foreign assistance."
