The Congress finds that the National Science Foundation plays a crucial role in strengthening the nation's information infrastructure. Automation and digitization in various industries will rely on NSF-funded researchers for information processing. NSF's research and assistance are essential for industry to leverage advanced communication and information technology. Information management is increasingly important, with projected growth in sectors related to biology. There is a lack of a systematic plan for designing information systems and tools and ensuring the workforce can transition to the information age. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the National Science Foundation. \"Information\" pertains to data in sectors where the government is heavily involved and transitioning to digital data use. \"Institution of higher education\" is defined as per the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Director, in consultation with other Federal agencies, awards grants for research on innovative approaches to improve information systems in areas like information studies, population informatics, translational informatics, and data security. Grants are merit-reviewed and competitive, with authorized appropriations of $3.5-3.8 million annually. Additionally, the Director awards Informatics Research Centers in collaboration with other agencies. The Director awards multiyear grants to institutions of higher education to establish Centers for Informatics Research, focusing on innovative multidisciplinary research in information areas. Grants are merit-reviewed and competitive, with annual appropriations of $3.5-3.8 million. The Director awards multiyear grants to institutions of higher education to establish Centers for Informatics Research, focusing on innovative multidisciplinary research in information areas. Institutions seeking funding must submit an application detailing research projects, promoting collaboration among professionals from different disciplines, and contributing to increasing innovation. The Director evaluates applications for grants based on the applicant's ability to innovate in information research, experience in the field, capacity for collaboration, support for students, and potential partnerships. The Director evaluates grant applications based on the applicant's ability to innovate in information research, collaborate, support students, and form partnerships with government or private entities. An annual meeting is held to promote collaboration among Centers. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2008-2011. The National Science Foundation Information Programs are outlined in Section 5. The National Science Foundation Information Programs include capacity building grants for institutions of higher education to establish or improve undergraduate and master's degree information programs, increase student enrollment in information fields, provide industry experience, and utilize distance learning. Grants are awarded based on merit and competition, with funds used to enhance information education quality and recruit more students. The National Science Foundation provides grants to institutions of higher education to enhance information education quality, establish degree programs, increase student enrollment, and facilitate industry partnerships. Activities include curriculum development, creating research opportunities for students, acquiring necessary equipment, and fostering collaborations with government agencies and private industry. The National Science Foundation provides grants to institutions of higher education to enhance information education quality, establish degree programs, increase student enrollment, and facilitate industry partnerships. This includes collaborating with government agencies, private industry, and academic institutions, establishing student internships, enhancing bridge programs between community colleges and universities, and other activities determined by the Director. The National Science Foundation provides grants to institutions of higher education for enhancing information education quality, establishing degree programs, increasing student enrollment, and fostering industry partnerships. The selection process for funding involves submitting an application detailing research and instructional capacity, as well as a plan to build instructional capacity in information fields. The proposal for National Science Foundation grants requires a comprehensive plan to build instructional capacity in information fields, collaborations with government agencies or private industry, analysis of student enrollment and placement data, and a plan to evaluate program success. The Director will evaluate the program established under this subsection within 3 years to assess the grants' impact on increasing students pursuing degrees in information fields. Grants will be awarded in various geographic areas and types of higher education institutions. Authorization of appropriations is also included. The Director will assess the impact of grants on increasing students pursuing degrees in information fields. Authorization of appropriations for the National Science Foundation is outlined for fiscal years 2008 to 2011. Grants under the Scientific and Advanced Technology Act of 1992 will focus on improving education in information-related fields. Authorization of appropriations for the National Science Foundation to improve education in information-related fields: \n- $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2008\n- $7,200,000 for fiscal year 2009\n- $7,400,000 for fiscal year 2010\n- $7,600,000 for fiscal year 2011 The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology must report to Congress within 120 days on efforts related to informatics, including standards harmonization and support for digitization. The report should include timetables for information standards, challenges in their promulgation, ensuring usability for scientists, and actions to ensure robust and timely standards."
