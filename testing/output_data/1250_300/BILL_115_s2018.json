The applicable amount is determined by marital status and income level. The Child Tax Credit under the \"American Family Act of 2017\" is based on marital status and income level.

The Child Tax Credit eligibility excludes individuals who are not dependents under section 152(b)(3). Starting in 2018, the $3,000 amount in subsection (a)(1) will be adjusted for inflation annually. Taxpayers must meet identification requirements to claim the credit. The Child Tax Credit amount will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50 if it is not already. Taxpayers must provide the name and taxpayer identification number of their qualifying child on their tax return.
