    "content": "The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides legal protection to identified species and their habitats, administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Species can be listed as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\" based on extinction risk assessments. Legal tools under the ESA include prohibiting unpermitted \"take\" of endangered species and ensuring actions do not harm listed species or critical habitat. As of August 24, 2016, 2,266 species were listed as endangered or threatened. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) was passed in 1973 and has been amended multiple times since then. It aims to protect endangered and threatened species and their habitats. As of August 24, 2016, there were 2,266 listed species, with 1,593 in the United States. The ESA prohibits unpermitted \"take\" of species and ensures actions do not harm critical habitat. Funding for the ESA expired in 1992, but Congress has continued to appropriate funds. The ESA plays a crucial role in species conservation but can also be a point of contention in debates over resource allocation. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) plays a crucial role in protecting endangered and threatened species and their habitats. However, it can also become a battleground in debates over resource allocation due to economic interests and resource scarcities. Examples include controversies like the Tellico Dam and Northwest timber harvest. The worldwide debate over global climate change also adds to the complexity of these issues. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a key player in protecting endangered species and their habitats, but it also sparks debates over resource allocation and economic interests. The global climate change debate further complicates these issues, with tensions rising over species protection, economic growth, and human population impacts on habitats. Critics argue that the ESA and administrative efforts fall short in accommodating needs beyond species conservation, while defenders believe it balances development biases in other laws and policies. Urban and suburban populations show stronger support for species conservation compared to rural areas. Debate on the Endangered Species Act (ESA) splits along demographic lines, with urban and suburban populations showing stronger support for species conservation. Native Americans often support the survival of listed species due to their reliance on natural resources. Opposing groups argue conservation measures will lead to job losses, while proponents claim the opposite. The debate also involves ethical and religious considerations, with industries like logging viewing the ESA as a problem, while others like commercial fishing see it as beneficial. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) debate involves various groups, including religious and industry interests. Questions arise regarding the authorization of appropriations and the effect of funding for agencies like FWS and NMFS. The authorization for appropriations expired in FY1992, leading to uncertainties about the act's prohibitions and authorities. The authorization for appropriations for agencies like FWS and NMFS under the ESA expired in FY1992, leading to uncertainties about funding. However, the agencies still have authority to carry out actions and enforce prohibitions under the act. The expiration of the authorization does not negate the statutory obligations created by the law. Additionally, citizens can still initiate civil suits under Section 11(g) of the act. The expiration of agency funding authorization under the ESA does not nullify statutory obligations. Citizen suits can still be initiated under Section 11(g) of the act, potentially dissuading prohibited acts. Congressional rules distinguish between authorizations and appropriations but do not affect a law's statutory force. House rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports. The Rules Committee can set parameters for appropriations measures through special rules, including waiving points of order. Senate rules also differentiate between authorizations and appropriations. The House and Senate rules distinguish between authorizations and appropriations, with special rules allowing waivers for points of order against provisions in conference reports on appropriations measures. Unauthorized appropriations are prohibited in both chambers, but waivers can be granted by unanimous consent. The practical effects of a funding lapse would impact various areas, such as interagency consultations and species listings. No agency actions approved, no incidental take statements issued, no species listed or delisted, critical habitat not designated, no permits for nonfederal actions, reduced inspections for CITES violations, no enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or adverse habitat modification, no habitat acquisition for listed species. The 104th Congress made efforts to end funding for the ESA, but it was abandoned due to potential negative effects. The ESA's success is measured by species recovery, with only 34 species delisted so far. The ESA's success is measured by species recovery, with only 34 species delisted so far. Some species listed as endangered may actually be extinct, making it difficult to prove their status. The effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is measured by the number of species that have stabilized or increased their populations, with 41% of listed species showing improvement. Some species, like red wolves and California condors, may not exist without ESA protection, indicating a level of success even though they remain rare. The status of rare species without the ESA is unknown, but the ESA has played a crucial role in preventing extinctions. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been crucial in preventing extinctions and has led to the stabilization or increase in populations of 41% of listed species. Some species, such as red wolves and California condors, may not exist without ESA protection. Scientific information and analysis are key to ESA actions, focusing on causes of extinction and comparing current extinction rates to background levels. The focus of the extinction debate has shifted from over-exploitation to broader risks facing species. During the 20th century, a shift occurred in the extinction debate towards broader risks facing species, including habitat loss, climate change, and the introduction of nonnative invasive species. Global climate change, habitat loss, and nonnative invasive species are major contributors to the decline of many species. The homogenization of the world's flora and fauna has led to the demise of numerous species. The extinction debate has shifted towards broader risks facing species, including habitat loss, climate change, and invasive species. Many species are threatened by factors such as predators, competitors, and multiple threats. The current rate of extinction is a concern, with estimates of total species ranging from 3.5 million to 100 million. It is difficult to estimate how fast species are going extinct due to uncertainty about the number of species and comparison with background extinction rates. Estimates of total species range from 3.5 million to 100 million, with 10-30 million being commonly accepted. Scientists use conservative assumptions to estimate extinction rates, with current rates exceeding background rates. Normal rates are 1 to 10 species per 10 million per year, while current estimates range from 100 to 10,000 times higher. Critics often question estimates of current extinction rates, which are believed to be 100 to 10,000 times higher than background levels. Despite uncertainties in calculations, biologists argue that similar results are found across different studies and methods. Once a species goes extinct, it cannot be brought back, but new species may evolve to adapt to changing conditions. The process of replacement or recovery of species could take time. Some scientists estimate that recovery to equal numbers of different species after major extinction events could take up to 25 million years. The Endangered Species Act defines endangered species as those in danger of extinction and threatened species as likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The ESA does not rely on a numerical standard due to the wide variety of species biology. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) defines endangered species as those at risk of extinction and threatened species as likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The ESA protects all species and subspecies of animals, with further protection for distinct population segments within a species. Limited protection is available for plant species, and no protection is provided for organisms not classified as animals or plants. The term \"take\" under the ESA includes actions like harassment, harm, hunting, and capturing, with controversy over whether habitat modification is included. The Endangered Species Act prohibits actions that harm or harass endangered species, with controversy over whether habitat modification is included. The Secretary of the Interior manages listed species through FWS, while marine species are under the Secretary of Commerce. Species can be listed based on scientific information or by petition. The Endangered Species Act allows species to be listed based on scientific information or by petition, with the Secretary making the decision based on the best available scientific and commercial information. Economic considerations are not taken into account when listing a species, as Congress directed that listing be a scientific question of whether the species is threatened or endangered. Endangered species are at risk of extinction throughout their range, while threatened species are likely to become endangered. The Endangered Species Act defines endangered species as those at risk of extinction throughout their range, while threatened species are likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The interpretation of the phrase \"all or a significant portion of its range\" has varied, with courts rejecting the Department of the Interior's narrow interpretation. In 2014, the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service issued a joint interpretation of the phrase. In 2014, FWS and NMFS issued a joint interpretation of the phrase \"all or a significant portion of its range.\" This interpretation states that a portion of a species' range is significant if its contribution to the species' viability is crucial, even if the species is not currently endangered throughout its entire range. The determination of whether a species should be listed as endangered or threatened must be based on scientific factors and threats to its continuance, as mandated by the ESA. The ESA mandates that listing determinations for endangered or threatened species must be based solely on scientific and commercial data. The addition of the word \"solely\" in 1982 clarified that economic impacts should not influence the decision. The goal is to ensure that decisions regarding species listing are made strictly on biological criteria, with non-biological considerations coming into play later. The legislation mandates that listing decisions for endangered or threatened species must be based solely on scientific and commercial data, excluding economic factors. The goal is to ensure that species listing is determined strictly by biological criteria, with economic considerations not playing a role. The ESA mandates that species listing decisions must be based solely on scientific and commercial data, excluding economic factors. Petitions for species status changes must be assessed within 90 days, with a 12-month review period if action is warranted. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) mandates that species listing decisions must be based solely on scientific and commercial data, excluding economic factors. Petitions for species status changes must be assessed within 90 days, with a 12-month review period if action is warranted. The agency has 12 months to conduct a status review of the candidate species and determine if listing is warranted, with lawsuits being brought against agencies for failure to meet deadlines. As of August 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) had received over 160 ESA petitions, with questions arising about the federal government's responsibilities towards proposed but not yet listed species. The federal government's responsibilities towards proposed but not yet listed species under the Endangered Species Act include conferring with the appropriate Secretary on management actions to avoid jeopardizing the species. This conference process is less formal than the consultation process for listed species and aims to assist agencies in minimizing adverse effects. The conference stage in the consultation process for proposed species under the Endangered Species Act is less formal and aims to advise agencies on minimizing adverse effects. Agencies may choose to follow a more complete process to avoid duplication of effort later. Once a species is listed, agencies have specific responsibilities and may need to avoid actions that could lead to liability. Candidate species must be monitored to prevent significant risks to their well-being. The relevant Secretary must monitor candidate species to prevent significant risks to their well-being. Candidate species are those being considered for listing as endangered or threatened. Federal agencies and landowners can enter into conservation agreements to improve the status of a species and avoid listing proposals. If a species is proposed for listing, the Secretary must publish the regulation. As actions are carried out, no change is required if a candidate species covered under a conservation agreement is listed as threatened or endangered. When a species is proposed for listing, the Secretary must publish the regulation, notify relevant parties, and hold a public hearing. Federal agencies must consult with the Secretary on actions that may harm candidate species. If an emergency poses a significant risk, the species must be promptly listed. The Secretary must monitor candidate species between proposal and listing decision, promptly listing in emergencies. Special regulations can be made for threatened species. Protections for threatened species can be tailored, like for the northern long-eared bat and polar bear. A DPS refers to a genetically distinct and geographically separated portion of a listed species. Only vertebrates can be designated as a DPS, meeting criteria of discreteness and significance. The DPS designation under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is based on genetic distinction and range, with only vertebrates eligible. Criteria for a DPS include discreteness and significance, with protection status determined similarly to other listings. Special rules may apply if a DPS is threatened, as seen in the case of the gray wolf. NMFS introduced evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) to interpret the ESA's \"distinct population segment\" language, identifying important salmon populations. The concept of evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) was introduced by NMFS to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA, identifying important groups of salmon populations. As of July 25, 2016, 28 ESUs of salmon and steelhead trout along the Pacific coast were listed as either endangered or threatened. The ESU concept was chosen for both policy and scientific reasons, as the stock level was not practical due to the large number of distinct stocks, and the full species level would not distinguish among different population segments. The question of whether hatchery fish may be assigned to an ESU has been controversial. Congress added the concept of experimental populations to the ESA in 1982 to reintroduce species to their historic range without severe land use restrictions. The concept of experimental populations was added to the ESA in 1982 by Congress to reintroduce species to their historic range without severe land use restrictions. To qualify as an experimental population, the release must be authorized by the service and geographically separate from other animals of the same species. The protected status of an experimental population is determined based on its risk of extinction, with special regulations under Section 4 of the ESA. Special regulations under Section 4 of the ESA apply to nonessential experimental populations, with rules for taking the species. No Section 7 consultation is needed for agency actions involving these populations unless they are in a national wildlife refuge or park. Critical habitat is not designated for nonessential experimental populations. The processes for delisting, uplisting, or downlisting a species are the same as listing processes, with decisions based solely on scientific and commercial data. The Secretary of the Interior can initiate status changes, or review species' status after a petition. Economic impacts are not considered in these decisions. The Secretary reviews species' status for listing changes based on scientific data without considering economic impacts. Critical habitat includes occupied and essential areas for conservation. Designation may be postponed if information is not determinable or publishing it would harm the species. The Secretary may choose not to designate critical habitat if it would harm the species or if information is not determinable. Critical habitat had been designated for 47.5% of listed domestic animal and plant species. Any area, federally owned or not, may be designated as critical habitat. Federal agencies must avoid adverse modification of critical habitat. The Secretary must base designation on the best scientific data available and consider economic impacts. The Secretary must consider economic impacts when designating critical habitat, and may exclude areas if the benefits outweigh the designation. Adverse modification of critical habitat is a concern for federal agencies, but private landowners also have restrictions on managing land. The ESA imposes restrictions on private land use primarily through the prohibition on taking listed species, with critical habitat designation only occasionally adding additional restrictions. P.L. 108-136 amended the ESA to prevent critical habitat designation on Defense Department lands with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans, considering national security and land benefits. The ESA restricts private land use by prohibiting taking listed species, with critical habitat designation occasionally adding more restrictions. P.L. 108-136 amended the ESA to prevent critical habitat designation on Defense Department lands with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans, considering national security and land benefits. The Secretary's determination for critical habitat designation must show a benefit to the lands and take national security into account. Designating critical habitat on military lands has been restricted for over 20 years due to concerns about interference with military activities. FWS prioritized critical habitat designation at the lowest level in its budget due to constraints, leading to criticism from conservation groups. FWS placed critical habitat designation at the lowest priority in its budget, citing budget constraints and the belief that it offers little additional protection for species. Conservation groups criticized the agency for not requesting increased funds for critical habitat designation and for imposing funding restrictions. FWS has been frequently sued for failing to designate critical habitat, with the agency consistently losing such suits. The agency views critical habitat requirements as a poor use of scarce resources, especially if the public perceives it as the main regulatory impact of the ESA. The designation of critical habitat may provide additional protection for listed species in the context of federal actions, but the FWS previously disagreed, stating that designated critical habitat does not offer extra protection as the jeopardy consideration would suffice. This conclusion was based on the regulatory definition of \"destroy or adversely modify\" critical habitat. The FWS previously believed that designated critical habitat did not offer extra protection as jeopardy consideration would suffice, based on the regulatory definition of \"destroy or adversely modify\" critical habitat. However, this definition was changed in February 2016 to focus more on the recovery goal of the ESA. The definition of \"destruction or adverse modification\" in the Act now emphasizes the focus on recovery for conservation of listed species. Recovery plans are required for listed species, but lack detail and are not binding. As of August 24, 2016, there were 1,156 recovery plans for U.S. species, and land can be acquired for conservation efforts using funds from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). The hortatory nature of recovery plans for U.S. species has faced criticism. As of August 24, 2016, there were 1,156 recovery plans in place. Land acquisition for conservation efforts can be funded through the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), which is primarily funded by receipts from offshore oil and gas leases. The ESA requires cooperation with states for conserving protected species and entering into cooperative agreements to assist states in their endangered species programs. States may receive federal funds for program implementation with a 25% matching amount required. The 1988 ESA amendments established a fund for state grants, including land acquisition and planning assistance, with an annual appropriation requirement. In FY2016, Congress allocated $53.5 million for cooperative efforts. The fund created for state grants, including land acquisition and planning assistance, requires annual appropriation. In FY2016, Congress allocated $53.5 million for cooperative activities with states and territories. Federal action agencies must complete a biological assessment if their actions may adversely affect a listed species. Consultation with FWS or NMFS is required to ensure actions do not jeopardize endangered species or critical habitat, known as a Section 7 consultation. A Section 7 consultation is required for federal actions that may harm endangered species or critical habitat. If the action is deemed harmful, the Secretary must suggest alternatives to avoid harm. The BiOp is issued based on the best available data. The Endangered Species Act requires a consultation for actions that may harm species or habitat. The BiOp must be based on the best available data and include alternatives to avoid harm. Consultations typically result in no jeopardy opinions or suggest reasonable alternatives for projects to proceed. Consultations should be completed within 90 days for federal actions, with the possibility of extension up to 150 days with reasons provided. The Endangered Species Act requires consultations for actions that may harm species or habitat. Consultations should be completed within 90 days for federal actions, with the possibility of extension up to 150 days with reasons provided. If no reasonable alternatives are feasible, the agency proposing the action must forego the action, risk penalties under the ESA, or obtain a formal exemption. Exemptions are available only for actions, not for species. The \"God Squad\" decides whether to allow the action to proceed despite future harm to a species. The Endangered Species Act requires consultations for actions that may harm species or habitat. Consultations should be completed within 90 days for federal actions, with the possibility of extension up to 150 days with reasons provided. Exemptions are available only for actions, not for species. The \"God Squad\" decides whether to allow the action to proceed despite future harm to a species, with specific federal officials and state representatives involved in the decision-making process. The President may exempt projects for repair or replacement of facilities in disaster areas under specified circumstances. To qualify for an exemption, federal agencies must have conducted consultations under the ESA, considered alternatives to avoid harm to species, and refrained from irreversible commitments of resources. The agency must avoid irreversible commitments of resources to qualify for an exemption under the ESA. The ESC will grant an exemption if no reasonable alternatives exist, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, the action is of regional or national significance, and no irreversible commitments have been made. Additional requirements are outlined in relevant regulations. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) outlines specific criteria for granting exemptions, including avoiding irreversible commitments of resources, regional or national significance of the action, and special provisions for international treaty obligations, national security, and presidentially declared disasters. The exemption process is complex and can take up to 280 days, with the applicant responsible for funding mitigation measures for the duration of the action. The rigorous process is deemed necessary as any exemption decision would jeopardize the continued existence of a species. The exemption process under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is rigorous and complex, lasting up to 280 days. The applicant must fund mitigation measures for the duration of the action, potentially forever. Exemptions apply to the action, not the species, so conservation efforts must continue. This can create challenges for governors balancing state interests and may not be sufficient to meet other statutory obligations. Parties may be reluctant to support actions that increase the risk of species extinction, especially if the benefits are minimal. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) exemption process is rigorous and complex, lasting up to 280 days. Agencies can modify actions to avoid jeopardizing species or habitats. Private parties can apply for permits for incidental take of species. Applicants must submit a habitat conservation plan showing impact mitigation measures. The Endangered Species Act requires an incidental take permit (ITP) applicant to submit a habitat conservation plan (HCP) detailing impacts, mitigation steps, funding, alternatives considered, and other required measures. The Act also includes provisions for exemptions, regulations on subsistence activities, interstate transport restrictions, and rules for establishing experimental populations. Various prohibited acts are listed, such as taking endangered species, possessing or selling unlawfully taken species, and violating regulations by FWS or NMFS. The Endangered Species Act prohibits taking, possessing, selling, or transporting unlawfully taken endangered species. Threatened species are also protected under similar regulations. Violations of the ESA can result in civil penalties, but exceptions exist for incidental take permits and cases where violations were made in good faith to protect oneself or others from harm. The Endangered Species Act allows for civil penalties for violations, with higher fines for knowing violators and business entities. Criminal violations may also apply. The Act includes provisions for enforcement, allowing individuals to bring lawsuits in federal court to enforce compliance. Litigation costs and attorneys' fees may be awarded to the prevailing party. Citizen suit provisions are a significant aspect of enforcing the ESA. The Endangered Species Act allows for civil penalties and enforcement through citizen suits in federal court. Litigation costs and attorneys' fees may be awarded to the prevailing party. Citizen suits have been instrumental in driving conservation efforts and challenging listing decisions for species at risk. The ESA also implements international agreements like CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention. The Endangered Species Act implements international agreements like CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention for the United States. CITES focuses on trade and species extinction risk, while the Western Hemisphere Convention aims to establish nature reserves and control wildlife trade. The ESA designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority. The Endangered Species Act designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority under CITES, with responsibilities for ensuring that international trade does not harm species. The Secretary also serves as the Management Authority for the United States under CITES, responsible for legal export and import of specimens. The ESA prohibits actions that harm endangered species. The Endangered Species Act designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority under CITES, responsible for ensuring legal international trade. The ESA prohibits actions harming endangered species. The ESA requires importers and exporters to obtain permission, keep records, and use designated ports. An Endangered Species Committee reached decisions on exemptions for Grayrocks Dam and the Platte River. The Endangered Species Committee granted an exemption for the Grayrocks Dam and Reservoir, imposing mitigation measures to protect whooping crane habitat. The Tellico Dam project faced opposition due to its impact on the snail darter fish. The Tellico Dam project on the Little Tennessee River faced opposition from various groups, including local landowners and Indian tribes, after the snail darter fish was listed as endangered. This led to litigation and the landmark Supreme Court case TVA v. Hill, which clarified the reach of the Endangered Species Act. Despite the Endangered Species Committee denying an exemption for the dam, Congress passed a law directing its completion. In 1992, the ESC granted exemptions for 13 Oregon timber sales in the habitat of the threatened northern spotted owl. Controversy surrounded these sales, leading to their withdrawal in the Clinton Administration. Additionally, there were applications for exemptions for the Pittston Company refinery in Eastport, ME, and the Consolidated Grain and Barge Company docking area in Mound City, IL. The Consolidated Grain and Barge Company applied for an exemption to build a docking area for barges in Mound City, IL, on the Ohio River, which was habitat for an endangered mussel. After a jeopardy opinion and denial of permits by the Army Corps of Engineers, the company withdrew the application in 1986. The Suwanee River Authority's project to dredge Alligator Pass in Suwanee Sound, Florida, home to the endangered manatee, was also denied a permit by the Army Corps of Engineers. The consulting engineer of the Authority applied for an exemption but lacked the authority to do so, leading to the withdrawal of the application in 1986."
