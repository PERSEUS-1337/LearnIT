    "content": "Prior to 1988, Medicaid did not cover services listed in a child's IEP/IFSP as special education funds were available. Congress changed the financing relationship between IDEA and Medicaid in 1988. IDEA requires interagency agreements to ensure services for eligible students, with Medicaid considered the first payer. Since 1988, Medicaid has been considered the first payer for services listed in a child's IEP/IFSP. However, states are not required to pay for these services according to CMS. Congress has addressed concerns about improper Medicaid payments for school-based services for IDEA children. The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) identified concerns with Medicaid school-based services, including improper payments in some states due to billing practices and lack of oversight. Bundled billing methods used by seven states did not account for variations in service needs and lacked documentation. Some school districts received little reimbursement due to state agencies and contractors retaining federal payments. Some school districts received minimal reimbursements for Medicaid services due to state agencies and contractors retaining federal payments. LEAs must meet four conditions to qualify for Medicaid reimbursement for IDEA-related services. The Medicaid reimbursement process for schools involves meeting specific conditions outlined in the state Medicaid plan or federal statute, including services listed in a child's IEP and authorization as a qualified Medicaid provider. Manuals issued by HCFA and CMS provide guidance on obtaining reimbursement for health services and administrative activities. In FY2006, nationwide Medicaid expenditures for school-based services totaled $2.7 billion, with 69% for benefits provided in schools and 31% for administration/training activities. In FY2006, Medicaid expenditures for school-based services totaled $2.7 billion, with 69% for benefits and 31% for administration/training activities. There was variation in spending patterns across states, with concerns raised about abuse and overpayments in Medicaid claims for services provided in schools. In FY2006, Medicaid expenditures for school-based services totaled $2.7 billion, with concerns about abuse and overpayments in Medicaid claims for services provided in schools. The HHS OIG and GAO have found inappropriate Medicaid billing practices in 22 states, including lack of verification for transportation services, billing for services not provided, and improper allocation of administrative costs. The Bush Administration published a final rule in 2007 regarding Medicaid payments for school-based administration and transportation, aiming to restrict federal payments for certain activities and services provided to children eligible for both Medicaid and IDEA. This rule was estimated to reduce federal Medicaid outlays by billions of dollars over a period of five years. The final rule published by the Bush Administration in 2007 aimed to restrict federal Medicaid payments for school-based administration and transportation, potentially saving billions of dollars over five years. Medicaid reimbursement would no longer cover certain administrative activities and transportation for school-aged children with an IEP or IFSP. The final rule published in 2007 aimed to restrict federal Medicaid payments for school-based administration and transportation for children with an IEP or IFSP. Many oppose these cuts, arguing that it will reduce access to needed healthcare and falsely assumes that school personnel activities are inconsistent with the proper administration of the state Medicaid plan. Additional federal funding to offset these cuts is unlikely. The final rule eliminates federal matching funds for certain school-based Medicaid spending, but other school-based expenditures are still reimbursable. States can claim federal matching dollars for school-based administrative activities conducted by state or local Medicaid agency employees. Federal funding remains available for administrative overhead costs related to direct medical services. Medicaid outreach and eligibility intake by Medicaid employees are also reimbursable. CMS will continue to reimburse states for school-based direct medical services under IDEA covered in approved state Medicaid plans, as well as transportation of school-age children to non-school-based medical service providers participating in Medicaid. The moratorium on restricting coverage or payments for school-based administration and transportation under Medicaid, in place since July 1, 2007, was extended to April 1, 2009. The moratorium on restricting coverage or payments for school-based administration and transportation under Medicaid, in place since July 1, 2007, was extended to April 1, 2009, and further extended to July 1, 2009, via the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This extension was estimated to cost $105 million in FY2009."
