Any State can enter into an agreement with the Secretary of Labor to provide temporary emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who have exhausted all regular compensation rights and are not receiving compensation from any other source. Temporary emergency unemployment compensation is available to individuals who have exhausted all regular compensation rights and are not receiving compensation from any other source. An individual is deemed to have exhausted their rights to regular compensation under a State law when no more payments can be made or when their rights have been terminated due to the expiration of the benefit year. The weekly benefit amount payable to an individual for total unemployment is equal to the amount of temporary emergency unemployment compensation. The weekly benefit amount for temporary emergency unemployment compensation is equal to the regular compensation amount under the State law for total unemployment. State law terms and conditions apply to claims for temporary emergency unemployment compensation, with a maximum limit set for individuals with established accounts. The maximum amount of temporary emergency unemployment compensation for individuals with established accounts shall not exceed the amount in the account. States can elect to trigger an extended compensation period for those who have exhausted regular benefits. SEC. 3. TEMPORARY EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACCOUNT. The agreement under this title establishes temporary emergency unemployment compensation accounts for eligible individuals, with the amount in the account being 13 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount. The account is reduced by any extended compensation received under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. The weekly benefit amount is the regular compensation payable to an individual for total unemployment in a week, including dependents' allowances. SEC. 4. PAYMENTS TO STATES HAVING AGREEMENTS FOR THE PAYMENT OF TEMPORARY EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION. Payments to states with agreements for temporary emergency unemployment compensation will be equal to 100% of the compensation paid to individuals. States will not receive payment if they are entitled to reimbursement under any other federal law. The amount payable to states will be determined by the Secretary in advance or as reimbursement based on estimated entitlements for each month. The Secretary will determine payments to states for temporary emergency unemployment compensation either in advance or as reimbursement, based on estimated entitlements for each month. Estimates may be adjusted for accuracy using agreed-upon methods between the Secretary and the State agency. SEC. 5. FINANCING PROVISIONS. Funds from the extended unemployment compensation account in the Unemployment Trust Fund are used to make payments to States with agreements under this title. The Secretary certifies payments to each State, and funds are transferred accordingly. Appropriations are made to assist States in covering administration costs of these agreements. Appropriations are made from the general fund of the Treasury to assist States in covering administration costs of agreements under this title. Amounts are appropriated without fiscal year limitation for payments under specific compensation categories, and repayment is not required. SEC. 6. FRAUD AND OVERPAYMENTS. Individuals who knowingly make false statements or fail to disclose material facts to receive emergency unemployment compensation they are not entitled to will be ineligible for further benefits and may face prosecution under federal law. They will also be required to repay the amount received to the State agency. If individuals receive emergency unemployment compensation they were not entitled to, the State may require repayment unless it was without fault on their part and repayment would be unfair. The State agency can recover the amount through deductions from future unemployment compensation within 3 years. The State agency can recover overpaid emergency unemployment compensation through deductions from future benefits, not exceeding 50% of the weekly amount, after a fair hearing process. Any determination can be reviewed in the same manner as under the State unemployment compensation law. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.
