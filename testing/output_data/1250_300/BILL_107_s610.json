    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Police Gun Buyback Assistance Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. Congress finds that decommissioned firearms from law enforcement agencies have been used in numerous crimes, including homicides, assaults, and drug-related offenses. Additionally, firearms sold by law enforcement agencies have been traced to crimes, such as a shooting near a playground. State and local law enforcement departments also resell confiscated firearms, including assault weapons, that were involved in crimes prior to the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. The purpose of this Act is to reduce the number of firearms on the streets by assisting State and local law enforcement agencies in eliminating the practice of transferring decommissioned firearms to any person. Law enforcement departments in various states have adopted the practice of destroying decommissioned firearms. The Attorney General may grant funds to States or local governments to purchase new firearms and destroy decommissioned firearms. Eligibility requires a law or policy to eliminate transferring decommissioned firearms to individuals, except for law enforcement agencies. Funds must be used solely for purchasing new firearms. To apply for a grant under this Act, the chief executive of a State or unit of local government must submit an application to the Attorney General with required information. The Attorney General will establish regulations within 90 days of the Act's enactment, outlining application requirements. SEC. 6. REPORTING.\n\nA State or unit of local government must report to the Attorney General within 2 years of receiving funds under this Act on its implementation. The report should include budget assurances for future firearm purchases by law enforcement agencies without needing to transfer decommissioned firearms.\n\nSEC. 7. DEFINITION.\n\nDefines \"decommissioned firearm\" as a firearm no longer in use by law enforcement or confiscated in a crime and no longer needed for evidence. \"Firearm\" and \"person\" have standard legal definitions.\n\nSEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for this Act is set at $10,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2001 to 2005."
