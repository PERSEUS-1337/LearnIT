    "content": "The Act titled \"Fairness for Small Business and Employees Act of 1998\" is also known as the \"Truth in Employment\" Act. It includes findings related to employment practices. Congress finds that trust and civility in labor-management relationships are crucial for a productive workplace and economy. The tactic of \"salting\" by union organizers has evolved into aggressive harassment, threatening the balance of collective bargaining rights. Organizers are increasingly seeking employment with nonunion employers to organize employees or harm competitors. Employers should not discriminate based on employees' views on collective bargaining, but should have the right to expect job performance. Employers should not discriminate against employees based on their views on collective bargaining, but they have the right to expect job applicants to be focused on furthering the goals of the business. The purposes of this title are to preserve the balance of rights between employers, employees, and labor organizations, protect workers' rights to organize, and prevent pressure on employers to hire individuals who disrupt the workplace. SEC. 103. PROTECTION OF EMPLOYER RIGHTS. Amends Section 8(a) of the National Labor Relations Act to clarify that employers are not required to hire individuals who seek employment primarily to further another employment or agency status. This does not affect the rights of bona fide employee applicants to self-organization, join labor organizations, bargain collectively, or engage in concerted activities for mutual aid or protection. TITLE II--FAIR HEARING\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds that bargaining unit determinations require case-by-case adjudication for accuracy. The National Labor Relations Board has a history of holding hearings to certify single location bargaining units. A blanket rule limiting factors considered in unit appropriateness undermines labor relations stability.\n\nSEC. 202. PURPOSE.\n\n    This title aims to ensure the National Labor Relations Board conducts a thorough analysis to determine the appropriateness of single location bargaining units based on all relevant facts.\n\nSEC. 203. REPRESENTATIVES AND ELECTIONS. SEC. 203. REPRESENTATIVES AND ELECTIONS. Amends the National Labor Relations Act to require a hearing to determine the appropriateness of a bargaining unit that includes employees from multiple facilities of an employer. Factors considered include functional integration, centralized control, common skills, and bargaining history. Congress finds that small businesses and labor organizations face disadvantages when dealing with actions from the National Labor Relations Board. The Equal Access to Justice Act has not effectively helped level the playing field. Due to the Board's greater expertise and resources, certain small entities should be awarded fees and costs when they prevail against the Board. The purpose of this title is to ensure that small businesses and labor organizations are not deterred from seeking review or defending against actions brought by the National Labor Relations Board. The purpose of this title is to ensure that small businesses and labor organizations are not deterred from seeking review or defending against actions brought by the National Labor Relations Board. It aims to reduce the disparity in resources and expertise between small entities and the Board, and make the Board more accountable by awarding fees and costs to small entities when they prevail against the Board. SEC. 302 amends the National Labor Relations Act by adding a new section regarding awards of attorneys' fees and costs. Sec. 20 outlines the conditions under which an employer or labor organization with specific size and financial criteria can be awarded fees and expenses as a prevailing party in administrative and court proceedings under certain circumstances. Sec. 20 states that a party meeting specific size and financial criteria can be awarded fees and expenses in civil actions against the Board, regardless of the justification of the United States' position. SEC. 303 of the National Labor Relations Act specifies that the provisions regarding agency and court proceedings apply to cases initiated after the enactment of the Act."
