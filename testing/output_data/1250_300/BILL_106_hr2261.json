    "content": "The \"Health Insurance Affordability and Equity Act of 1999\" is a new section in the Internal Revenue Code that provides a credit for health insurance costs of previously uninsured individuals and individuals with COBRA coverage. The Health Insurance Affordability and Equity Act of 1999 allows a tax credit of 60% for individuals who pay for qualified health insurance coverage for themselves, their spouse, and dependents. The credit is subject to monthly limitations based on the type of coverage - $1,200 for self-only coverage and $2,400 for family coverage. The taxpayer is eligible for a tax credit if they have family coverage under qualified health insurance. An eligible month is defined as a month that is at least 1 year after the individual was eligible for or participated in a group health plan that provided qualified health insurance. In the case of a joint return, both spouses must have eligible months. The tax credit eligibility for family coverage under qualified health insurance requires eligible months for each spouse separately. Amounts paid for coverage are not considered if the individual is covered under specific medical care programs. Married individuals not filing joint returns must meet certain criteria. Married individuals not filing joint returns must meet specific criteria to determine the limitation on the tax credit based on adjusted gross income. The tax credit limitation based on adjusted gross income is calculated by comparing the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income to a specified dollar amount, with any excess over the dollar amount divided by $10,000. Modified adjusted gross income includes adjustments from certain exclusions. Any resulting amount not divisible by $10 is rounded down. The applicable dollar amount varies based on the taxpayer's health insurance coverage. The applicable dollar amount for tax credit limitation is $60,000 for coverage of more than 1 individual and $30,000 for other cases or married individuals filing separately. Qualified health insurance is defined as medical care excluding certain provisions related to long-term care insurance contracts. The text discusses the exclusion of coverage provided under group health plans and certain other insurance contracts from the definition of qualified health insurance. It also addresses the treatment of continuation coverage under COBRA as qualified health insurance and includes special rules for coordination with other deductions. The text outlines special rules for the tax credit for qualified health insurance, including coordination with other deductions and denial of credit to dependents. It also mentions an inflation adjustment for dollar amounts in subsection (c)(3) starting after 2000. Starting in 2000, dollar amounts in subsection (c)(3) will increase annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment for that year. Amounts will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $100.
