Congress finds that the Trade Act of 1974 allows the US Trade Representative to enforce rights under trade agreements. The Uruguay Round Agreements Act states that section 301 determinations are based on World Trade Organization findings. A panel report confirmed that section 301 is consistent with US obligations under the Uruguay Round Agreements. The Trade Act of 1974 allows the US Trade Representative to enforce rights under trade agreements. A panel report confirmed that section 301 is consistent with US obligations under the Uruguay Round Agreements. Mexico violated its commitments under the Uruguay Round Agreements by issuing a revised antidumping threat determination to evade compliance with a panel report. On September 20, 2000, Mexico attempted to evade compliance with a panel report by issuing a revised antidumping threat determination. Despite a ruling by a panel and the Appellate Body, Mexico failed to comply with its obligations under the World Trade Organization. On January 1, 2002, Mexico imposed a discriminatory 20 percent tax on soft drinks containing high fructose corn syrup to evade the Dispute Settlement Body's determinations. This tax aimed to continue Mexico's antidumping order on US high fructose corn syrup by restricting market access. Mexico lifted its antidumping order on high fructose corn syrup on April 20, 2002, only after implementing the discriminatory tax. Mexico lifted its antidumping order on high fructose corn syrup after imposing a tax on soft drinks to prevent US imports. This move allowed Mexico to claim compliance with trade dispute findings. The 20 percent tax on high fructose corn syrup further restricts imports from the US. The import restrictions of Mexico's antidumping order led to a 20 percent tax on high fructose corn syrup, causing a significant drop in imports from the United States. The US has exhausted proceedings under the Dispute Settlement Understanding, with adverse findings adopted by the Dispute Settlement Body against Mexico. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like Appellate Body, Dispute Settlement Body, Dispute Settlement Panel, Dispute Settlement Understanding, GATT 1994, and Uruguay Round Agreements.

Enforcement of US rights under trade agreements regarding high fructose corn syrup exports to Mexico. Congress determines that Mexico's imposition of a 20 percent tax on soft drinks containing high fructose corn syrup and the extension of an unjustified antidumping order on high fructose corn syrup from the United States unjustifiably burdens or restricts US commerce, denying rights under existing trade agreements. The United States Trade Representative will take action if Mexico does not eliminate its tax on soft drinks with high fructose corn syrup and preserve US rights under trade agreements. A certification must be submitted within 30 days of the Act's enactment stating Mexico's compliance. If certification is not made, action will be taken within 60 days. The United States Trade Representative will take action if Mexico does not comply with trade agreements regarding high fructose corn syrup.
