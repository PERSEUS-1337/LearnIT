    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section 1260 in the Internal Revenue Code, addressing gains from constructive ownership transactions. The new section 1260 in the Internal Revenue Code deals with gains from constructive ownership transactions. If a taxpayer has gain from such a transaction that would be long-term capital gain, it will be treated as short-term capital gain to the extent it exceeds the net underlying long-term capital gain. Additionally, there will be an interest charge on deferral of gain recognition if gain is treated as short-term capital gain. The taxpayer's tax for a taxable year with capital gain under subsection (a)(1) will increase by interest under section 6601. This interest applies to the due date for the tax return and underpayments for prior years if the gain was included in income during the ownership transaction period. Any amount due is considered in computing interest deductions. No credits can offset the tax increase. The taxpayer's tax for a taxable year with capital gain will increase by interest under section 6601. This interest applies to the due date for the tax return and underpayments for prior years if the gain was included in income during the ownership transaction period. Any amount due is considered in computing interest deductions. No credits can offset the tax increase. Financial position refers to any position with respect to stock, debt instrument, partnership interest, or investment trust interest. Constructive ownership transaction occurs if the taxpayer holds a long position under a notional principal contract with respect to the same. The taxpayer may enter into a constructive ownership transaction by holding a long position under a notional principal contract, entering into a forward or futures contract, being the grantor of a put and holder of a call with substantially equal strike prices, or engaging in other transactions with similar effects. This section does not apply to positions marked to market. The section provides exceptions for positions marked to market and defines terms like long position, forward contract, and related person. The section defines terms like forward contract and related person, and explains the concept of net underlying long-term capital gain in constructive ownership transactions. It also states that the net underlying long-term capital gain will be treated as zero unless proven otherwise, and provides an exception for taxpayers who elect to mark their positions to market. If a taxpayer elects to mark their financial position to market, they will recognize gain or loss on any open constructive ownership transaction as if it were sold at fair market value at the end of the taxable year. Any subsequent realized gain or loss will be adjusted accordingly. Any gain or loss from a constructive ownership transaction is treated as ordinary income or loss. If gain or loss is recognized before the end of the taxable year, it will be treated as ordinary income or loss. An election under this provision can be made without the Secretary's consent and applies to the current and future taxable years unless revoked. An election under this provision can be made without the Secretary's consent and applies to the current and future taxable years unless revoked. The Secretary shall prescribe regulations necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. The amendments made by this section apply to gain recognized after the date of the enactment of this Act."
