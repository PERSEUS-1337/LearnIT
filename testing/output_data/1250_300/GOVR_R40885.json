    "content": "H.R. 3962, Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, is based on H.R. 3200. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would reduce federal deficits by $109 billion over 10 years and insure 96% of the non-elderly population by 2019. The total cost of the coverage provisions is projected to be $1.052 trillion. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, would cost $1.052 trillion for Medicaid expenditures and tax credits for small employers. The net cost of coverage provisions over 10 years is estimated to be $891 billion. The bill aims to reduce the number of uninsured, restructure the private health insurance market, set minimum health benefit standards, provide financial assistance, and raise revenues. H.R. 3962 aims to reduce the number of uninsured by restructuring the private health insurance market, setting minimum standards for health benefits, and providing financial assistance. It includes requirements for individuals to maintain health insurance and for employers to provide insurance or pay a payroll assessment. Market reforms such as modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal would be implemented. Acceptable health insurance coverage would need to meet required minimum standards and incorporate the market reforms outlined in the bill. The Exchange would be established under a new independent federal agency. The Exchange, established under a new federal agency, would offer private plans and a public option. Subsidies for individuals below 400% of the federal poverty level would be available only through the Exchange. Plans in the individual market could be grandfathered indefinitely with no changes. A Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan program would encourage the creation of health insurance cooperatives. Dental and vision care plans would not be affected. The bill aims to encourage the creation of member-run health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange, without affecting dental or vision care plans. Revenues would be raised by limiting employer deductions and modifying tax-advantaged accounts. The report provides background information on the private insurance market and summarizes key provisions of H.R. 3962 affecting private health insurance. The provisions effective prior to 2013 are outlined in the table in the Appendix. H.R. 3962 includes provisions to change how private health insurance markets operate, focusing on individuals buying coverage directly or through small employers. Insurers would be required to cover individuals regardless of pre-existing conditions to prevent adverse selection. America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) has expressed concerns about the impact of reform on insurers' ability to guard against adverse selection. The private health insurance provisions in H.R. 3962 aim to prevent adverse selection by excluding preexisting conditions and requiring individuals to purchase coverage. Adequate premium subsidies may be necessary to make the individual mandate practical, and the removal of one provision could hinder the implementation of others. The private health insurance provisions in H.R. 3962 include individual and employer mandates, private health insurance market reforms, immediate reforms, Health Insurance Exchange with public option, subsidies, CO-OP Program, revenue provisions, and other provisions like abortion and end-of-life care. Americans obtain health insurance through various methods, including employment-based coverage, private insurance, or publicly funded programs like Medicare or Medicaid. In 2008, 60% of the U.S. population had employment-based health insurance, with employers choosing to offer coverage either through insurance or self-funding. Approximately 46 million Americans were uninsured in 2008, with individuals and employers purchasing health insurance in the large group, small group, or nongroup market segments. Large employers, who make up more than 95% of the market, enjoy lower premiums due to economies of scale and a larger risk pool. Large employers have a more attractive insurance package than small employers and individuals seeking nongroup coverage due to economies of scale and a larger risk pool. States have experimented with creating a single site for comparing insurance plans, with some models proving more sustainable. Private-sector companies also help individuals and small groups compare health insurance plans. Less than half of small employers offer health insurance coverage. Small employers face challenges in offering health insurance due to cost concerns and limited ability to spread risk. Factors such as being medically underwritten, lacking market power, and economies of scale contribute to this issue. Allowing small firms to purchase insurance through a larger pool could help lower premiums for high-cost employees. Small employers have limited market power and economies of scale, making it difficult to negotiate benefits and rates with insurance carriers. Purchasing insurance through a larger pool could lower premiums for high-cost employees. State and federal regulations impact the private health insurance market, with reforms affecting premiums based on age, health, and behaviors. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act requires small group coverage to be sold on a guaranteed issue basis. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates guaranteed issue coverage for small groups (2-50 employees) in all states. Some states also require guaranteed issue policies for self-employed individuals and non-HIPAA eligible individuals. Most states have premium rating rules for small group and individual markets, ranging from pure community rating to adjusted community rating. Only New Jersey and New York use pure community rating in their nongroup markets. Adjusted community rating allows premium variation based on factors such as age or gender, while prohibiting pricing based on health factors. Rate bands limit premium differences based on health within a specified range set by the state. Federal law mandates limits on excluding coverage for preexisting conditions in group health plans. In January 2009, 21 states had rules providing additional consumer protection in the small group market. In January 2009, 21 states in the small group market had rules providing additional consumer protection regarding preexisting condition exclusion. In the individual market, as of December 2008, 42 states limited the period for excluding coverage for preexisting health conditions. There is a debate about whether a publicly sponsored health insurance plan should be part of insurance market reform, with proponents arguing it could be less expensive and increase competition. Some argue that a public health insurance plan could offer more choice and competition by potentially lowering provider payments and premiums. However, opponents fear it could give the government an unfair advantage and drive private plans out of the market. Studies have shown that non-profit health insurance organizations may perform better in terms of quality compared to for-profit organizations. Non-profit health maintenance organizations (HMOs) have been found to score higher on quality measures compared to for-profit organizations. Studies show that health insurance co-operatives, a subset of non-profit plans, have performed well in case studies. Advocates suggest incentivizing the creation of new health insurance co-operatives to invest earnings back into lower premiums, cost-sharing, and innovative programs. As of 2008, 47% of private health plan enrollment was in non-profit organizations, but there are relatively few health insurance co-operatives in the US. Advocates propose incentivizing the creation of health insurance co-operatives to reinvest earnings into lower premiums, cost-sharing, and innovative programs. Opponents argue that co-operatives have not been successful nationwide and may not make health insurance more affordable. Some provisions of the bill would take effect before January 1, 2013, including prohibiting postretirement reductions in retiree health benefits and allowing individuals to keep COBRA coverage until the Exchange is operational. The bill prohibits postretirement reductions in retiree health benefits and allows individuals to keep COBRA coverage until the Health Insurance Exchange is established. A temporary national high-risk pool program would provide health benefits to eligible individuals until the Exchange is operational. Health insurance issuers must provide rebates if their coverage has a medical loss ratio below a specified level. Individuals up to age 26 can remain on their parents' plans. Premium increases must be justified to the Secretary and states before implementation. The bill aims to reduce pre-existing condition lookback periods, shorten benefit exclusion periods, and prohibit domestic violence from being considered a pre-existing condition. It also mandates coverage for congenital disorders, prohibits lifetime benefit limits, and limits insurance policy rescissions. Additionally, a temporary reinsurance program would assist employment-based plans with health benefit costs. H.R. 3962 includes a mandate for most individuals to have health insurance, with penalties for noncompliance. Individuals must maintain acceptable coverage under various health plans or face an additional tax. The bill also establishes a temporary reinsurance program to assist employment-based plans with health benefit costs. Individuals who do not maintain acceptable health insurance coverage may face an additional tax, calculated based on their income or the national average premium. Some individuals may receive subsidies to help with premium costs. Certain groups are exempt from the mandate, including nonresident aliens and those with religious exemptions. Employers are required to offer health coverage or contribute a set amount under H.R. 3962. H.R. 3962 mandates employers to offer individual and family health coverage or contribute to the Exchange, with exceptions. Employers must contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost plan offered, prorated for part-time employees. Current plans are grandfathered for five years before needing to meet essential benefits package requirements. Employers must contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost plan offered, prorated for part-time employees. They would automatically enroll employees in the plan with the lowest premium unless the employee opts out. Employers must provide written notice and information to show compliance with health participation requirements. The Secretary of HHS could terminate an employer's election to provide health insurance. Employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 that do not offer coverage would face an 8% excise tax. Employees can choose to decline employer-provided coverage and enroll in an Exchange plan, with potential responsibility for the full premium. Beginning in 2014, employers with wages over $750,000 would be assessed 8% of average wages for employees who decline qualifying coverage. Employers with aggregate wages above $750,000 would be assessed 8% of average wages for employees who decline qualifying coverage. This payroll assessment would not apply to employees covered as spouses or dependents in an Exchange plan. Full-time employees opting for Exchange coverage over employer-provided coverage would be responsible for 100% of the premium. Small businesses may be eligible for a 50% credit towards employee health coverage costs for up to two years, phased out as average compensation and number of employees increase. The proposed legislation offers a 50% credit towards small businesses' share of qualified employee health coverage costs for up to two taxable years. The credit would phase out as average employee compensation increases from $20,000 to $40,000 and as the number of employees increases from 10 to 25. Highly compensated employees with compensation exceeding $80,000 would not be eligible for the credit. Adjustments for inflation would be applied, and the credit would be part of the general business credit, available only to businesses with a tax liability. Non-profit organizations would be ineligible for the small business credit. Additionally, the legislation would establish new federal health insurance standards for qualified health benefits plans (QHBPs), including market reforms applicable to QHBPs. The bill specifies new health plan standards for qualified health benefits plans (QHBPs), including market reforms like prohibiting coverage exclusions for pre-existing conditions and requiring guaranteed issue and renewal. The bill requires health plans to be offered on a guaranteed issue and renewal basis, with premiums determined using adjusted community rating rules. Premiums can vary based on age, premium rating area, and family enrollment. H.R. 3962 allows premiums to vary based on age, premium rating area, and family enrollment. It imposes new non-discrimination and adequacy standards for insurers' networks of providers. The bill also requires coverage to offer the option of keeping dependent children under 27 on the family's policy, prohibits cost-sharing on preventive services, limits annual out-of-pocket spending, and prohibits annual and lifetime benefit limits on covered health care items and services. H.R. 3962 mandates QHBPs to cover specific benefits, limit out-of-pocket spending, comply with network standards, and offer an essential benefits package. It requires new individual policies to be Exchange plans from 2013 onwards and existing group plans to meet QHBP standards by 2018. Existing nongroup policies can be grandfathered with no changes, and states can form Health Care Choice Compacts for cross-state insurance sales. The Health Care Choice Compacts would allow states to facilitate the sale of individual health insurance plans across state lines. The Secretary would work with the NAIC to develop guidelines for these compacts, with coverage subject to the laws of one primary state. Grants would be available for states to regulate health insurance coverage in secondary states. QHBPs must cover essential benefits, limit out-of-pocket spending, comply with network standards, and be equivalent to employer health plans in 2013. The essential benefits package for QHBPs must cover a range of services including hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, prescription drugs, mental health services, preventive services, maternity care, and durable medical equipment. Compliance with network standards and equivalence to employer health plans in 2013 is also required. The essential benefits package for QHBPs includes preventive services, vaccines, maternity care, well baby and child care, oral health, vision, hearing services, durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and related supplies. The annual out-of-pocket limit in 2013 would be $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family. Cost-sharing levels would be established using copayments, covering an average of 70% of health care claims. Plans offered through the Exchange could have less cost-sharing or richer benefit packages as Enhanced, Premium, and/or Premium-Plus plans. Employer plans would have flexibility in offering employee cost-sharing. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee (HBAC) would recommend coverage details for plans offered through the Health Insurance Exchange, including benefits, cost-sharing levels, and updates to the essential benefits package. The Committee would consider innovation in healthcare, reducing health disparities, and public input in its recommendations. The Secretary would review HBAC's recommendations within 45 days. H.R. 3962 would federalize private health insurance standards and create a Health Insurance Exchange to facilitate the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) by individuals and small businesses. The Secretary would be required to adopt benefit standards within 18 months based on HBAC recommendations or propose an initial set if necessary. The Exchange would provide access to insurers' plans without being an insurer itself. The Health Insurance Exchange, established under H.R. 3962, would facilitate the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans by individuals and small businesses. It would not be an insurer but provide access to insurers' plans, similar to how Travelocity or Expedia operate. The Exchange would also negotiate with plans, oversee requirements, determine eligibility, and administer premium credits. Startup and operating costs would be covered by a Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund funded by taxes on individuals without coverage, penalties for non-compliant employers, and payroll assessments. The Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund, funded by taxes on individuals without coverage, penalties for non-compliant employers, and payroll assessments, would support the establishment of state-based Exchanges. Only one Exchange could operate in a state, with the Commissioner approving state-based Exchanges meeting specified criteria. State-based Exchanges would receive federal matching grants, and existing Exchanges could transition to the new system. The Commissioner would presume the Exchange meets required standards and work with states to establish a process. New nongroup coverage could only be obtained through the Exchange starting in 2013. Public health insurance option and income-based credits would be available through the Exchange. CBO estimated 30 million people would have Exchange coverage by 2019. Individuals could be eligible for Exchange coverage unless enrolled in certain group plans. Individuals would be eligible for Exchange coverage unless enrolled in group plans through a full-time employee, Medicare, or Medicaid. Once enrolled in an Exchange plan, eligibility continues until no longer enrolled. An annual open-enrollment period would be offered, with special enrollment periods for specific circumstances. Exchange-eligible employers could meet requirements by offering and contributing towards employees' enrollment. Employees can choose from available Exchange plans. Employers can become Exchange-eligible by offering and contributing towards employees' enrollment. They can choose any available Exchange plans. The eligibility criteria for employers to participate in the Exchange vary based on the number of employees. Exchange plans must meet federal requirements and have standardized cost-sharing options. The Exchange plans for insurance must meet federal requirements and have standardized cost-sharing options. Plans are categorized into Basic, Enhanced, Premium, and Premium-Plus tiers based on the level of cost-sharing for benefits in the essential benefits package. Premium-Plus plans offer additional benefits like adult oral health and vision care. The Premium-Plus plans in the service area offer additional benefits such as adult oral health and vision care. Plans must adhere to cost-sharing levels specified by the Secretary for each tier, with a 10% variation allowed. State requirements for benefits beyond the essential package apply to Exchange plans if the state reimburses for any net increase in premium credits. H.R. 3962 establishes a public health insurance option through the Exchange, available to all eligible individuals with income-based credits. The public option through the Exchange would offer Basic, Enhanced, Premium, and Premium-Plus plans. Geographically adjusted premiums would be set to cover costs, with limited start-up funding repaid within 10 years. The Secretary would negotiate payment rates for providers, ensuring they are not lower than Medicare rates and not higher than average rates. Insolvency would result in the public option being prohibited from receiving federal funds. The public option would set payment rates for health care providers and services, ensuring they are not lower than Medicare rates and not higher than average rates. Providers could opt out, with physicians able to participate as preferred or non-preferred providers. The Secretary could use innovative payment methods and implement payment and delivery system reforms under the public option. The public option allows for innovative payment methods, including bundling of services and performance-based payments. The Secretary can implement successful payment and delivery system reforms from other parts of the Act. Administrative functions include determining payment amounts, making payments, and provider education. Enrollment in the public option is voluntary. The bill proposes a voluntary public option for health insurance through Exchange plans, where individuals, including Members of Congress, can choose to enroll. Those opting for the Exchange plan would be responsible for 100% of the premium. Additionally, the bill includes a provision for the establishment of not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange, with $5 billion authorized for grants and loans from 2010 to 2014. The bill authorizes $5 billion for grants and loans from 2010 to 2014 for not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange. Conditions for receiving grants and loans include being a not-for-profit member organization, not offering insurance before July 16, 2009, having ethical standards, not being sponsored by a state government, offering QHBPs through the Health Insurance Exchange, and being licensed in each state. The cooperative, funded by grants and loans, issues QHBPs through the Health Insurance Exchange. It must be governed by a majority vote of its members and operate with a strong consumer focus. Profits are used to lower premiums or improve benefits. Priority is given to cooperatives operating statewide or with significant financial support. Failure to comply with program terms results in repayment of funds plus interest. Individuals eligible for premium credits under H.R. 3962 may also qualify for cost-sharing subsidies. These subsidies are available for Basic plans in 2013 and 2014, but individuals can upgrade to Enhanced or Premium plans in 2015, with additional premiums to be paid. Exchange-eligible individuals can receive subsidies towards their health insurance costs. Beginning in 2015, individuals eligible for credits could obtain an Enhanced or Premium plan under H.R. 3962. Exchange-eligible individuals could receive a credit in the Exchange if they meet certain criteria, including income levels and not being enrolled in other health coverage. The premium credit is based on what is considered an \"affordable premium amount\" for individuals to pay. The employer offers health insurance with a premium credit based on an affordable amount relative to individuals' income. The Commissioner adjusts percentages to maintain government versus enrollee premium ratios. The affordability premium credit is calculated based on the difference between the enrollee's premium and the affordable amount or the reference premium and the affordable amount. Premium percentage limits are established for individuals based on family size. The Commissioner would establish premium percentage limits on a linear sliding scale based on family income tiers. Affordable premium credits are calculated monthly, with assistance available for cost-sharing. The Commissioner would specify reductions in cost-sharing amounts and annual out-of-pocket maximums under a Basic plan to align with actuarial values for each income tier. The House bill includes provisions to raise revenues for expanded health insurance coverage, such as limiting employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. Table 4 outlines these provisions, their effective dates, and estimated revenue over a 10-year period. The House bill includes provisions to raise revenues for expanded health insurance coverage by limiting employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. Employers providing prescription drug coverage to retirees eligible for subsidy payments from the federal government would be required to coordinate the subsidy and deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage under H.R. 3962. The House bill requires employers to coordinate the subsidy and deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage, reducing the deduction by the federal subsidy amount. This provision is expected to raise $2.2 billion over 10 years. Tax-advantaged accounts like FSAs, HSAs, HRAs, and MSAs for health care spending will be affected by the revenue provisions in H.R. 3962. FSAs are employer-established plans that reimburse employees for health care expenses on a pre-tax basis. The House bill affects tax-advantaged accounts like FSAs and HSAs for health care spending. FSAs are funded through employee salary reduction and have an average contribution of $1,350. H.R. 3962 proposes limiting annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per person starting in 2013. HSAs allow individuals to fund medical expenses on a pre-tax basis and can be rolled over. Distributions from HSAs for qualified medical expenses are not taxable, but non-qualified distributions are subject to taxes and penalties. H.R. 3962 proposes increasing the penalty on non-qualified distributions from HSAs to 20% and modifying the definition of qualified medical expenses to exclude over-the-counter medications unless prescribed by a physician. These changes are estimated to raise $1.3 billion and $5.0 billion over 10 years, respectively. Additionally, the bill addresses state laws regarding abortion coverage and funding. H.R. 3962 would increase revenues by $5.0 billion over 10 years. It prohibits discrimination against health care entities that do not provide, pay for, or refer for abortions. The bill also restricts the recommendation of abortion-related standards in the essential benefits package. H.R. 3962 prohibits discrimination against health care entities that do not provide, pay for, or refer for abortions. The Stupak Amendment adds additional restrictions on the use of funds for abortions under the bill. The Stupak Amendment adds restrictions on the use of funds for abortions under H.R. 3962, allowing separate supplemental coverage for elective abortions to be purchased with nonfederal funds only. Premiums for this coverage cannot be paid with funds authorized by H.R. 3962 or with affordability credits. The Stupak Amendment in H.R. 3962 allows nonfederal QHBP offering entities to provide separate supplemental coverage for elective abortions, but it must be paid for with funds not authorized by the bill. Additionally, Exchange plans cannot discriminate against healthcare providers unwilling to provide or cover abortions. States can receive incentive payments for enacting alternative medical liability laws compliant with the bill. States can receive incentive payments for enacting alternative medical liability laws compliant with the bill. The law must be effective in improving the medical liability system, encouraging error disclosure, and maintaining access to affordable insurance. It should include an early offer system or certificate of merit program, without limiting attorneys' fees or imposing damage caps. The bill proposes an early offer system for claimants to receive payment of economic losses and legal fees within 180 days of filing a claim. If the offer is declined and litigation proceeds, the standards of misconduct and proof are raised. A certificate of merit program is required for medical malpractice suits, and states can receive incentive payments for enacting compliant laws. The bill does not provide funds for incentive payments but clarifies that it does not modify state legal standards. The bill authorizes incentive payments for early offer system in medical malpractice cases, clarifies no funds provided for payments, requires dissemination of end-of-life planning information by QHBPs, and prohibits promotion of suicide or hastening of death."
