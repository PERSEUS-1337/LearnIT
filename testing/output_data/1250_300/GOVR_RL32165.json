    "content": "China maintained a fixed exchange rate of 8.28 yuan to the U.S. dollar from 1994 to July 21, 2005. The Chinese central bank controlled the peg by buying or selling dollar-denominated assets to balance demand for the yuan. This policy prevented the yuan from fluctuating based on economic factors. However, in the later years of the peg, economic conditions changed, and the yuan would likely have appreciated if it had been floating. The Chinese government announced a shift to a more market-based exchange rate system on July 21, 2005. The Chinese government modified its currency policy on July 21, 2005, allowing the yuan's exchange rate to be adjustable based on market supply and demand. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the yuan was immediately adjusted from 8.28 to 8.11, appreciating by about 2.1%. The yuan is now allowed to fluctuate daily against a basket of currencies, but remains not fully convertible in international markets. China continues to tightly control capital transactions, resulting in a \"managed float\" where market forces determine the yuan's movement direction, but the government intervenes to slow its appreciation. Since July 2005, China has allowed the yuan to appreciate steadily but slowly, accumulating foreign reserves rapidly. The yuan has risen 16% against the dollar, leading to concerns about the falling dollar's impact on the U.S. economy. Total U.S. exports are growing rapidly, while the growth rate of imports from China has slowed. The yuan's gradual appreciation since 2005 has raised concerns about the falling dollar's impact on the U.S. economy. Despite the increase in yuan value, China remains hesitant to make significant changes to its currency policy. This paper reviews the economic issues surrounding China's currency policy, including concerns from the U.S., China's fixed exchange rate regime, U.S.-China trade imbalance factors, and the economic consequences for both countries. China's accumulation of foreign reserves and U.S. debt purchases are also discussed. The U.S.-China trade imbalance is influenced by China's currency policy, which many believe is significantly undervalued, leading to cheaper Chinese exports and a growing U.S. trade deficit. This has negatively impacted U.S. production and employment in various manufacturing sectors. Policymakers are exploring options to induce China to reform its currency policy, including legislative measures in Congress. The U.S.-China trade imbalance is influenced by China's undervalued currency, impacting U.S. production and employment in manufacturing sectors. Analysts urge the Bush Administration to pressure China to revalue its currency or allow it to float freely. President Bush and officials criticize China's currency policy, advocating for market-determined exchange rates. The Administration initially sought to encourage China to reform its financial system instead of applying direct pressure. The Bush Administration initially sought to encourage China to reform its financial system instead of applying direct pressure on China to abandon its currency peg. The Administration's stance on China's currency policy toughened in April 2005, with growing complaints from Members of Congress leading to the introduction of currency bills. Schumer proposed a tariff on Chinese goods if China didn't appreciate its currency. Senate Republicans negotiated to allow a vote on a similar bill later. Supporters of the bill threatened to bring it up for a vote in 2006 but were convinced not to by officials. Significant events included a 4.1% increase in import prices from China in April 2008. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 4.1% increase in import prices from China in April 2008, the largest 12-month increase since December 2003. The U.S. Census Bureau noted a 1.8% rise in U.S. imports from China in the first three months of 2008 compared to 2007. The Bank of China reported an exchange rate of 7.00 yuan to the dollar, appreciating by 15.9% since July 2005. China's foreign exchange reserves reached $1.68 trillion in March 2008. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) was launched in September 2007 with $200 billion in capital, investing $5 billion in Morgan Stanley in December 2007. China stated it had no plans to sell off its dollar assets in August 2007. In response to concerns over currency manipulation, China announced the elimination of regulations requiring firms to convert foreign exchange holdings into yuan. The IMF clarified currency manipulation as policies affecting exchange rates to increase net exports. In May 2007, a Section 301 petition was filed over China's currency practices. The IMF must deliver clear policy messages to members. In May 2007, a Section 301 petition was filed over China's currency practices, but the USTR declined it in June 2007. The Treasury Department reports annually on exchange rate policies of countries with large surpluses and trade with the US, looking for currency manipulation. China has been cited for manipulating its currency multiple times. Since 1994, China has not been designated as a currency manipulator, but the Treasury Department has increased its focus on China's currency policy and reforms. The November 28, 2005 report praised China's currency reforms but noted that China had not fully implemented its commitment to make its exchange rate mechanism more flexible. The Treasury Department's report criticized China for not fully implementing its commitment to a more flexible exchange rate mechanism. Despite assurances from Chinese officials, the new managed float regime still appeared to be a tightly managed currency peg against the dollar. China's central bank heavily intervened in currency markets, keeping the yuan significantly undervalued. However, China was not cited as a currency manipulator under U.S. trade law. The Treasury Department's reports criticized China for its undervalued currency and called for accelerated appreciation of the RMB. Many Members have been critical of Treasury's decision not to cite China as a currency manipulator despite its interventions in currency markets. Calls have been made for legislation to revise the criteria used for determining currency manipulation. Chinese officials argue that their currency policy is not aimed at favoring exports or discouraging imports, but rather to maintain economic stability and investor confidence. They believe that abandoning the current currency peg to the dollar could lead to an economic crisis and harm export industries undergoing reforms. Additionally, concerns about rural unrest due to income disparities have also been expressed. Chinese officials are concerned about rising unrest in rural areas due to income disparities and government land seizures. They argue that appreciating the currency could lower farmers' income and lead to tensions. They also believe that a fully convertible currency could strain the underdeveloped banking system, citing the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis as an example. China's currency policy was influenced by the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. Chinese officials considered reforming their currency policy but decided to maintain a currency peg to ensure stable economic growth. US officials urged China to make the currency more flexible by allowing faster appreciation of the yuan and decreasing intervention in currency markets. Fixed exchange rates have a historical precedent, including the Bretton Woods system. Understanding China's currency policy starts with how a fixed exchange rate works. China's currency policy was influenced by the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, leading to a decision to maintain a currency peg for stable economic growth. This system operated similarly to the Bretton Woods system, where the Chinese central bank controlled the yuan-dollar exchange rate through buying or selling currency. This fixed exchange rate contrasted with a floating exchange rate system, like the one the United States has with the Euro area, where market forces determine the exchange rate. The central bank maintains a fixed exchange rate by adjusting the supply of currency to meet market demand. Changes in economic circumstances can lead to the need for the central bank to increase or decrease foreign exchange reserves to maintain the peg. This process is necessary to restore equilibrium when the relative demand for a country's currency shifts. The central bank adjusts foreign exchange reserves to maintain a fixed exchange rate by meeting market demand. Excess demand for yuan led to an increase in reserves through buying dollars. The central bank holds U.S. financial securities to maintain the peg. Since July 2005, China has been rapidly accumulating foreign reserves, becoming the world's largest holder by 2006. Foreign reserves grew from $75 billion in 1995 to $1.53 trillion in 2007. The yuan has appreciated by about 16% to 7 yuan per dollar by April 2008, moving towards a \"managed float\" system. Since July 2005, the yuan has appreciated steadily, reaching 7 yuan per dollar by April 2008. The current situation is a \"managed float\" where market forces determine the yuan's movement, but government intervention slows its appreciation. China's rapid foreign reserves accumulation suggests a need to prevent rapid yuan appreciation against the dollar for trade financing and currency stability. China's rapid accumulation of foreign reserves has outpaced GDP and imports growth in recent years. The nature and composition of China's reserves, particularly the share held in U.S. assets, remain undisclosed. It is unclear how much of the increase in reserves is due to new accumulations, valuation changes, exchange rate effects, or reinvestment of earnings. The real exchange rate, not the nominal exchange rate, influences economic activity, including imports and exports. The difference in overall price level increases between the United States and China from 1994 to 2003 suggests a need for currency stability to prevent rapid yuan appreciation against the dollar for trade financing. The real exchange rate, not the nominal exchange rate, affects imports and exports. China's inflation led to divergence in exchange rates from 1994 to 1997, making exports more expensive. By 2003, the yuan's value had risen, bringing it close to its 1998 level in real terms. Appreciation in the nominal exchange rate has contributed to this trend. The yuan has been expensive since 1997, with its value rising. In the long run, real exchange rates return to their market value whether fixed or floating. If the demand for Chinese goods increases, the yuan would appreciate if floating, leading to a trade balance adjustment. With a fixed exchange rate, price adjustment takes time to return to market value, affecting trade surplus with the United States. The trade surplus with the United States persists due to the relatively inexpensive Chinese imports and expensive U.S. imports. This surplus, along with net remittances, equals the capital flowing from China to the U.S. The Chinese central bank's accumulation of dollar reserves increases the supply of yuan, leading to inflation. As prices rise, exports become costlier abroad, and imports cheaper, eventually returning the trade surplus to equilibrium. Undervaluing a fixed exchange rate does not provide a lasting competitive advantage for exporters and import-competing industries. When a country undervalues a fixed exchange rate, it does not give a lasting competitive advantage to its exporters and import-competing industries. Floating exchange rates adjust more quickly to equilibrium than fixed rates. Using monetary policy to influence currency value limits the ability to counteract changes in the business cycle. Pegging a currency would prevent lowering interest rates to offset economic downturns, leading to capital outflows and pressure on the currency peg. This loss of monetary autonomy is less significant for small countries tied to large neighbors with shared business cycles. China maintains some monetary autonomy despite its fixed exchange rate by using capital controls. The currency is convertible for trade transactions but not for financial flows. Chinese enterprises must exchange foreign currency for yuan, and foreign exchange purchases are regulated, limiting capital outflows. This allows China to retain flexibility over its monetary policy. China maintains monetary autonomy through capital controls, requiring Chinese enterprises to exchange foreign currency for yuan. Foreign exchange purchases are regulated, limiting capital outflows and allowing flexibility in monetary policy. The yuan's undervaluation estimates vary, with some suggesting it may be more or less undervalued currently. Estimates of the yuan's undervaluation are based on two main methods: the \"fundamental equilibrium exchange rate\" and the \"purchasing power parity\" methods. The fundamental equilibrium exchange rate method calculates how much the exchange rate must change to achieve a balanced current account, but this approach is controversial among economists. Ernest Preeg estimated that the yuan was undervalued by 40% in 2003, based on rule-of-thumb estimates. He observed that the increase in Chinese foreign exchange reserves equaled 100% of the trade surplus less net foreign direct investment in 2002, suggesting the trade surplus would be zero without the reserves. Preeg also noted that a 1% decline in the dollar leads to a $10 billion decline in the US trade deficit, indicating a 40% decline in the dollar would be needed to eliminate the deficit. The Institute for International Economics estimated that the yuan was 15%-25% undervalued in 2003. They argued that the current account surplus should be reduced by $50 billion to return to equilibrium, which would leave China with a deficit of 1%-1.5% of GDP. They believed that a large revaluation was necessary to achieve this reduction in the surplus. The Institute for International Economics estimated that the yuan was 15%-25% undervalued in 2003 and argued for a $50 billion reduction in the current account surplus to reach equilibrium, resulting in a 1%-1.5% GDP deficit for China. They emphasized the need for a significant revaluation to achieve this reduction due to the extensive use of imports in Chinese exports. Goldman Sachs Economic Research Group estimated a 9.5%-15% undervaluation of the yuan and suggested that a current account deficit equal to Foreign Direct Investment could be achieved with a 9.5%-15% revaluation. Based on estimates by Virginie Coudert and Cecile Couharde, China could achieve equilibrium with a 9.5%-15% revaluation, leading to a current account deficit equal to Foreign Direct Investment. Their analysis suggests China has an underlying current account deficit of 1.5%-2.8% of GDP, with the yuan being 44%-54% undervalued against the dollar in 2003. These estimates are not based on econometric models but on simple rules. The estimates of the yuan's undervaluation are not based on econometric models but on simple rules of thumb. The main source of contention is the definition of an \"equilibrium\" current account balance, with authors using their own opinions and assumptions. Changing the assumed equilibrium balance can significantly impact the estimated undervaluation. Some economists argue that the current account balance would always be close to zero in equilibrium, but this neglects the fact that countries with different saving and investment rates may willingly lend to and borrow from one another for long periods of time. The Preeg, IIE, and Goldman Sachs estimates use an assumption of equilibrium less favorable to China than the current account balance, calling for balance only in official and portfolio borrowing while still allowing for foreign direct investment inflows. Their estimate of China's overall \"equilibrium\" current account position is actually a deficit, leading to larger estimates of the yuan's undervaluation. If China had chosen balance as their equilibrium benchmark instead of a deficit, estimates of the yuan's undervaluation would have been smaller. Capital controls and net FDI inflows require China to increase foreign reserves to prevent net foreign indebtedness. Determining the equilibrium current account balance in China is challenging due to capital controls. If capital controls were eliminated, the economic situation would change significantly. If capital controls were eliminated in China and the currency floated, the economic situation would change entirely. The equilibrium market exchange rate would be equal to the current fixed rate if private citizens lent as much to the United States as the Chinese central bank is currently lending. It is uncertain whether China would be a net borrower or lender if their currency floated and capital controls were abolished, given their high national saving and investment rates. China's high internal saving rate may allow it to finance its investment without running a current account deficit. Foreign reserve accumulation should not be seen as proof of undervaluation. Some argue that the yuan is overvalued, and revaluing it could reduce the overall U.S. trade deficit. The FEER approach suggests that the yuan is overvalued, aiming to reduce the unsustainable U.S. trade deficit. It argues that the dollar is incorrectly valued against most trading partners. The Coudert and Couharde estimate shows the yuan is 54% undervalued, based on the dollar being 35% overvalued in 2003. The sustainability of the trade deficit is debated, with no widely accepted theoretical approach indicating it is unsustainable in the near future. The U.S. trade deficit is not deemed unsustainable in the near future, as evidenced by its duration, lack of impact on economic growth, and absence of significant dollar declines. Even if China reduced its trade deficit with the U.S., other countries could still lend to the U.S., potentially widening other bilateral deficits. It is uncertain if China should bear a \"fair share\" of reducing the U.S. trade deficit, as countries can have varying trade balances with different partners. The U.S. trade deficit is not considered unsustainable, as it has not affected economic growth or led to significant dollar declines. Even if China reduced its trade surplus with the U.S., other countries could still lend to the U.S., potentially widening other bilateral deficits. International experience suggests that China may still run a bilateral trade surplus with the U.S., similar to other East Asian countries that have maintained high saving rates. Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, many East Asian countries have run large current account surpluses, indicating a challenging environment for developing world borrowing. The current economic environment is not conducive to developing world borrowing, with several countries in the region having large foreign exchange reserves and current account surpluses. China's current account balance is not out of line with its neighbors, and estimates show its currency may be undervalued. The Economist's Big Mac Index estimated China's currency was undervalued by 56% in February 2007, but relying too heavily on this index has drawbacks. The Economist's Big Mac Index estimated that China's currency was undervalued by 56% in February 2007. However, relying heavily on this index has drawbacks as it compares the price of a Big Mac in China and the United States, which may not accurately reflect purchasing power parity due to non-tradeable factors. The Big Mac Index suggests that purchasing power parity should determine currency value, but it has limitations in accurately reflecting real-world economic conditions. Despite attempts to adjust for discrepancies, PPP estimates are unreliable for short-term exchange rate predictions. Additionally, the index may not reflect changes in trade deficits over time. Economist Jeffrey Frankel argues that income level can be regressed on the exchange rate using a cross-sample of countries to find a predictable relationship between a country's income level and its equilibrium exchange rate based on PPP. He estimates that China's exchange rate was undervalued by 36% in 2000, with speculations of increased undervaluation since then. Coudert and Couharde made a similar calculation for 2003, estimating the yuan to be undervalued by 41%-51%. Frankel acknowledges caveats to this analysis, including the long-term nature of PPP, the influence of financial flows on exchange rates, and the need for gradual adjustments to avoid economic disruption. The regression analysis on income levels and exchange rates explains 57% of the data variation. Gradual exchange rate adjustments are recommended to prevent economic disruption. The \"Balassa-Samuelson\" effect predicts that as countries become richer, their exchange rates will appreciate. Using income levels as a proxy for productivity growth differences can lead to inaccurate results. Another proxy, the consumer price index to producer price index ratio, estimated the yuan to be 18% undervalued in 2003. The consumer price index to producer price index ratio is used as a proxy to estimate the undervaluation of the yuan in 2003. Different studies show varying degrees of undervaluation, ranging from 18% to 47%. However, there are concerns about the accuracy of this proxy for China due to non-market determined consumer prices and restrictions on labor and capital mobility. Some studies replicate these findings but note that the estimates lack statistical significance. The yuan is believed to be undervalued, but estimates lack statistical significance and robustness. Adjusting for serial correlation and adding explanatory variables in the PPP model results in smaller undervaluation estimates. Changes in the model, such as time period or sample omission, greatly affect the estimate. The Treasury Department's report in December 2006 discusses the use of economic models to estimate currency misalignment. The report on exchange rates discusses using economic models to estimate currency misalignment and fair market exchange rates. Treasury advises focusing on serious misalignments, using real effective exchange rates, utilizing multiple models, and considering empirical data and market-based reasons for misalignment. Critics question the undervaluation of the yuan due to lack of statistical significance and robustness in estimates. Treasury points out that most models estimate equilibrium exchange rates based on trade flows, but in reality, financial flows play a significant role. Critics argue that China's undervalued currency gives them an unfair advantage in trade, citing the U.S.-China trade imbalance. However, bilateral trade balances are influenced by structural factors and exchange rates. Despite a large trade surplus with the U.S., China actually had a small surplus with the rest of the world in 2007. The yuan's undervaluation against the dollar does not necessarily mean it is undervalued against other currencies, as China runs deficits with other countries. In 2007, China had a small trade surplus with the world excluding the United States. Despite the undervaluation of the yuan against the dollar, China had deficits with countries like Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. The U.S. trade deficit with China has been rising, but U.S. exports to China have also increased significantly. China became the third largest U.S. export market in 2007, with a growing level of imports coming from export-oriented multinational companies. China's growing level of imports, contributing to the U.S. trade deficit, is largely from export-oriented multinational companies, particularly from East Asia. The share of China's exports produced by foreign-invested enterprises has significantly increased over the years, reaching 57.1% in 2007. Similarly, FIEs accounted for 58.5% of China's imports in 2007, importing raw materials and components for assembly in China before exporting the final products. This pattern results in trade deficits with East Asian countries and surpluses with countries like the United States. China's trade deficit with East Asian countries and trade surpluses with countries like the United States are influenced by the country's role as a production platform for foreign companies. Foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) play a significant role in China's trade, with a sharp rise in FDI leading to increased exports to the United States. This trend could impact the bilateral trade deficit independently of the exchange rate regime. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in China surged from $1.9 billion in 1986 to $74.8 billion in 2007, mainly going to export-oriented manufacturing. The U.S. trade deficit with China grew rapidly in the early 1990s, coinciding with a significant increase in FDI and exports by Foreign-invested Enterprises (FIEs). FIEs have a minimal impact on China's overall trade balance as they import nearly 80% of what they export. By 2007, China became the largest foreign supplier of computer equipment to the U.S., surpassing Japan. China's ranking fell to 4th in computer equipment shipments, with a 7.0% share in 2007. China was the largest foreign supplier to the U.S., with a 51.5% share. The increase in Chinese computer production is attributed to foreign companies moving manufacturing facilities to China. An undervalued yuan benefits China's export industries and attracts foreign investment, particularly from U.S. firms. An undervalued currency in China benefits export industries and attracts foreign investment, particularly from U.S. firms. However, it also makes imports more expensive, hurting Chinese consumers and non-exporting Chinese firms that rely on imported goods. This policy may impede the efficient allocation of resources in the Chinese economy in the long run. A revaluation of the yuan could reduce aggregate spending in China by raising imports and reducing exports, potentially helping to prevent inflation in an overheating economy. Some argue that revaluing the yuan could help the Chinese economy by preventing inflation and promoting stable economic growth. However, others believe that the undervalued yuan is absorbing underemployed labor in rural China and that revaluation could be disruptive. Critics also point out that China's currency policy limits the government's ability to use monetary policy effectively, leading to an economy overly dependent on fixed investment and exports, potentially undermining the banking system's financial stability. The undervalued yuan in China may be undermining the banking system by increasing easy credit and risky loans. Low interest rates restrict banks from regulating investments effectively, leading to overproduction in some sectors. Large foreign exchange reserves could help move towards a convertible currency but also have opportunity costs. China's large foreign exchange reserves could be used for development needs like infrastructure, education, and bank recapitalization. Accumulating reserves may make the yuan cheaper, impacting exports and causing a rise in the U.S. trade deficit in the short run. In the short run, U.S. exports and production of goods competing with Chinese imports decrease, affecting the manufacturing sector. This leads to a rise in the U.S. trade deficit and reduced aggregate demand. China is a major supplier of labor-intensive consumer goods to the U.S., causing concern for industries like machine tools, hardware, and furniture due to growing competition. The undervalued Chinese currency may further impact these industries. An undervalued Chinese currency affects various industries in the U.S. by reducing output and competitiveness. U.S. producers import capital equipment and inputs from China, benefiting from lower prices. The undervalued yuan also leads to increased U.S. product output and competitiveness in global markets. Additionally, U.S. borrowers benefit from Chinese investments in U.S. assets, allowing for more capital investment in plant and equipment. Chinese investments in U.S. assets, particularly in U.S. Treasury securities, lead to increased capital investment in plant and equipment. This influx of capital from China lowers U.S. interest rates, benefiting both private firms and households. China held $397 billion in U.S. Treasury securities as of September 2007, making it the second largest foreign holder after Japan. China's significant holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, totaling $397 billion as of September 2007, make it the second largest foreign holder after Japan. If the U.S. trade deficit with China were eliminated, it would impact the flow of Chinese capital into the U.S., potentially leading to higher interest rates for U.S. Treasuries. This could increase the government's interest payments, contributing to a higher budget deficit. An undervalued yuan from China can benefit the U.S. by lowering import prices, increasing consumption of both imported and domestically produced goods. This can improve the terms-of-trade and increase the purchasing power of U.S. consumers in the long term. The undervalued yuan from China can benefit the U.S. by increasing the purchasing power of consumers in the long term. The rise of the yuan may impact the price of Chinese products sold in the U.S., with import prices from China increasing. Critics argue that the low value of the yuan has affected the U.S. manufacturing sector, leading to job losses. The U.S. manufacturing sector has lost 2.7 million factory jobs since July 2000, but there is no clear link between job losses and imports from China. Manufacturing output is at an all-time high, with employment falling due to productivity growth. The overall trade deficit is increasing, and there is a long-term trend of moving employment away from manufacturing towards the service sector. This trend is driven by changing technology and comparative advantage, rather than the Chinese currency issue. The trend of shifting manufacturing abroad is driven by changing technology and comparative advantage, rather than the Chinese currency issue. Alan Greenspan stated that an undervalued yuan does not significantly impact manufacturing activity and jobs in the United States. An undervalued yuan does not significantly impact manufacturing activity and jobs in the United States. It leads to a shift in U.S. production towards firms benefiting from lower interest rates due to Chinese capital inflows. This shift does not affect aggregate U.S. employment in the medium or long run, but there may be short-term consequences. The trade deficit with China has widened, but overall unemployment has decreased. The gains and losses from the trade deficit will not be evenly distributed across regions and sectors of the economy. In the long run, a shift in U.S. output towards firms benefiting from Chinese capital inflows may lead to temporary declines in aggregate spending and employment. This could result in a decrease in the inflation rate, which may be concerning if the economy is already sluggish. However, government macroeconomic policy adjustments and market forces can help compensate for any output decline in the trade sector. Ultimately, the economy would benefit from a larger capital base and higher productivity, although U.S. citizens would not directly enjoy the returns from Chinese-owned capital. In the long run, a shift in U.S. output towards firms benefiting from Chinese capital inflows may lead to temporary declines in aggregate spending and employment. This could result in a decrease in the inflation rate, which may be concerning if the economy is already sluggish. However, government macroeconomic policy adjustments and market forces can help compensate for any output decline in the trade sector. Ultimately, the economy would benefit from a larger capital base and higher productivity, although U.S. citizens would not directly enjoy the returns from Chinese-owned capital. The size of the economy would be larger in the long run due to capital inflow/trade deficit, leading to higher productivity and wages for U.S. workers. The United States has high productivity growth and strong economic fundamentals but low household saving rates, leading to a negative government saving rate. This results in foreigners financing profitable investments in the US, causing a trade deficit. In contrast, China has a much higher saving rate and lower consumption rate. China also has a higher rate of investment compared to the US. China maintains a higher rate of gross fixed investment as a percent of GDP than the United States (42.8% versus 20.0%) and has a gross national saving of 118% compared to 68% in the US. This results in China having a current account balance of 9.0% of GDP, while the US has a -6.2% balance. Both countries would need to adjust their saving/investment patterns to reduce the US trade deficit and China's trade surplus in the long run. Some analysts believe China is moving towards boosting consumer spending to address this issue. The Treasury Department's November 2005 report on International Economic and Exchange Rate Policies noted China's commitment to sustainable domestic growth by modernizing the financial sector. Concerns remain about China's shift from exports to consumption for GDP growth and the US reliance on foreign financing due to low saving rates. Economists prioritize the overall trade deficit over bilateral balances, emphasizing the need for adjustments in saving/investment patterns to reduce trade imbalances in the long run. The United States has a trade surplus with the Netherlands and Austria, despite both countries using the euro. Concerns arise from the low saving rate in the US, leading to heavy borrowing from China and other countries. The dollar has depreciated against various currencies, which could potentially disrupt the economy. Economists fear a sudden plummet in the dollar's value due to the unsustainably large trade deficit. Some economists worry about the possibility of a sudden and severe depreciation of the dollar, leading to dislocations in the U.S. economy. This could occur due to the unsustainably large trade deficit, causing net debt to foreigners to grow without bounds. The adjustment may happen rapidly if investors realize significant dollar depreciation is inevitable and flee dollar assets. While this scenario is seen as highly unlikely, it could have significant costs to the economy, so it may be worth guarding against. Central banks in China and other developing countries have helped prevent rapid depreciation of the dollar since 2002. The dollar's stability since 2002 is due to central banks in China and other developing countries accumulating foreign reserves to prevent rapid depreciation. If these countries stop intervening in currency markets, the dollar could significantly decline, potentially triggering a currency crisis. The United States may need to pressure China for further exchange rate reforms to avoid this scenario. The United States could pressure China for currency reforms to prevent a potential currency crisis. Options include making the yuan fully convertible, allowing appreciation, reducing intervention in currency markets, and financial sector reforms for greater flexibility. Members of Congress are frustrated with the Treasury Department's failure to label China as a currency manipulator, which could increase pressure on China to reform its currency. Members of Congress are frustrated with the Treasury Department's failure to designate China as a currency manipulator, as it could increase pressure on China to reform its currency. Bills in Congress aim to identify \"fundamentally misaligned currencies\" and cite countries for manipulation regardless of intent, potentially leading to China's designation. The bills in Congress aim to increase pressure on China to reform its currency by potentially designating it as a currency manipulator. The U.S. government could persuade China through direct negotiations to change its exchange rate policy, as they believe it is detrimental to China's economy and global growth. Various high-level talks have been utilized to encourage China to adopt policies promoting domestic consumption and currency reforms. The United States has used high-level talks to urge China to adopt policies promoting domestic consumption and currency reforms. China's currency policy has been a major topic in discussions, with pressure from the US to make the currency more flexible. The US could build consensus within the G-7 to put more pressure on China to reform its currency policy. The United States could build consensus within the G-7 to pressure China to reform its currency policy, or persuade China to engage in talks with other East Asian economies to reach an exchange rate consensus. Another option is to involve the International Monetary Fund to help China understand the risks of over-relying on exports and promote balanced economic growth. The U.S. government could pressure China to reform its currency policy by threatening trade sanctions. Legislation like H.R. 1002 proposes additional tariffs on Chinese imports unless their currency appreciates. Proponents believe such measures have been effective in the past, while opponents argue it may violate WTO rules and backfire. Some proposals seek to impose sanctions on China's currency policy to encourage reform without violating WTO rules. The United States could file a case with the WTO against China's currency peg, potentially leading to trade sanctions if China does not comply. If the DSB ruled in favor of the United States, it would direct China to modify its currency policy to comply with WTO rules. The advantage of using the WTO is a multilateral approach, but there is no guarantee of a ruling in favor of the United States. The U.S. could initiate a Section 301 case to respond to foreign trade barriers, including violations of U.S. rights under a trade agreement. Failure to use WTO dispute resolution procedures could lead to China filing a WTO case against the United States. The Bush Administration rejected Section 301 petitions on China's exchange rate policy in 2004, despite efforts by U.S. groups and Members of Congress. In 2007, House Members filed another petition over China's currency practices, but the USTR declined it. Legislation has been proposed to require U.S. officials to bring a case against China over its currency policy. H.R. 321, H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 796, S. 1607, and S. 1677 propose measures to address China's currency policy through U.S. officials. Commerce Department imposed countervailing duties on Chinese products in 2007. The Commerce Department imposed countervailing duties on certain imported Chinese coated free sheet paper products in 2007, ranging from 11 to 20%. Legislation such as H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 364, and S. 796 aims to apply U.S. countervailing laws to non-market economies and address China's currency policy as a form of export subsidy. Critics argue that determining the subsidy level from China's currency manipulation would be challenging for possible U.S. countervailing measures. Members argue that proposed legislation aligns with WTO rules, allowing countervailing duties. Critics raise concerns about determining subsidy levels from China's currency manipulation and potential challenges in the WTO. U.S. antidumping laws aim to address undervalued yuan impacting export prices, with bills like H.R. 2942 and S. 1607 proposing adjustments to antidumping duties based on currency misalignment. Critics question the feasibility of accurately valuing currencies and the compatibility of this approach with WTO trade remedy rules. The United States could potentially utilize safeguard provisions under U.S. trade remedy laws to impose restrictions on imported Chinese products causing market disruption to domestic producers. This option has been used in the past to limit textile and apparel imports from China. The Bush Administration has invoked the China textile safeguard to restrict imports, reaching an agreement with China in 2005. However, relief under the safeguard has not been extended to various industries. Proposed bills would consider China's exchange rate misalignment in market disruption determinations. Some analysts caution against pressuring China on its currency policy, suggesting a more comprehensive trade strategy instead. Some analysts argue that U.S. policymakers should address China's currency policy as part of a comprehensive trade strategy to accelerate economic reforms and address U.S. complaints. U.S. officials have urged China to boost domestic consumption and make its currency policy more flexible. Key concerns include market access, protection of intellectual property rights, and subsidization of Chinese state-owned enterprises. The United States has a legal process within the WTO to seek compliance with trade agreements, giving it leverage to push for economic liberalization in China. The United States has leverage through WTO commitments to push China to liberalize its economy and open its markets. Concerns have been raised about China's large holdings of U.S. federal debt and the potential use of it as a political tool. China has been suggested to have the power to make the dollar collapse by liquidating its U.S. Treasuries holdings if trade sanctions are imposed to force a yuan revaluation. China could potentially make the dollar collapse by selling off its U.S. Treasuries holdings as a bargaining chip in response to trade sanctions. U.S. policymakers, including Senator Charles Grassley, expressed concern and sought clarification from the Chinese government. China reassured that it had no plans to drastically adjust its foreign reserves structure and emphasized its responsible investment approach. China's U.S. government securities are crucial in its foreign exchange reserves. Liquidating these assets would impact the dollar's value but is unlikely. The launch of China Investment Corporation aims to manage reserves better and diversify investments. The Chinese government launched the China Investment Corporation (CIC) to manage its foreign exchange reserves, initially managing over $200 billion. There are concerns about diversifying away from dollar-denominated assets, potentially affecting U.S. interest rates. If the yuan appreciates, it could boost U.S. exports and lead to a decline in the U.S. bilateral trade deficit. This shift would require U.S. borrowers to find new lenders, causing interest rates to rise. If the Chinese central bank stops purchasing U.S. assets to maintain the peg, U.S. borrowers will need new lenders, leading to higher interest rates. This could reduce spending on interest-sensitive purchases and investment, impacting the U.S. economy. Analysts fear a sudden decline in Chinese demand for U.S. assets could destabilize the economy. Rising inflation in the U.S. could also lead to import price increases if the yuan appreciates. The floating exchange rate could lead to a depreciation if demand for Chinese goods falls, causing inflationary pressures. China's capital controls prevent a large private capital outflow, which could impact the U.S. trade deficit and borrowing from China. If the United States were to shift to private citizens buying U.S. assets instead of the Chinese central bank, it could lead to a reduction in output for U.S. exporters and import-competing firms, causing the bilateral trade deficit to expand. China could try floating its exchange rate while maintaining capital controls to prevent currency depreciation due to private capital outflow. Another option is to maintain the status quo, allowing the real exchange rate to adjust over time as inflation rates diverge between the two countries. The real exchange rate would adjust as inflation rates diverged between the two countries, causing the U.S. bilateral trade deficit to decline. However, this adjustment would take time, and pressures on the U.S. trade sector would persist. China's high saving rate and the U.S.'s low saving rate contribute to their trade imbalances. Even with a floating exchange rate, China's exports to the U.S. are likely to continue growing due to low-cost labor and productivity gains. China's low-cost labor and productivity gains have been reducing export prices in yuan terms, leading to continued export growth to the United States. Despite the significant appreciation of the yuan since 2005, the trade deficit has not decreased. U.S. policymakers are concerned about China's currency policy due to the growing trade deficit, decline in manufacturing employment, and China's economic rise. Economists believe that if China's currency were allowed to float, it would likely appreciate against the dollar initially. However, the failure of the trade deficit to fall in response to the yuan's appreciation suggests other factors are at play. The failure of the bilateral trade deficit to decrease despite the yuan's appreciation suggests other factors are at play. There is debate over the potential effects of further yuan appreciation on the U.S. economy, as it may benefit some sectors while harming others. The trade deficit with China has not hindered the U.S. from achieving full employment, and various factors, such as productivity growth and shifts to the service sector, also impact manufacturing employment. It is unclear to what extent production has shifted to China from the U.S. or other low-wage countries. Foreign multinational corporations' involvement in China's exports further complicates the issue of who benefits from China's trade. The debate over the implications of China's trade and the effects of an appreciating yuan on the U.S. economy continues. Chinese officials plan to gradually make the currency more flexible and eventually adopt a floating currency. There is considerable debate over policy options that would promote U.S. economic interests, as changes to the current system would have winners and losers in both countries. Chinese officials plan to gradually make the currency more flexible and eventually adopt a floating currency. However, the current currency policy may be undermining efforts to reform the banking system and reduce non-performing loans. The rising money supply could lead to easy credit policies and more non-performing loans, with limited bank loan restrictions mainly due to government directives. China's currency policy acts as a de facto subsidy, benefiting some export industries while undermining others. China's currency policy acts as a de facto subsidy, benefiting some export industries while undermining others. U.S. officials believe that China's exchange rate reforms are overly cautious and preventing adjustments in global trade imbalances, which could eventually undermine world economic growth. Both countries agree that China needs major economic reforms to boost domestic consumption, while the U.S. must increase domestic saving. China plans to boost economic development in the hinterland and increase spending on social security, health care, and education, but this will take time to implement. China officials aim to boost economic development in the hinterland and increase spending on social security, health care, and education. Proposed currency legislation in the 110th Congress on China's currency policy includes bills that would require the Treasury Department to determine if China manipulated its currency, impose tariffs on Chinese products if manipulation is found, and file a WTO case against China over its currency policy. The proposed currency legislation in the 110th Congress aims to address government subsidies and currency manipulation by non-market economies like China. The bills would establish new methodologies for estimating subsidy benefits, make exchange rate misalignment actionable under U.S. countervailing law, and impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods unless China stops manipulating its currency. Additionally, the legislation would apply countervailing laws to non-market economies, factor in undervalued currency when determining antidumping and countervailing duties, and include currency misalignment in safeguard measures on Chinese imports causing market disruption. The proposed currency legislation in the 110th Congress aims to address government subsidies and currency manipulation by non-market economies like China. H.R. 2942 (Tim Ryan) and S. 364 (Rockefeller) would apply countervailing laws to nonmarket economies, make undervalued currency a factor in determining antidumping and countervailing duties, and require action in the WTO if consultations fail to resolve currency issues. S. 1607 (Baucus) would require Treasury to identify fundamentally misaligned currencies and take priority action if appropriate policies are not adopted within 180 days. The proposed currency legislation in the 110th Congress aims to address government subsidies and currency manipulation by non-market economies like China. If the designated country fails to adopt appropriate policies within 180 days, the U.S. would take measures such as making currency undervaluation a factor in determining antidumping duties, banning federal procurement from the country, and requiring U.S. officials to oppose multilateral financing. The Treasury Department would be required to identify currency manipulators and submit an action plan to end manipulation, with the authority to file a case in the WTO. The proposed currency legislation in the 110th Congress aims to address government subsidies and currency manipulation by non-market economies like China. S. 2813 (Bunning) would require the Treasury Department to identify currency manipulators, submit an action plan to end manipulation, and consult with the IMF. Several bills were introduced in the 109th Congress to deal with foreign exchange rate policies, including S.Amdt. 309 (Schumer) to S. 600 imposing a tariff on Chinese goods if currency manipulation continued. In the 109th Congress, Senator Schumer pushed for consideration of bill S. 295 to address China's currency reforms. Despite delays and assessments of China's seriousness in reforming its currency policy, Schumer remained disappointed with China's progress and requested the Senate to take up the bill. Senator Schumer pushed for bill S. 295 to address China's currency policy, but later postponed the vote to give more time for negotiations with China. H.R. 3283 aimed to apply U.S. countervailing laws to non-market economies like China and required the Treasury Department to define currency manipulation. The bill passed in July 2005, and a similar bill was introduced in the Senate as S. 1421."
