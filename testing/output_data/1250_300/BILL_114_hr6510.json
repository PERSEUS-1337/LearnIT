    "content": "The \"Save the Children Act of 2016\" is the short title of this Act. Congress expresses its sense through this Act. Congress acknowledges the humanitarian crisis faced by Syrian children due to the civil war and supports the temporary relocation of up to 25,000 young Syrian minor children refugees to the United States over three years. The Act supports the relocation of up to 25,000 young Syrian child refugees to the United States over three years. Efforts should be made by relevant authorities to reunite or relocate these children back to Syria once the civil war violence decreases. The Save the Children Program is established under Section 3 of the Act to support the relocation of young Syrian child refugees to the United States. Efforts will be made to reunite or relocate these children back to Syria once the civil war violence decreases. The Save the Children Program grants visas for young Syrian children aged three to ten to enter the US until civil war violence in Syria decreases. A grace period of six months is given before visas expire to reunite children with their families. Only children with established guardians present or orphaned are eligible for visas. An Office of Coordination is established in the Office of Refugee. The Save the Children Program grants visas for young Syrian children aged three to ten to enter the US until civil war violence in Syria decreases. A Coordinator is established in the Office of Refugee Resettlement to oversee the program's operations in the United States. The Coordinator has the authority to appoint additional personnel as needed. The Coordinator in the Office of Refugee Resettlement can appoint additional personnel, including private citizens or federal employees detailed from other departments, to assist in carrying out duties under the Act. The Coordinator will utilize the staff and resources of the Division of Unaccompanied Children's Services. The Coordinator in the Office of Refugee Resettlement is responsible for identifying qualifying young minor children for the Program, obtaining custody or establishing orphan status, and facilitating their temporary resettlement in the United States. They work with approved organizations and government authorities to implement the Program in accordance with relevant laws and agreements. The Coordinator collaborates with approved organizations and government authorities to implement the Program and assist those admitted. They consult with key officials to ensure Program operations align with laws, international agreements, and the goal of family reunification within six months of reduced violence in Syria. The Program in Syria will terminate six months after a sustained reduction in civil war violence and displacement of inhabitants. The Office will work to reunite minor children with their parents after the certification. The Office, in consultation with relevant departments, will reunite minor children in the United States with their parents or caretakers as required by international agreements and US laws. The Program may be suspended if deemed necessary for foreign policy and domestic security interests. Appropriations are authorized for each fiscal year to carry out the program's purposes using funds from the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962. The Office can use funds from the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962 for the Program. The Coordinator must report to Congress on the Program's implementation within 180 days of the Act's enactment. SEC. 4. TEMPORARY NONIMMIGRANT VISA. The Program shall admit alien minor children aged three to ten under a temporary nonimmigrant visa until civil war violence in Syria substantially reduces. Preference is given to children already in US or ally custody outside Syria. The Syrian Civil War Minor Child Protection Act of 2016 allows alien children aged three to ten, who are residents of Syria or displaced persons/refugees, to temporarily reside in the United States under the Save the Children Program. Aliens admitted to the United States under the Save the Children Act of 2016 can stay in the country until the Secretary of State certifies a significant reduction in civil war violence in Syria and newly displaced Syrian inhabitants."
