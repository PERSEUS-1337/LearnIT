It utilizes random feature maps to build a kernel specified by the distance measure, improving generalizability over Nearest-Neighbor estimates. D2KE encompasses representative-set and distance substitution kernels, while also extending Random Features methods to complex structured inputs. Our proposed framework for classification experiments compares favorably to existing distance-based learning methods in various domains such as time series, strings, and histograms for texts and images. It is easier to specify dissimilarity functions for structured inputs like time series, strings, histograms, and graphs than to construct feature representations. There are well-developed dissimilarity measures for complex structured inputs, such as Dynamic Time Warping for time series and Edit Distance for strings. Standard machine learning methods are designed for vector representations, with less focus on structured inputs. Distance-based machine learning methods, such as Nearest-Neighbor Estimation (NNE), face challenges with high variance when neighbors are far apart due to large intrinsic dimensions. Research has focused on global distance-based methods, drawing on kernel methods or learning with similarity functions. These methods aim to address the limitations of NNE by directly learning with similarity functions. Machine learning methods utilize kernel methods or similarity functions to address challenges in distance-based methods. Approaches include treating data similarity matrices as kernel Gram matrices for SVM or kernel ridge regression. However, most similarity measures do not provide positive-definite kernels, leading to non-convex problems. Research focuses on estimating positive-definite Gram matrices that approximate similarity matrices through clipping, flipping, or shifting eigenvalues, or explicitly learning a positive-definite approximation. These modifications may result in information loss, but the enforced positive-definite property is typically guaranteed. In this paper, a novel general framework called D2KE (Distance to Kernel and Embedding) is proposed to construct positive-definite kernels from a dissimilarity measure on structured inputs. This approach offers a more general and richer family of kernels compared to traditional methods, addressing issues such as information loss and inconsistency between training and testing data sets. The D2KE framework constructs PD kernels from a dissimilarity measure on structured inputs, providing a feature embedding for classification and regression models. It outperforms existing distance-based learning methods in testing accuracy and computational time across various domains like strings, time series, and histograms for texts and images. Our proposed framework for distance kernel learning constructs PD kernels from a given distance measure for structured inputs, outperforming existing methods in testing accuracy and computational time. It generalizes Random Features methods to complex structured inputs, accelerating kernel machines across domains like time-series, strings, and histograms. A generic RF method is used to accelerate kernel machines on structured inputs in various domains such as time-series, strings, and histograms. Existing approaches for Distance-Based Kernel Learning have limitations, such as strict conditions on the distance function or constructing empirical PD Gram matrices that may not generalize well. Different methods have been proposed to obtain a PD kernel or find a Euclidean embedding approximating the dissimilarity matrix. One could find a Euclidean embedding approximating the dissimilarity matrix. Another approach presented a theoretical foundation for an SVM solver in Krein spaces. Specific methods focus on building a PD kernel for structured inputs like text and time-series. Interest in approximating non-linear kernel machines using randomized feature maps has increased for faster training and testing times. Numerous explicit nonlinear random feature maps have been developed. The interest in approximating non-linear kernel machines using randomized feature maps has grown due to faster training and testing times. Various explicit nonlinear random feature maps have been created for different types of kernels. The Random Fourier Features (RFF) method, which approximates a Gaussian Kernel function, has been extensively studied. Methods to accelerate RFF on high-dimensional input data matrices have been proposed. However, existing RF methods only consider inputs with vector representations. D2KE is a method that computes random features with structured inputs using a structured distance metric. It differs from existing RF methods by constructing a new PD kernel through a random feature map. While a recent work has developed a kernel for single-variable time-series, it cannot be applied to discrete structured inputs like strings and graphs. D2KE offers a unified framework for various structured inputs beyond the limitations of existing methods. The unified framework of D2KE provides a method for structured inputs like strings and graphs, going beyond existing limitations. It offers a general theoretical analysis for KNN and distance-based kernel methods in estimating target functions from samples. The dissimilarity measure between input objects is used instead of a feature representation, with a requirement for it to be a metric in some analyses. The dissimilarity matrix in BID4 can handle varied input sizes like strings or graphs. An ideal dissimilarity measure for learning should ensure small differences in the target function and compact data representation. Lipschitz Continuity is preferred for the target function with a small constant L. The text discusses the importance of Lipschitz Continuity for the target function in learning, along with the need for a quantity to measure the size of the space implied by a dissimilarity measure. It introduces the concept of effective dimension and provides an example in the case of measuring the space of Multiset. The text introduces the concept of effective dimension in measuring the space of Multiset, providing an example. It discusses the bound on the estimation error of the k-Nearest-Neighbor estimate of the target function f(x) based on effective dimension. The text introduces an estimator based on a RKHS derived from a distance measure, with better sample complexity for higher effective dimension problems. It addresses converting a distance measure into a positive definite kernel using the D2KE approach, constructing a family of kernels from a given distance measure. The D2KE approach constructs positive-definite kernels from a distance measure by introducing a family of kernels parameterized by p(\u03c9) and \u03b3. The kernel can be interpreted as a soft version of the distance substitution kernel, providing insights into its relationship with the soft minimum function. The kernel in Equation FORMULA13 is always positive-definite by construction. To approximate it, draw samples from p(\u03c9) and solve for a feature embedding. This allows for the use of the kernel in large-scale settings efficiently. The kernel can be approximated using a random feature map, making it suitable for large-scale settings with a high number of samples. By minimizing domain-specific empirical risk, a target function can be learned as a linear function of the RF feature map. This approach is different from recent work that selects random features in a supervised setting. The RF based empirical risk minimization for D2KE kernels is outlined in Algorithm 1, where random feature embeddings are computed using a structured distance measure and an exponent function parameterized by \u03b3. The structured distance measure and exponent function parameterized by \u03b3 are used to compute feature embeddings, contrasting with traditional RF methods. The estimator is analyzed in Algorithm 1 in Section 5, comparing its performance to K-nearest-neighbor. The approach is related to the representative-set method, with a kernel equation depending on data distribution. A Random-Feature approximation is obtained by creating an R-dimensional feature embedding, equivalent to a scaled version of the representative-set method. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of the choice of p(\u03c9) in the kernel function, showing that \"close to uniform\" distributions often perform better in various domains. This contrasts with traditional methods like the representative-set method, where the size of the representative set needs to be kept small for good generalization performance. The importance of choosing the data distribution p(\u03c9) in the kernel function is highlighted, showing that distributions close to uniform perform better in various domains compared to traditional methods like the representative-set method. The experiments demonstrate improved performance in time-series, string classification, and vector sets domains with synthetic distributions of random elements. The importance of selecting the data distribution p(\u03c9) in the kernel function is emphasized, with synthetic distributions of random elements showing better performance in various domains compared to traditional methods like the representative-set method. The analysis focuses on error decomposition in the proposed framework, highlighting the role of the selected distribution in capturing relevant semantic information for estimating f(x) under the dissimilarity measure d(x, \u03c9). The text discusses the risk decomposition in the proposed framework, focusing on the function approximation error. It highlights the importance of the RKHS norm constraint and the kernel parameter in improving the approximation of the true function. The goal is to select the best function within this class that approximates the true function well. The text discusses the importance of the RKHS norm constraint and the kernel parameter in improving function approximation. It aims to select the best function within this class that approximates the true function well, with a focus on the estimation error and the dependency on n. The text discusses the difficulty in analyzing the kernel for a specific equation and focuses on the error from Random Feature Approximation. It delves into the approximation error of the kernel and provides a proposition for evaluating the empirical risk. To guarantee a small approximation error in empirical risk minimization, it is necessary to have a number of Random Features proportional to the effective dimension. The proposed framework can achieve suboptimal performance by combining error terms and utilizing a random feature approximation-based ERM estimator.
