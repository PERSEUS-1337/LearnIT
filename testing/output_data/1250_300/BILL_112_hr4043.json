    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Military Readiness and Southern Sea Otter Conservation Act\" and pertains to the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness and Conservation Act. The Congress finds that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service developed a relocation and management plan for southern sea otters as authorized by Public Law 99-625. National defense-related activities at San Nicolas Island have not adversely affected sea otters, but the expansion of the otter population into the designated management zone may have national security impacts. Military training programs need flexibility due to real-world events. The Sikes Act Compliant Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans in California address the management needs of threatened species and provide conservation benefits. Public Law 99-625 allows for the designation of otters as a nonessential experimental population to meet military readiness requirements. The purpose is to enhance conservation of the southern sea otter population while ensuring military readiness. The Secretary of Defense is required to establish Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas for national defense purposes, including specific coordinates within Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock. This is to ensure the conservation of the southern sea otter population while allowing for military readiness activities. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas are designated within specific coordinates at Naval Base Ventura County San Nicolas Island and Begg Rock, Naval Base Coronado San Clemente Island, and Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton to balance national defense needs with the conservation of the southern sea otter population. Activities within the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas are exempt from certain provisions of the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, allowing for the incidental taking of southern sea otters during military readiness activities. The Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas are exempt from certain provisions of the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, allowing for the incidental taking of southern sea otters during military activities. Southern sea otters within these areas are treated as species proposed to be listed under the Endangered Species Act. No requirement exists to remove otters from these areas. The Secretary of the Interior may revise or terminate exceptions for military activities in the Southern Sea Otter Military Readiness Areas if they impede otter conservation. The Secretary of the Navy must monitor otter populations every three years and report to Congress on their status. The Secretary of the Navy must report to Congress and the public every three years on monitoring efforts related to otter populations. A plan for ecosystem management in waters off the coast of California is to be developed to ensure the recovery of the southern sea otter, black abalone, and white abalone, as well as the commercial harvest of shellfish fisheries. The Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service will assess the carrying capacity of southern sea otter habitat, including impacts of water quality and causes of degradation. The existing relocation and management plan for southern sea otters will continue until the required management plan and assessment are completed. The southern sea otters are protected under Public Law 99-625 until the completion of the required management plan and assessment. Definitions include incidental taking, optimum sustainable population, southern sea otter, and take. The term 'take' in reference to regulations by the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act is defined. Military readiness activity is also defined as per the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003. The Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 defines military readiness activities as training and operations related to combat, testing military equipment for proper operation and suitability for combat use.
