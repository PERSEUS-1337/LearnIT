    "content": "FIFRA requires EPA to review and register pesticide products, establish maximum limits for pesticide residues in food, and assess fees on pesticide manufacturers for regulatory activities. Congress has authorized fee collection since 1954, with additional appropriations funding most costs. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 established the current fee framework. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) established the current pesticide fee framework, modifying provisions from 1988. It authorized the collection of maintenance fees for EPA review of pesticide registrations issued before November 1, 1984, and registration service fees for new pesticide registrations and amendments. PRIA 1 set fee amounts for various review activities and required EPA to complete reviews within specific timeframes. In 2007, PRIA 2 reauthorized and expanded the pesticide fee framework. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 (PRIA 1) established the current pesticide fee framework, authorizing maintenance fees for EPA review of pesticide registrations and registration service fees for new registrations. PRIA 2 in 2007 added new application categories, revised decision timeframes, and adjusted fee amounts. PRIA 3 in 2012 further amended the fee framework, setting annual maximum maintenance fees per registrant and a cap on aggregate fees collected by EPA. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 extended the framework but maintenance fee collection authority expires on September 30, 2018. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act sets annual maintenance fees per registrant based on registrations held, with a cap on total fees collected. Failure to pay fees can result in registration cancellation. Small businesses receive fee reductions, and public health pesticides are exempt from fees. Collected fees go to the \"Reregistration and Expedited Processing Fund\" for EPA costs. EPA is mandated to use funds for evaluating inert ingredients, expedited processing, reevaluating pesticides, and enhancing information systems capabilities. The Pesticide Registration Improvement Act mandates annual maintenance fees per registrant based on registrations held, with fee reductions for small businesses and exemptions for public health pesticides. Collected fees support EPA costs for evaluating inert ingredients, expedited processing, reevaluating pesticides, and enhancing information systems capabilities. EPA's authority to collect registration service fees is phasing out, with a potential 70% reduction in fees for FY2019 if not extended. FIFRA Section 33, as amended by PRIA 3, sets registration service fee amounts for various actions requested by applicants, with specified timeframes for completion. Section 33 of the Pesticide Registration Improvement Act outlines fee schedules and timeframes for requested actions by EPA. It includes fee reductions for small businesses, exemptions for certain applications, and requirements for annual appropriations to collect fees. EPA is prohibited from assessing fees if appropriations for specified functions are below a certain threshold. For FY2013 through FY2018, EPA was authorized to assess registration service fees regardless of minimum appropriations. Collected fees are deposited in the \"Pesticide Registration Fund\" and subject to annual appropriations. Fee receipts can be used without fiscal year limitation for application review, worker protection activities, and grants. The EPA is authorized to assess registration service fees for application review, worker protection activities, and grants. The Inspector General audits the funds annually, and EPA must report on pesticide program activities. Congress appropriated $8.89 billion for EPA in FY2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 and Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2018 authorized EPA to assess registration service fees for pesticide programs. Collected fees ranged from $21.4 million to $28.7 million for maintenance and $10.6 million to $18.6 million for registration services annually from FY2004 to FY2018. Congress extended fee collection authority through FY2018 appropriations but did not enact reauthorization legislation. Efforts to reauthorize the collection of maintenance and registration service fees in 2017 were extended through FY2018 appropriations. The House and Senate passed separate versions of reauthorization legislation for the Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act of 2017 (H.R. 1029), now renamed the Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of 2018. Both versions would reauthorize fee collection through FY2023 and FY2025, increase fee caps, and allocate funds for expedited rulemaking and guidance development. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 would increase maintenance fees to an average of $31.0 million per fiscal year, allocate funds for expedited rulemaking and guidance development related to pesticides, enhance compliance monitoring programs, revise registration service fee amounts, add more actions for fee assessment, and revise time frames for EPA review. EPA is required to implement two final rules by October 1, 2021, except for one rule amending elements of the agricultural worker protection standard. The EPA promulgated two rules during the previous administration, one amending the agricultural worker protection standard and the other revising standards for certified pesticide applicators. The Senate amendment to H.R. 1029 would authorize EPA to propose revisions addressing application exclusion zones and direct the U.S. Government Accountability Office to publish a report on designated representatives' impact on pesticide application information and worker health and safety by October 1, 2021. The report due by October 1, 2021, will assess the impact of designated representatives on pesticide application information, worker health, and safety. It will also provide recommendations to prevent misuse of this information. House-passed H.R. 2 aims to enact H.R. 1029 into law, while the Senate version does not include a similar provision. The prior PRIA reauthorizations were passed without roll call votes, indicating broad support for extending the pesticide fee framework. The current iteration of PRIA reauthorization has faced delays due to disagreements between the House and Senate on EPA administration and enforcement of certain FIFRA regulations. Members have acknowledged a coalition of organizations that helped develop PRIA in the early 2000s, but final enactment is pending."
