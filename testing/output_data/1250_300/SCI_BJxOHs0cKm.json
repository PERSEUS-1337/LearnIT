    "content": "While empirical evidence suggests that model generalization is related to local properties of the optima described via the Hessian, the PAC-Bayes paradigm connects model generalization with the Hessian's higher-order \"smoothness\" terms and parameter scales. A metric is proposed to score generalization capability, along with an algorithm to optimize the perturbed model. Deep models, with millions of parameters, still generalize well in applications like computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Classical learning theory suggests generalization capability is related to the complexity of the hypothesis space, measured in terms of parameters, Rademacher complexity, or VC-dimension. The generalization capability of models is related to the complexity of the hypothesis space, as suggested by classical learning theory. However, empirical observations show that over-parameterized models can still generalize well. The Hessian matrix's spectrum at the solution and sharpness metrics are found to be related to model generalization. Some Hessian-based sharpness measures are problematic for explaining generalization. The connection between sharpness metrics and generalization is demonstrated empirically. Hessian-based sharpness measures are found to be problematic for explaining generalization, especially in RELU-MLP models. Bayesian analysis has also been used to evaluate model simplicity, with recent work using the Occam factor to penalize sharp minima and determine optimal batch sizes. Additionally, PAC-Bayes bound has been utilized to analyze the generalization behavior of deep models, providing an alternative perspective on Occam's razor. The PAC-Bayes bound is used to analyze generalization behavior of deep models, incorporating local properties of solutions. BID28 suggests using perturbed loss difference as a sharpness metric, while BID3 optimizes the PAC-Bayes bound for better generalization. The relationship between model generalization and local smoothness of a solution is explored from a PAC-Bayes perspective, showing a connection with the Hessian of the loss function. The PAC-Bayes perspective explores the relationship between model generalization and the Hessian of the loss function. The analysis reveals that the generalization error is influenced by the Hessian, Lipschitz constant, parameter scales, and training sample size. A new metric for generalization is introduced, leading to the selection of an optimal perturbation level related to the Hessian. An algorithm utilizing Hessian estimation to enhance model generalization is proposed in the supervised learning scenario. The PAC-Bayes theory explores the relationship between model generalization and the Hessian of the loss function. It suggests that the gap between expected loss and empirical loss is bounded by the KL divergence between distributions. By perturbing the parameters around a solution, a bound on generalization error can be obtained. The perturbation bound connects generalization with local properties around the solution w. Optimizing \u03b7 can scale the bound approximately as BID33. Researchers have empirically found a relationship between model generalization and second-order information around local optima. The Hessian matrix \u22072L(w) has not been rigorously connected to model generalization. The introduction of the local smoothness assumption and a main theorem address this gap. Global smoothness assumptions for deep models are unrealistic, usually only holding in a small local neighborhood N. The local smoothness assumption and main theorem address the gap in connecting the Hessian matrix \u22072L(w) with model generalization rigorously. The neighborhood set is defined with a particular type of radius, but the argument holds for other types as well. The empirical loss function needs to be Hessian Lipschitz in order to control the deviation of the optimal solution. The Hessian Lipschitz condition is used to model the smoothness of second-order gradients. The draft assumes a convex function that is \u03c1-Hessian Lipschitz. The uniform perturbation theorem is discussed in the draft. The draft assumes a convex function that is \u03c1-Hessian Lipschitz. Theorem 2 states that with carefully chosen perturbation levels, the expected loss of a uniformly perturbed model can be controlled. The perturbation level is related to various factors such as the diagonal element of the Hessian, Lipschitz constant \u03c1, neighborhood scales characterized by \u03ba, number of parameters m, and number of samples n. Truncated Gaussian perturbation is also discussed in the draft. The model perturbation is discussed in relation to the local Hessian Lipschitz condition and the posterior distribution of model parameters. The perturbed parameters are assumed to be bounded, and the third-order term in the perturbation is also considered. The perturbed parameters are assumed to be bounded, and the third-order term in the perturbation is also considered. The proof procedure involves solving for \u03c3 that minimizes the right-hand side, leading to Theorem 2. Details of the proof are presented in the Appendix C and D. In the experiment, \u03b7 is treated as a hyper-parameter, and a weighted grid over \u03b7 can be optimized for the best \u03b7. The spectrum of \u2207 2L is not enough to determine generalization power for a multi-layer perceptron with RELU activation. Re-parameterization of the model can scale the Hessian spectrum without affecting model prediction and generalization. The bound does not assume cross entropy loss or RELU-MLP model, and optimal perturbation levels scale inversely with parameters. The bound changes approximately with a logarithmic factor speed. The optimal perturbation levels scale inversely with parameters, leading to a logarithmic change in the bound. By using the optimal \u03c3 * in the bound, the change is minimal for RELU-MLP with the re-parameterization trick. A heuristic-based approximation called pacGen is introduced, assuming local convexity in L(w) around w * . The metric requires estimating the diagonal elements of the Hessian \u2207 2L for real-world data. In real-world applications, the metric is calculated on every point by estimating the diagonal elements of the Hessian \u2207 2L and the Lipschitz constant \u03c1. The efficiency concern is addressed by approximating \u2207 and estimating \u03c1 using a randomly perturbed model. The neighborhood radius is set to \u03b3 = 0.1 and = 0.1 for all experiments. The batch size is varied while fixing the learning rate at 0.1, showing that as the batch size increases, the gap between test and training loss also grows. The proposed metric \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ) follows the same trend. The experiment is also carried out with a fixed training batch size of 256. The test loss and training loss increase, as shown by the proposed metric \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ). LR annealing heuristics are not used, enabling large batch training. Generalization gap and \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ) increase with decreasing learning rate. Similar trends are observed on CIFAR-10. Adding noise to the model improves generalization. Optimizing perturbed empirical loss E u [L(w + u)] is suggested for better generalization power. The text suggests optimizing the perturbed empirical loss E u [L(w + u)] for better model generalization power. A systematic way to perturb model weights based on the PAC-Bayes bound is introduced. The algorithm perturbs parameters with small gradients below a certain threshold and decreases perturbation level as epochs increase. Results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 BID17, and Tiny ImageNet 8 are compared in FIG6. The algorithm optimizes the perturbed empirical loss by perturbing model weights based on the PAC-Bayes bound. The perturbation level decreases with epochs. Results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 BID17, and Tiny ImageNet 8 are compared using Wide-ResNet BID36 as the prediction model. Different optimizers and learning rates are used for each dataset. The perturbation method optimizes the perturbed loss by updating model weights with off-the-shelf algorithms. Different optimizers and learning rates are used for CIFAR and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Perturbation improves model generalization by adjusting perturbation levels based on local smoothness structures, leading to better performance compared to dropout. The perturbedOPT approach connects solution smoothness with model generalization in the PAC-Bayes framework. The text discusses a new perturbation method that connects solution smoothness with model generalization in the PAC-Bayes framework. It integrates the Hessian in the model generalization bound and proposes a new metric to test model generalization. The method adjusts perturbation levels based on the Hessian, showing similar performance to a regularizer in improving performance on unseen data. The text presents a toy example demonstrating the effect of an algorithm acting as a regularizer to improve performance on unseen data. A small 2-dimensional sample set is constructed from a mixture of 3 Gaussians, with binarized labels. A 5-layer MLP model is used with shared weights and no bias terms. The model has only two free parameters, w1 and w2, and is trained using 100 samples. The loss function is plotted with respect to the model variables, showing multiple local optima. The colors on the loss surface represent the values of the generalization metric scores. The text presents a toy example demonstrating the effect of an algorithm as a regularizer to improve performance on unseen data. It shows a sharp global optimum and a flat local optimum on the loss surface, with colors indicating generalization metric scores. The local optimum has a similar overall bound compared to the global optimum. Predictions from both optima show that the sharp minimum approximates the true label better but has complex structures in its predicted labels. The text discusses the effect of an algorithm as a regularizer to improve performance on unseen data, showing a sharp global optimum and a flat local optimum on the loss surface. Predictions from both optima reveal that the sharp minimum approximates the true label better but has complex structures in its predicted labels. The procedure involves truncating the Gaussian distribution and choosing bounded coefficients for the prior. After truncating the Gaussian distribution, the variance decreases, leading to a tighter bound for the truncated Gaussian. When the loss function is convex around w* with \u2207(w*) \u2265 0, the best \u03c3i is found. Lemma 4 states that for a bounded model weight, with probability at least 1-\u03b4 over n samples, a tighter bound can be obtained. The algorithm treats \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter instead of optimizing it further. The proof of Lemma 3 involves solving for \u03c3 that minimizes the right-hand side of the inequality. The term related to \u03c3i is monotonically increasing with \u03c32, leading to a complete solution. The proof involves minimizing \u03c3 in FORMULA2, showing monotonically increasing term with \u03c32 in FORMULA14, and combining inequalities to complete the proof. Lemma discusses optimizing \u03b7 independently of data, building a grid for optimization, and bounding the quadratic term in FORMULA10. The generalization ability is linked to eigenvalues of \u22072L(w), even with correlated perturbations.

The generalization ability is linked to eigenvalues of \u22072L(w), even with correlated perturbations. The inequality (23) holds for correlated perturbations. Lemma 5 introduces conditions for local optimal w* and random perturbations u. Figures compare dropout and proposed perturbation algorithm. Dropout is a multiplicative perturbation using Bernoulli distribution widely used in deep models. The section compares dropout with the proposed perturbation algorithm using wide resnet architectures on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Dropout is seen as a multiplicative perturbation widely used in deep models. The perturbation algorithm has dropout layers turned off, with specific model parameters and optimization settings for each dataset. Figures show accuracy versus epochs for training and validation. The perturbed SGD algorithm with specific parameters outperformed dropout in experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Dropout improved validation/test accuracy, with a dropout rate of 0.3 working best for CIFAR-10 and 0.1 for CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet. The perturbed algorithm showed better performance, possibly due to varying perturbation levels on parameters based on local smoothness structures."
