The \"Access to Women's Health Care Act of 1997\" recognizes the importance of obstetrician-gynecologists in providing primary and preventive health care for women throughout their lifetime. Obstetrician-gynecologists play a crucial role in managing women's health beyond reproductive care, reducing the need for referrals to other physicians. Obstetrician-gynecologists are uniquely qualified to provide basic health care services to women. Some States have promoted access to these specialists, but patients in other States or Federally-governed health plans may face restrictions. SEC. 2. ASSURING ACCESS TO OBSTETRICAL AND GYNECOLOGICAL SERVICES UNDER GROUP HEALTH PLANS AND INSURANCE COVERAGE. This section adds new standards for access to obstetrical and gynecological services under group health plans. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must allow female enrollees to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider. If not designated, the plan or issuer cannot require prior authorization for obstetric and gynecologic care provided by a participating obstetrician-gynecologist. Group health plans and health insurance issuers must allow female enrollees to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider. The plan cannot require prior authorization for gynecologic care ordered by the participating physician, and coverage requirements for medical necessity must still be met. Prohibitions include denying or limiting coverage to avoid these requirements, and offering incentives to accept less protection. The plan must not avoid the requirements of this section, provide monetary incentives to women to accept less protection, or penalize providers for following the rules. Group health plans must comply with notice requirements and can negotiate reimbursement levels with providers. State laws offering more protection for health insurance issuers are not preempted. The section outlines reimbursement levels and non-preemption of state laws for health insurance issuers. Amendments are made to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act regarding group health insurance coverage. Amendments are made to Public Law 104-204 and ERISA regarding group health insurance coverage. Amendments are made to Public Law 104-204 and ERISA regarding group health insurance coverage, including standards relating to access to obstetrical and gynecological services. Amendments to Public Law 104-204 and ERISA require group health plans to allow female enrollees to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider without prior authorization for obstetric and gynecologic care. Group health plans must allow female enrollees to designate an obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary care provider for obstetric and gynecologic care without prior authorization. Plans are prohibited from denying women eligibility based on this designation or providing incentives to accept less coverage. The plan cannot avoid the requirements of providing minimum protections to women, offering monetary incentives to accept less coverage, or penalizing providers for following the requirements. Imposing these requirements is considered a material modification in the plan, requiring notice within 60 days. Group health plans can still negotiate reimbursement levels and types. The plan must adhere to minimum protections for women without offering incentives for less coverage or penalizing providers. Any changes must be notified within 60 days. Group health plans can negotiate reimbursement levels and types with providers. State laws providing greater protections to enrollees than federal law are not preempted. Section 731 and 732 of the Act (29 U.S.C. 1191) are amended to include references to section 713. The table of contents in the Act is also updated to reflect these changes. Section 713 of the Act introduces standards for access to obstetrical and gynecological services. This section amends Part B of title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act to include new standards under section 2752. The provisions of section 2706 apply to health insurance coverage in the individual market. Health insurance issuers must comply with notice requirements similar to group health plans. State laws providing greater protections to enrollees are not superseded by this section. The amendments made to the Act apply to group health plans starting from January 1, 1998, and to individual market health insurance coverage thereafter. Group health plans under collective bargaining agreements ratified before the enactment date are subject to specific provisions. The amendments to the Act apply to group health plans starting from January 1, 1998, and to individual market health insurance coverage thereafter. Group health plans under collective bargaining agreements ratified before the enactment date have specific provisions exempting them until the termination of the agreements or January 1, 1998."
