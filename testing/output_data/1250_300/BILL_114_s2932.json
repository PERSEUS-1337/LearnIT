    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Protecting Patient Access to Emergency Medications Act of 2016\". The Congress recognizes the importance of controlled substances for emergency medical services to save lives and improve health outcomes. There is a need for regulatory oversight to prevent diversion in all healthcare settings, including emergency medical services. Investigations for nearly 70,000 doses of controlled substances administered; regulatory oversight to prevent diversion is essential in all health care settings, including emergency medical services, tailored to unique care delivery models. Oversight should promote uniformity of rules, application, and enforcement to prevent diversion in emergency medical services. SEC. 312 of the Controlled Substances Act adds regulations for emergency medical services to prevent diversion of controlled substances. Definitions in this section clarify emergency medical services as medical response provided outside of a facility, emergency medical services agencies as organizations providing such services, and emergency medical services practitioners as licensed healthcare providers credentialed to deliver emergency care. The curr_chunk defines terms related to medical oversight in emergency medical services, including the roles of a medical director, standing order, verbal order, and online medical direction. The curr_chunk explains the registration process for emergency medical services practitioners to dispense controlled substances under the oversight of a registrant emergency medical services agency. The terms \"online medical direction\" and \"registrant emergency medical services agency\" are defined within the context. The Attorney General can register emergency medical services agencies to dispense controlled substances to ultimate users in emergency medical situations, instead of registering individual practitioners or medical directors. This single registration per State is tailored to recognize existing medical care delivery and oversight for patients with emergency medical conditions. Medical oversight for emergency medical services agencies involves having one or more licensed physicians as medical directors responsible for overseeing the provision of emergency medical services. The medical director's responsibilities may vary based on state regulations. The medical director of an emergency medical services agency may have responsibilities including decisions on patient transportation, approving medical protocols, overseeing patient care, online medical direction, and establishing drug formularies. The medical director of an emergency medical services agency oversees drug formularies, medication dispensing, medical education programs, quality improvement, and administration of controlled substances by practitioners under standing orders. Emergency medical services practitioners can receive standing orders or online medical direction from medical directors or licensed physicians in specific circumstances, such as upon dispatching services or upon request for a specific patient. The medical director of an emergency medical services agency can provide verbal orders in specific patient situations to ensure proper care and treatment, without the need for written or oral prescriptions. A registrant emergency medical services agency is not required to be present or provide a prescription for administering medication to a known individual. The agency must keep standing orders on file and have a policy for documenting verbal orders and controlled substance administrations in patient care charts. This documentation must be available to the Attorney General upon request. The registrant emergency medical services agency must document the administration of controlled substances in the patient care chart and make it available to the Attorney General upon request. They can receive, move, and store controlled substances at designated locations within the agency. The emergency medical services agency can store controlled substances at designated locations within the agency and is not considered a distributor of controlled substances under the Act. This section does not affect requirements under the Social Security Act or limit the Attorney General's authority to enforce diversion of controlled substances."
