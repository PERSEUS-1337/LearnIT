    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Telecommuting and Air Quality Act.\" It includes a grant program for designing a pilot program to promote telecommuting as a way to improve air quality. The Secretary of Transportation will grant a nonprofit entity to design a pilot program for promoting telecommuting to improve air quality. The program will be administered in collaboration with the EPA and the Department of Energy. The pilot program aims to establish ozone precursor credit-trading with participating employers who authorize telecommuting. The proposed Ozone Precursor Credit-Trading Pilot Program defines key terms such as participating employers, telecommuting, regulated entities, ozone precursors, and VMTs. The program aims to establish a pilot program where participating employers engage in telecommuting to reduce emissions of ozone precursors. The proposed pilot program aims to evaluate methods for calculating reductions in ozone precursor emissions through telecommuting. Employers can transfer emission credits to others and participate in a trading forum for exchanging credits. The pilot program allows for trading emission credits through a commercial forum or direct exchanges. Regulated entities can obtain credits and use them to achieve compliance with emission reduction targets. The Federal Government will facilitate credit transfers between participating employers and entities. The Federal Government will facilitate the transfer of emission credits between participating employers and regulated entities in specific geographic areas for the pilot program. The Secretary requires consultation with local governments and business organizations for the pilot program design. A study and report on the program's potential effects on transportation policies, energy conservation, air quality, and quality of life are also mandated. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the grant under subsection (a). Authorization of appropriations is provided for the grant under subsection (a) in the amount of $250,000 for fiscal year 2000."
