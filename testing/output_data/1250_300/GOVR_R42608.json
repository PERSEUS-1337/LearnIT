A panel of banks is surveyed daily to determine rates, with averages reported at 11:30 a.m. There are separate LIBOR rates for 15 maturities and 10 currencies. In the U.S., many contracts reference the three-month dollar LIBOR, determined by a panel of 18 banks including Bank of America, Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase. The dollar LIBOR index is determined by a panel of 18 banks, including Bank of America, Citibank, and JPMorgan Chase. The highest 4 and lowest 4 responses are discarded, and the middle 10 are averaged. Banks can apply to participate in the survey, with criteria based on market share and reputation. Other regions have similar indexes like EURIBOR for Europe and TIBOR for Tokyo, measuring borrowing costs in different currencies and maturities. The LIBOR index is used in various financial contracts, such as mortgages and interest rate swaps, as a benchmark. It is also utilized by futures exchanges and policymakers to assess financial market stress. Private parties voluntarily choose to use LIBOR as a benchmark. Private parties voluntarily choose to use LIBOR as a benchmark for setting interest rates in financial contracts. Other benchmarks exist but may not be as suitable due to differences in borrower type or loan maturity. Alternatives to LIBOR for private contracts exist, but may have shortcomings due to differences in borrower type or loan maturity. Lenders could consider using U.S. Treasury securities yield or the Federal Funds Rate as benchmarks, but these may not always align with banks' borrowing costs. The appropriate alternative benchmark may vary based on the types of loans or financial derivatives being referenced. LIBOR is widely used in financial instruments, with estimates showing a significant reliance on it for adjustable rate mortgages. The value of loans, derivatives, and financial instruments referencing LIBOR is significant, with estimates showing high reliance on it for adjustable rate mortgages. A single bank on the LIBOR reporting panel can influence the index, but may not always be able to move it in the desired direction. The dollar LIBOR panel consists of 18 banks, with only the middle 10 responses being averaged. If a bank manipulates its bid, it can impact the average rate reported. A single bank can potentially move the index from 8% to 7.5% by changing its response. In the context of the dollar LIBOR panel consisting of 18 banks, with only the middle 10 responses being averaged, a single bank can potentially affect the index by manipulating its bid. Barclays admitted to submitting false survey responses to manipulate LIBOR, which is a violation of U.S. law as it impacts U.S. derivatives markets. Barclays admitted to submitting false survey responses to manipulate LIBOR, violating U.S. law and impacting U.S. derivatives markets. The manipulation involved changing survey responses for trade positions and reputation, as well as attempting to influence other banks' responses. Collusion among banks can have a greater impact on LIBOR. Barclays manipulated LIBOR by submitting false survey responses through collusion with other banks, impacting derivatives markets. Derivatives traders within Barclays asked employees to submit false responses to benefit their trading positions, with preferences for high or low LIBOR changing daily. Barclays admitted to submitting false survey responses for LIBOR during the 2005-2007 period, with preferences changing daily based on market conditions. As financial turmoil increased in 2008, Barclays' management aimed to lower responses to protect the firm's reputation, drawing attention from UK officials and regulators. Barclays faced scrutiny from UK officials and regulators for consistently providing higher LIBOR survey responses compared to other responders. This raised concerns about the firm's financial strength. Despite previous misconduct in 2005-2007, Barclays under-reported its cost of funds in 2008. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York also raised concerns about Barclays' LIBOR responses and the methodology of the index. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) raised concerns with Barclays about its LIBOR responses and the methodology of the index. FRBNY also communicated these concerns to UK regulators and the BBA. Documents posted in response to congressional inquiries reveal FRBNY's concerns with the credibility of LIBOR in 2008. Included are various documents such as emails between Timothy F. Geithner and Mervyn King, as well as presentations to the U.S. Treasury and the Interagency Financial Markets Group Meeting regarding market concerns about LIBOR."
