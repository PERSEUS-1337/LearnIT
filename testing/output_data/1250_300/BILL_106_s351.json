    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Taxpayer Oversight of Surplus Property Act\". Congress recognizes the importance of fair distribution of Federal surplus property to various eligible recipients, including law enforcement agencies, schools, medical institutions, libraries, homeless assistance providers, and local government units. The Federal Personal Property Utilization and Donation Program helps save taxpayer dollars by repurposing surplus property. Oversight by Members of Congress and state officials ensures accountability to taxpayers, as surplus Federal property belongs to the American people. State agencies' efforts in distributing surplus property have benefited thousands of taxpayers. The current system for donating surplus Federal property is hindered by prioritizing foreign entities over the needs of American taxpayers. New legislation is needed to prioritize domestic use transfers of excess personal property to Federal agencies over foreign assistance programs. The legislation aims to prioritize states and local organizations for the transfer of nonlethal excess supplies from the Department of Defense. Section 2547 of title 10, United States Code is amended to allow nonlethal excess supplies of the Department of Defense to be made available to states or local governments before humanitarian relief purposes. The term 'State' includes states of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and any U.S. possession. Additionally, the legislation allows for transfers of property for environmental protection in foreign countries. SEC. 4 amends Section 607 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to allow property transfers for environmental protection in foreign countries. It specifies conditions for property transfer and prohibits transfer restrictions. SEC. 5 requires a report on disposal and donation of surplus personal property. The Administrator of General Services must review statutes on disposal and donation of surplus personal property and submit a report to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The report should assess program effectiveness, property amounts, and types administered in fiscal years 1997 and 1998. Legislative recommendations for integrating and consolidating programs under a single Federal authority are also required."
