    "content": "The service sector encompasses a wide range of economic activities that provide human value-added in various forms. These activities are intangible, cannot be stored, and must be consumed at the point of production. Rapid technological changes are expanding the possibilities for service delivery. Examples of services include retail, transportation, information, banking, education, healthcare, and more. Services are a significant sector of the U.S. economy. The service sector in the U.S. economy is diverse and includes industries such as education, healthcare, financial services, and distribution services. These sectors are crucial for the economy as they provide intrinsic value and support the flow of capital and goods. In 2010, the service sector accounted for 83% of nonagricultural payroll jobs and 65% of GDP. Services play a vital role in ensuring the efficient functioning of the economy. The service sector in the U.S. economy is diverse and crucial, accounting for 83% of nonagricultural payroll jobs and 65% of GDP in 2010. U.S. trade in services plays a significant role in overall trade, with services accounting for 30% of total U.S. exports and 17% of total U.S. imports in 2010. Many service providers prefer a direct presence in the country of the consumer for services like hotel, restaurant, legal, accounting, and construction services. Cross-border services trade data may not capture all trade, so data on sales by foreign affiliates of U.S.-owned companies and U.S. affiliates of foreign-owned firms provide a more accurate measurement. In 2008, U.S. firms sold $1,137 billion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned foreign affiliates, while foreign firms sold U.S. residents $727 billion in services through their majority-owned foreign affiliates located in the United States. These figures, along with cross-border trade data, do not fully capture the total value of trade in services. Data on sales via temporary movement of consumers and providers are not readily available. The seeds for multilateral negotiations in services trade were planted in the Trade Act of 1974. The Trade Act of 1974 initiated multilateral negotiations in services trade, leading to the inclusion of services in the Uruguay Round negotiations in 1986. This resulted in the creation of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) to administer the agreements. Developing countries were initially hesitant to have services covered by international trade rules due to less advanced service sectors. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) was established along with the World Trade Organization (WTO) to administer the agreements from the Uruguay Round negotiations. Trade scholar Geza Feketekuty highlights challenges in creating rules for international trade in services, including targeting domestic regulations as barriers, distinguishing legitimate regulations from protectionism, and adapting to technology advances like the internet. These challenges call for flexible yet rigid rules to address them effectively. The GATS recognizes the challenges of international trade in services, including the impact of the internet on making services tradable across borders. It emphasizes the need for flexible yet disciplined rules to address barriers to trade in services, considering the various modes of delivery. The four modes of delivery are cross-border supply, consumption abroad, commercial presence, and presence of natural persons. The GATS emphasizes the need for flexible rules to address barriers to trade in services. The four modes of delivery include cross-border supply, consumption abroad, commercial presence, and presence of natural persons. These modes determine how services are provided across borders. The GATS is an agreement among 153 WTO members that provides a framework for government policies affecting trade in services. It aims to promote economic development, liberalize trade, and preserve governments' right to regulate services sectors. The GATS is divided into six parts, with Part I defining its scope and application to all services and modes of delivery. The GATS applies to all services, government barriers at all levels, and four modes of service delivery. It includes principles like MFN treatment, transparency, and impartial administration of rules. Exceptions exist for balance of payments difficulties. Part II of the GATS outlines exceptions for balance of payments difficulties and national security purposes. Part III establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members, prohibiting less favorable treatment and placing limits on foreign service suppliers. Part III of the GATS establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members, ensuring that service suppliers from other member countries receive national treatment and allowing for further reductions in trade barriers. These obligations apply only to services and modes of delivery listed in each member's schedule of commitments, following a positive list approach. The GATS establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members, ensuring service suppliers receive national treatment. Each member's schedule of commitments lists services and modes of delivery. Parts IV-VI require new negotiations to expand coverage and handle conflicts in the dispute settlement mechanism. Annexes cover MFN exemptions, financial services, transportation, telecommunication, maritime services, and mode-4 delivery. Negotiations were not completed, but signatories did not want to delay the rest of the Uruguay Round. The GATS stipulated ongoing negotiations on financial services, telecommunications, maritime services, and mode-4 delivery. Agreements were reached on basic telecommunications in February 1997 and financial services in December 1997. Negotiations on mode-4 ended in July 1995 with limited results, while negotiations on maritime services concluded in June 1996 without resolution. WTO members' commitments on national treatment and market access in specific service sectors are crucial under the GATS and in Doha Development Agenda negotiations. Access in specific service sectors or subsectors is a significant part of a member's obligations under the GATS and a key focus during negotiations. Each WTO member must submit a schedule of commitments (SC) during GATS negotiations, with new members required to do so upon accession. The SC is comparable to tariff schedules but more complex, divided into four columns detailing sector/subsector commitments, market access restrictions, national treatment restrictions, and additional commitments. The schedule of commitments (SC) in GATS negotiations includes sector-specific commitments for trade liberalization in all services sectors and subsectors. The objective is to reform GATS rules, expand coverage of service sectors, and reduce limitations on national treatment and market access. The GATS negotiations aim to reform rules and expand coverage of service sectors. Article XIX mandates new negotiations on services, addressing issues like special treatment for least developed countries and government subsidies. The GATS negotiations focus on reforming rules and expanding service sector coverage. Special treatment for least developed countries, government subsidies, emergency safeguard measures, and government procurement are key issues addressed in the negotiations. Progress has been slow since 2000 due to political challenges, but guidelines approved in 2001 aim for progressive liberalization while respecting members' right to regulate the services sector. The main objective of the GATS negotiations is the progressive liberalization of trade in services to promote economic growth and development while respecting members' right to regulate the services sector. All service sectors and delivery modes are subject to negotiations, with special attention given to the needs of developing countries. Negotiations are conducted in special sessions of the Council for Trade in Services, using the \"request-offer\" format for new commitments. Modalities were adopted in September 2003. After the GATS negotiations adopted modalities in September 2003, members were tasked with negotiating commitments and credit for autonomous liberalization. The DDA round, launched successfully in November 2001, included services negotiations. Deadlines were set for market access requests and commitment offers, but the services negotiations faced challenges as deadlines passed. The rest of the DDA negotiations were at risk of collapse after disagreements in September 2003. The DDA negotiations faced challenges as deadlines passed, leading to a potential collapse in September 2003. However, a negotiating framework was established in July 2004 to put the round back on track, emphasizing the importance of timely and high-quality offers. Services were briefly mentioned in the framework, which was significant for the U.S. business community. The DDA negotiations faced challenges with deadlines for initial offers, which were of low quality. Services were briefly mentioned in the July framework, placing them on par with agriculture and market access negotiations. Negotiations on rules are conducted by working groups, with members using the request-offer format for national treatment and market access commitments. Members submit wish-lists and offers, with negotiations continuing until consensus is reached on acceptable commitments. Unlike goods negotiations, services negotiations are not conducted multilaterally among all members at the same time. The WTO services negotiations involve multiple rounds of bilateral, plurilateral, and multilateral negotiations among members to reach consensus on commitment offers. These negotiations have faced delays and challenges, with the DDA negotiations being suspended in 2006 due to disagreements on agriculture trade modalities. Despite this, negotiations resumed in 2007 and are ongoing. The WTO services negotiations faced delays and challenges, with disagreements on agriculture trade modalities leading to the suspension of DDA negotiations in 2006. Negotiations resumed in 2007, with the United States aiming to secure market access commitments from trading partners. The United States aims to secure market access commitments from trading partners in the WTO services negotiations. U.S. policymakers have targeted goals for the negotiations, including addressing concerns about market access and national treatment commitments made during the Uruguay Round. Government regulation is a significant aspect of services trade, with GATS rules recognizing the need for regulation to ensure consumer health and safety. In various governments, service sectors are regulated by different agencies, with some sectors overseen by multiple government bodies. Service providers, whether local or foreign, must understand regulations to conduct business. Lack of transparency in regulatory processes hinders foreign trade in services, especially in developing countries. The United States urges WTO members to establish clear domestic procedures for licensing, informing the public of regulations, and providing market access commitments in services negotiations. The United States urges WTO members to establish clear domestic procedures for licensing, informing the public of regulations, and providing market access commitments in services negotiations, including eliminating unnecessary restrictions on foreign direct investment and improving market access in financial services. The United States is requesting trading partners to improve market access in financial services, transparency in financial services regulations, and fairness in applying financial services regulations. They are also seeking commitments to expedite new-to-market initiatives in insurance, increase market access in telecommunications services, privatize telecommunications carriers, and address cross-subsidization of express delivery services. Additionally, the US is asking for increased access in road freight transport, order processing services, inventory management services, and energy exploration services. The United States is requesting increased market access in energy services, including energy transmission, distribution, marketing, and conservation. They are also seeking commitments for third-party access to energy transportation facilities. Additionally, the US is prioritizing environmental protection services such as wastewater treatment, waste management, and biodiversity conservation in trade negotiations. The United States is requesting increased market access for various environmental services, including wastewater treatment, waste management, and biodiversity conservation. They are also seeking market access for retail, wholesale, and franchising services, as well as education and professional services. This includes removing citizenship requirements for licensing and lifting restrictions on foreign ownership. The United States is seeking increased market access for various professional services by removing citizenship requirements for licensing, foreign ownership restrictions, and restrictions on associations with local professionals. They have also requested improved market access commitments for computer, audiovisual, and advertising services. The U.S. initial and revised offers aim to maintain national treatment and market access for foreign service providers. The United States aims to maintain national treatment and market access for foreign service providers in various professional sectors. The U.S. offers include horizontal commitments that apply to all sectors listed in the schedule of commitments, such as temporary entry of personnel. Some U.S. WTO-trading partners have expressed concerns about these offers. The United States offers horizontal commitments for all sectors listed in the schedule of commitments, including temporary entry of personnel for specific groups working for foreign firms with affiliates in the U.S. This includes services sales persons, inter-corporate transferees, personnel establishing a business entity, fashion models, and service providers in specialty occupations. The U.S. also allows temporary entry for personnel engaged in the acquisition of land in scheduled services sectors and subsectors. The United States permits temporary entry of personnel for land acquisition in scheduled services sectors. Foreigners providing scheduled services are taxed like U.S. residents. The U.S. offers commitments in business services, taxation, architectural and engineering services, with exceptions mainly related to state restrictions on foreign service providers. Other sectors include market research, management consulting, computer services, and real estate. The United States offers commitments in various services sectors, including market research, management consulting, computer services, real estate services, agriculture-related services, telecommunications, retail trade, education, environmental services, financial services, healthcare, travel and tourism, transportation services, energy services, and construction. Developing countries criticize the U.S. for not offering broader commitments, arguing that the sectors the U.S. has committed to are not beneficial to them. The European Union has also criticized the U.S. for its limited commitments. Countries have criticized the United States for not offering broader commitments in various sectors, such as express delivery and energy services, which are not useful to them. The European Union has also criticized the U.S. for not opening maritime and postal services to foreign competition. Developing countries and some developed countries have focused their criticism on U.S. commitments under the mode-4 category, particularly the restrictions on access for software specialists and information technology engineers. Deadlines for completing negotiations have been rescheduled due to the complexity of the issues. The negotiations in the DDA have faced delays in meeting deadlines for procedural steps due to complexity. The \"request-offer\" format is seen as a potential obstacle, with the US and EU proposing sector benchmarks for commitments. Developing countries oppose these proposals, arguing they are too restrictive. The EU proposed sector benchmarks for commitments in the DDA negotiations, which faced opposition from developing countries. The US services business community expressed concerns that focusing on benchmarks could cause delays. Canada, supported by the US and other developed countries, suggested changes to the negotiating process to stimulate progress. Canada, supported by the United States and other developed countries, proposed changes in the negotiating process to boost services negotiations. The proposal aimed to address frustrations with the current sequencing of negotiations. Developing countries rejected the proposal and prefer to maintain the current sequencing. The positive list approach to market access commitments has also faced criticism for potentially hindering market access liberalization. Market access liberalization in negotiations involves sectors and subsectors not covered by WTO rules unless specified. The \"negative list\" approach preferred by the United States has caused controversy, particularly regarding Mode-4 delivery of supply personnel. Despite accounting for less than 1% of world trade in services, Mode-4 has sparked tension between developed and developing countries, as well as within the U.S. itself due to its connection to immigration policy. The controversy surrounding mode-4 delivery of supply personnel in the U.S. is related to immigration policy and has sparked tension between developed and developing countries. India has criticized visa restrictions on temporary workers entering the U.S. India has criticized visa restrictions on temporary workers entering the United States, particularly those not directly affiliated with U.S. companies, and called for greater transparency in U.S. immigration regulations. Congressional committees objected to changes in visa policies being included in trade agreements, leading to compromises but bipartisan warnings against such inclusions in the future. The U.S. business community urges flexibility in visa policy for trade agreements, proposing alternative options to advance negotiations. Little progress has been made on establishing rules for subsidies and emergency safeguard measures in services. Developing countries prioritize these issues, but basic questions remain unresolved. Negotiations on government procurement have been slow, with a consensus that services negotiations have not advanced significantly in over 10 years. Negotiations on government procurement and services have been slow, with little progress made in over 10 years. A World Bank assessment found that many WTO members, especially developing countries, have not significantly changed their commitments from the Uruguay Round. The best offers made so far are 1.9 times more restrictive than actual policies, showing reluctance to lock in trade in services. WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy suspended the DDA, including services negotiations, in 2006 after disagreements among G-6 members. Negotiations on government procurement and services have been slow, with little progress made in over 10 years. WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy suspended the DDA, including services negotiations, in 2006 after disagreements among G-6 members. Progress on services negotiations remains sluggish due to divisions between developed and developing countries. Developing countries are hesitant to improve offers until progress is made in agriculture and NAMA negotiations. The slow progress in services negotiations within the DDA is hindered by disagreements between developed and developing countries. Developing countries are reluctant to enhance their offers until the US and EU commit to reducing agriculture subsidies. The complexity of the services agenda and the involvement of various players also contribute to the challenges in formulating trade rules. The services negotiations in the DDA face challenges due to the involvement of multiple participants, including regulatory agencies. The prospects for the negotiations are uncertain, with factors such as political will, willingness to compromise, and resolution of issues in agriculture and non-agriculture market access playing a role. The WTO Ministerial in Hong Kong in 2005 aimed to accelerate the DDA process. At the WTO Ministerial in Hong Kong in 2005, trade ministers aimed to accelerate the DDA negotiations, focusing on completing the services negotiations with special consideration for developing countries. However, by the end of 2007, countries remained divided on key objectives, with developed countries pushing for binding commitments on trade in services while developing countries resisted. In 2008, WTO Director Lamy called a ministerial meeting in Geneva to address agriculture and NAMA negotiations. A \"signaling\" conference was held to gauge participants' offers and expectations, but little progress was made. Cluster meetings in 2009 aimed to provide momentum with limited results. Services negotiations in 2010 were hindered by agriculture and NAMA talks. In 2009, WTO members held \"cluster\" meetings to boost negotiations, but achieved limited results. Little progress was made in services negotiations in 2010 due to being tied to agriculture and NAMA talks. Senator Grassley expressed concern over the stalled Doha services negotiations."
