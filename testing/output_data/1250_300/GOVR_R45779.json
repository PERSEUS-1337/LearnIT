    "content": "Many Members of the 116th Congress are interested in Trump Administration's efforts to reform USAID, known as Transformation at USAID. The reform process began in 2017 with an executive order and OMB memorandum, focusing on making the government more efficient. USAID submitted its own reform plan to OMB, separate from the State Department's \"redesign\" initiative. OMB's government-wide reform plan in 2018 included 32 reforms, some directly related to USAID. USAID cooperated with the State Department's \"redesign\" initiative and OMB's government-wide reform plan, \"Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century,\" which included restructuring U.S. humanitarian assistance programs and changing USAID's bureau structure. USAID finalized and began implementing its reforms, known as Transformation, but there is no comprehensive public report detailing the effort. Various sources such as USAID publications, Administrator Mark Green's testimony before Congress, and implementation documents inform the Transformation process. Administrator Green has engaged with Congress on USAID reforms, utilizing documents like Country Roadmaps and the Private Sector Engagement Strategy. While most reforms do not need congressional approval, some require notification to Congress. Green values congressional input and support for Transformation efforts, recognizing Congress's power to shape reforms through oversight and funding. The report analyzes key elements of current USAID reform efforts under the Transformation umbrella, focusing on objectives, process, structure, and workforce reforms. Administrator Green's testimony described Transformation as experience-informed, innovation-driven reforms to optimize effectiveness. Congressional support and oversight are crucial in shaping USAID reforms. Transformation, as described by Administrator Green, aims to optimize structures and procedures at USAID for maximum effectiveness. Key objectives include supporting country transitions to self-reliant development, increasing collaboration with the private sector, and enhancing national security strategy. The core goal is to end the need for foreign assistance by using taxpayer dollars more efficiently. USAID's Transformation initiative focuses on optimizing structures and procedures for maximum effectiveness, with the core objective of supporting partner countries' journey to self-reliance. The primary reform objective is to move partner countries towards economic self-sufficiency, with a shift towards using taxpayer dollars more efficiently. Other objectives, such as advancing national security goals, have been de-emphasized in later Transformation materials. Past USAID Administrations have also aimed to refine foreign assistance deployment to align with U.S. national security and foreign policy strategies. The Transformation initiative by USAID focuses on optimizing structures and procedures to support partner countries' journey to self-reliance. It aims to establish a more flexible and field-responsive approach to programming, aligning with the current global landscape. The key reform objective is to move partner countries towards economic self-sufficiency, using taxpayer dollars more efficiently. The \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" is the organizing principle for USAID policy reforms under Transformation. The Transformation initiative by USAID aims to align its approach to development with the current global landscape by focusing on optimizing structures and procedures to support partner countries' journey to self-reliance. This involves using a matrix of 17 indicators to quantify countries' progress towards ending their need for foreign assistance, with indicators selected based on alignment with self-reliance, reputation of reporting institutions, and comparability across countries. The matrix of 17 indicators quantifies countries' progress towards self-reliance, focusing on commitment and capacity. USAID's new approach prioritizes self-sufficiency in country strategies, aiming to support countries in moving beyond poverty. The \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" by USAID focuses on making self-sufficiency the primary goal in country strategies, using a matrix of 17 indicators to measure progress. This approach aims to tailor programming to each country's unique challenges while establishing a common metric across all countries, reflecting theories that connect economic growth to democratic institutions and markets. The indicators selected by USAID for the \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" framework reflect theories connecting economic growth to democratic institutions and markets. These indicators are divided into \"commitment\" and \"capacity\" composites, with more weight given to the \"commitment\" indicators. USAID emphasizes the need to evaluate these indicators in each country's unique context and states that they do not provide a comprehensive diagnosis of development causes. The indicators selected by USAID for the \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" framework focus on country-level evaluation, shifting away from past global development approaches. Concerns have been raised about potential aid cuts to underperforming countries based on these indicators. The \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" framework by USAID uses metrics to inform programmatic allocations, not to determine aid eligibility based on country performance. Concerns exist about potential aid cuts to underperforming countries, but USAID emphasizes that the framework is not a grading system. The \"Journey to Self-Reliance\" framework by USAID focuses on financing self-reliance and private sector engagement as key tools to end the need for foreign assistance. It emphasizes providing countries with access to capital for reinvestment in their own progress, aligning with global development frameworks. The focus of USAID's self-reliance approach is facilitating access to capital for countries to reinvest in their progress, aligning with global development frameworks like the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals and multilateral development banks' agenda to leverage private sector investments. This approach combines domestic resource mobilization, strong public finance management, and fiscal transparency to create a market-based enabling environment for private investment. The USAID's self-reliance approach focuses on facilitating access to capital for countries to reinvest in their progress by combining domestic resource mobilization, strong public finance management, and fiscal transparency to create a market-based enabling environment for private investment. This initiative prioritizes effective financial markets and private sector engagement to support partner country self-sufficiency. The new Private Sector Engagement Policy (PSE Policy) builds on longstanding efforts to leverage resources of nongovernmental actors for international development, including the Global Development Alliance (GDA) program. The Global Development Alliance (GDA) program, launched in 2001, has been USAID's flagship mechanism for public-private partnerships. The U.S. Global Development Lab (the Lab) focuses on innovation and sourcing breakthrough solutions. The Development Innovation Ventures (DIV) program integrates venture capital approaches into USAID's programs. The Obama Administration emphasized private sector partnerships as part of a broader Science, Technology, Innovation, and Partnerships (STIP) agenda. The PSE Policy highlights business partnerships to attract solutions from scientists and technology innovators, shifting towards an \"enterprise-driven development\" approach. The PSE Policy emphasizes business partnerships to attract solutions from scientists and technology innovators, shifting towards an \"enterprise-driven development\" approach. It seeks to infuse a private sector engagement orientation across all programming, broadening USAID's partner makeup to include nontraditional partners. The policy is still in early stages of implementation. The USAID's Private Sector Engagement (PSE) Policy aims to broaden partner makeup by integrating nontraditional partners in program design. The policy is in early stages of implementation, with changes in engagement methodology and sourcing mechanisms expected. The USAID Acquisition and Assistance Strategy highlights a shift towards private sector engagement, aiming to build partnerships and promote partner self-sufficiency through diversifying partner base and supporting local partners' capacity building. The USAID is making shifts to its partnering approach by diversifying its partner base, supporting local partners' self-reliance, and establishing a more flexible partnering approach. Reforms are ongoing, including the launch of a New Partnerships Initiative and expected revisions to operational policies. Past experience, such as the USAID Forward initiative, informs these changes. The Lab has contributed to new partnering modalities like \"co-creation,\" which is increasingly referenced in USAID's solicitations. The aim is to build on these efforts to encourage greater collaboration in program design. The Lab has contributed to new partnering modalities like \"co-creation,\" increasingly referenced in USAID's solicitations. Transformation aims to highlight tools for greater collaboration with partners and adaptive management, aligning USAID's organization with U.S. international development goals. Congressional oversight has scrutinized proposed structural changes, with the Administrator awaiting approval from all oversight committees. USAID is divided into field missions and headquarters' bureaus. The Administrator is seeking approval from all oversight committees for proposed changes in USAID's organizational structure. USAID is divided into field missions and headquarters' bureaus, with headquarters' bureaus and offices categorized into geographic, functional, central, and independent offices. The reorganization proposal includes adding two new Administration-appointed Associate Administrators to the chain of command. USAID is proposing a reorganization to include two new Administration-appointed Associate Administrators in the chain of command. The Associate Administrators would each oversee three bureaus, aiming to relieve the Administrator of some day-to-day oversight responsibilities and allow for greater focus on agency-wide management priorities. USAID is proposing a reorganization to include two new Administration-appointed Associate Administrators in the chain of command. This aims to relieve the Administrator of day-to-day oversight responsibilities and allow for greater focus on agency-wide management priorities. Some concerns have been raised about potential politicization of development decisions with the addition of political appointees. The reorganization focuses on functional and central bureaus, moving from four functional bureaus, six central bureaus/offices, and six independent offices to five functional bureaus, three central bureaus, and four independent offices. One key proposal is the creation of a Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance. The proposed reorganization at USAID includes the creation of a Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (HA), combining the Offices of Food for Peace (FFP) and U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA). This consolidation aims to elevate U.S. humanitarian assistance on the global stage by providing a unified voice and reducing confusion in articulating U.S. efforts. The merger of FFP and OFDA into HA at USAID aims to streamline humanitarian assistance efforts, eliminate duplication, and enhance the agency's ability to respond effectively to complex emergencies. This restructuring differs from past bureaus at USAID and is intended to provide a more unified and prominent voice for U.S. humanitarian efforts globally. The proposed HA restructuring at USAID aims to combine humanitarian offices for efficiency and effectiveness. Some stakeholders support the elevation of USAID's humanitarian functions, while others are concerned about the impact on interagency cooperation and global humanitarian funding. Food assistance stakeholders worry about the dissolution of FFP and potential decline in U.S. in-kind commodities provision. The proposed restructuring at USAID aims to consolidate humanitarian offices for efficiency. Concerns have been raised about the potential decline in U.S. in-kind commodities provision and the de-emphasis of nonemergency programs under the new bureau context. The creation of the Bureau for Democracy, Development, and Innovation is the largest structural change proposed, seeking to streamline technical assistance and knowledge management functions. The proposal for the new Bureau for Democracy, Development, and Innovation (DDI) aims to consolidate technical staff and offices from different bureaus into one, creating a \"one-stop-shop\" for missions in the field. The DDI would provide coordinated consultancy services in various areas such as education, environment, private sector engagement, youth, and gender equality. Supporters believe this will enhance technical support, while detractors are concerned about managing unrelated functions within DDI. The new Bureau for Democracy, Development, and Innovation (DDI) aims to consolidate technical staff and offices into one place for better support. Detractors worry about managing unrelated functions within DDI. USAID's Transformation seeks to modify workforce management structures to adapt to complex situations. This includes developing new hiring mechanisms, leadership philosophy, and knowledge management framework, all described as \"employee-led.\" The new Bureau for Democracy, Development, and Innovation (DDI) aims to consolidate technical staff and offices into one place for better support. USAID's Transformation involves workforce reforms, including new hiring mechanisms like direct-hire (DH) positions and non-DH positions funded through program funds. DH positions come with U.S. government benefits, while non-DH positions like U.S. personal services contractors (USPSCs) and institutional support contractors (ISCs) have varying benefits. The Transformation workforce reforms address staffing concerns raised after the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola response. The Transformation workforce reforms at USAID include a new hiring mechanism called the Adaptive Personnel Project (APP) to address staffing concerns raised after the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola response. The APP is a noncareer, excepted service mechanism aimed at providing more flexibility for the agency to surge and contract its workforce. The Adaptive Personnel Project (APP) at USAID is a noncareer, excepted service mechanism that offers workforce flexibility by allowing time-limited positions based on hiring managers' discretion. It aims to provide talent-based classification for positions, enabling employees to move between different roles without being locked into a specific group and series. USAID is working with the Office of Personnel Management to structure the APP for flexibility in classification, allowing employees to move between different functional areas easily. APP employees will receive government benefits and a common performance management system will be implemented. The pilot will establish 300 positions for crisis response offices, potentially changing the agency's hiring mechanisms. Congressional approval is required to use program funds for the pilot. USAID is seeking congressional approval to use program funds for the APP pilot, which aims to establish 300 positions for crisis response offices. If approved, the agency plans to fill these positions in 2020 and expand to an additional 1,200 positions in the following two years. Congress may have ongoing areas of interest related to U.S. foreign assistance policy and USAID operations and budget. Members of Congress are considering USAID reform activities and the role of foreign assistance in U.S. foreign policy. Concerns about rival powers like China and Russia influencing regions where USAID operates may lead to a reevaluation of the goal to end the need for foreign assistance. If successful, alternative forms of engagement with aid partners may be necessary to maintain U.S. influence. USAID is undergoing Transformation while facing proposed budget cuts. Congress has not supported the cuts, and new Associate Administrator positions may raise concerns about politicization. Alternative forms of engagement, such as cultural exchange programs and business ties, may help maintain U.S. influence in countries transitioning away from aid. The Transformation proposal at USAID includes adding new Associate Administrator positions, potentially politicizing development decisions. Concerns arise over vacancies in high-level positions, hindering policy implementation. The focus is on new strategies and hiring mechanisms, with little discussion on phasing out existing processes. Congress may inquire about plans to integrate or eliminate outdated strategies. The Transformation proposal at USAID includes adding new Associate Administrator positions, potentially politicizing development decisions. Administrator Green argues for self-reliance roadmaps to guide congressional allocation decisions. Congressional funding priorities may conflict with country-specific aid agenda under Transformation. The Transformation proposal at USAID includes transnational programming like countering trafficking and regional trade hubs. Self-reliance indicators may need attention, especially regarding tariff barriers. Congress may consult with USAID to align indicator configuration with priorities. Other priorities of Transformation, such as operational flexibility in nonpermissive environments and countering violent extremism, have lost prominence. Congress may seek more information on how Transformation aligns with the Administration's plans. The Transformation proposal at USAID includes transnational programming like countering trafficking and regional trade hubs. Congress may consider seeking additional information on how Transformation would align with the Administration's planned Prosper Africa trade and investment initiative. Alignment with State Department policies and structure is also unclear. Congress may need to assess whether certain reforms should be broadened to include State Department policies and structure. The proposed merger of the Offices of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance and Food for Peace into the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance raises questions about the future of Food for Peace Act Title II programming. The Office of Food for Peace is currently dual-funded, but in the proposed HA Bureau, it would cease to exist in name. Congress may seek to understand how the HA Bureau would be structured to ensure it meets its mandates outlined in the farm bill."
