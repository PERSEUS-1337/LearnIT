The \"HIV Partner Protection Act\" amends the Public Health Service Act to require states to have laws or regulations for partner notification of individuals with HIV disease. This includes confidential reporting of positive test results and providing partners with information about potential exposure to the disease. The program for partner notification of individuals with HIV disease includes providing partners with information on exposure, counseling and testing for HIV, and therapeutic measures for preventing deterioration of the immune system. The program includes providing information on therapeutic measures for preventing immune system deterioration and conditions from the disease, referrals for services, in-person notifications, no penalties for infected individuals not identifying partners, and no penalties for good faith errors in reporting. The program includes providing information on therapeutic measures for preventing immune system deterioration and conditions from the disease, referrals for services, in-person notifications, no penalties for infected individuals not identifying partners, and no penalties for good faith errors in reporting. State insurance laws require demonstration of compliance with testing protocols for individuals exposed to HIV disease to receive grants. State insurance laws require that a State must show compliance with testing protocols for individuals exposed to HIV disease to receive grants. Insurance cannot penalize individuals solely for being tested for the disease. Definitions include 'infected individual' as someone with HIV disease and 'partner' as spouses, sexual partners, or needle-sharing partners of infected individuals. The legislation defines 'partner' broadly to include spouses, sexual partners, needle-sharing partners, and individuals exposed to HIV disease. Certain states have delayed applicability for compliance with testing protocols until fiscal year 2001. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide grants to States to assist with the costs of implementing partner notification programs for HIV. $10,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually from 2000 to 2004 for this purpose."
