    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crane Conservation Act of 2003\". Congress acknowledges the serious decline of crane populations globally, particularly in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Five species of Asian cranes are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Convention. The Crane Action Plan identifies four African crane species and one Asian species as seriously threatened. The wattled crane, blue crane, grey-crowned crane, black-crowned crane, and sarus crane are seriously threatened. The whooping crane and Mississippi sandhill crane are endangered with low population numbers. Conservation efforts have not been enough to address the decline in crane populations due to hunting and habitat loss. Conservation resources have not been sufficient to cope with the continued diminution of crane populations from hunting and habitat loss. Cranes are flagship species for wetland, grassland, and agricultural conservation. Other threats include egg collection, poisoning, collisions with power lines, disturbance from warfare, and trapping for sale. Joint commitment is needed to address these threats effectively. Cranes face threats such as hunting, habitat loss, egg collection, poisoning, power line collisions, warfare disturbance, and trapping for sale. Joint commitment from countries and the private sector is necessary to address these threats. Cranes are important ambassadors for promoting goodwill among countries due to their migration across continents. Conservation efforts and successes in one region can be applied to other regions where cranes are found. Conservationists in the United States can learn from and collaborate with colleagues in other countries to conserve threatened crane populations. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of cranes, support conservation programs in countries where endangered cranes occur, assist private organizations dedicated to crane conservation, and provide financial resources for these efforts. The term \"conservation\" in this Act refers to methods and procedures to ensure the population of crane species in the wild is sufficient to prevent extinction, including habitat protection, research, management plans, enforcement, and community involvement. The Act focuses on the development of management plans for crane ranges, enforcement of the Convention, law enforcement and habitat protection through community participation, reintroduction of cranes to the wild, conflict resolution initiatives, and community outreach and education. The terms \"Convention,\" \"Fund,\" and \"Secretary\" are defined within the Act. SEC. 5. CRANE CONSERVATION ASSISTANCE.

Projects are approved if they enhance conservation programs for cranes and address conflicts between humans and cranes. The Secretary approves project proposals that enhance conservation programs for cranes and address conflicts between humans and cranes by assisting in implementing conservation programs, addressing habitat conflicts, enhancing compliance with laws, developing scientific information on crane habitat and populations, and promoting cooperative projects among various entities. The Secretary approves project proposals that promote cooperative projects among governmental entities, local communities, NGOs, and private sector, conduct necessary scientific research on cranes, reintroduce cranes into the wild, and provide training to enhance conservation capacity. Preference is given to projects ensuring long-term conservation and those with matching funds available. The Secretary gives preference to projects that focus on long-term conservation of cranes and habitats or have matching funds available. Recipients of assistance must submit reports to evaluate project progress and success, which will be made available to the public. The Secretary convenes a panel of experts biennially to identify conservation needs for cranes. The Secretary convenes a panel of experts biennially to identify conservation needs for cranes, including the establishment of a Crane Conservation Fund. Establishment of the Crane Conservation Fund within the Multinational Species Conservation Fund, with provisions for funding and expenditures for crane conservation efforts. The Secretary determines necessary amounts for assistance under section 5, with a limit of 3% or $80,000 for administrative expenses. Not more than 50% of the Fund can be used for North American crane conservation projects. The Treasury Secretary invests excess Fund amounts in interest-bearing US obligations.
