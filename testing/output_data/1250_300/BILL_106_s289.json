    "content": "The \"Faith-Based Drug Treatment Enhancement Act\" amends the Public Health Service Act to allow services for substance abuse prevention and treatment to be provided through religious organizations. This Act is cited as the \"Faith-Based Drug Treatment Enhancement Act.\" This part of the Act applies to programs providing federal financial assistance for substance abuse prevention or treatment. It excludes awards for other purposes. Definitions include 'designated award recipient' and 'designated direct award'. Designated direct award means an award received directly from the Federal Government under a designated program. Designated subaward is an award of financial assistance made by a non-Federal entity, partially consisting of Federal financial assistance. Financial assistance includes grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, or voucherized assistance. Program beneficiary is an individual receiving program services, and program participant is defined in section 582(a)(2). Program services refer to the services provided under the designated program. A program participant is an individual who receives program services, which include treatment for substance abuse or preventive services. A religious organization is a nonprofit religious organization. Voucherized assistance is a system where beneficiaries are given a document to pay for services and choose the organization providing services according to specified rules. The program participant selects the organization for services and is reimbursed by the award recipient. The beneficiary determines how program funds are allocated by choosing a service provider from alternatives. Religious organizations can participate in the program as service providers chosen by the beneficiary. Religious organizations have the authority to be designated award recipients, make subawards to other entities, provide program services through voucherized assistance, and be service providers under a designated program. The term 'program participant' includes entities that have received a direct award or subaward, even if they only provide services through voucherized assistance. Religious organizations can participate in designated programs by providing program services through voucherized assistance without compromising their religious character or the religious freedom of beneficiaries. The establishment clause of the first amendment does not require social-welfare programs to discriminate against faith-based providers or force them to abandon their religious identity. Religious organizations can participate in Federal programs without having to compromise their religious character or expression. They are eligible for program participation on an equal basis as other nonprofit organizations, and the government cannot discriminate against them based on their religious identity. Religious organizations retain independence from government control over their religious beliefs, with additional safeguards in place to protect their freedom. Religious organizations participating in Federal programs are protected from government interference in their religious beliefs and practices. They are not required to change their internal governance or remove religious symbols. Employees providing program services must adhere to the organization's religious beliefs and practices. Religious organizations in Federal programs can require employees to adhere to their religious beliefs and rules on drug/alcohol use. Program beneficiaries objecting to a religious organization can receive services through an alternative entity or program participant. Religious organizations in Federal programs can require adherence to their beliefs. Program beneficiaries objecting can receive services through an alternative entity with equal value. Religious organizations in Federal programs cannot discriminate based on religion but can require active participation in religious activities and adherence to religious rules from program beneficiaries. Religious organizations receiving Federal financial assistance must adhere to fiscal accountability regulations, including auditing principles for fund usage. They can seek judicial review for compliance with these regulations. SEC. 583 limits funds for sectarian worship or instruction under designated programs, with an exception for beneficiaries to choose how assistance is used. SEC. 584 addresses program administration and fund treatment. SEC. 584 addresses the administration of programs and the treatment of funds, clarifying that financial assistance is aid to the beneficiary, not the organization providing services. It also prohibits state discrimination in the use of funds, allowing federal funds to be used in religious facilities or by religious organizations participating in the program. The Congress finds that formal educational qualifications for counselors in drug treatment programs may hinder the effectiveness and provision of services. If a State imposes educational requirements on program providers, including religious organizations, they must recognize the value of religious education and training for personnel. Religious education should be considered equivalent to secular coursework in the delivery of program services. The Congress acknowledges that formal educational qualifications for counselors in drug treatment programs may impede service provision. States must credit religious education and training for personnel in religious organizations providing program services. The Secretary can waive educational qualifications for successful religious organizations in drug treatment. The Secretary can waive educational qualifications for successful religious organizations in drug treatment if certain criteria are met, including a record of prior successful drug treatment and a lack of empirical evidence supporting the necessity of educational qualifications."
