Congress finds that nanotechnology presents unprecedented scientific and technological opportunities in various fields such as materials, electronics, medicine, energy, and national security. Government funding for long-term, high-risk research is essential to drive breakthroughs in technology. Advancements in nanotechnology, funded by the government, are crucial for creating breakthrough technologies. Federal investments in this field will not only benefit the private sector but also improve the efficiency of the government and its mission agencies. The market for nanotechnology products in the US could exceed $1 trillion in the future. Mastering nanotechnology requires a unique skill set combining chemistry, physics, materials science, and information science. Funding in these critical areas has been stagnant, leading to a decline in young people pursuing graduate studies in these fields. Research on nanotechnology raises social, ethical, philosophical, and legal issues that require careful consideration and guidance. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) aims to address social, ethical, and legal issues related to nanotechnology. Achieving international leadership in nanotechnology is crucial for national security. Authorizing legislation can establish new technology goals and research directions. Authorizing legislation plays a significant role in nanotechnology research and development programs, contributing to the advancement of nanotechnology. It helps establish new technology goals, improve coordination, oversight, and ensure optimal returns on investments for the Executive Branch and Congress. The Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board (referred to as the Advisory Board) is established to provide advice on research investment policy, strategy, program goals, and management processes related to nanoscience and nanotechnology. The Advisory Board will operate in coordination with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The President, with the Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, will establish procedures for selecting up to 20 qualified individuals from industry and academia to serve on the Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board. Members must have expertise in various fields related to nanotechnology and hold diverse views on societal, ethical, educational, legal, and workforce issues. The President will consider recommendations from various sources in appointing members, and designate a Chairperson for the Advisory Board. The President will establish a Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Advisory Board with up to 20 qualified individuals from industry and academia. Members will have expertise in nanotechnology-related fields and diverse views on societal, ethical, educational, legal, and workforce issues. The President will appoint a Chairperson for the Advisory Board, who will serve for a 3-year term. Members will serve for 1 to 3 years and may be reappointed. Vacancies will be filled in the same manner as the original appointment. Members will serve without pay but will receive travel expenses. The Advisory Board will meet at least 2 times per year. The President will establish a National Nanotechnology Coordination Office to support the Advisory Board and coordinate Federal nanotechnology activities. The staff of the office will be appointed according to civil service laws and paid based on classification and General Schedule pay rates. The Advisory Board advises on the National Nanotechnology Program, including setting goals, research needs, performance metrics, and increasing investments in nanotechnology and biology research. The Advisory Board advises on the National Nanotechnology Program, including setting goals, research needs, and performance metrics. Approaches to increase multi-agency investments in research at the intersection of nanoscale technology and biology, creation of programs for new instrument development, stimulating industrial partnerships for commercialization, addressing workforce issues, and coordinating research activities among Federal agencies and the Department of Defense are key focus areas.

The Board also consults with various entities conducting research on and using nanotechnology, ensuring that the Federal nanotechnology program considers societal implications of nanoscale science and technology. SEC. 7. REPORTS. The Advisory Board must submit an annual report to the President, agency heads, and congressional committees. The report should cover the program's technical success, management, funding levels, and portfolio balance. The Advisory Board's annual report should include a review of the program's activities, balance in the program's portfolio, participation of minority serving institutions, policy issues related to nanotechnology, recommendations for new goals and research areas, and new investments by participating agencies. The annual report by the Advisory Board should include recommendations for new investments in program funding areas, reviews of pertinent issues, and a technology transition study evaluating the success of transitioning research into commercial and military products in the nanotechnology sector. The curr_chunk discusses promoting efficient technology transition in the nanotechnology sector, including barriers and recommendations for government-sponsored activities. The Act is exempt from termination under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Sums are authorized for carrying out the Act."
