    "content": "The \"Import Control and Safe Handling of Spent Nuclear Fuel Act of 1995\" prohibits the import of spent nuclear fuel into the United States unless approved by Congress, licensed by the appropriate Federal agencies, and operating repositories are in place. National security exceptions are also outlined. SEC. 3 of the \"Import Control and Safe Handling of Spent Nuclear Fuel Act of 1995\" outlines national security exceptions for importing spent nuclear fuel, including exemptions for countries suspected of nuclear weapons development. SEC. 4 addresses guidelines for safe shipment of certain materials by port authorities. Port authorities have the authority to establish guidelines for the safe handling of spent nuclear fuel at marine ports, ensuring public health and safety. Guidelines may include worker training, response plans for emergencies, and community notification. The guidelines for handling spent nuclear fuel at marine ports include informing local communities, setting standards for storage and transportation, and limiting radiation exposure for workers. The guidelines for handling spent nuclear fuel at marine ports aim to prevent radiation exposure and accidents during fuel movement. These guidelines must be more protective than other existing laws and can be enforced regardless of other regulations governing fuel transportation. The Act does not impact the port's liability for handling nuclear materials. Definitions are provided in the Act. The Act defines \"atomic energy defense activity\" as functions carried out by the Secretary of Energy, \"port authority\" as an authority overseeing port operations in the US, and \"repository\" as defined in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The Act defines \"port authority\" as the authority overseeing port operations in the US and \"repository\" as defined in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The term \"repository\" has the meaning given by section 2(18) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, and \"spent nuclear fuel\" has the meaning given by section 2(23) of the same Act."
