    "content": "Following each decennial census, the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are divided among the 50 states, with each state guaranteed at least one Representative. Congressional redistricting must occur every 10 years to ensure equal population distribution among districts. This process involves state and federal legal requirements, including constitutional provisions like the Elections Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The Elections Clause and the Equal Protection Clause ensure fair elections and prevent discrimination in voting laws. Redistricting maps must comply with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibits voting discrimination based on race. Congressional district boundaries must adhere to Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to prevent minority vote dilution. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits discriminatory voting practices, including minority vote dilution, and ensures equal opportunity for racial and language minority groups to elect representatives. The Supreme Court's ruling in Shelby County v. Holder in 2013 impacted the preclearance requirement under Section 5 of the VRA for certain states and jurisdictions. Until 2013, the VRA required certain states and jurisdictions to obtain preclearance for voting law changes. This included proving no discrimination in redistricting maps to protect citizens' ability to elect preferred candidates. The Supreme Court's Shelby County v. Holder ruling invalidated this requirement, stating it unfairly targeted specific states and jurisdictions. The Supreme Court's Shelby County v. Holder ruling invalidated the preclearance requirement for certain states and jurisdictions under the VRA, impacting redistricting maps and congressional district drawing. This decision removed nine states and jurisdictions within six additional states from the preclearance requirement, affecting how election laws are changed. The Supreme Court has evaluated disputes over redistricting maps in cases involving New York, North Carolina, and South Dakota, impacting how congressional districts are drawn. The rulings address population equality, Voting Rights Act, Equal Protection Clause, partisan gerrymandering, and state ballot initiatives for redistricting. The Constitution requires each congressional district to have an equal number of persons, known as the \"equality standard\" or \"one person, one vote.\" This interpretation stems from the 1964 Wesberry v. Sanders case. In 1964, the Supreme Court established the \"one person, one vote\" standard for congressional and state legislative redistricting, ensuring equal representation. The Court emphasized the need for equal voting power in elections and addressed the requirement for population equality among districts. The \"maximum population deviation\" in redistricting maps refers to the percentage difference from the ideal population between the most and least populated districts. The Supreme Court has set standards for population equality in congressional districts, requiring less deviation than for state legislative districts. In cases like Kirkpatrick v. Preisler and Karcher v. Dagett, the Court has emphasized the importance of achieving near absolute population equality unless necessary for a legitimate state objective. In Karcher v. Dagett, the Court established that absolute population equality is the standard for congressional districts unless deviation is needed for legitimate state objectives. The Court outlined criteria such as compactness, municipal boundaries, prior district preservation, and incumbent contests. The 1983 Tennant v. Jefferson County Commission decision clarified that districts don't need precise mathematical equality but must justify population deviation with legitimate state objectives. The Court set a two-pronged test based on Karcher to assess the constitutionality of redistricting plans. The Court outlined a two-pronged test for determining the constitutionality of congressional redistricting plans. Challengers must prove that population differences could have been avoided, and if successful, the state must show that the differences were necessary for a legitimate state objective. The state's burden is flexible and depends on various factors. In Tennant v. Jefferson County Commission, the Court found that certain state policies justified minor population disparities in the redistricting plan. The Supreme Court upheld a 0.79% maximum population deviation in congressional districts, citing valid state policies and the difficulty in achieving greater population equality. The Court's redistricting jurisprudence addresses the balance between the VRA's requirements and equal protection standards, requiring awareness of race in districting while prohibiting racial-based redistricting without justification. This guidance aims to achieve a delicate balance in creating \"majority-minority\" districts when necessary under the VRA. The VRA provides guidance on creating \"majority-minority\" districts to prevent vote denial based on race or language minority status. The Supreme Court's three-pronged test in Thornburg v. Gingles establishes criteria for proving vote dilution under Section 2 of the VRA. The VRA's three-pronged test in Thornburg v. Gingles outlines criteria for proving vote dilution under Section 2, including demonstrating minority group size, political cohesion, and majority bloc voting patterns. The Court considers the \"totality of the circumstances\" to determine if there is an equal opportunity for political participation and candidate selection. Factors like past discrimination history are relevant in this assessment. The \"totality of the circumstances\" test in assessing vote dilution under Section 2 of the VRA includes factors such as history of discrimination, racially polarized voting, election practices that may enhance discrimination, access to candidate slating process, effects of discrimination on education, employment, and health, racial appeals in political campaigns, and minority group representation in public office. In Bartlett v. Strickland, the Supreme Court ruled that the first prong of the Gingles three-pronged test requires a minority group to be geographically compact enough to constitute a majority in a district. The Court rejected the argument that Section 2 of the VRA grants special protection to minority groups needing to form political coalitions to elect preferred candidates. The Supreme Court determined in Bartlett v. Strickland that Section 2 of the VRA does not provide special protection to minority groups forming political coalitions. The Court stated that creating majority-minority districts in redistricting plans can prevent racial vote dilution and ensure minority voters' equal rights. In certain circumstances, Section 2 can require the creation of majority-minority districts in congressional redistricting plans to prevent racial vote dilution and ensure minority voters' equal opportunity. The Supreme Court requires minority voters to constitute over 50% in such districts. Redistricting plans must also adhere to equal protection standards under the Fourteenth Amendment, with race as the predominant factor triggering strict scrutiny review. States must demonstrate a compelling governmental interest and narrow tailoring in creating majority-minority districts to withstand this scrutiny. To withstand strict scrutiny, the state must show a compelling interest in creating majority-minority districts that are narrowly tailored. These cases involve \"racial gerrymandering\" claims where race is argued to have been improperly used in redistricting. The Supreme Court requires plaintiffs to prove that racial considerations were dominant in district creation. In Easley v. Cromartie in 2001, the Court upheld the constitutionality of a 47% black district in North Carolina against claims of racial gerrymandering. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a 47% black district in North Carolina against claims of racial gerrymandering. The Court emphasized the need for challengers to prove that race, rather than politics, predominantly influenced the district boundaries. The Supreme Court emphasized the need for challengers to prove that race, rather than politics, predominantly influenced district boundaries in cases of majority-minority districts. In a 2015 decision, the Court outlined the method for analyzing racial predominance, requiring a district-by-district analysis to determine if traditional redistricting principles were subordinated to racial considerations. The Supreme Court outlined the method for analyzing racial predominance in district boundaries, emphasizing the need to prove that race, not politics, influenced majority-minority districts. The Court determined that traditional redistricting principles should not be weighed against the use of race to determine predominance. Alabama's Court also clarified that maintaining a particular percentage of minority voters in a minority-majority district is not required under Section 5 of the VRA. Instead, the focus is on ensuring a minority's ability to elect their preferred candidate. The Supreme Court clarified that Section 5 of the VRA requires minority-majority districts to maintain a minority's ability to elect their preferred candidate. This decision may impact Congress if drafting a new coverage formula for Section 5 preclearance. In a recent case, the Court ruled that proving racial predominance in gerrymandering claims does not require conflict with traditional redistricting criteria. The Supreme Court remanded a case to the federal district court to determine the permissibility of 11 out of 12 \"majority-minority\" districts created by Virginia in 2011. The districts were drawn with a black voting-age population of at least 55% to comply with the Voting Rights Act. In 2014, 12 registered Virginia voters filed a lawsuit alleging racial gerrymandering in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court clarified that proving racial predominance in gerrymandering claims does not require conflict with traditional redistricting criteria. In a case involving racial gerrymandering in Virginia, the Supreme Court clarified that proving racial predominance does not require a conflict with traditional redistricting criteria. The Court rejected the argument that racial gerrymandering harm arises from grouping voters of the same race without shared interests. The Supreme Court clarified that proving racial predominance in redistricting cases requires examining the actual considerations behind crafting the map, not theoretical justifications. Another case, Cooper v. Harris, is being considered to shed light on race and redistricting issues. In North Carolina, a federal court ruled the 2011 congressional redistricting map unconstitutional due to racial gerrymandering. The North Carolina legislature redrew its congressional district map in 2011 to include two new majority-minority districts, CD 1 and CD 12, which were later deemed unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. The plaintiffs argued that the VRA's preclearance requirements were used as a pretext to pack African-American voters into these districts, reducing their influence in others. The district court found that race predominated in creating these districts, subordinating traditional redistricting criteria to achieve a racial quota. The court determined that race predominated in creating congressional districts 1 and 12, applying strict scrutiny. Compliance with the VRA was questioned, with insufficient evidence for CD 1 and a failure to prove racially polarized voting in CD 12. The defendants were unable to demonstrate a compelling state interest in creating these districts. The court found racially polarized voting in CD 1 and CD 12, leading to the invalidation of district 12. The VRA may require majority-minority districts, but redistricting must also adhere to equal protection standards. Race must not be the predominant factor in drawing district lines without a compelling governmental interest. The Supreme Court has ruled that a redistricting plan must be narrowly tailored to create a majority-minority district, without race being the predominant factor. The Court is also considering a case on unconstitutional racial gerrymandering, while defining partisan gerrymandering as drawing district lines to benefit one political party. The Supreme Court has struggled to establish a manageable standard for determining unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering, with conflicting opinions on whether such claims are justiciable. In Vieth v. Jubelirer, the Court addressed a claim of partisan gerrymandering but could not agree on a standard for assessing such claims. In Vieth v. Jubelirer, the Supreme Court addressed claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. Justice Kennedy concluded that while the claims were not justiciable, there could be a possibility of judicial relief with a limited and precise rationale. He noted that future cases may involve the First Amendment interest of not penalizing citizens based on their participation in the electoral process. In future cases claiming unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering, Justice Kennedy emphasized the First Amendment interest of not burdening citizens based on their political participation, voting history, party association, or expression of views. He suggested that analyzing such cases under the First Amendment may provide a better basis for intervention by focusing on whether a redistricting plan burdens the representational rights of voters for ideological or political reasons. In the 2006 decision League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry (\"LULAC\"), the Supreme Court was divided on whether partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable. The Court disagreed with Texas voters who challenged a redistricting plan, stating that claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering are justiciable but could not agree on a standard for adjudicating such claims. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, who had joined the Court since its ruling in Vieth, generally disagreed with the justiciability of such claims. In the aftermath of LULAC, the Supreme Court remains divided on whether claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering are justiciable. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito generally agree with Justice Kennedy's position, leaving open the possibility for a future standard to adjudicate such claims. The critical standard for finding a violation and granting relief in cases like Whitford v. Gill remains unresolved. The State of Wisconsin appealed a federal court ruling on partisan gerrymandering to the Supreme Court. The case involved the Whitford v. Gill redistricting map, which was deemed unconstitutional. The plaintiffs, Democratic supporters, challenged the map for diluting their voting power based on political beliefs. The plaintiffs challenged Wisconsin's state legislative redistricting plan for unequal treatment of voters based on political beliefs, violating the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court ruled that the First Amendment and Equal Protection Clause prohibit drawing a redistricting map that hinders a citizen's vote based on political affiliation. The court emphasized that the weight of a citizen's vote should be protected from discrimination based on political preferences. The Equal Protection Clause protects a citizen's vote from discrimination based on political preferences. The court considered the associational aspect of partisan gerrymandering, emphasizing the rights of individuals to associate for political beliefs and the right of voters to cast their votes effectively. The redistricting plan in question was found to have a purpose of benefiting the Republican Party. The court found that the redistricting plan aimed to secure Republican Party control of the state legislature, increasing districts favoring one party. Despite complying with redistricting principles, the plan was deemed to entrench one party's power for a decade. The court determined that the redistricting plan aimed to ensure one political party's control of the state legislature for 10 years by strategically allocating votes in newly created districts. The court introduced a new measure called the \"efficiency gap\" to calculate the imbalance among districts, highlighting methods like \"cracking\" and \"packing\" to diminish the electoral power of voters from one party. The court introduced the \"efficiency gap\" (EG) measure to assess redistricting plans, focusing on methods like \"cracking\" and \"packing\" to diminish voter power. The EG measures the degree of cracking and packing in a district plan, showing the deviation from the expected relationship between votes and seats. The court found that the redistricting plan created a burden based on the EG measure and election results. The court relied on election results, academic analyses, and the Efficiency Gap measure to determine that the state legislative redistricting plan burdened the plaintiffs' representational rights. The court found that the plan's discriminatory effect could not be justified by political geography or legitimate state interest. The court concluded that considering the Efficiency Gap was appropriate in assessing partisan gerrymandering, despite the lack of explicit guidance from the Supreme Court. The court determined that the Wisconsin state legislative redistricting plan constituted an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, as the partisan effect could not be justified by political geography or legitimate state interest. Multiple alternative plans were available that would have achieved the same redistricting goals with less partisan advantage, but were not used. The court enjoined the State of Wisconsin from using the plan in future elections. The Wisconsin state legislative plan was deemed an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, leading to an injunction against its use in future elections. The Supreme Court has yet to establish a clear standard for addressing such gerrymandering claims. Some states have implemented independent redistricting commissions to address concerns about partisan gerrymandering. In Arizona and California, independent redistricting commissions were adopted through ballot initiatives, removing control of congressional redistricting from state legislative bodies. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of an independent commission for drawing congressional district boundaries in the 2015 case of Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission. The Elections Clause allows a commission to draw congressional districts instead of a state legislature. The Supreme Court ruled that the Elections Clause of the Constitution permits an independent commission, not just a state legislature, to draw congressional districts. This decision was based on the principle that political power comes from the people, allowing for the creation of independent commissions to prevent manipulation of electoral rules by state politicians. The Supreme Court ruled that the Elections Clause allows for an independent commission, not just a state legislature, to draw congressional districts. This decision aims to prevent manipulation of electoral rules by state politicians for their own benefit. The Court interpreted the term \"legislature\" in different contexts, including cases where it encompassed the people's veto power through referendums and the governor's veto power. The Court also noted that there is no constitutional barrier for a state to empower its people with a legislative function. The Supreme Court ruled that the Elections Clause allows for an independent commission to draw congressional districts, preventing manipulation by state politicians. The Court found no constitutional barrier to states empowering their people with a legislative function through initiatives. Additionally, the Court held that Arizona's congressional redistricting process aligns with federal redistricting statutes. The Supreme Court ruled that states can use initiatives to redistrict as long as it follows federal procedures. Congress intended for states to have the authority to create congressional districts using their own laws, including initiatives. This clarifies that states can enact election laws through the initiative process. The Supreme Court ruling allows states to use initiatives for redistricting, clarifying that states can enact election laws through this process. This decision suggests that state constitutional provisions regulating congressional redistricting through initiatives are likely to be upheld under the Elections Clause. Additionally, federal statutes and the Constitution govern congressional redistricting, with the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings shaping the process and impacting challenges to redistricting plans. The Supreme Court's rulings have significantly influenced congressional redistricting, requiring districts to have roughly equal populations but allowing deviations for legitimate state objectives. The Court also mandates strict scrutiny if race is the primary factor in district lines, requiring a compelling governmental interest and narrow tailoring of the redistricting plan. The Supreme Court requires strict scrutiny for redistricting based on race, with a compelling governmental interest and narrow tailoring of the plan. The Court is currently reviewing cases on racial and partisan gerrymandering, potentially setting standards for unconstitutional gerrymandering. Additionally, states can create nonpartisan commissions for drawing congressional districts."
