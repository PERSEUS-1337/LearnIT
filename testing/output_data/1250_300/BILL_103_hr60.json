    "content": "SECTION 1. CREDIT FOR PURCHASE OF PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE BY FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYER. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section allowing a credit for the purchase of a principal residence by a first-time homebuyer. The tax code allows a credit for first-time homebuyers equal to 10% of the purchase price of their first principal residence, capped at $2,500. A first-time homebuyer is defined as an individual who has not owned a principal residence in the past 3 years, and all joint owners must also be first-time homebuyers. The tax code provides a credit for first-time homebuyers, where all joint owners must be first-time homebuyers. The maximum credit is allocated among all individuals purchasing the residence, and certain individuals are ineligible if specific conditions apply. For first-time homebuyers, ownership interest excludes certain deed contracts. The eligibility period for purchasing a residence begins on the enactment date, with specific criteria for binding contracts. The term 'purchase' refers to acquiring property under specific conditions, excluding certain relationships and basis determinations. The adjusted basis of property acquired from a decedent or the person from whom it was acquired, the definition of principal residence, and the meaning of purchase price are important terms in tax law. Any excess credit beyond the limit imposed by other sections can be carried over to the next taxable year, with a 5-year limit on carryforwards. The tax law allows for a carryforward of excess credit to the next taxable year, with a 5-year limit. If a taxpayer disposes of property within 36 months of acquiring it, the tax for that year is increased by the amount of the credit allowed for the property purchase. If the taxpayer buys a new principal residence within the applicable period after the disposition, the increased tax does not apply. If a taxpayer disposes of property within 36 months of acquiring it, the tax for that year is increased by the amount of the credit allowed for the property purchase. If the taxpayer buys a new principal residence within the applicable period after the disposition, the increased tax does not apply. If an individual with a legal or equitable interest in a property dies within a 36-month period, or if the old residence is destroyed or converted, or if there is a disposition due to a divorce or legal separation, certain tax implications apply. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years ending after the enactment of this Act."
