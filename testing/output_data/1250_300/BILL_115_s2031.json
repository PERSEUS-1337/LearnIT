    "content": "The \"Kisatchie National Forest Land Conveyance Act\" authorizes the conveyance of certain Federal land in Louisiana for market value consideration. The Act defines terms such as \"Collins Camp Properties\" and \"Secretary\" and pertains to the State of Louisiana. The Secretary is authorized to convey Federal land in Louisiana by quitclaim deed, including a 2.16-acre parcel in Winn Parish. Collins Camp Properties has the first right of purchase within a 1-year period. The Secretary shall convey Federal land to Collins Camp Properties, including 47.92 acres in Winn Parish, Louisiana. The land may be configured to maximize marketability or achieve management objectives, with terms and conditions set by the Secretary. Consideration for the conveyance shall be in the form of cash. The Secretary shall convey Federal land to Collins Camp Properties in Winn Parish, Louisiana, with consideration in cash equal to the market value determined by appraisal or competitive sale. Hazardous substances disclosure is required, but remediation is not mandated. In any conveyance of Federal land under this Act, the Secretary must disclose hazardous substances but is not obligated to remediate them. This does not affect the application of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to the conveyances of Federal land. SEC. 5 states that the proceeds from the sale of Federal land will be deposited into a specific fund. SEC. 6 addresses the administration of the Act. As a condition of conveyance of Federal land to Collins Camp Properties, the Secretary requires payment of appraisal costs and administrative/environmental analysis costs. Collins Camp Properties must provide written statements from holders of Forest Service special use authorizations agreeing to relinquish them. Failure to provide written authorization results in Collins Camp Properties administering the special use authorization according to its terms. The Secretary requires Collins Camp Properties to administer the special use authorization until it expires, as a condition of conveyance of Federal land."
