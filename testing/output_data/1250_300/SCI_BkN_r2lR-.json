    "content": "Identifying analogies across domains without supervision is a key task for artificial intelligence. Recent advances in cross domain image mapping have focused on translating images across domains. The visual fidelity often falls short for identifying matching samples from the other domain. This paper introduces AN-GAN, a matching-by-synthesis approach that outperforms current techniques in finding exact analogies between datasets. The cross-domain mapping task involves domain alignment and learning the mapping function, which can be iteratively solved to improve unsupervised translation quality. Humans excel at making analogies between domains without prior supervision, using previous knowledge to establish strong priors in new situations. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have focused on identifying analogies across domains without supervision. One key problem is mapping images between different domains, such as aerial photos and Google-Maps images. Various approaches have been proposed for unsupervised mapping, where a mapping function is learned to translate images from one domain to another. This is achieved by utilizing distributional constraints to map images accurately between domains. Recent advances in artificial intelligence focus on mapping images between different domains using a mapping function that learns to translate images accurately. The method utilizes distributional and cycle constraints to achieve this. However, the translated images often lack visual fidelity for exact matching. The paper addresses the problem of analogy identification by proposing the addition of exemplar-based constraints to improve the mapping function's performance. In this work, the focus is on analogy identification by adding exemplar-based constraints to improve visual analogy identification performance. The method can find correspondences between sets even when exact analogies are not present in all sample images. By aligning domains and using a two-step approach, the method achieves more accurate results than previous unsupervised mapping approaches. The method aims to identify analogies between datasets without supervision, related to image matching methods and unsupervised style-transfer. It utilizes a two-step approach to align domains and fit a translation function for more accurate results than previous unsupervised mapping approaches. The unsupervised scenario requires generic visual feature matching due to different domains. Standard visual features like multi-layer VGG-16 are ineffective for analogies. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have revolutionized image synthesis, enabling realistic image generation. GAN methods train a generator network to synthesize samples from a target distribution by jointly training a discriminator network. The generative architecture used for image mapping is based on BID12. Unsupervised mapping involves no supervision except for sample images from both domains. Supervised mapping, with matching pairs of input and output images, can be trained directly using GANs. The method described uses GANs for image mapping, specifically employing the U-net architecture. It aims to find matching indexes between two sets of images in different domains A and B. The approach is iterative and does not rely on supervision, allowing for the generation of correspondences between the domains. The iterative approach presented aims to find matching indexes between images in domains A and B using a GAN-based distribution approach. A mapping function T AB is trained to map images from domain A to domain B, optimizing the distribution alignment to appear identical. The discriminator D is trained to distinguish between samples from the mapped distribution and the target distribution, while T AB is optimized to make this task challenging. The distribution-constraint alone is often insufficient in datasets, leading to the addition of constraints like circularity and distance invariance. The cycle approach involves training one-sided GANs in both A \u2192 B and B \u2192 A directions, ensuring that an image translated from A to B and back to A recovers the original image. This method provides matching between samples and synthetic images in the target domain but does not guarantee exact correspondences. The method described in this section aims to provide exact matches between domains by finding a set of indices for every A domain image that corresponds to a B domain image. This allows for training a fully supervised mapping function to obtain high-quality results. The goal is to create a binary match matrix where each proposed match is denoted by a value of 1, while the rest are 0. The method aims to find exact matches between domains by creating a binary match matrix with values of 1 for proposed matches and 0 for the rest. The optimization objective includes a perceptual loss and an entropy constraint to encourage sparse solutions. The relaxed formulation can be optimized using SGD, with the entropy term helping to recover exact correspondences. The AN-GAN method aims to achieve exact matches between domains by utilizing a softmax function. By increasing the significance of the entropy term, solutions can converge to the original correspondence problem. Iteratively updating parameters for N epochs achieves excellent results. AN-GAN combines exemplar and distribution-based constraints in its loss function for cross-domain matching. AN-GAN is a method for cross-domain matching that emphasizes the importance of good initialization of T AB. It utilizes exemplar and distribution-based constraints in its loss function, including distributional loss, cycle loss, and exemplar loss. The optimization problem involves adversarially training discriminators D A and D B. The method includes an initial burn-in period and optimization iterations for different losses. In experiments, the exemplar-loss was optimized for specific iterations and epochs, with a decay in learning rate. Shared \u03b2 parameters were used to inform matching likelihood between image directions. Different loss functions were tested, with perceptual loss yielding the best performance. VGG features were extracted for each image in the loss function. The best performance in experiments was achieved using a perceptual loss function, which extracted VGG features for each image. The loss function also included L1 loss on pixels to consider colors. The method was considered unsupervised matching as the features were off-the-shelf and not tailored to specific domains. Matching experiments were conducted on public datasets to evaluate the approach. The study conducted matching experiments on public datasets using off-the-shelf features. Various scenarios were evaluated, including exact matches, and the method was compared against existing solutions for cross-domain matching. The study evaluated the performance of different methods on public datasets for cross-domain matching. The datasets included building facades, maps, shoes, and handbags. The methods involved using CycleGAN with different loss functions and training iterations. The study compared different methods for cross-domain matching using images of shoes from the Zappos50K dataset and Amazon handbags. The edge images were automatically detected using HED. The datasets were down-sampled to 2k images each for memory complexity. Results showed that matching using pixels or deep features did not solve the task due to differences in the domains. The study compared methods for cross-domain matching using images of shoes from Zappos50K and Amazon handbags. Matching with pixels or deep features did not work due to domain differences. CycleGAN improved matching, but there is room for enhancement. Perceptual features like VGG were used for better performance than pixel matching. The method of matching linear combinations of images was less sensitive to outliers. The study compared methods for cross-domain matching using images of shoes from Zappos50K and Amazon handbags.

Perceptual features like VGG were used for better performance than pixel matching. The method of matching linear combinations of images was less sensitive to outliers. The full-method AN-GAN uses the full exemplar-based loss to optimize the mapping function for improved performance in matching directions. The full-method AN-GAN significantly improved cross-domain matching performance by optimizing the mapping function to ensure each source sample matches the nearest target sample. In experiments with unavailable matches, the method successfully identified correct matches for samples with matches in the other domain, showing the ability to handle scenarios with non-matching pairs. The protocol for partial exact matching is similar to Sec. 4.1.1, with M % of non-matching pairs. Results show that the method can handle scenarios with unmatched examples, achieving a high match rate even with a low exact match ratio. The approach was also tested on scenarios with no exact analogies available, showing promising results. In this experiment, the method was evaluated qualitatively on finding similar matches in cases where an exact match is not available, using the DiscoGAN architecture. Analogies were observed for the Shoes2Handbags dataset, showing that the quality of the mapping affects the matching results. The AN-GAN method produced better analogies compared to DiscoGAN. A two-step approach was suggested for aligning datasets accurately. Our suggested two-step approach involves using AN-GAN to find analogies and then training a mapping function for dataset alignment. We achieved 97% alignment accuracy on the Facades dataset and used Pix2Pix for self-supervised mapping. Our method outperformed CycleGAN in image mapping quality, approaching fully-supervised results. Our self-supervised method using AN-GAN outperforms CycleGAN in image mapping quality and approaches fully-supervised results. The method also shows improved performance on point cloud matching tasks. The experiments were conducted using the Bunny benchmark to find the rigid 3D transformation between reference and target objects. Both CycleGAN and the proposed method used a similar architecture with a fully connected network and a linear affine matrix for mapping. A loss term was added to ensure orthonormality of the weights. The success rate for alignment accuracy was compared between the two methods for different rotation angles. Our method significantly outperforms the baseline results reported in BID17 for large angles in achieving an RMSE alignment accuracy of 0.05. It is effective for low dimensional transformations and settings where exact matches do not exist. The algorithm for cross-domain matching in an unsupervised way introduces the exemplar constraint to improve match performance, outperforming baseline methods on public datasets for full and partial exact matching. The exemplar constraint was introduced to improve match performance in cross-domain matching. The method outperformed baseline methods on public datasets for full and partial exact matching, even in cases where exact matches are not available. Future work includes exploring matching between different modalities like images, speech, and text, requiring the development of new distribution matching algorithms."
