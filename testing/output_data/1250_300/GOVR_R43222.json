Harbor maintenance plays a critical role in facilitating U.S. foreign trade and reducing trade costs. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintaining federal navigation channels, and decisions on harbor maintenance now have a greater impact on the U.S. economy than in 1986. In 1986, Congress established the current harbor maintenance policy, with merchandise trade accounting for 14% of GDP. Now, it accounts for 25%, making decisions on harbor maintenance more impactful on the U.S. economy. The harbor maintenance tax (HMT) supports the cost of maintenance, with a tax rate of 0.125% on cargo and cruise tickets. Revenue from the tax goes into the harbor maintenance trust fund (HMTF) for dredging channels and maintaining ports. Unlike other federal trust funds, HMTF funds can only be used with congressional appropriation. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) is funded by the harbor maintenance tax (HMT) at a rate of 0.125% on cargo and cruise tickets. The HMTF can only be accessed with congressional appropriation. Currently, over half of the annual HMT collected is spent on harbor maintenance, with a balance of $8.5 billion as of July 2013. The fund is expected to receive $2.05 billion in FY2014, with the Administration requesting $923 million for harbor maintenance. Proposed bills in Congress aim to increase spending on harbor maintenance and prevent the accumulation of funds in the trust account. Proposed bills in Congress, such as S. 218 and H.R. 335, would double spending on harbor maintenance by using HMT revenues. H.R. 3080 aims to increase HMTF expenditures annually, with 80% of the prior year's HMT collected to be spent on harbor maintenance by FY2020. This increased spending may impact funding for other Corps activities, requiring adjustments in the energy and water development appropriation to stay within federal budget caps. The HMTF, established in 1986, funds operations and maintenance costs for commercial navigation of harbors and inland harbors in the US. \"Harbors\" must handle cargo, while \"inland harbors\" must currently handle cargo. Definitions have not changed since 1986. The Corps did not conduct a rulemaking. The Corps interprets \"commercial navigation\" as any project authorized by Congress with commercial navigation as a purpose. Most harbor projects are authorized as \"single-purpose\" commercial navigation projects, with O&M costs payable from the HMTF. For \"multi-purpose\" projects, only costs related to commercial navigation are eligible for HMTF recovery. The Corps defines \"high use\" ports as those handling over 10 million tons of freight per year, accounting for 90% of maritime commerce. These ports received two-thirds of HMTF spending in FY2013. \"Moderate use\" ports, handling between 1-10 million tons, received 19% of HMTF spending. \"Low use\" ports, handling 1% of maritime commerce, received 5% of HMTF spending. This distribution is a key aspect of the HMTF debate. In FY2013, high use ports handling over 10 million tons received two-thirds of HMTF spending, while moderate use ports received 19% and low use ports handling 1% of commerce received 5%. This distribution is a key aspect of the HMTF debate, reflected in differences between S. 601 and H.R. 3080 on how funds should be allocated. The debate centers on whether funding should prioritize large commercial ports or spread funding more evenly among all ports. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) allocates funds based on tonnage, with a focus on large commercial cargo ports. Out of 1,228 eligible waterways, 61% carried no cargo and 75% handled little to no cargo. The current metric favors ports based on cargo volume, benefiting those handling oil, chemicals, grains, ores, and coal. A value-based metric could potentially allocate funds differently. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) allocates funds based on tonnage, favoring ports that handle tankers, bulk ships, and container ships. High-use ports received only half of the requested funds in FY2011, while moderate-use and low-use ports received 30% and 10% respectively. Small harbors received significantly less funding compared to the busiest harbors. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund allocates funds based on tonnage, with high-use ports receiving only half of the requested funds in FY2011. Small harbors received significantly less funding compared to the busiest harbors, with low-use harbors receiving 10% of the total amount requested. The most economically significant ports received only half of the funds requested, leading to operational challenges for the 59 busiest commercial shipping channels. Harbor traffic is more concentrated in terms of ship capacity, with 90% of ship traffic occurring at the top 35 ports. The Corps may justify concentrating O&M funds on high-use harbors, but this could hinder the development of moderate-use ports and impact ports with fishing and recreational vessel traffic. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with maintenance work done on 400 to 500 harbors and channels annually. The Corps maintains over 900 coastal channels and harbors, with maintenance work done on 400 to 500 harbors and channels annually. A 2012 study found that the Corps actively maintains only 360 out of more than 1,400 authorized coastal navigation projects. There is uncertainty about whether the Corps is maintaining fewer projects than before, and a lack of systematic evaluation of the economic justification for continued federal investment in harbor projects. The Corps' current policies and management tools are inadequate for identifying inefficient harbor projects and lack procedures for confirming economic viability. Many harbor projects were authorized decades ago, before modern transportation alternatives were available. The 2003 Corps study highlights the need for explicit requirements to reevaluate projects when economic indicators fall below threshold values. In the early 1900s, regular line boats provided scheduled service at 50 Great Lakes ports for passengers and freight. Today, many small harbors are used for pleasure boats, funded by a cargo tax. The Corps prioritizes harbor maintenance projects based on commercial importance, using a Channel Portfolio Tool to allocate funds objectively. Congress has allowed the Corps to divest inland waterways projects not needed for commercial cargo, but the Corps still maintains responsibility for harbor upkeep. The Corps uses a \"Channel Portfolio Tool\" to prioritize funds for harbor maintenance based on commercial importance, using data on tonnage, value, and ship transits. They also use metrics like tonnage, cost per ton, support for commercial fishing, public safety, infrastructure condition, and legal requirements to allocate funds objectively. However, the large number of criteria raises concerns about how many harbor projects may not qualify for priority funding. The 2008 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report recommended creating an advisory committee to provide input on national harbor maintenance projects, but no such committee has been established. A 2010 GAO report expressed concerns that the Corps' criteria for prioritizing projects are not transparent and may not yield the highest return on investment. The Corps' budget process was found to focus more on anticipated rather than demonstrated project performance, although actual performance is considered for completed projects in the Operation and Maintenance program. The Corps' O&M budget reflects actual performance, with a focus on budget priority for completed projects. Opportunity cost is a significant metric for distributing funds efficiently to harbors, although not explicitly mentioned in budget guidance. Former Secretary of the Army emphasized the importance of defining problems within national needs for optimal solutions. Costs of O&M activities funded from the HMTF vary considerably. The Corps' O&M budget focuses on completed projects and cost variations funded from the HMTF. Costs per ton and vessel differ among ports, with smaller ports having higher expenses. O&M expenses at a harbor can fluctuate yearly, and data on waterway usage and expenses have not been jointly analyzed. The HMTF covers federal costs for maintaining harbors up to 45 feet, with a non-federal sponsor responsible for 50% of costs for harbors deeper than 45 feet. S. 601 proposes changes to the non-federal cost share requirement for O&M. Under current law, the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund covers federal costs for maintaining harbors up to 45 feet in depth. For harbors deeper than 45 feet, a non-federal sponsor is responsible for 50% of the additional maintenance costs. S. 601 proposes changes so that local cost-sharing would only be required for channels deeper than 50 feet. New construction projects, such as deepening or widening channels, are not funded by the HMTF but by general government revenues. The federal share of construction costs varies based on harbor depth, ranging from 40% for harbors over 45 feet to 80% for harbors under 20 feet. Berths and private side channels are not eligible for HMTF funding, leading some ports with deep channels to object to this limitation. S. 601 and H.R. 3080 propose changes to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, allowing ports with high revenue to use funds for dredging and sediment removal. This could benefit ports like Los Angeles and Long Beach, potentially reducing funds for other ports. There is a wide variation in HMT generated at harbors, with some generating significant revenue. In 2011, New York harbor generated $132 million, about 15% of total HMT collections. Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors generated a quarter of total HMT collections. The top 15 harbors collect over 75% of total HMT revenue, raising concerns about equity and efficiency. The Corps maintains harbors for public safety, including \"harbors of refuge\" for small craft. Critical harbors of refuge receive priority for O&M funds, along with harbors supporting Coast Guard stations and channels used by passenger ferries. Harbors that support Coast Guard search and rescue stations, \"subsistence harbors\" providing supply to isolated communities, and channels used by passenger ferries may receive priority for O&M funds. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have allocated an additional $30 million for maintenance of \"small, remote, or subsistence\" harbors, urging the Corps to revise criteria for navigation maintenance projects. The Committee urges the Corps to revise criteria for navigation maintenance projects to allocate funds based on economic impact, national defense, and public safety importance. President Clinton proposed phasing out federal funding for recreational harbors not contributing to the HMTF, shifting responsibility to state and local governments. The Clinton Administration proposed shifting responsibility for maintaining harbors to state and local governments, focusing the Corps on national water projects. President Reagan had suggested ending funding for harbors with high maintenance costs, aiming to save $150 million annually. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) was established as a user fee during the Reagan Administration after Congress rejected the idea of local port authorities assessing fees on ships for maintenance. Debate over maintaining underused harbors dates back to the 1950s, with the Corps previously not maintaining harbors with little commercial traffic. In the 1950s, the Corps' policy was not to maintain harbors with little commercial traffic. A 1956 audit found that the Corps was maintaining channels used mainly by recreational boaters or a single shipper, contrary to their policy. The General Accounting Office recommended Congress establish specific policies for determining which navigation projects should be federally funded. In 2011, GAO identified 11 coastal navigation projects of questionable value, receiving $12 million in O&M spending and generating $1.5 million in HMT revenues. The Okeechobee Waterway in Florida was recommended for reclassification as a flood-control project to make it ineligible for HMTF expenditures, but it still received about $30 million from FY1999 to FY2008. Another criticized project, the Anahuac Channel and Trinity River project in Texas, received about $17 million of HMTF funds from FY1999 to FY2008, with no recent cargo movement. The Anahuac Channel and Trinity River project in Texas received $17 million of HMTF funds from FY1999 to FY2008. Recent budget requests have allocated O&M expenses to flood risk mitigation instead of navigation. Recreational boaters on the Great Lakes and in Oregon contribute to the local economy and create jobs, but do not contribute to the HMTF. Federal fuel taxes paid by recreational boaters are used for various boating-related programs and facilities. The use of boat fuel taxes for harbor dredging was supported by some in the recreational boating industry. The Corps initiated a pilot program on the Atlantic Coast to explore local financing feasibility. Key information on HMTF expenditure reports and harbor usage data is not publicly available. The Corps collects data on cargo tonnage and vessel usage for waterways it maintains since 1922. However, there is a discrepancy between the facility nomenclature in its tonnage database and expenditure database. The Corps lacks reports comparing shipping channels' dimensions to authorized dimensions and economic losses from deficiencies. The Navigation Economic Technologies Program aims to develop standardized data for navigation projects. The Corps does not publish estimates of economic loss from deficiencies or the benefits of correcting them. The Navigation Economic Technologies Program (NETS) aims to develop economic tools for navigation improvement evaluation. NETS focuses on economic analysis of construction dredging projects rather than maintenance economics. Congress requested the Corps to estimate the nationwide average availability of authorized channel dimensions from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund starting in FY2014. In July 2012, Congress requested the Corps to estimate the nationwide average availability of authorized channel dimensions from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) starting in FY2014. The Federal Maritime Commission estimated the average HMT payment for a 40-foot shipping container is $109, which is small compared to cargo value but significant against typical freight charges. Shipping a 40-foot container from Asia to the U.S. Midwest costs around $4,000, with an average value of $117,606, resulting in an HMT of $147. Ports near the Canadian and Mexican borders claim the HMT diverts funds. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) collects a small fee of $147 for a 40-foot container, which is about 4% of shipping costs from Asia to the U.S. Midwest. U.S. ports near the Canadian and Mexican borders argue that the HMT diverts cargo to ports in Canada and Mexico due to the lack of a similar tax. A study suggested that removing the HMT could lead to diverting 59,000 to 72,500 containers per year back to U.S. ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell have addressed this issue. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) collects a fee for containers, potentially diverting cargo to Canadian and Mexican ports. Senators Murray and Cantwell plan to replace the HMT with a user fee to reduce incentives for shipping through Canada. The HMT may hinder coastal feeder service, discouraging transshipment of containers at U.S. ports. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMT) collects fees at destination ports, potentially discouraging coastal feeder service. CBP and the Corps estimate $500 million in uncollected HMT from domestic waterborne shippers. Unlike import duties, the HMT is not refundable, affecting price competitiveness of some U.S. exports. Exporters do not pay HMT for port use when exporting a product, but pay on materials transported through ports. The debate over WRDA is in the context of industrial supply chain cost-effectiveness. The debate over WRDA is happening in the context of concerns about industrial supply chain cost-effectiveness. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations are worried about the President's budget requests for Corps O&M not being enough to maintain competitiveness in the global marketplace. The U.S. Departments of Transportation and Commerce have launched the Competitive Supply Chain Initiative to enhance the nation's marine transportation system and improve national competitiveness. Supply chain competitiveness impacts the cost of products in the U.S. and overall national freight infrastructure. The Department of Commerce emphasizes the importance of supply chain competitiveness for national competitiveness and infrastructure. It is crucial for policymakers, management, and academicians to align supply chain and transportation infrastructure with strategic priorities. In 2012, the Corps and the U.S. Department of Transportation signed a memorandum of understanding to improve transportation infrastructure investments. The Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of Transportation signed a memorandum of understanding in 2012 to improve transportation infrastructure investments. President Obama announced an initiative in 2012 to expedite federal permitting for construction projects at five harbors in anticipation of the Panama Canal expansion in 2015. Additionally, a Task Force on Ports was established in response to calls for a more strategic framework for allocating federal investments in ports."
