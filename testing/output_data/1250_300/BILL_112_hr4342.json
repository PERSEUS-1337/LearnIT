    "content": "The \"Waterways Are Vital for the Economy, Energy, Efficiency, and Environment Act of 2012\" or the \"WAVE4 Act\" recognizes the importance of the inland waterways navigation system for the nation's economy, energy reliability, efficiency in transportation of bulk commodities, and environmental protection. The purposes of the Act are to improve program and project management for navigation projects on inland waterways, optimize system reliability, minimize project completion schedules, eliminate delays, and prioritize investments for maximum benefits and reduced risk. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\nQualifying project means a construction or major rehabilitation project for navigation infrastructure of inland and intracoastal waterways authorized before, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act, not completed on the date of enactment, and funded at least in part from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. Major rehabilitation project refers to a project for the restoration of a major project or feature with an estimated cost exceeding $100,000,000. The Secretary of the Army must ensure project managers for qualifying projects receive formal training and certification, are fully certified, provide risk-based cost estimation with 80% confidence level, and undergo independent peer review for projects exceeding $45,000,000 or with public safety concerns or high complexity. The Chief of Engineers determines projects involving high complexity, novel approaches, or significant interagency interest. The Governor of any affected State can request a review. Inland Waterways Users Board members are appointed to project development teams, receive quarterly updates on projects under construction, and are included as signatories on project management plans. A system is established to identify and apply best practices. The project development team and Board appointee are signatories on the project management plan for qualifying projects. A system is established to apply lessons learned from prior projects for better project completion. Evaluation of early contractor involvement procedures is conducted to improve project delivery performance. Additional measures may be implemented to achieve the Act's purposes, such as creating centers of expertise for project design and review. The military construction program includes the creation of centers of expertise for project design, standard designs for inland navigation locks, full-funding contracts, and procedures for recommending new project construction starts using a capital projects business model. SEC. 6. 20-YEAR CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROGRAM. The Secretary of the Army, in collaboration with the Inland Waterways Users Board, must submit a 20-year program for capital investments on inland waterways to Congress. This program should be based on national project-selection criteria and updated annually with any changes to project-specific recommendations. The Secretary of the Army, with the Inland Waterways Users Board, must update a 20-year capital investment program for inland waterways annually, detailing changes to project recommendations and national project-selection criteria. Additionally, a strategic review of the program must be submitted to Congress every 5 years for potential revisions. SEC. 7. COST SHARING FOR QUALIFYING PROJECTS. One-half of construction costs for qualifying projects will be split between the general fund of the Treasury and the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. Dams will be funded solely from the general fund. SEC. 8. LIMITATION ON EXPENDITURES FROM THE INLAND WATERWAYS TRUST FUND. Section 9506 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to limit expenditures from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund for construction or rehabilitation of dams and any rehabilitation expenditure below $100,000,000. Additionally, the Trust Fund cannot be used to cover costs exceeding the total authorized cost of a Federal project. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund cannot pay for costs exceeding the authorized Federal project construction cost, adjusted for inflation and additional agreed-upon amounts. SEC. 9. REVISION TO INLAND WATERWAYS USER FEE. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund financing rate is amended to 20 cents per gallon during 2012 and 26 cents per gallon after 2012."
