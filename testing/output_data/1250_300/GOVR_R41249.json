Mental health parity laws aim to equalize coverage for mental health services with medical and surgical benefits. Prior to 1996, health insurance coverage for mental illness was historically less generous than for physical illnesses, with lower limits, fewer covered services, and higher cost sharing. Mental health parity laws aim to equalize coverage for mental health services with medical and surgical benefits. Policymakers have developed three general approaches to achieving parity: mandated coverage, parity coverage, and full parity approach. Federal mental health parity law prior to the ACA employed a mandated offering parity approach. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements and mandates coverage of certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services in specific financing arrangements. It does not include a comprehensive coverage mandate for mental health services at the federal level, but contains separate provisions mandating coverage for certain plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements and mandates coverage of certain mental health services in specific financing arrangements. It does not include a comprehensive coverage mandate for mental health services at the federal level but contains provisions mandating coverage for certain plans. The ACA does not modify federal mental health parity requirements but expands their applicability to specific financing arrangements. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements and mandates coverage of certain mental health services in specific financing arrangements. Recent data shows that some employers have modified their benefits in response to MHPAEA, with some choosing to drop coverage for mental health services. MHPA was the first federal mental health parity law, employing a mandated offering parity approach with no coverage mandates but requiring partial parity. The MHPA (P.L. 104-204) was the first federal mental health parity law, mandating that annual and lifetime dollar limits on mental health coverage be no less than those for medical services. It amends ERISA, PHSA, and IRC to apply parity coverage requirements to all group health plans. MHPA establishes a small employer exemption and a cost exemption, further amended by MHPAEA. The MHPA (P.L. 104-204) mandated parity in mental health coverage limits with medical services, applying to all group health plans. MHPAEA (P.L. 110-343) expanded requirements to include substance use disorders and clarified exemptions for small employers and cost increases. The MHPAEA significantly amends mental health parity requirements for small employers and clarifies cost exemptions. The federal mental health parity requirements do not apply to the individual market. The ACA extends the applicability of these requirements and mandates coverage of specified mental health services. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to various plan types, including qualified health plans, Medicaid non-managed care benchmark plans, and individual market plans. Small employer exemption remains, but the definition of small employer was expanded. QHPs purchased through an Exchange must cover mental health services starting in 2014. The federal parity law exempts small employers but was expanded under the ACA. Starting in 2014, QHPs from Exchanges must cover mental health services in compliance with federal parity requirements. Medicaid benchmark plans offering mental health services must also comply. The ACA mandates specific mental health service coverage for QHPs, Medicaid plans, and new individual plans. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and new individual plans, ensuring parity with medical services. Federal mental health parity law requires full parity when benefits are offered. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and new individual plans, ensuring parity with medical services. This coverage mandate extends to plans in the small and individual group market. QHPs are required to offer essential health benefits (EHB), which include mental health and substance abuse services. The scope of covered services must be defined through the rulemaking process. Abuse services are a category of covered services within the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) required to be offered by Qualified Health Plans (QHPs). The scope of covered services must be defined through the rulemaking process, with coverage provided for services in 10 broad categories. The ACA mandates Medicaid benchmark plans and new individual plans to offer at least the EHB by January 1, 2014, including mental health services. The ACA mandates Medicaid benchmark plans and new individual plans to offer at least the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) by January 1, 2014, including mental health services. Some states mandate coverage of certain mental health conditions through their parity laws, creating a federal-level requirement for coverage of mental health benefits by insurers. States can require QHPs to cover additional benefits beyond the EHB, but they must assume the cost of those benefits. The ACA mandates Medicaid benchmark plans and new individual plans to offer Essential Health Benefits (EHB) by January 1, 2014, including mental health services. States can require QHPs to cover additional benefits beyond the EHB, but they must assume the cost of those benefits. ACA Section 1311(j) requires federal mental health parity requirements to apply to all QHPs in the same manner as health insurance issuers and group health plans. QHPs offered by the Exchanges will be provided through both the small group and individual markets, with large group plans only allowed to participate starting in 2017. The exemption of small employers from federal mental health parity requirements may impact some plans offered through the Exchange. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to all Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) offered through the Exchanges, including small group and individual markets. The small employer exemption from these requirements is discussed, with ACA Section 1563(c)(4) extending the requirements to the individual market. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to all Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) offered through the Exchanges, including small group and individual markets. The small employer exemption may remain in effect under federal mental health parity law despite the ACA conforming amendment. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may still be in effect, with an expanded definition of \"small employer\" to include those with an average of at least 1, but not more than 100, employees. States have the option to use the pre-ACA definition of small employer until 2016 for plans offered through an Exchange, potentially leading to questions about compliance with federal mental health parity requirements for plans offered to individuals seeking coverage on the individual market. The federal mental health parity requirements may apply differently to plans offered to individuals seeking coverage on the individual market compared to plans offered to single individuals seeking group coverage as an employer. Questions arise regarding the small employer exemption and whether small employer Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) might be exempt from the federal mental health parity requirements. The ACA does not specify if the small employer exemption applies to QHPs in the same manner as health insurance issuers and group health plans. The ACA does not specify if the small employer exemption applies to QHPs in the same manner as health insurance issuers and group health plans. Medicaid managed care plans must comply with federal mental health parity requirements, including plans offering medical, surgical, mental health, or substance use disorder benefits. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, which must comply with treatment limitations and financial requirements. Plans offering EPSDT services are deemed to meet the parity requirement, unlike Medicaid managed care plans. Medicaid benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans are not required to comply with federal mental health parity requirements for annual and lifetime limits and in- and out-of-network covered benefits, unlike Medicaid managed care plans. It is unclear if the parity requirements extend to non-managed care plans under traditional Medicaid. Plans offering EPSDT services are considered to meet the parity requirement, which may impact the coverage terms for mental health and substance abuse services in Medicaid. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to newly eligible Medicaid populations, including those enrolled in benchmark or benchmark-equivalent non-managed care plans. Existing CHIP provisions also apply federal mental health parity requirements. Changes may be needed to align CHIP provisions with ACA redesignations. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to newly eligible Medicaid populations, including those in benchmark or benchmark-equivalent non-managed care plans. Existing CHIP provisions also apply federal mental health parity requirements, which may need alignment with ACA redesignations in SSA Title XXI. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to various Medicaid populations and CHIP plans, aligning with SSA Title XXI. It extends these requirements to individual market plans, QHPs, and certain Medicaid expansion populations. The changes made by the ACA represent an expansion of the federal mental health parity requirements established by MHPA and MHPAEA. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to various Medicaid populations, CHIP plans, individual market plans, QHPs, and certain Medicaid expansion populations. It creates a mandate for coverage of certain mental health services for specific plan types, representing a significant change from federal law prior to the ACA. Small employer exemption is maintained, but questions arise about how small employer plans in the Exchange may be affected. Federal mental health parity requirements are extended to all qualified health plans, but it is unclear if they extend to non-managed care plans. Certain federal mental health parity requirements are extended to Medicaid non-managed care benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, but not all. It is uncertain if these requirements apply to non-managed care plans in traditional Medicaid. The CHIP statute includes two parity provisions, with one having limited reach and the other applying requirements fully to CHIP plans."
