    "content": "The Energy and Water Development appropriations bill includes funding for various agencies, with a proposed budget of $38.02 billion for FY2020, which is 15% lower than the FY2019 appropriation. The bill also includes a 12% increase for DOE nuclear weapons activities. In FY2019, the total appropriations were $44.66 billion, 3% above the FY2018 level. In FY2019, the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill provided $44.66 billion, 3% above the FY2018 level. The bill was signed into law on September 21, 2018. The FY2020 budget proposes substantial reductions in DOE energy research and development programs, including cuts in fossil fuels, nuclear energy, energy efficiency, and renewable energy R&D. The FY2020 budget proposes significant reductions in DOE energy research and development programs. This includes cuts in fossil fuels, nuclear energy, energy efficiency, and renewable energy R&D. Programs targeted for elimination or phaseout include energy efficiency grants, ARPA-E, and loan guarantee programs. Funding reductions are also proposed for USACE, Reclamation, and CUP. Congressional consideration of the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill is influenced by budget enforcement measures from the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established separate limits on defense and nondefense discretionary spending for FY2012 through FY2021. Sequestration would trigger across-the-board cuts if spending limits are breached. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased limits for FY2018 and FY2019 but not for FY2020, resulting in lower limits. A bill to raise limits for FY2020 and FY2021 was reported by the House Budget Committee. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set limits on defense and nondefense spending, with a bill reported to raise limits for FY2020 and FY2021. The Trump Administration's budget request for FY2020 includes a significant decrease in funding for USACE, limiting new studies and construction projects. The FY2020 budget request includes a significant decrease in funding for USACE and Reclamation. The request seeks to limit funding for ongoing projects with benefits at least 2.5 times their costs. The Administration also proposes transferring the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program from USACE to DOE. DOE's budget request includes mandatory proposals related to Power Marketing Administrations. The FY2020 budget request includes proposals to divest assets of Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) like BPA, SWPA, and WAPA, which own transmission infrastructure. The budget projects $5.8 billion in savings over 10 years. Additionally, the budget proposes repealing WAPA's borrowing authority for its Transmission Infrastructure Program and eliminating the statutory requirement for PMAs to limit rates to cover only construction, operations, and maintenance costs. The FY2020 budget proposes divesting assets of Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) like BPA, SWPA, and WAPA, aiming to save $5.8 billion over 10 years. It suggests transitioning PMAs to a market-based rate-setting approach, estimating $1.9 billion in new revenues over a decade. The budget also calls for repealing $3.25 billion in WAPA's borrowing authority for transmission projects, saving $640 million over 10 years. These proposals have faced opposition from various groups and Members of Congress. No legislative action has been taken on them yet. The FY2020 budget proposes terminating the DOE Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Program (SEP), which provide grants for energy efficiency improvements in low-income housing and state energy programs. These programs received $257 million and $55 million respectively in FY2019, despite previous proposals for elimination in FY2018 and FY2019 budgets. The DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) oversees the SEP programs, which received $257 million for weatherization and $55 million for SEP in FY2019. The proposed elimination of grant programs is due to a shift towards early-stage R&D. The Administration's FY2020 budget request includes significant reductions in R&D funding for energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear energy, and fossil energy. This shift focuses DOE resources on early-stage R&D and relies more on the private sector for funding. The FY2020 DOE budget request includes significant reductions in R&D funding for energy research, focusing on early-stage R&D and relying more on the private sector for later-stage research and development. The budget also allocates new funding for a proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV, with $116 million for seeking an NRC license and developing interim nuclear waste storage capacity. The DOE requested $116 million for a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, with $38.5 million allocated to NRC for application consideration. The funding would come from two accounts: $90 million from Nuclear Waste Disposal and $26 million from Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal. Despite previous opposition and lack of funding, DOE submitted a license application in 2008, which was suspended in 2011. The FY2019 appropriations did not include funding for Yucca Mountain or the Senate's nuclear waste pilot program. The FY2020 budget request includes halting further loans and loan guarantees for DOE's loan programs, as well as rescinding unused prior-year authority and unspent appropriations. Additionally, DOE provided $3.7 billion in additional Title 17 loan guarantees for two new reactors after the budget request was submitted. The FY2020 DOE appropriation request includes $169.5 million in unspent appropriations for loan guarantee subsidy costs. $3.7 billion in additional Title 17 loan guarantees were provided for new reactors at the Vogtle nuclear plant. The request also includes $107 million for the U.S. contribution to the ITER project in France. The appropriation request is 19% below the FY2020 level and would pay for components supplied by U.S. companies for the ITER project. The FY2020 DOE appropriation request includes funding for components supplied by U.S. companies for the ITER project in France. The United States is to pay 9% of the project's construction costs, with a total estimated cost between $4.0 billion and $6.5 billion. DOE funding for the project was $122 million in FY2018 and $132 million in FY2019. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget would eliminate ARPA-E and rescind $287 million of the agency's unobligated balances. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget proposes to terminate ARPA-E, despite Congress increasing its funding in previous years. ARPA-E will use its unobligated balances to phase out the program by FY 2022. The FY2020 budget request for DOE Weapons Activities is 12% higher than FY2019, with a focus on nuclear warhead life-extension programs. The FY2020 budget for DOE Weapons Activities includes a 10% increase in funding for nuclear warhead life-extension programs. This includes notable increases for the W80-4 LEP and the initiation of funding for the W87-1 LEP. The budget also includes funding for the W76-2 LEP, a low-yield modification of the current W76 warhead. The FY2020 budget request includes $10 million for the W76-2 LEP, a low-yield modification of the current W76 warhead. NNSA is seeking $51.5 million for surveillance efforts for the B83 gravity bomb, with a 47% increase from FY2019. Funding for Plutonium Sustainment would increase by 97% to $712 million for FY2020 to produce plutonium pits for nuclear warheads. Sustainment funding would increase by 97% to $712 million for FY2020 to produce plutonium pits for nuclear warheads at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Savannah River Site. The Department of Energy's Office of Environmental Management (EM) would see a decrease of $706 million (-10%) in total FY2020 appropriations request for environmental cleanup and waste management activities. The FY2020 budget request includes reductions in Cleanup (-9%), Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup (-20%), and the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund (-15%). There is a proposal to transfer management of the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) from USACE to the Office of Legacy Management (LM). The FY2020 LM budget request includes $141 million for FUSRAP, down from $150 million appropriated in FY2019. USACE will continue cleanup of FUSRAP sites on a reimbursable basis. No markups had been held for FY2020 Energy and Water Development appropriations as of the report publication date.

USACE is an agency in the Department of Defense with military and civilian responsibilities under its civil works program. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is responsible for planning, building, and operating water resources facilities funded by the Energy and Water appropriations bill. Recent omnibus water authorization acts have authorized Corps projects, including the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014, the Water Resources Development Act of 2016, and the Water Resources Development Act of 2018. The Water Resources Development Acts of 2016 and 2018 authorized new US Army Corps of Engineers projects and changed various USACE policies. Unlike other infrastructure programs, federal funds for USACE projects are not distributed based on formulas or competitive grants. USACE is directly involved in planning, designing, and managing cost-shared projects with nonfederal sponsors. Prior to FY2010, Congress identified additional project funding during the appropriations process. Starting in the 112th Congress, earmarks for specific projects became subject to House and Senate approval. Since FY2010, Congress has not added funding at the project level for US Army Corps of Engineers projects. Instead, they have included \"additional funding\" for select categories of projects and provided direction on the use of these funds. The Bureau of Reclamation primarily built large dams and water diversion structures in the West, while the Corps of Engineers focused on flood control and navigation projects. Reclamation's original mission was to develop water supplies for irrigation in arid lands. Reclamation's mission was to develop water supplies for irrigation in arid lands in the West.
