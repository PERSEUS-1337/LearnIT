The term 'baseline budget projection' refers to the projection of current year levels of outlays, receipts, and surplus or deficit into the budget year and future years. It includes both on-budget and off-budget outlays and receipts, with discretionary appropriations subject to statutory limits. A portion of the baseline budget surpluses is used if there is any net reduction in revenues in current legislation affecting revenues.
