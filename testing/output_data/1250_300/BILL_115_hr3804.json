    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safe Communities Act of 2017\". The Congress acknowledges the lack of financial resources for incorporating disaster threats into land use planning, leading to costly relief programs and security responses. It emphasizes the need for federal support in integrating disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness into urban development to reduce post-disaster recovery costs for taxpayers. Disaster response and relief efforts are costly to taxpayers, with a focus on post-disaster recovery rather than mitigation. Planning should incorporate mitigation strategies from various professional fields. Comprehensive planning can reduce risks from natural disasters and terrorist acts, requiring federal and state support for a supportive planning environment. Many states lack land use statutes that support comprehensive planning for safe communities. The Federal Government and States need to provide a supportive statutory context for comprehensive planning, including updating land use statutes to support long-term hazard mitigation and emergency preparedness. Efforts to coordinate State and regional investments with local plans require additional State level planning. Comprehensive urban planning considers the relationship between land use, transportation systems, water facilities, and other critical infrastructure for safe and economically viable communities. Local governments should integrate safety considerations into comprehensive planning efforts, with safe housing being essential for community development. Safe housing is crucial for community development, and comprehensive planning should incorporate modern techniques to ensure a variety of safe housing options are available. Prevailing land use patterns often put people and the environment at risk, especially in poorly regulated rural communities and small towns. The Federal and State governments should support Tribal governments and Native Hawaiian organizations in implementing land use planning to improve housing safety and socioeconomic conditions. The Federal Government and State governments should support Tribal governments and Native Hawaiian organizations in implementing land use planning to improve housing safety and socioeconomic conditions for Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiians. SEC. 3. SAFE COMMUNITIES PLANNING GRANTS. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a grant program to assist States and local governments in developing or revising land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to mitigate natural and human-caused hazards, including acts of terror. This includes creating or revising State and local land use plans that incorporate risk reduction and hazard mitigation, as well as developing comprehensive land use plans for multi-State regions. The grant program aims to assist States and local governments in developing or revising land use planning statutes to mitigate natural and human-caused hazards, including acts of terror. Eligibility for the grant requires demonstrating citizen engagement and multi-jurisdictional cooperation in the planning process. To effectively assess risks from natural hazards and terrorist acts, planning legislation and regulations are created through multi-agency cooperation between Federal, State, and local government agencies. Land use plans include implementation elements with defined roles, responsibilities, and timelines, consistent with capital budget objectives, guiding decisions on future infrastructure development. The legislation requires comprehensive planning that incorporates risk assessment and mitigation into land use plans, urban design guidelines, building codes, and transportation plans. It also mandates updates to these plans over time and adherence to professional planning standards. Grant funds received by State or local governments must be used in accordance with these requirements. The legislation mandates comprehensive planning that integrates risk assessment and mitigation into land use plans, building codes, and transportation plans. Grant funds must be used for purposes such as developing land use policies, assessing critical infrastructure, and updating building codes and zoning regulations. The legislation mandates comprehensive planning integrating risk assessment and mitigation into land use plans, building codes, and transportation plans. Grant funds can be used for developing land use policies, assessing critical infrastructure, updating building codes, and zoning regulations. Grants under subsection (a) are capped at $1,125,000, with a federal share not exceeding 90 percent for project funding.

Grants under subsection (a) are capped at $1,125,000, with a federal share not exceeding 90 percent for project funding. The Secretary shall encourage coordination between Federal land management agencies and State or local planning directors. The Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security will conduct audits to ensure proper use of grant funds. Homeland Security will audit grants to ensure funds are used as specified. Audit results will influence future grant awards. Definitions include land use planning legislation and comprehensive plan. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of terms related to land use planning, including comprehensive plan, state, and state planning director. These terms are crucial for understanding regulations and management of land use and urban development. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to land use planning, including State planning director, local planning director, and Tribal government. These definitions are essential for regulating land use and development on a statewide, local, and tribal level. The curr_chunk focuses on safe communities planning research. The Secretary of Homeland Security will conduct research on best practices in land use and community planning to reduce threats from natural hazards and terrorism. This includes integrating federal facility security with local plans, assessing the impact of security strategies on the community, and using mapping tools for risk assessment. A report to Congress on community security planning will be submitted within 2 years. The Secretary of Homeland Security will report to Congress on best practices in community security and safety planning, evaluating land use codes, software tools for safe development, design standards for residential development, and safety integration into infrastructure planning. Consideration will be given to regional, State, and local differences, with a focus on risk reduction and cost evaluation. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2019 through 2023: $57,250,000 allocated, with $56,250,000 for grants under section 3 and $300,000 for section 4."
