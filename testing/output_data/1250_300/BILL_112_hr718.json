    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Huntington's Disease Parity Act of 2011\". Huntington's Disease is a progressive neurological condition causing physical and mental deterioration. In the US, 30,000 individuals have the disease, with 200,000 at risk. Symptoms include loss of movement control, cognitive decline, and behavioral issues. Adult-onset typically occurs between ages 30-50. Huntington's Disease can lead to decreased motivation, severe depression, and loss of employment, requiring individuals to rely on Social Security Disability Insurance. Despite medical advancements, the Social Security Administration has not updated its rules for evaluating neurological disabilities since 1985. The Social Security Administration has outdated rules for evaluating Huntington's Disease, leading to delays in benefits under the Medicare program. Individuals with the disease often face incapacitation before reaching the age-eligibility requirement of 65 years. In 2000, the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services waived the 24-month waiting period for benefits. The Social Security Administration needs to update its evaluation criteria for Huntington's Disease due to significant incapacitation faced by individuals with the disease. There is a need to remove the 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage, similar to the exemption for individuals with ALS.

The Commissioner of Social Security will update medical and evaluation criteria for disability caused by Adult-Onset and Juvenile Huntington's Disease in consultation with relevant medical organizations.
