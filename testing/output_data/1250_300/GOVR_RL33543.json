    "content": "The report discusses the modernization of U.S. military tactical aircraft, including fighter aircraft, strike fighters, and attack planes. These aircraft are a significant part of U.S. defense capability and spending. Current modernization efforts focus on three main aircraft acquisition programs: the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Air Force F-22 fighter program, and the Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter program. Congress faces decisions in FY2010 regarding the termination of the alternate engine program for the F-35, the procurement of additional F-22s, and the Navy's funding request for nine aircraft. The report discusses FY2010 legislative activity on U.S. tactical aircraft, including the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs. Key issues include the affordability of DOD's modernization plans and the future of the U.S. industrial base. Congress must decide on the procurement of additional F-22s, the Navy's funding request for nine F/A-18E/Fs, and a multiyear procurement arrangement for F/A-18E/Fs and EA-18Gs. The central issues regarding tactical aircraft include the affordability of DOD's modernization plans and the future of the U.S. industrial base. Tactical aircraft are shorter-ranged combat aircraft that operate within a single regional theater of operations. Strategic aircraft, on the other hand, are larger and longer-ranged bombers designed for intercontinental missions. Tactical aircraft, such as fighters, strike fighters, and attack planes, are primarily used for air-to-air and air-to-ground combat operations. They are often referred to as tac air and operate from land bases or aircraft carriers. Tactical aircraft, also known as tac air, operate from land bases or aircraft carriers. They are used for air-to-air combat, air-to-ground combat, close air support, battlefield air interdiction, deep interdiction, and reconnaissance missions. Marine Corps aircraft can operate from Navy ships and land bases, including those with short runways. Some Marine Corps aircraft are VSTOL or STOVL aircraft. The Air Force and Navy operate various tactical aircraft for air-to-air and air-to-ground operations, including F-22, F-15, F-16, A-10, and F/A-18A-F. In early 2009, the DOD had around 3,500 tactical aircraft, with the Air Force having about 2,375 and the Navy and Marine Corps having about 1,125. Modernization efforts focus on three main areas. In early 2009, the DOD had a total inventory of about 3,500 tactical aircraft, with the Air Force having 2,375 and the Navy and Marine Corps having 1,125. Modernization efforts focus on three main aircraft acquisition programs - the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, the Air Force F-22 fighter program, and the Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter program. The F-35 program is DOD's largest weapon procurement program, aiming to acquire 2,456 JSFs for the three services. The F-35 program is the DOD's largest weapon procurement program, aiming to acquire 2,456 JSFs for the three services at an estimated cost of $246 billion. The Air Force is getting the F-35A to replace F-16s and A-10s, the Marine Corps is getting the F-35B to replace F/A-18s and Harriers, and the Navy is getting the F-35C for carrier operations. The FY2010 budget requested funding for 30 F-35s. The administration's proposed FY2010 budget requested funding for the procurement of 30 F-35s, including 10 F-35As for the Air Force, 16 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps, and four F-35Cs for the Navy. The F-22 fighter, also known as the Raptor, is a fifth-generation aircraft with advanced capabilities. The administration wants to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft, while supporters aim for 243 to 250 or more. The F/A-18E/F, or Super Hornet, is a modern Navy strike fighter. The Navy has been procuring F/A-18E/F Super Hornets since FY1997, with a total of 449 purchased through FY2009. The administration's proposed FY2010 budget requested funding for nine more F/A-18E/Fs. The Navy's aircraft carrier air wings rely heavily on Hornets and Super Hornets, with more than 40 in each wing. There are projections of a significant fighter shortfall for both the Air Force and Navy-Marine Corps in the coming years. In 2008, projections showed a potential Air Force fighter shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024. Navy officials also projected a Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, possibly exceeding 200 aircraft by 2018. Some question the Air Force's projections, suggesting they are influenced by assumptions about military threats and organizational constraints rather than actual needs. The Navy's projected shortfall depends on service life extensions for Hornets and procurement rates of F-35Cs and F-35Bs. Additionally, the Air Force announced a plan in 2009 to retire older tactical aircraft to generate savings for other purposes. The Air Force announced a combat air forces restructuring plan in response to the proposed FY2010 defense budget, aiming to retire 249 older tactical aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and A-10s, to generate savings for other program needs. This plan does not include the retirement of five fighters proposed in the budget submission. The restructuring plan seeks to create a smaller and more capable force by accelerating the retirement of approximately 250 aircraft, focusing on higher priority missions. The Air Force's combat air forces restructuring plan aims to retire 249 older tactical aircraft, including F-15 Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, and A-10 Thunderbolt IIs. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley stated that by accepting short-term risk, they can convert legacy fighters and F-22 Raptors into a smaller, more lethal force bridging to fifth-generation fighters like the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. Cost savings of $355 million in FY10 and $3.5 billion over the next five years will be used for advanced capability modifications, procuring munitions, and investing in critical intelligence capabilities. The Air Force's combat air forces restructuring plan aims to retire older tactical aircraft and invest in advanced capabilities. This includes procuring munitions for joint warfighters and critical intelligence capabilities. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz emphasized the need for modernizing the fighter force to maintain an advantage over potential adversaries. The restructuring plan will involve reassigning manpower authorizations to emerging missions such as surveillance operations and nuclear deterrence. The Air Force's combat air forces restructuring plan aims to realign manpower authorizations to prioritize missions like surveillance operations and nuclear deterrence. This includes expanding aircrews for MQ-1 Predator, MQ-9 Reaper, and MC-12 Liberty, adding a fourth B-52 Stratofortress squadron, and enhancing information processing capabilities. Secretary Donley and General Schwartz are committed to revitalizing the nuclear enterprise and deploying 50 unmanned combat air patrols by FY11 to meet current and future challenges. Congress is concerned about the affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing the tactical aircraft force. Secretary Donley highlighted the concern in Congress over the affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing the tactical aircraft force, especially as production of the F-22 and F/A-18E/F winds down. The focus may shift to the affordability of the F-35 program as DOD aims to increase procurement rates. Past plans aimed at acquiring 130 F-35 aircraft per year by 2014-2015, with a significant reduction in potential costs since the 1990s. DOD plans to increase F-35 procurement rates to 130 aircraft per year by 2014-2015, with reductions in planned numbers of Air Force and Navy air wings. The F-35 program aims to reduce costs by acquiring a strike fighter in three common versions for the services. The F-35 program aims to reduce costs for developing, procuring, and operating U.S. tactical aircraft through the acquisition of a strike fighter that can be procured in three common versions for the services. However, the affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plan is uncertain, especially with potential budget constraints in the future. Funding tradeoffs may arise if tactical aircraft modernization plans cannot be fully funded without reducing funding for other DOD programs. Potential funding tradeoffs may arise if DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans cannot be fully funded. This includes tradeoffs between funding for tactical aircraft acquisition programs and non-aircraft systems that can perform similar missions, as well as tradeoffs with other aircraft types like long-range bombers or helicopters. Some argue for less emphasis on tactical aircraft and more on long-range aircraft due to regional anti-access capabilities. The DOD is considering funding tradeoffs between tactical aircraft acquisition programs and other aircraft types like long-range bombers or helicopters. There is also a debate on funding for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) to improve U.S. capabilities for irregular warfare operations. The DOD is considering funding tradeoffs between land-based Air Force tactical aircraft and sea-based Navy and Marine Corps tactical aircraft acquisition programs. The administration's proposal to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft and focus on the F-35A is an example of such a tradeoff. Funding for procurement of F-35s, F-22s, and other aircraft types is being debated. The DOD is considering tradeoffs in funding between Air Force and Navy/Marine Corps tactical aircraft programs. The proposal to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft and focus on the F-35A is an example of such a tradeoff. Funding debates include procurement of F-35s, F-22s, and other aircraft types, with complex questions on costs, capabilities, and technical feasibility being studied and debated for years. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is currently reviewing U.S. military goals and objectives, including the emphasis on irregular warfare operations versus conventional conflict. Some argue for reducing high-capability tactical aircraft procurement in favor of investing in UAVs, UCAVs, special operations helicopters, and other equipment for counterinsurgency and anti-terrorism operations. The Quadrennial Defense Review is considering reducing procurement of high-capability tactical aircraft in favor of investing in UAVs, UCAVs, special operations helicopters, and other equipment for counterinsurgency and anti-terrorism operations. Some argue that advanced aircraft are still necessary due to potential threats from Russian aircraft and SAMs, as well as advancements in aircraft and SAMs from European and Asian countries. Concerns also arise from China and India acquiring advanced fighter aircraft and SAMs, potentially challenging U.S. airpower in the future. Representative Neil Abercrombie has requested a review of these considerations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined DOD's investment planning for tactical fighter and attack aircraft, revealing cost increases, schedule delays, and reduced procurement quantities of new aircraft. The military services plan to spend $109.3 billion on 570 new tactical aircraft and modernizing existing ones over the next 7 years. The F-22A development period doubled, unit costs more than doubled, and the number of aircraft the Air Force can procure has steadily declined. Similar challenges and risks are emerging for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) is facing challenges similar to the F-22A, with increased development costs and slipping procurement schedules. Uncertainty in costs and deliveries makes it difficult to plan and implement modernization efforts effectively. Legacy systems must be sustained until new systems are ready, requiring more funding if new aircraft quantities are reduced or deliveries are delayed. The services are investing an average of about $1.7 billion per year on legacy modifications over the next seven years. There are large pent up demands for unfunded requirements and potential life extension programs. Hard decisions on retiring or extending the life of legacy aircraft must be made soon. DOD lacks a comprehensive investment plan for modernizing fighter and attack aircraft, leading to difficulty in determining capability gaps and duplication of capability. Each military service operates within its own stovepipe to plan and acquire resources for its force structure. The military services lack a comprehensive investment plan for modernizing fighter and attack aircraft, leading to difficulty in determining capability gaps and duplication of capability. Each service operates independently to acquire resources for its force structure, resulting in underperformance in delivering aircraft within desired costs and quantities. Future plans may be unaffordable within projected funding levels, as they rely on unrealistic assumptions about cost, quantity, and delivery schedules for new acquisitions. The GAO recommends that the DOD take decisive actions to shorten cycle times in developing new tactical aircraft and develop an integrated investment strategy for tactical air forces. The CBO conducted a study on the capabilities and costs of the fighter force under the DOD's fiscal year 2009 plans. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) conducted a study on the capabilities and costs of the fighter force under the Department of Defense's fiscal year 2009 plans. The study compares different approaches to modernize the fighter forces and states that modernizing the fleets would significantly increase capability. The services' goals for modernizing their fighter forces over the next several decades would result in a significant increase in capability with state-of-the-art aircraft offering technological advances like increased payload capacity and greater stealth capabilities. Fighter inventories may fall below goals in the coming years, but aggregate capabilities would remain equal to or improve due to enhanced lethality and survivability of new fighters. The modernization of fighter forces aims to increase capability with state-of-the-art aircraft offering technological advances like increased payload capacity and greater stealth capabilities. Alternative approaches include purchasing additional F/A-18E/F Super Hornets or upgraded versions of legacy aircraft for short-term inventory relief and cost savings, albeit with lesser capability improvements. Forces equipped with a mix of fighters and subsonic attack aircraft would offer improved basing flexibility and persistence during air-to-ground missions. Replacing some fighters with attack aircraft could provide comparable air-to-ground weapons capacities to today's forces. The modernization of fighter forces aims to increase capability with state-of-the-art aircraft offering technological advances like increased payload capacity and greater stealth capabilities. Forces equipped with a mix of fighters and attack aircraft would offer improved basing flexibility and persistence during air-to-ground missions. Tactical aircraft acquisition decisions can impact employment levels and the structure of the U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry. The United States currently has two active prime contractors for the production of tactical aircraft\u2014Lockheed and Boeing. Concerns have been raised about potential reduced competition if F/A-18E/F production winds down, leaving only one prime contractor. Questions for Congress include the need for multiple prime contractors, the value of competition for innovation and pricing, and the potential for Boeing to maintain key skills for future competition. The curr_chunk discusses the value of competition at the prime contractor level in the development and procurement of tactical aircraft, focusing on the potential for Boeing to maintain key skills for future competition against Lockheed. It also addresses how decisions on tactical aircraft programs could impact U.S. export earnings and the international competitiveness of the aerospace industry. Legislative activity for FY2010 related to tactical aircraft modernization is presented, with a specific mention of a report requirement on \"4.5\"-generation fighter procurement. The provision discusses the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation fighter aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and F/A-18s with upgrades. It requires a report on the number of aircraft needed for fiscal years 2011-2025, procurement costs, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a cost-benefit analysis. The provision requires a report on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation fighter aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and F/A-18s with upgrades. It includes details on the number of aircraft needed, procurement costs, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a cost-benefit analysis. The Secretary's recommendations on authorizing a multiyear procurement contract for these aircraft must be accompanied by certifications as per section 2306b of title 10, United States Code. The provision requires a report on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation fighter aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and F/A-18s with upgrades. It includes details on the number of aircraft needed, procurement costs, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a cost-benefit analysis. The term '4.5 generation fighter aircraft' refers to current fighter aircraft with advanced capabilities like AESA radar, high capacity data-link, and enhanced avionics, able to deploy advanced armaments. Section 1032 mandates a report on force structure findings from the 2009 Quadrennial Defense Review, focusing on fighter force structure decisions for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. Section 1047 of the provision prohibits the Air Force from retiring fighter aircraft until 90 days after submitting a report to Congress on various aspects of the combat air forces restructuring plan. This includes details on assumed threat capabilities, modeling simulations, unmanned aerial vehicle inventories, and operational risks associated with planned fighter fleets. SEC. 1047 of the provision prohibits the retirement of fighter aircraft and reassignment of Air Force personnel until a report is submitted. Funding is allocated for the continued operation and maintenance of 249 fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. The report under subsection (a) shall include a detailed plan addressing force structure and capability gaps, assessment of threat environment, follow-on mission assignments, criteria for base and fighter selection, environmental analyses, and manpower authorizations for Air Force personnel affected by retirements. The report must include a detailed plan addressing force structure, threat environment assessment, mission assignments, base and fighter selection criteria, environmental analyses, and manpower authorizations for Air Force personnel affected by retirements. Additionally, it should cover funding needed for operation and maintenance costs, personnel, and aircraft procurement in fiscal years 2010 through 2015 if the restructuring plan is not implemented. The report must include a detailed plan addressing force structure, threat environment assessment, mission assignments, base and fighter selection criteria, environmental analyses, and manpower authorizations for Air Force personnel affected by retirements. Additionally, it should cover funding needed for operation and maintenance costs, personnel, and aircraft procurement in fiscal years 2010 through 2015 if the restructuring plan is not implemented. Congress expressed the sense that the Navy should maintain not less than 10 carrier air wings, each with at least 44 strike fighter aircraft, despite the majority not being fifth-generation assets. The House Armed Services Committee is concerned about Air Force plans to retire legacy fighter aircraft, including 112 F-15s, 134 F-15s, and 3 A-10s in addition to previously scheduled retirements. Congress emphasizes the importance of maintaining not less than 10 carrier air wings with at least 44 strike fighter aircraft, even if they are not fifth-generation assets. The Air Force plans to retire 249 legacy fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010, including 112 F-15s, 134 F-15s, and 3 A-10s. Concerns are raised about potential gaps in force structure and capability due to retiring aircraft before replacement ones are available. The committee has identified $344.6 million in funds that could be used for the continued operation and maintenance of the legacy fighters. The committee has identified $200.9 million in unexecutable peacetime operations in the Air Force operating forces budget. They recommend using these funds, totaling $344.6 million, for the continued operation and maintenance of 249 legacy fighters slated for retirement in fiscal year 2010. Additionally, $10.5 million for aircraft procurement should be used for necessary modifications to sustain the fighter aircraft. The Air Force projects a shortfall of approximately 800 fighter aircraft by 2024, which could impact their ability to meet future requirements. The committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a report on the fighter aircraft shortfall by 2024, including alternative solutions like accelerated procurement of fifth generation fighters and fleet management options. The report must address the impact on the Air National Guard and air sovereignty. The report highlights concerns about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, with a potential peak shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. Factors contributing to the shortfall include fiscal year constraints. The committee is concerned about the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, with a potential peak shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. Factors contributing to the shortfall include decisions to reduce F/A-18A through D inventory, delays in the F-35B/C program, and aircraft reaching service life sooner than expected. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to mitigate the naval strike-fighter inventory shortfall. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to mitigate the naval strike-fighter inventory shortfall and recommends a multi-year procurement contract for cost effectiveness. Authorization for the purchase of additional F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft is included in the Act, with a provision to maintain no less than ten carrier air wings with no less than 44 strike-fighters each. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to address the naval strike-fighter inventory shortfall. A report is requested to evaluate extending the service-life of F/A-18A through D aircraft versus procuring more F/A-18E/F aircraft. The Navy is facing an aircraft inventory gap as older F/A-18A-D Hornets retire before the F-35C variant is available. The committee is concerned about the Navy's aircraft inventory gap as older F/A-18A-D Hornets retire before the F-35C variant is available. The Navy projected a shortfall of 69 tactical aircraft in 2017, which could increase to 125 when including Marine Corps requirements. The Chief of Naval Operations now estimates a potential gap of up to 250 aircraft for the Department of the Navy. The committee is disappointed with the Navy's failure to provide a report comparing single versus multiyear procurement costs as mandated. The Chief of Naval Operations estimates a potential gap of up to 250 aircraft for the Department of the Navy due to a shortfall in the tactical air fleet. The Navy's delay in addressing this issue raises concerns about national security risks and reliance on costly solutions like the service life extension program for legacy F/A-18s. Achieving initial operational capability of the F-35C in 2015 is seen as optimistic, and long-term procurement plans are needed to address the carrier strike aircraft shortfall. The Navy is considering a service life extension program (SLEP) for legacy F/A-18s to address a potential aircraft shortfall. The cost and effectiveness of extending the planes' flight hours to 10,000 through SLEP are uncertain, raising concerns about the plan's efficiency compared to procuring new aircraft. The committee is concerned about the cost uncertainties of a SLEP to achieve an additional 1,400 flight hours for legacy F/A-18s, which may be inefficient compared to procuring new F/A-18E/F models. The cost per flight hour gained through a SLEP is approximately $18,571, while a new F/A-18E/F would cost $8,333 per flight hour. The Navy should carefully evaluate the costs and benefits of new F/A-18E/F procurements versus investing in a SLEP for legacy aircraft. New F/A-18E/F models offer improved technological capabilities over legacy F/A-18s. The committee notes the benefits of new F/A-18E/F procurements over investing in a SLEP for legacy aircraft. New F/A-18E/F models offer improved technological capabilities, including radar, avionics, refueling system, and weapon hard points. The Navy projects the F/A-18E/F to remain in the fleet until 2040. The Department of Defense plans to review tactical aircraft forces in the Quadrennial Defense Review. The committee expects analysis on multiyear procurement for the F/A-18, including cost differentials and tradeoffs between SLEP and new procurements. The committee expects the Department to analyze multiyear procurement for the F/A-18, comparing costs between single year and multiyear strategies, and tradeoffs between SLEP and new procurements. This analysis should inform tactical aviation procurement strategies based on the Quadrennial Defense Review. Addressing the strike-fighter shortfall is urgent, as highlighted in testimony before the committee. Additionally, a provision in H.R. 2647 / P.L. 111-84 requires a report on the procurement of \"4.5\"-generation fighter aircraft. Section 131 of H.R. 2647 / P.L. 111-84 mandates the Department of Defense to submit a report to Congress on the procurement of 4.5-generation fighter aircraft within 90 days of the enactment of the Act. The report should include factors influencing decisions on fighter force structure for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. Additionally, Section 1075 prohibits the Air Force from retiring fighter aircraft until a report on the combat air forces restructuring plan is submitted to Congress. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress on the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft within 90 days of the Act. The report will detail the number of aircraft needed, estimated procurement costs, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and a comparison of costs and benefits between annual and multiyear contracts. The report will discuss the procurement of 4.5 generation fighter aircraft, including costs, potential savings from multiyear contracts, and comparisons between annual and multiyear procurement methods. It will also address the availability of F-35 aircraft for the Air National Guard from 2015 to 2025. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report with a classified annex to the congressional defense committees concurrent with the 2009 quadrennial defense review. The report includes analyses supporting force structure findings and changes to minimum military requirements for major military capabilities. Major military capabilities are defined as determined by the Secretary, discussed in the 2006 quadrennial defense review, or described in specific sections of title 10, United States Code. The Secretary of the Air Force is prohibited from retiring any fighter aircraft or reassigning personnel associated with the Combat Air Forces restructuring plan until a report is submitted. The report must address force structure and capability gaps, assess the current threat environment and capabilities, outline mission assignments for affected bases, and explain the criteria used for decision-making. The report must address force structure and capability gaps, assess the current threat environment and capabilities, outline mission assignments for affected bases, explain criteria for decision-making, describe environmental analyses, identify manpower authorizations, detail funding needs for fiscal years 2010-2015, estimate cost avoidance, and describe future investments for the remaining fighter force. The report must address force structure and capability gaps, assess the current threat environment and capabilities, outline mission assignments for affected bases, explain decision-making criteria, describe environmental analyses, identify manpower authorizations, detail funding needs for fiscal years 2010-2015, estimate cost avoidance, and describe future investments for the remaining fighter force to ensure its service life and modernization. The prohibition on retiring five fighter aircraft in fiscal year 2010 does not apply. Congress finds that the Navy should maintain 10 carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighter aircraft per wing, in addition to the required 11 operational aircraft carriers. The sense of Congress is that the Navy should maintain 10 carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighter aircraft per wing, in addition to any other aircraft associated with the air wing. The Department of the Air Force's investment strategy aims to transition to a smaller, more flexible, lethal, and capable strike fighter force, which will be challenging to implement. The Department of the Air Force plans to transition to a smaller, more flexible, and capable strike fighter force. They may consider procuring additional 4.5 generation fighter aircraft under a multiyear contract, specifically F-15, F-16, and F-18 with advanced capabilities. The goal is to provide Congress with the necessary analysis to support a potential multiyear purchase. The House Appropriations Committee expresses concerns about the lack of detail and analysis provided regarding the Air Force's Combat Air Force restructure plan, which includes retiring 248 legacy F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft. The House Appropriations Committee is concerned about the lack of detail and analysis in the Air Force's plan to retire 248 legacy F-15, F-16, and A-10 aircraft. They are also worried about the personnel and acquisition costs related to removing F-15 training from Tyndall Air Force Base. The Committee requests a cost benefit analysis of this proposal for Tyndall Air Force Base and Kingsley Field in Oregon within 180 days. The House Appropriations Committee requests a detailed report on the impact of retiring legacy aircraft and relocating F-15 training from Tyndall Air Force Base and Kingsley Field in Oregon within 180 days. The report should analyze factors affecting F-15 training quality, identify training locations, assess simulator access, instructor base quality, construction requirements, and costs. Additionally, the Department is asked to identify airfields with shared runways for Air Force and commercial operations and provide analysis on training and operational mission impacts at these bases. The Committee requests a report on the impact of retiring legacy aircraft and relocating F-15 training within the continental United States. An independent review by a Federally Funded Research and Development Center is also directed to assess the impact of the restructure on the Nation's combat air forces. No funds may be obligated on executing the Combat Air Force restructure until all directed reports are submitted. The report highlights the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall due to high operational tempo in overseas contingencies aging the tactical aircraft fleet. The Navy's tactical aircraft fleet, mainly the F-18 variant, is aging faster than planned due to high operational tempo. This has led to critical shortfalls in strike fighter inventory, with over 200 aircraft now predicted to be affected. Delays in the introduction of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter have worsened the situation, along with challenges in extending the life of older F-18 aircraft. Additionally, the Navy's reduction in F-18 purchases in fiscal year 2010 has added to the confusion. The Navy is facing a shortage of F-18 aircraft due to aging fleet and reduced purchases in fiscal year 2010. The recommendation is to enter into another multi-year procurement for F/A-18E/F aircraft to mitigate the shortfall and achieve significant cost savings. The Navy is recommended to enter into a multi-year procurement for F/A-18E/F aircraft to address the strike fighter shortfall and save costs. An additional $108,000,000 is proposed for long lead equipment and cost reduction initiatives for a five-year, 150 aircraft procurement. $495,000,000 is also allocated for the procurement of nine additional F/A-18E/F aircraft. The Senate Appropriations Committee expresses concern about the Navy's strike fighter inventory shortfall due to aging F/A-18 models and delays in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The Committee is concerned about the Navy's strike fighter inventory shortfall due to aging F/A-18 models and delays in the F-35 program. An increase of $512,280,000 is provided for the procurement of nine additional F/A-18s in fiscal year 2010. The Senate approved an amendment prohibiting the Air Force from retiring any tactical aircraft until a detailed plan is submitted to address force structure and capability gaps. The Senate approved an amendment to limit the early retirement of tactical aircraft until the Air Force submits a detailed plan to address force structure and capability gaps resulting from the retirement of those aircraft. The Senate approved an amendment to limit the early retirement of tactical aircraft until the Air Force submits a detailed plan addressing force structure and capability gaps. The plan includes follow-on missions for affected bases, criteria for base and aircraft selection, personnel reassignment, cost avoidance estimates, and investment of funds in the future defense program. This appendix contains Air Force briefing slides on the proposed combat air forces restructuring plan."
