    "content": "Congress has been grappling with the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) for over five years. The IHCIA authorizes various specific Indian Health Service (IHS) programs, including health professional recruitment, mental health services, urban Indian health services, and construction of health facilities. Despite authorizations expiring in FY2001, Congress continues to appropriate funds for these programs. Negotiations have led to multiple reauthorization bills through the 106th-109th Congresses, with proposed changes not always accepted by HHS or other agencies. Proponents both inside and outside of Congress have proposed significant changes to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA). Negotiations have resulted in multiple reauthorization bills from the 106th-109th Congresses, with some proposals not accepted by HHS or other agencies. Bills such as S. 1057 and H.R. 5312 have been introduced, with discussions on Indian health issues ongoing. Congress also faces financial challenges related to Indian trust funds. The federal government's management of Indian trust funds has led to financial claims against the United States by Indian individuals and tribes, with claims totaling as much as $176 billion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) have been reorganized due to these issues. The BIA manages funds, lands, and physical assets held in trust for Indian tribes and individuals, with trust lands totaling about 56 million acres. The asset value of the funds is about $3.3 billion, with $2.9 billion in tribal accounts and $400 million in Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts. The Treasury Department oversees the accounts and makes payments to beneficiaries. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) were reorganized due to financial claims against the United States totaling $176 billion. The BIA manages trust funds, lands, and assets for Indian tribes and individuals, with trust lands totaling 56 million acres and funds valued at $3.3 billion. A class action suit was filed in 1996 demanding an accounting of funds and correction of mismanagement, leading to the current reorganization of the BIA. The Cobell case involves U.S. officials being sued for fund mismanagement and breach of trust duties regarding Indian trust funds. The lawsuit aims to determine the amount of money owed to the plaintiffs and the historical accounting method to be used. DOI and Treasury were ordered to bring trust management up to current standards. The district court decided on the historical accounting method for determining the amount owed to the plaintiffs in the Cobell case. DOI proposed a limited reconciliation of trust account transactions, while the plaintiffs suggested using production and mapping databases for a more comprehensive estimate. The court ordered a full historical accounting without statistical sampling, but the U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the decision twice. DOI estimated compliance costs at $12-13 billion. Congress has mainly addressed the Cobell suit through oversight hearings and provisions in Interior appropriations. The district court has not issued another order on historical accounting, and the DOI continues to carry out its historical accounting plan. Congress has addressed the Cobell suit through oversight hearings and provisions in Interior appropriations, expressing concerns about the costs of the lawsuit potentially impacting trust reform implementation and other Indian programs. Current and future costs include ongoing litigation expenses, a potential $12-$13 billion for court-ordered historical accounting, and a possible Cobell settlement costing as much. Possible future costs for the ongoing litigation include a $12-$13 billion court-ordered historical accounting, a potential Cobell settlement, and the $27.5 billion proposed by Cobell plaintiffs. Funding sources may include discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund.\" Congress may consider various options such as awaiting court actions, delaying accounting, delineating historical accounting obligations, or directing a settlement. Two settlement bills, S. 1439 and H.R. 4322, have been introduced in the 109th Congress to establish an IIM accounting-claim settlement fund. Two bills, S. 1439 and H.R. 4322, introduced in the 109th Congress, aim to establish an IIM accounting-claim settlement fund. The bills propose creating a commission to review Indian trust asset management, increasing payments for individual Indian trust interests, and requiring an annual independent audit of all Indian trust funds. Hearings have been held on these bills, with a Senate mark-up of an amended S. 1439 scheduled but withdrawn at the Administration's request. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee mark-up of an amended S. 1439, with a settlement amount of $8 billion, was scheduled for August 2 but withdrawn at the Administration's request for further negotiations on including IIM land mismanagement claims and funds mismanagement claims under the settlement. The DOI, BIA, and OST have made organizational changes to implement trust management reform since the 1994 Act, including transferring the management of trust funds from BIA to OST in 1996. In April 2003, a new reorganization split BIA trust management operations from other services and created OST field operations to oversee trust management. Tribal leaders and Cobell plaintiffs oppose these changes. The DOI has made organizational changes to implement trust management reform, including creating OST field operations to oversee trust management. Tribal leaders and Cobell plaintiffs oppose the reorganization, citing insufficient consultation and undefined new OST duties. Bills proposing changes in DOI and BIA trust management have not advanced in Congress, but S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 propose to reorganize DOI management of Indian trust assets. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 propose reorganizing DOI management of Indian trust assets. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) regulates gambling on Indian reservations, prohibiting gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988 with exceptions for certain circumstances. Critics argue that these exceptions lead to \"reservation shopping\" and undermine on-reservation economic development intended by Congress. The bills S. 2078 and H.R. 4893 aim to curb exceptions in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that allow for \"reservation shopping\" and undermine on-reservation economic development. These bills remove the exception requiring secretarial and gubernatorial agreement, with limitations for tribes without reservations in 1988, newly recognized tribes, and restored tribes. H.R. 4893 adds a geographic limitation to lands with a \"nexus\" to the tribe and introduces a new exception for tribes landless on the date of its enactment. The bills S. 2078 and H.R. 4893 aim to address exceptions in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act related to \"reservation shopping\" and on-reservation economic development. H.R. 4893 repeals the land claim exception and adds a new exception for tribes landless on the date of enactment, with limits similar to newly recognized tribes. Opponents argue that the bills impose unfair burdens on tribes and raise concerns about tribal sovereignty. Native Hawaiians, not considered Indians under federal law, have federal programs authorized for their benefit. The indigenous people of Hawaii, not recognized as Indians under federal law, lack a political entity like Indian tribes. Congress has authorized federal programs for Native Hawaiians, but without recognition, these programs are at risk of legal challenges. Bills in the 109th Congress aim to establish a process for recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity, separate from BIA programs and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The bills in the 109th Congress aim to establish a process for recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity separate from BIA programs and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Proponents argue that Congress has the power to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity due to its constitutional authority over indigenous native peoples in the United States. They point to established Native Hawaiian programs, such as the Hawaiian homelands program, as evidence of this recognition. Proponents argue that Native Hawaiians have not given up their claims to sovereignty but had it forcibly withdrawn in the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. They maintain a distinct community with cultural and political institutions, similar to Indian tribes. Opponents dispute Congress's authority to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity, citing concerns over constitutionality and the lack of a special responsibility to Native Hawaiians as with Indian tribes. Opponents of recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity argue that it would be based on race alone, setting a precedent for other non-Indian groups. They dispute claims of Native Hawaiian sovereignty and question the constitutionality of such recognition. The U.S. Civil Rights Commission also raised concerns about racial discrimination. Bills similar to S. 147 and H.R. 309 have been debated in previous Congresses. The kingdom granted political rights to non-Native Hawaiians, with sovereignty residing in the monarch. Bills like S. 147 and H.R. 309 were considered in previous Congresses. S. 147 was reported by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 2005. S. 3064, an amended version of S. 147, failed to proceed in the Senate in 2006. H.R. 309 was referred to the House Resources Committee. The House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution also discussed constitutional issues related to H.R. 309 in 2005."
