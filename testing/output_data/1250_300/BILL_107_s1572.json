    "content": "The \"Freedom Consolidation Act of 2001\" may be cited as such. It includes findings. Congress finds that in previous acts, it was declared that certain countries should be invited to become full NATO members to contribute to security in the North Atlantic area. Additionally, there was a call for the prompt admission of specific countries to NATO to promote economic stability and security in Central and Eastern Europe. The European Security Act of 1998 emphasized the importance of including emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe in NATO, not limited to Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia. It highlighted that countries like Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria would enhance stability, freedom, and peace in Europe as NATO members. At the Madrid Summit in July 1997, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic were invited to join NATO, with a declaration stating that further invitations would be extended to nations willing and able to meet membership criteria. The Washington Summit in April 1999 reiterated NATO's commitment to welcoming new members who can uphold the principles of the Treaty and contribute to peace and security in the Euro-Atlantic area. In late 2002, NATO will hold a summit in Prague, Czech Republic, to decide on inviting additional emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to join the Alliance in the next round of NATO enlargement. Countries in the region have expressed their cooperation in seeking NATO membership, with a commitment to fulfilling the objectives of the Treaty. Several countries in Central and Eastern Europe, including Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Croatia, have declared their joint cooperation in seeking NATO membership in the upcoming round of NATO enlargement. This initiative was supported by President George W. Bush, who emphasized the importance of extending NATO membership to all European democracies willing to uphold the responsibilities it entails. The upcoming NATO summit in Prague in late 2002 will address the invitation of new members from the region. Former President William J. Clinton emphasized NATO's commitment to expanding membership to all European democracies willing to share responsibilities and not be used as pawns. He stated that no nation would be automatically excluded, and no country outside NATO would have a veto. The goal is to advance the cause of freedom and prevent a gray zone of insecurity in Europe. Congress reaffirms support for NATO enlargement expressed in previous acts and declarations. It endorses the vision of further NATO enlargement articulated by Presidents Bush and Clinton, urging allies to work towards this goal at the Prague Summit in 2002. Slovakia is designated to receive assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994. Slovakia is designated as eligible to receive assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994, in addition to other countries previously designated for assistance under similar acts. The European Security Act of 1998 designates Slovakia as eligible for assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994, allowing for the possibility of other emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to also receive assistance under the same program. SEC. 5. Authorization of security assistance for countries designated under the NATO Participation Act of 1994. Authorization of Foreign Military Financing for several countries under the Arms Export Control Act for fiscal year 2002, with specific grant amounts allocated for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Romania. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to the Security Assistance Act of 2000."
