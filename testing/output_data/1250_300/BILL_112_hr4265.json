    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Shared Responsibility in Preserving America's Future Act\" and includes a surtax on millionaires contingent on the passage of a balanced budget amendment or spending limit amendment. This surtax is added as a new part to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. For taxable years after 2012 and before 2023, non-corporate taxpayers face a 5% tax on modified adjusted gross income exceeding $1,000,000, with adjustments for inflation starting in 2013. For taxable years after 2012 and before 2023, non-corporate taxpayers are subject to a 5% tax on modified adjusted gross income exceeding $1,000,000, with adjustments for inflation starting in 2013. The threshold amount for married individuals filing separately is one-half of the amount for the taxable year. Modified adjusted gross income is calculated by reducing adjusted gross income by the excess of gross income from a non-passive trade or business. If any adjusted amount is not a multiple of $10,000, it is rounded up to the next highest multiple. The tax code imposes a 5% tax on modified adjusted gross income exceeding $1,000,000 for non-corporate taxpayers. This includes gross income from a non-passive trade or business, with adjustments for inflation. Special rules apply for nonresident alien individuals. Regulations similar to section 469(l) will determine the income considered for taxation. Special rules apply for nonresident alien individuals, citizens, and residents living abroad, and charitable trusts under the tax code. The tax imposed under this section is not considered tax imposed by this chapter for certain purposes. The tax imposed under this section is not considered tax imposed by this chapter for certain purposes, such as determining credits or under section 55. Additionally, the application of this section is contingent on the ratification of a balanced budget or spending limit amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States sets a spending limit. If not certified by the President before September 30, 2012, it won't apply. The amendment must be ratified by December 31, 2017, to take effect. A clerical amendment is made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Section 15 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will not be affected by the amendment on the surtax for millionaires. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years starting after December 31, 2012."
