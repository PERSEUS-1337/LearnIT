    "content": "The environmental impacts of human activity, particularly related to buildings, have become a major concern in recent decades. Buildings, including residential, commercial, and government structures, are recognized as significant contributors to resource depletion, greenhouse gas emissions, and ecological degradation. Their construction, operation, and demolition processes consume vast amounts of resources and produce substantial waste streams, impacting both the environment and human health. Buildings consume resources like electricity, water, and construction materials, leading to high environmental and financial costs. They account for 40% of energy consumption in the US, produce 40% of greenhouse gas emissions, and cost consumers over $430 billion annually. The location of buildings affects stormwater management and transportation energy requirements. Inaccessible buildings may force occupants to commute by car, contributing to traffic congestion and pollution. Occupant health and productivity are also impacted. Green building addresses environmental and health impacts in construction, renovation, and operations of buildings. It aims to improve indoor air quality and reduce pollutants that can lead to \"sick building syndrome.\" Green building has gained popularity since the 1990s and involves various stakeholders such as construction firms, building owners, and occupants. Green building, a concept that emerged in the 1990s, has become a respected approach to construction with various stakeholders involved. This report discusses the definition of green building, major federal policies, tools for ensuring buildings meet green criteria, and issues in its implementation. The modern practice of green building began in the 1990s, with the formation of the Committee on the Environment in 1990 being a milestone in the United States. The modern practice of green building emerged in the 1990s with the formation of the Committee on the Environment within the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the founding of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). Green building encompasses environmentally conscious design principles and strategies to reduce harmful impacts of the built environment, with efforts existing along a design and performance continuum. Some practices may be considered \"greenwashing\" as a marketing tool, while others aim to provide truly sustainable buildings. Some green building practices are criticized as \"greenwashing\" for being indistinguishable from standard building practices used as a marketing tool. However, others aim to significantly reduce environmental impacts, such as zero-impact and minus-impact buildings. Green building is an integrated approach that reduces the environmental footprint of buildings compared to standard practices. The environmental footprint of a structure or activity includes its impact on the environment and human environment. Green building is a relative concept that aims to improve environmental performance through various techniques and strategies. These techniques, such as energy-efficient systems and design features, are implemented to reduce the environmental footprint of buildings. Green building techniques are often decided during the design phase and can impact a building's environmental footprint throughout its lifecycle. The term green building is used interchangeably with sustainable building, which aims to maintain small environmental footprints indefinitely. Another term, high-performance building, includes factors like security in addition to environmental aspects. Federal statutory definitions include optimizing all major high-performance building attributes. High-performance building integrates and optimizes various attributes like energy efficiency, durability, occupant productivity, safety, security, accessibility, cost-benefit, sustainability, and functionality. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established a detailed definition for high-performance green buildings. Green building focuses on specific elements to reduce environmental impact. Green buildings focus on elements such as energy, water, materials, waste, health, siting, transportation, ecology, and smart growth. High-performance buildings also consider serviceability, productivity, functionality, disaster resilience, and climate resilience. This focus has increased due to natural disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown. Green building projects prioritize objectives like energy efficiency, conservation, and the use of renewable energy sources. Factors like climate zone and flood risk influence design choices. Reduced energy footprint is a key element, with techniques including energy-efficient appliances, solar power, and smart-grid innovations. Energy is a crucial element in green building projects, with a focus on energy efficiency, utilization of renewable energy sources, and energy storage technologies. Federal laws set numeric requirements for energy reductions in buildings, with significant potential energy savings from energy efficiency measures. Despite progress in reducing energy intensity, consumption still exceeds goals. Energy should not be the sole focus in green building, as other factors like design choices based on climate zone and flood risk also play a role. In green building projects, energy is crucial but not the sole focus. Water management, including reducing usage and handling rainwater, is also important for cost savings and environmental benefits. Low-impact development techniques can help control stormwater and preserve natural water systems. Low-impact development techniques focus on managing stormwater through natural and engineered infiltration methods, such as green roofs and rain gardens. The choice of materials in construction can significantly impact a building's environmental footprint, with environmentally preferable products reducing resource depletion, pollution, and energy usage. Environmentally preferable materials can have significant recycled content, be made from renewable resources, and designed to reduce health risks. There is debate on what defines such materials due to inconsistencies in measurement methodologies. Waste reduction efforts in construction include source reduction, reuse, recycling, and waste-to-energy methods. Landscaping can also help reduce chemical pollutants. The construction industry can reduce waste through source reduction, recycling, and waste-to-energy methods. Landscaping can also play a role in reducing chemical pollutants. Indoor air quality is crucial for occupant health, with techniques like ventilation and air filtration being key. The importance of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) goes beyond just indoor air quality (IAQ) and includes factors like lighting, climate control, acoustics, and ergonomic design. Building siting can impact environmental footprint, with considerations for transportation access, ecological sensitivity, and climate-related risks. Green building considers factors such as climate-related risks, productivity, and indoor environmental quality (IEQ) to create high-performance buildings. While green buildings can improve occupant productivity, trade-offs between serviceability and other elements may occur. Serviceability is an important aspect of green building design that is often overlooked. In certified green buildings, serviceability is a key objective for high-performance buildings and has received increasing attention in green certification systems. Resistance to hazards like earthquakes, hurricanes, and flooding can increase a building's useful life and allow it to function during disruptions. Climate-resilient design is emphasized, focusing on preparing for severe weather events and climate change. Integration is a salient feature of green building. Green building design, as defined in Executive Order 13693, focuses on preparing for and recovering from severe weather events and climate change. Integration across elements and stages is key to improving performance and minimizing environmental impacts throughout the building's lifecycle. Information technology can enhance integration and performance, while a focus on one element at the expense of others can be counterproductive. The appropriate use of information technology in building operations can enhance performance. Energy efficiency should be balanced with health considerations to prevent issues like mold growth. Green building design emphasizes integration across elements and stages to optimize overall performance. Prioritizing certain elements may be necessary based on constraints or priorities. A focus on different stages in the life cycle of a building is crucial for overall sustainability. Choices made during construction need to consider long-term impacts, such as energy usage during operation. Green building approaches help assess the interconnectedness of various elements and prioritize environmentally preferable products for occupant health and productivity. The approach to green building can reduce problems by assessing the impact of actions on interconnected elements. On-site renewable energy and stormwater management contribute to sustainability. Various systems and tools exist to evaluate green buildings, but determining sustainability is complex. Professional organizations developed rating systems in the 1990s to address this challenge. In the 1990s, professional organizations developed rating and certification systems to standardize green building practices. Rating systems assign points based on criteria in green building design categories, resulting in an overall score and tier ranking. Certification validates that a building meets specified requirements, with objectivity ensured by independent assessments. LEED, developed by the USGBC, is the most prevalent green building certification system in the US. It has been widely recognized as a benchmark for green building design since its launch in 1998. Over 37,300 commercial buildings worldwide have been LEED certified as of April 2017. USGBC offers certifications for various building categories including new construction, existing buildings, interiors, homes, schools, retail, healthcare, and neighborhoods. LEED certification, offered by USGBC, covers various building categories like new construction, existing buildings, interiors, homes, schools, retail, healthcare, and neighborhoods. Certification requires meeting mandatory requirements and earning points in green building elements for levels like Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. Total score determines certification level. The LEED rating system, along with other certification systems like BREEAM, assess buildings based on mandatory requirements and optional points to determine certification levels such as Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. LEED v4 was released in 2013, while BREEAM In-Use is an online system for benchmarking existing commercial building performance introduced in the US in 2017. Unlike LEED, BREEAM In-Use has no prerequisites and allows any existing building to certify improvements. BREEAM In-Use is an online rating system for existing commercial building performance in the United States since 2017. It has no prerequisites and offers ratings from Acceptable to Outstanding based on nine impact categories. Certifications must be renewed annually. Green Globes, developed in Canada, is based on BREEAM and awards between one and four Globes based on points earned across six elements. Like BREEAM, Green Globes has no mandatory provisions for certification. The International Living Future Institute's Living Building Challenge offers three certifications: Living Building Certification, Petal Certification, and Zero Energy Building Certification. Criteria for certification fall into seven performance areas, referred to as \"Petals\": place, water, energy, health and happiness, materials, equity, and beauty. Living Building Certification requires a building to meet requirements in all seven performance areas. Petal Certification requires compliance with no fewer than three of the seven Petals, one of which must be water, energy, or materials. Zero Energy Certification requires a building to generate all of its energy needs on site without using combustion. Zero Energy Certification requires a building to generate all of its energy needs on site without using combustion. Certification under the Living Building Challenge also includes a 12-month assessment of actual building performance. Different green building ratings systems emphasize various aspects and may be more suitable based on local conditions and priorities. Various certification programs exist for improving environmental performance in specific areas such as energy efficiency, indoor air quality, water efficiency, and overall building performance. Several federal statutes and policies impose green building requirements on federal offices and agencies, with some agencies using third-party green building certification systems since the late 1990s. The General Services Administration (GSA) recommends the use of third-party green certification systems, as they simplify compliance with federal guidelines, reduce the need for additional staff, and provide a recognizable label to communicate sustainability efforts. Some agencies have internal policies on certification under available rating systems. The General Services Administration (GSA) recommends using third-party green certification systems to simplify compliance with federal guidelines, reduce the need for additional staff, and communicate sustainability efforts. Agencies can choose to certify under rating systems like LEED or Green Globes, aiming for a LEED Silver rating or Two Globes for new construction and major renovation projects. The Department of Energy's 2014 rulemaking on green building certification does not specify a particular rating system. The 2014 Department of Energy rulemaking on green building certification sets minimum criteria for rating systems eligible for federal agency use. Many states and local jurisdictions require green building certification for government and commercial buildings, with some offering incentives. Green building rating systems have influenced building codes and standards, with codes often being mandatory. Building codes are mandatory regulations that specify minimum requirements for building design and construction. They can cover various aspects of a building's design, from aesthetics to resource use. Green building codes add additional environmental requirements beyond the baseline set by federal regulations. State and local governments often adopt national model codes for regulating buildings within their jurisdictions. Green building codes go beyond minimum building code requirements and can be adopted as mandatory or voluntary measures by state and local governments. These codes specify additional environmental design and performance requirements that can be layered on top of existing building codes. Standards for specific components are often incorporated into model and mandatory building codes, created by recognized standards development organizations. Green building standards are guidelines and criteria for judging a building's environmental performance. They can be achieved through various pathways, including prescriptive, performance, and outcome-based requirements. These standards may be code-intended and adopted by jurisdictions. They are developed through a consensus process involving multiple stakeholders. The International Code Council (ICC) and ASHRAE are the main developers of national green building model codes and standards in the United States. The ICC is responsible for the development of the widely used International Building Code (IBC) and the International Green Construction Code (IgCC), which includes sustainability measures for the entire construction project and its site. The IgCC functions as an overlay code and is fully compatible with existing codes. The International Green Construction Code (IgCC) was released by the ICC in 2012 as the first model code to include sustainability measures for construction projects. It functions as an overlay code that can be adopted alongside existing ICC codes. Municipalities can choose from various compliance pathways to adjust requirements based on local factors. The IgCC covers most building types except low-rise residential buildings, which are referred to the ICC 700 National Green Building Standard (NGBS). The NGBS, developed in partnership with ASHRAE and NAHB, is structured as a rating system and can be adopted by ordinance. The National Green Building Standard (NGBS) is a rating system developed in partnership with ASHRAE and NAHB. Standard 189.1, a high-performance green building standard for nonresidential and residential buildings, includes requirements for site sustainability, energy efficiency, water-use efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and building impacts. Elements of Standard 189.1 have been incorporated into Department of Defense properties. The ICC and ASHRAE have partnered to integrate Standard 189.1 into the 2018 version of the IgCC, aligning it with the LEED rating system. The 2018 version of the IgCC will align with the LEED rating system and incorporate Standard 189.1 as its technical content. Various federal laws and policies, such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, have provisions related to green building efforts. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) included incentives and requirements for energy and water efficiency in federal buildings. It mandated a 20% reduction in energy consumption by federal buildings by 2015, promoted energy-efficient products procurement, set energy consumption targets for new federal buildings, and required sustainable design principles. It also continued DOE's weatherization assistance program with a goal of 25% improvement by 2012. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) set targets for federal buildings to reduce energy consumption by 30% below existing standards, mandated sustainable design principles, and continued DOE's weatherization assistance program. It also established energy efficiency goals for state plans, funding for rebate programs, Energy Star labeling, and energy conservation standards for products. Agencies were required to purchase Energy Star labeled or energy-efficient products. EPACT 2005 also set energy-efficiency standards for public housing. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) mandated energy efficiency standards for federal buildings and directed agencies to purchase Energy Star labeled or energy-efficient products. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) provided a legislative framework for federal green building efforts, including efficiency standards for appliances and lighting, as well as requirements for energy-efficient lighting in GSA facilities. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) mandated energy efficiency standards for federal buildings, requiring a 30% reduction in total energy consumption by 2015. It also established energy-efficiency standards for residential, commercial, and federal buildings, including a program to assist low-income families with weatherization. Additionally, EISA required the Department of Energy to create an Office of Commercial High-Performance Green Buildings to promote the development of green commercial buildings. EISA increased energy efficiency standards for federal buildings, requiring a 30% reduction in total energy consumption by 2015. It set more stringent goals for new construction and renovations, aiming for a 65% reduction by 2015 and zero-net energy use by 2030. Agencies must use green building certification systems, implement water-conservation guidelines, and install advanced metering devices. The Office of Management and Budget issues scorecards on agency energy management performance twice a year.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated funds for green building projects and energy efficiency initiatives in government facilities, including loans for small businesses and green retrofits for housing. The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 directed GSA to develop leasing provisions to promote energy and water efficiency in commercial buildings. The Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of 2015 directed DOE to study energy efficiency in tenant spaces, collect occupant energy-use information, develop a Tenant Star recognition label, establish energy conservation standards for grid-enabled water heaters, and maintain a public database of energy-related information on commercial and multifamily buildings. President Obama's Executive Order 13693 focused on federal sustainability and replaced previous orders. President Obama signed Executive Order 13693 in 2015, replacing previous orders to establish green building as a key component of federal efforts to reduce environmental impacts and improve resource use efficiency. The order set new targets for federal agencies to achieve by FY2025, including reducing building energy intensity, potable water consumption intensity, and producing clean energy. It also mandated new federal buildings to be designed for net-zero energy, water, and waste by FY2030, and included climate-resilient design elements.

The rise of green building since the 1990s has raised questions about its impacts on market penetration, cost, building performance, and measurement science. The rise of green building since the 1990s has raised questions about its impacts on market penetration, cost, building performance, and measurement science. The building industry is a significant component of the U.S. economy, with green construction spending growing substantially in recent years. Green construction in the United States has seen significant growth, with spending more than tripling from $39 billion in 2008 to $129 billion in 2014. By 2013, green building accounted for 20% of new construction, up from 2% in 2005. It is projected to generate $303.4 billion in GDP between 2015 and 2018, with new institutional construction driving future growth. The percentage of certified-green floorspace is increasing, with 38% of office space certified by LEED or Energy Star in 2016, up from 5% in 2005. Green building efforts have increased significantly in the U.S., with a rise in certified office space from 5% in 2005 to 38% in 2016. However, there is still a large portion of buildings not meeting green criteria, making retrofitting challenging. The financial impact of green building includes initial construction costs, operating expenses, rental rates, and property values. The true costs of implementing green measures are not always clear, leading to distorted perceptions of economic benefits. Limited empirical evidence exists on the financial performance of green building investments. The financial performance of green building investments is difficult to generalize due to the higher perceived initial costs. Construction costs for green buildings may not be substantially higher than conventional buildings, according to a DOE review. The use of integrated design may help mitigate costs. The DOE review found that green building construction costs are comparable to conventional buildings. Integrated design can reduce initial costs. Green buildings can save on operational costs through reduced utility usage and selling renewable energy. Studies show green certification is linked to lower utility expenses, but its impact on overall operating costs is mixed. Green certification may not significantly reduce overall operating expenses for commercial buildings, but green-labeled buildings can command price premiums in the real estate market. However, challenges such as short-term ownership or leasing can hinder the financial return on green building investments. The return on investment for owners depends on premium charges to tenants, while tenants would benefit more from long-term tenure. This split-incentive problem can limit the potential benefits of green building. The return on investments for tenants in green building renovations may be limited by the length of their tenure, known as the split-incentive problem. Constraints on capital availability can also hinder potential beneficiaries, such as educational institutions and hospitals. However, cost barriers are decreasing as green building practices become more widespread, with financial incentives making investments more financially attractive. The \"triple bottom line\" concept considers social and environmental returns in addition to financial ones when assessing green building investments. The \"triple bottom line\" concept in green building considers social and environmental returns along with financial ones. Green building efforts need to differentiate between design and performance, as factors like maintenance, alterations, and changes in building use can impact a building's environmental performance post-certification. This raises uncertainty about whether a green building will outperform a conventional one in practice. Studies have shown that green buildings may not always perform significantly better than conventional buildings due to factors like changes in building use and occupancy. Even though green building efforts have helped reduce energy-use intensity in newer homes, the overall energy consumption is higher due to larger size and more electronic devices. The energy performance of green buildings often differs from predicted models, raising concerns about their actual efficiency. The performance gap in green buildings, referred to as a \"performance gap,\" is a concern in the construction industry. Rating systems like LEED now require postoccupancy performance assessment with building-level energy and water meters. Other systems, such as BREEAM In-Use and Living Building Certification, include performance parameters in certification criteria. Building codes are also moving towards incorporating performance outcomes, such as the 2015 IgCC's outcome-based compliance pathway for energy usage. Building systems may be commissioned to ensure they are designed, installed, tested, and capable of being operated as planned, improving environmental performance, especially for energy use. Organizations can also develop an environmental management system (EMS) with international standards, requiring an explicit environmental policy and commitments to conform to relevant environmental requirements, continuously improve performance, and prevent pollution. An organization must have an explicit environmental policy with commitments to conform to relevant requirements, improve performance, and prevent pollution. Performance measurement in EMS can help meet these commitments. Building monitoring tools like GSAlink can detect faults in equipment and provide resource analytics for effective management. Studies on green building performance show mixed results due to a lack of consensus on criteria and outcomes. A lack of consensus on defining green building criteria and measuring outcomes hinders result comparison. Recent studies show varied energy performance in green buildings, with some falling short of expectations. LEED ratings are primarily used in discussed studies, limiting data on other rating systems in the US market. A study on over 100 LEED-certified buildings found 24% better energy performance on average, but some performed worse. Criticisms of the study included sample bias and inappropriate baselines. A follow-up assessment using the same data found that primary energy savings from LEED certification varied, with Gold and Platinum-certified buildings performing 13% better than average. A study of 22 green federal buildings, most LEED-certified, showed better performance in energy use, water use, operating costs, occupant satisfaction, and carbon emissions compared to the national average. However, some buildings did not meet federal energy consumption requirements, with most consuming more electricity than the national average. The assessment of Arizona's LEED-certified new construction buildings revealed an energy performance gap, with most buildings underperforming in energy use compared to design and baseline simulations. The findings suggest that LEED certification may not consistently reduce building energy consumption, but limitations in sample sizes and access to performance data hinder comprehensive evaluations. Improved access to building performance data is crucial for assessing and enhancing the environmental targets of green buildings. Performance measurement is crucial for ensuring green buildings meet environmental targets and identifying areas for improvement. Methods for measuring green building performance are not well-developed for most elements, with some easier to quantify (like energy and water use) than others. Disagreements may arise on the most relevant metrics, such as energy use intensity (EUI). The Green Building Advisory Committee has proposed alternative methodologies for measuring EUI, including energy use per occupant and area-based EUI. The Green Building Advisory Committee has proposed alternative methodologies for measuring energy use intensity (EUI), including energy use per occupant and area-based EUI. However, accurate building occupancy data is crucial for calculating occupancy-adjusted EUI. Commonly accepted metrics like Energy Star scores may not be highly correlated with intended outcomes. Regular measurement and adjustment of building performance are essential for maintaining environmental performance over time. Eventually, a standard life-cycle assessment may be feasible for whole buildings as federal agencies are required to measure performance. The Green Building Advisory Committee has proposed alternative methodologies for measuring energy use intensity (EUI), including energy use per occupant and area-based EUI. Accurate building occupancy data is crucial for calculating occupancy-adjusted EUI. Regular measurement and adjustment of building performance are essential for maintaining environmental performance over time. Federal agencies are required to measure the performance of their buildings against specified targets, especially with respect to energy use. Energy performance is compared against a baseline of consumption levels in 2005, but determining an accurate baseline can be challenging without adequate measurement of energy use. Despite the importance of measurement, uncertainties and gaps exist, making effective application challenging. Consensus on specific measurement goals or metrics may not exist, and obtaining reliable and consistent data can be difficult. Measurement science related to green building is an active area of research, with the development of appropriate measurement science identified as a top research need for progress in green building. Measurement science in green building is a key research area, with a focus on developing metrics and tools for building sustainability. Federal agencies track progress towards green building goals through annual sustainability scorecards, which assess areas like GHG emission reductions, energy intensity, renewable energy use, water intensity, and fleet petroleum use. The scorecards provide numeric reports and color scores to indicate progress, with a green score being favorable. The federal agencies track progress towards green building goals through annual sustainability scorecards, which include numeric reports and color scores indicating agency progress. A green score signifies meeting or being on track to meet the target, yellow shows some progress, and red indicates lack of progress. Some agencies have surpassed the 15% compliance target for buildings with over 5,000 square feet, while others are making progress. Several agencies have received a red score for green buildings in FY2015. Several agencies have already achieved the 15% compliance target for buildings with over 5,000 square feet, while others are making progress. At least three agencies have achieved compliance in fewer than 2% of buildings. EISA set a goal for federal facilities to reduce energy intensity by 30% from 2003 levels by 2015, but many agencies did not meet this goal. E.O. 13693 directs agencies to reduce energy intensity by 2.5% per year relative to 2015. E.O. 13514 set a goal for a 26% reduction in potable water intensity between 2007 and 2020, which was replaced by E.O. 13693 in 2015 with a 36% reduction from 2007 levels by 2025. Many agencies have already achieved the earlier goal and are making progress towards the 36% reduction required for 2025. Some critics have concerns about green building certification systems, noting that they vary in rigor and lack caps on performance metrics like energy use. They argue for more integrative and sustainable approaches that go beyond individual buildings to include the built environment as a whole. Some observers worry that new builders may not appreciate the importance of an integrative approach to green building design, viewing green building measures as add-ons rather than integral parts of a project. The limited scientific knowledge base in green building makes it challenging to identify the most appropriate approaches, requiring substantial research to improve understanding. Differences in goals and perspectives among proponents of green building can complicate the identification of objective criteria and approaches. Issues in green building can be compounded by differences in goals and perspectives among proponents. Identifying objective criteria, especially for elements like siting, can be challenging. Congress may need to assess the effectiveness of current federal green building programs and methods for coordination. They may also consider extending efforts to support green building adoption nationwide and prioritize elements like siting. Congressional actions could include appropriations, new statutory requirements, and tax law changes to facilitate scientific and technical knowledge growth in green building. Congress could facilitate the growth of scientific and technical knowledge in green building by taking actions such as appropriations, new statutory requirements, and tax law changes. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified numerous federal initiatives related to green building, but few focus on the integrative aspects discussed in the report. Congress may need to examine how effectively federal agencies are implementing green building programs and their impact on adoption nationwide. Coordination among agencies to assess the performance of initiatives is recommended. Federal agencies are implementing green building programs, including support for energy-efficient mortgages. Congress may need to consider stronger incentives, funding programs, and regulatory actions to promote green building practices nationwide. In 2005, Congress could consider specific appropriations and regulatory actions to accelerate green building adoption, especially in areas like residential renovation. They may also need to enhance current green building efforts in federal agencies and ensure integration and harmonization of activities. Energy efficiency is a key focus due to concerns about fossil fuel imports, climate change, and inefficient energy use in buildings. The text discusses the importance of green building efforts in the United States, highlighting concerns about fossil fuel imports, climate change, and inefficient energy use in buildings. It suggests that Congress should examine the balance of federal efforts in green building and consider whether incremental approaches are sufficient to address national needs. Additionally, it mentions the need for increased funding for R&D in green building, as current levels are deemed suboptimal. According to studies, green building R&D funding is low, with energy being a higher priority. Congress should consider modifying federal funding levels and priorities, creating incentives for private-sector R&D, and ensuring sufficient training for a knowledgeable workforce in green building. Sufficient training and education are available for a knowledgeable workforce in green building construction, certification, and operation, including federal green buildings, schools, and hospitals."
