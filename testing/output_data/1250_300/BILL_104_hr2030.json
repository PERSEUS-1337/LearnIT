    "content": "The \"Parental Choice in Television Act of 1995\" allows parents to choose television programming for their children. The Congress finds that television has a significant influence on children's values and behavior, with some children exposed to up to 11 hours of TV a day. Studies show that exposure to violent programming can lead to aggressive behavior and the acceptance of violence as normal. Children in the United States are exposed to a high amount of violent and sexual content on television, leading to concerns from parents about the negative influences on their children. Parents support technology that allows them to block harmful programming and there is a governmental interest in empowering parents to limit these influences. Providing parents with information about upcoming programming is seen as important in addressing this issue. The government aims to empower parents by providing them with information and tools to block harmful video programming for children. This includes establishing a Television Rating Code based on recommendations from an advisory committee to identify and rate programming containing sexual content. The government aims to empower parents by establishing rules for identifying and rating video programming with sexual or violent content. This includes requiring TV manufacturers to create sets that allow parents to block inappropriate content for children. The government requires TV manufacturers to include circuitry in televisions to block certain programs and channels. Regulations prohibit shipping or importing TVs that do not comply with these rules. The government mandates that TVs must have blocking technology to restrict certain content. Regulations prohibit interstate shipping or importing of non-compliant TVs. The FCC oversees industry standards for blocking technology and ensures TVs can receive specified signals. The FCC will adapt regulations as new video technology emerges to maintain consumer access to blocking services. The FCC will ensure that blocking technology remains available to consumers as new video technology develops. Amendments to the Act include adding new sections for compliance with rating provisions on video programming containing sensitive material. The effective date for these changes is contingent on distributors establishing voluntary rules for rating content.
