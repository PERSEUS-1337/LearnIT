    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Engineering Biology Research and Development Act of 2015\". The Congress finds that cellular and molecular processes can be utilized to develop new products, processes, and systems that benefit society, national security, and the economy. Engineering biology requires a diverse set of skills and long-term research for breakthroughs, necessitating government investment. The Federal Government can support the development of tools and technologies in engineering biology to stay competitive with other countries. A National Engineering Biology Initiative is crucial to maintain the United States' competitive edge in the field. Without necessary resources and a national strategy, the country risks falling behind other nations investing in engineering biology. This initiative can establish new research directions, improve coordination, drive technology transfer, and maximize returns on Federal investment. The Act defines key terms such as \"Advisory Committee,\" \"biomanufacturing,\" and \"engineering biology.\" It also establishes the National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program. The President will implement a National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program to advance societal well-being, national security, and economic productivity. This includes advancing research at the intersection of biological, physical, and information sciences, supporting social science research, expanding the number of researchers with engineering biology training, accelerating commercialization of research, and improving interagency coordination. Program activities will involve sustained support for research through grants to individual investigators. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program will include sustained support for research, education and training of students, tracking economic benefits, and accelerating commercialization of new products and technologies. The National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program aims to quantify economic benefits, accelerate commercialization of new products, and support startup companies through various activities such as identifying research opportunities, fostering partnerships, providing entrepreneurship education, and facilitating proof of concept activities. The Program also focuses on expanding participation by reaching out to undergraduate and minority-serving institutions and promoting research collaborations. The Program aims to expand participation by reaching out to undergraduate and minority-serving institutions, encouraging research collaborations, and addressing ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering biology. The Program in engineering biology focuses on research and development, dissemination of results, and public input through various mechanisms. An interagency committee will be designated to oversee the Program, including representatives from various government agencies. The Interagency Committee, consisting of representatives from various government agencies, will oversee the planning, management, and coordination of the Program in engineering biology. Their responsibilities include coordinating federal research activities, setting goals and priorities, and developing a strategic plan every 5 years to guide the Program's activities and secure long-term funding for interdisciplinary research and development. The Interagency Committee oversees the Program in engineering biology, coordinating research activities, setting goals, and securing long-term funding. The Program supports interdisciplinary research, education, outreach, societal issues, and moving results into application. An interagency budget is proposed annually to maintain a robust research portfolio and ensure funding balance. Plans include utilizing Federal programs for Program advancement. The Interagency Committee oversees the engineering biology research and development portfolio, ensuring funding balance and utilizing Federal programs for Program advancement. They consider recommendations from various groups and prepare an annual report for submission to relevant committees. The Interagency Committee oversees the engineering biology research and development portfolio, ensuring funding balance and utilizing Federal programs for Program advancement. They prepare an annual report for submission to relevant committees, including the Program budget for the fiscal year, agency spending breakdown, assessment of Federal agency implementation, and Small Business Innovation Research awards. SEC. 5. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. The President shall designate an advisory committee on engineering biology research and development with at least 12 members from various sectors to assess the progress, funding, priorities, and societal issues of the Program. The Advisory Committee shall report to the President and the Committee on a regular basis. The Advisory Committee on engineering biology research and development will report every 3 years to the President and relevant committees on the Program's progress and recommendations for improvement. The Federal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to this Committee. The Director of the National Science Foundation will convene a workshop with the National Academies to review ethical, legal, environmental, and societal issues related to engineering biology research. The workshop aims to assess current research, identify gaps, and provide recommendations for addressing research needs. A summary report of the workshop findings will be transmitted to relevant congressional committees within 2 years of the Act's enactment. The National Science Foundation will support basic research at the intersection of biological, physical, and information sciences and engineering, research on environmental and social effects of engineering biology, provide research instrumentation support, and award grants for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The Department of Commerce will establish a bioscience research program to advance standard reference materials and measurements for engineering biology and biomanufacturing. The Department of Commerce will establish a bioscience research program to advance standard reference materials and measurements for engineering biology and biomanufacturing. This program will provide access to user facilities with advanced equipment and technical expertise to inform the development of guidelines for new products and systems in engineering biology. The Department of Energy, as part of the program, will conduct basic research, development, and commercial application activities in engineering biology disciplines such as synthetic biology, biofuel development, biobased materials, and environmental remediation. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will conduct and support research in engineering biology fields, including synthetic biology, related to Earth and space sciences, aeronautics, space technology, and space exploration. They will also award grants to institutions to support graduate students and postdoctoral fellows conducting engineering biology research. The Environmental Protection Agency will support research on how engineering biology products will impact the environment as part of the Program."
