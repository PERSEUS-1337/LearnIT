    "content": "The \"Fairness and Equity Tax Act of 1995\" introduces a minimum tax on certain foreign and foreign-owned corporations under Subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This new part, titled \"Minimum Tax on Certain Foreign and Foreign-Owned Corporations,\" establishes a minimum tax requirement for these entities. The \"Fairness and Equity Tax Act of 1995\" imposes a minimum tax on certain corporations based on their business activities and foreign ownership. The taxable income of these corporations must meet a minimum threshold determined by profit percentage applied to gross receipts. This applies to domestic corporations that are 25% foreign-owned or foreign corporations with income connected to US business. There are exceptions if an alternative method is approved by the Secretary. The \"Fairness and Equity Tax Act of 1995\" imposes a minimum tax on certain corporations based on their business activities and foreign ownership. The taxable income of these corporations must meet a minimum threshold determined by profit percentage applied to gross receipts. An exception exists if a qualified section 482 agreement is in effect with the Secretary for specific business activities. The Secretary may enter into a qualified section 482 agreement with a corporation to reflect taxable income from specific activities. The agreement can have retroactive effects for prior taxable years if deemed necessary. If a corporation's activities cannot be categorized, a minimum tax is imposed instead of the standard rules. In cases where a corporation's activities cannot be categorized, a minimum tax of 35 percent is imposed on gross receipts from property sales or leases. The Secretary may waive this tax in cases of casualty or disaster. Foreign taxes are not considered in determining taxable income, and an applicable profit percentage is set annually by the Secretary. The Secretary sets an applicable profit percentage annually for different business activities based on domestic corporations' average earnings rates. This percentage applies to taxable years starting in the prescribed calendar year. The earnings rate of a domestic corporation is determined by the ratio of adjusted book income to gross receipts from the activities. The tax code defines adjusted book income as financial income without deductions for certain taxes. Definitions for terms like '25-percent foreign-owned' are provided, along with rules for substantial foreign-related transactions. The tax code defines adjusted book income as financial income without deductions for certain taxes. Rules for substantial foreign-related person transactions are based on the aggregate amount involved in transactions with related foreign parties exceeding $2,000,000 or 10 percent of the corporation's gross income. Business activities are categorized by the 3-digit classification of the Standard Industrial Classification Code. The Secretary has the authority to aggregate classifications and use alternative classification systems when appropriate. The amendments in Part VIII regarding the minimum tax on certain foreign and foreign-owned corporations will be effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 1995."
