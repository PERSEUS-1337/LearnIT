    "content": "The NLRA, as amended, governs labor-management relations in the private sector by improving workers' bargaining power. It allows workers to join or form a union, bargain collectively, and protects their right not to join. Employers are required to bargain in good faith with a union chosen by the majority of employees. The NLRA allows workers to bargain collectively over wages, hours, and conditions of employment. Employers must bargain in good faith with a union chosen by the majority of employees. The act defines unfair labor practices to protect the rights of employers and workers. The NLRB administers and enforces the NLRA, resolving objections to elections and hearing appeals of unfair labor practices. The NLRB oversees secret ballot elections, investigates unfair labor practice complaints, and supervises regional offices. A bargaining unit is a group of employees with similar interests in wages and working conditions, determined based on a \"community of interest.\" Guards cannot be in the same unit as other employees, and the appropriate unit is decided by the NLRB if not agreed upon by the union and employer. In a 2011 case, the board reviewed an employer's argument against a group of employees seeking union representation as a bargaining unit. In August 2011, the NLRB reviewed a case where CNAs at a healthcare center petitioned to be represented by the United Steelworkers. The employer argued that the bargaining unit should include all nonprofessional service and maintenance employees, not just CNAs. The CNAs assist residents with daily tasks, wear nursing uniforms, and work under licensed practical nurses in the facility's nursing department. The CNAs at a healthcare center assist residents with daily tasks, wear nursing uniforms, and work under licensed practical nurses. They are required to obtain and maintain certification from the state of Alabama. The employer argued that other employees with similar educational requirements should be included in the bargaining unit. These employees include resident activity assistants, a staffing coordinator, a maintenance assistant, a medical records clerk, and cooks. The CNAs and other employees receive annual evaluations, pay raises based on evaluations, and the same benefits. Unlike the CNAs, the other employees are not part of the nursing department and do not work specific shifts. The CNAs at a healthcare center, who assist residents with daily tasks, wear nursing uniforms, and work under licensed practical nurses, were granted a bargaining unit by the board. The board determined that the CNAs shared a community of interest due to their distinct training, certification, supervision, pay rates, and work assignments. Rules for union organizing campaigns differ for employers, employees, and union organizers, with exceptions to basic rules. Employers may campaign against unionization. Employers may campaign against unionization and hold captive audience meetings to give their position on unionization. Employees can campaign for union support during work hours in nonwork areas. Distribution of union literature may be restricted to nonwork areas if not allowed in work areas. Employees can distribute union literature in nonwork areas if the employer does not allow it in work areas. They can use work e-mail for union activities if other causes or organizations are allowed to use it. Union organizers cannot campaign on company property but can meet with employees on union property or public property. Nonemployee union organizers may be allowed in the workplace under certain conditions. The NLRA protects the rights of employees and employers in the workplace. Employers cannot interfere with employees' rights to form or join a union, including threatening job loss, closing a plant, or discriminating against union supporters. Union organizers have certain rights to meet with employees on union or public property, distribute literature, and contact employees at home. Under a neutrality agreement, employers may allow organizers onto company property. The NLRA protects employees' rights to form or join a union, prohibiting employers from interfering with union activities. This includes threats of job loss, plant closures, wage discrimination, or unfair treatment. Both employers and unions must bargain in good faith regarding wages, hours, and working conditions. Unfair labor practices can be filed by employees, employers, or unions, leading to investigations by the NLRB. The NLRA aims to prevent and address unfair labor practices, allowing for the filing of charges by employees, employers, or unions. Investigations are conducted by the NLRB to determine violations, with potential remedies including cease-and-desist orders and reinstatement with back pay for improperly fired employees. Appeals can be made to the five-member board for decisions made by administrative law judges. In FY2011, $60.5 million in backpay was awarded for unfair labor practices, with estimates of 1,000 to 3,000 workers illegally fired for union activities annually. Kate Bronfenbrenner found that 25% of union campaigns resulted in workers being fired. The number of unfair labor practice charges filed peaked at 44,063 in FY1980 and stood at 21,629 in FY2012, with 36.4% found to have merit. In FY1980, the number of unfair labor practice charges filed peaked at 44,063, decreasing to 21,629 in FY2012. 36.4% of charges filed in FY2012 were found to have merit. The NLRA states that a union may be designated for collective bargaining by a majority of employees through election, voluntary recognition by the employer, or NLRB order. A union must be certified or recognized before collective bargaining can begin. The NLRB conducts secret ballot elections for union certification. A petition can be filed by a union, worker, or employer, with at least 30% of employees required to sign authorization cards. If a majority of employees in the NLRB-conducted election choose union representation, the union is certified as the bargaining representative. There is no set timetable for holding an election. When a majority of employees in an NLRB-conducted election choose union representation, the union is certified as the bargaining representative. There is no set timetable for holding an election, and certification does not require an initial contract agreement. If an agreement on the election details is not reached, a hearing may be held, and the regional director may direct the election. In a secret ballot election, employees decide on union representation, with a runoff election between the top two choices if no majority is reached. Individual voting rights may be challenged by the employer or union. If there is more than one union on the ballot and no choice receives a majority of the vote, the top two unions face each other in a runoff election. Individual voting rights in an NLRB election can be challenged by the employer or union. The regional director decides whether challenged ballots should be counted if they could impact the election outcome. Either party can file objections to an election, which may be appealed to the board. A union and employer can agree to a secret ballot election conducted by a third party. The NLRB also conducts secret ballot elections for decertifying a union. Employees or a union can file a decertification petition signed by at least 30% of the employees in the bargaining unit. The NLRB allows decertification petitions to be filed by employees or a union with at least 30% of the employees in the bargaining unit. A union certified after a secret ballot election is protected from decertification for a year. The NLRB made changes to representation procedures in December 2011, but implementation was suspended in response to a court decision in May 2012. The NLRB made changes to representation procedures in December 2011, allowing hearing officers to limit pre-election hearings to matters relevant to the question of representation. The rule also consolidated pre-election and post-election requests for review, with parties able to request special permission for review of pre-election decisions. The new rule implemented in December 2011 consolidated pre- and post-election requests for review, with special permission required for review of pre-election decisions in extraordinary circumstances. The rule eliminated the 25-day waiting period for election scheduling and made board review of post-election disputes discretionary. Under the December 22, 2011 rule, board review of post-election disputes became mandatory in stipulated elections. In FY2010, NLRB conducted 1,823 elections with unions winning 62.3% of them. Most elections were based on consent or stipulated agreements, and held within two months of petition filing. In FY2012, 93.9% of initial representation elections were conducted within 56 days. In FY2011, post-election objections and challenges were filed in 115 cases. For objections resulting in an investigative hearing, it took a median of 62 days to issue a decision; for those resolved without a hearing, it took a median of 21 days. The NLRB does not track the time taken for unions and employers to reach a first contract agreement after an election, but a study found that over two-fifths of cases did not reach an agreement within two years. A recent study found that over two-fifths of cases did not reach a contract agreement within two years of winning an NLRB election. The NLRA allows for voluntary union recognition through card check agreements, where a majority or supermajority of employees sign authorization cards. A neutral third party often validates these signatures. Employees under voluntary recognition have 45 days to file a decertification or election petition. A collective bargaining contract may include a card check arrangement for unorganized branches, stores, or divisions of a company. Employees have 45 days under voluntary recognition to file a decertification or election petition. A card check arrangement may be combined with a neutrality agreement where the employer agrees to remain neutral during a union organizing campaign. This agreement may give the union access to company property and employee information. A neutrality agreement allows a union access to company property and employee information. Unions may engage in corporate campaigns to gain employer agreement for a card check campaign. A bargaining order may be issued by the NLRB if unfair labor practices prevent a fair election. A union can be formed if a majority of employees sign authorization cards and the employer engages in unfair labor practices that hinder a fair election. A bargaining order may be issued without a secret ballot election, and can be appealed to higher courts. Certification by the NLRB is only granted after winning a secret ballot election, providing certain protections to the union for a year. Certification of a union provides advantages such as protection from decertification or representation by another union. The duration of an employer's duty to bargain depends on certification or voluntary recognition. An employer may withdraw recognition under certain circumstances. If no contract agreement is reached after a year, the employer can withdraw recognition of the union. Before the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, only a union or employee could request a secret ballot election. Section 9(c) of the Taft-Hartley Act gave employers the right to request an election if they had \"good faith\" doubt that the union was supported by a majority of employees. After the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, employers gained the right to request an election if they had \"good faith\" doubt about union support. The \"Joy Silk doctrine\" required recognition of the union if no doubt existed. By 1969, the doctrine was abandoned, allowing employers to choose between voluntary recognition or requesting an election. In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled that if an employer requests an election, the union must file a petition. The NLRB has since dealt with cases of voluntary recognition. In 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that if an employer insists on an election, the union must file a petition. The NLRB has recently reviewed cases of voluntary recognition, where unions were recognized through card check agreements before collecting authorization card signatures. In December 2003, the UAW and employers at Dana and Metaldyne plants in Ohio entered card check and neutrality agreements. Neutral third parties validated signatures on authorization cards. Decertification petitions were filed by employees after UAW recognition but before contract agreements. NLRB directors dismissed the petitions citing the \"recognition bar\" doctrine. Employees petitioned the NLRB to review dismissals, represented by the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation. The NLRB questioned if voluntary recognition should prevent decertification petitions within a reasonable time. In September 2007, the NLRB issued a decision in both cases. The NLRB addressed the issue of whether voluntary recognition should prevent employees from filing a decertification petition within a reasonable time after entering into a card check agreement. The board ruled that employees have 45 days to file a petition to decertify the union or for a rival union to file an election petition. If a petition is not filed within 45 days of notice of voluntary recognition, an election petition cannot be filed during the recognition bar period. In July 2003, Lamons Gasket and the United Steelworkers (USW) entered into a card check agreement. In November 2009, Lamons Gasket voluntarily recognized the USW as the sole representative of a unit of employees. Following a voluntary recognition, an election petition is barred for a reasonable period of time, defined as at least six months, but not more than a year, after the first bargaining session between the employer and union. The decision in Lamons Gasket overruled previous rulings and followed standards used in the Lee Lumber and Building Material Corporation case. Following the decision in Lamons Gasket, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce requested information from the NLRB regarding cases filed under the Dana decision. Once a union and employer have a collective bargaining agreement, election petitions are subject to a \"contract bar\" for up to three years. In August 2007, the NLRB allowed an employer to withdraw recognition of a union after the third year of a longer-term contract. Shaw's Supermarkets entered into a five-year contract with the UFCW in January 1999. After three years, employees requested a decertification election, but Shaw's withdrew recognition of the union instead. The General Counsel of the NLRB argued that Shaw's should not be allowed to withdraw recognition. The NLRB allowed Shaw's Supermarkets to withdraw recognition of the union during a five-year contract. The board majority agreed that Shaw's acted properly based on evidence of a loss of majority support. The dissenting member suggested a decertification election should have been held. If a union and employer cannot reach a collective bargaining agreement, it may lead to an impasse and potential work stoppage. When a collective bargaining agreement reaches an impasse, it may result in a work stoppage where workers strike or the employer locks out employees. To avoid this, a neutral third party can assist in reaching a contract agreement. Mediation involves a mediator helping the union and employer find common ground, while arbitration involves an arbitrator deciding on the resolution of issues. Arbitration can be used for grievance disputes or determining terms of a new contract. Arbitration can take different forms, including grievance or \"rights\" arbitration and contract or \"interest\" arbitration. Interest arbitration can be voluntary or compulsory, conventional or final-offer, and binding or nonbinding. In final-offer arbitration, the arbitrator may choose between the complete final offers of the employer and union. Voluntary interest arbitration is when both parties agree to arbitration, while compulsory arbitration is required by law. Conventional arbitration allows the arbitrator to decide on a final contract agreement, while final-offer arbitration requires the arbitrator to choose either the union's or the employer's final offer. Final-offer arbitration allows the arbitrator to choose between the complete final offers of the employer and union. The decision can be binding or nonbinding, with the parties having the option to accept or reject the arbitrator's decision. Med-Arb combines mediation and arbitration, where a neutral third party facilitates an agreement and becomes the arbitrator if a settlement cannot be reached. Interest arbitration is used to resolve bargaining impasses, mainly in the public sector where striking is limited. In the private sector, parties may voluntarily use interest arbitration. It can prevent strikes or lockouts but may also change negotiating behavior. Contract negotiations have advantages like preventing strikes or lockouts but may change negotiating behavior. Interest arbitration is used to resolve impasses to avoid strikes or lockouts, but it can also have a chilling effect on negotiations. Strikes can impose costs on both workers and employers, with replaced workers only rehired when jobs become available. Interest arbitration can have adverse effects on bargaining behavior. Parties may not bargain seriously if they believe arbitration will result in a better settlement. It can also create a \"narcotic\" effect, leading parties to rely on arbitration rather than engaging in negotiations. Conventional arbitration may prevent serious negotiations by encouraging extreme positions. Final-offer arbitration is proposed as a solution to this issue. One proposal to address the chilling effect of conventional arbitration is final-offer arbitration. This approach limits the arbitrator to choosing between the last offers of the union or employer, encouraging both parties to compromise and potentially reach a contract settlement on their own. The NLRA does not have a statutory exemption for small businesses, but the NLRB does not certify bargaining units of only one employee or have jurisdiction over employers with low annual revenues. The NLRB does not certify bargaining units of only one employee or have jurisdiction over employers with low annual revenues. The board's jurisdiction is based on employers whose operations affect interstate commerce, with additional administrative standards based on annual sales or gross revenue thresholds. Retail businesses must have annual sales of at least $500,000, hotels and motels must have gross revenues of $500,000, and nonretail businesses must meet specific sales criteria to come under NLRB jurisdiction. The NLRB establishes jurisdictional standards based on annual sales or gross revenue thresholds for businesses affecting interstate commerce. For example, retail businesses need $500,000 in annual sales, hotels and motels require $500,000 in gross revenues, and nonretail businesses must meet specific sales criteria. Private colleges and symphony orchestras need at least $1 million in annual revenue. These standards have been in place since August 1, 1959, as authorized by the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. The NLRB establishes jurisdictional standards based on annual sales or gross revenue thresholds for businesses affecting interstate commerce. The board must assert jurisdiction over a labor dispute if the employer meets the standards in effect on August 1, 1959. However, the board may decline jurisdiction over disputes not substantially affecting interstate commerce. Smaller employers may allow unionization through alternative methods if the board does not assert jurisdiction. Additionally, Section 14(c)(2) of the NLRA allows state agencies or courts to assert jurisdiction over disputes declined by the Board. The NLRB sets jurisdictional standards based on sales or revenue thresholds for businesses affecting interstate commerce. State agencies or courts can assert jurisdiction over disputes declined by the Board. A report estimated that 5 million employees of small employers lack collective bargaining rights under the NLRA. Legislation has been proposed to change union certification procedures. Legislation has been introduced to change current union certification procedures, with proposals including requiring secret ballot selections or certification based on majority employee authorization cards. Arguments for secret ballots include concerns about coercion and pressure, while proponents of card check certification argue that it can prevent employer interference. Research on different certification procedures' effects on union success rates is also reviewed. Unions argue that employers may pressure employees during election campaigns, while proponents of secret ballot elections emphasize privacy and confidentiality. Card check certification is seen as less costly by unions, but employers argue that unionization may be costly for employees due to dues and higher wages. Research suggests that changes in union recognition procedures could impact unionization levels, with unions having a higher success rate with card check certification. Research suggests that changes in union recognition procedures could impact unionization levels in the United States. The union success rate is higher with card check certification than with secret ballots, and unions undertake more drives under this method. Combining card check campaigns with neutrality agreements further increases the success rate. In Canada, automatic card check recognition has shown higher success rates compared to secret ballots, with provinces having varying laws governing union recognition. Mandatory voting in secret ballot elections is required in some provinces, while others allow card check recognition. In Canada, union recognition procedures include mandatory voting in secret ballot elections or automatic card check recognition. A study found that unions have a higher success rate under card check recognition compared to secret ballots. The study analyzed 171 union organizing campaigns in nine provinces between 1978 and 1996. In British Columbia, union certification required card checks until 1984, then switched to secret ballot elections until 1992, and back to card checks in 1993. Mandatory voting was reintroduced in 2001, leading to a decrease in union success rates. After mandatory voting was adopted in 1984, the union success rate fell by 19 percentage points. When card check recognition was reinstated in 1993, the success rate increased by a similar amount. There were about 50% fewer organizing attempts during the mandatory voting period. In Ontario, card check recognition was allowed before 1995, but secret balloting became required in November 1995. A study showed that certification rates were higher with card checks compared to secret ballots. The union success rate dropped from 72.7% to 64.3% under secret balloting. Larger bargaining units were organized under secret balloting, with an average size of 63.1 workers compared to 36.3 employees under card check recognition. The average size of bargaining units certified under secret balloting was 63.1 workers, compared to 36.3 employees under card check recognition. Elections are held within five working days after an application for secret balloting. A study in Canada found that unionization raised short-term unemployment rates. Evidence suggests that card check recognition may be more successful under a neutrality agreement. Union success rates are higher when combining card check and neutrality agreements in the US. The study found that union success rates are higher when card check recognition is combined with a neutrality agreement, with a success rate of 78.2% compared to 62.5% with just a card check agreement. Card check recognition may lead to higher success rates due to less employer opposition and lower costs compared to secret ballot elections. Requiring card check certification may increase union success rates, especially when combined with a neutrality agreement. However, the impact on reversing the decline in private sector unionization in the United States is uncertain. Despite potential benefits, there may be challenges such as employer opposition during the collection of authorization cards. Americans generally support unions, with approval ratings around 59% according to a 2008 Gallup poll. According to recent polls, Americans generally support unions, with 59% approval in August 2008. In March 2009, 53% favor a law making it easier for unions to organize, while 33% agree that Congress should change laws to facilitate union formation. 61% believe a secret ballot is fair for forming a union, while 32% think a majority signing cards should suffice. According to surveys, a majority of workers believe that a secret ballot election is the most fair way to decide on forming a union. However, some workers have reported feeling pressure from management during union organizing campaigns. 22% of 430 workers in a union organizing campaign felt pressure from management, while 6% felt pressure from the union. 5% of workers felt pressured to sign authorization cards in the presence of a union organizer. The NLRA grants private sector workers the right to organize and bargain collectively to improve their bargaining power. Governments intervene in labor markets to enhance competition and efficiency in resource allocation. In competitive labor markets, workers are paid based on their contribution to output, including compensation for unfavorable working conditions. The theory of compensating wage differentials recognizes that individuals have different preferences for working conditions. Increasing workers' bargaining power can lead to higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions, especially in non-competitive labor markets like a monopsony. Increasing the bargaining power of workers through unionization can raise wages, improve benefits, and enhance working conditions. However, in competitive labor markets, this may lead to a misallocation of resources, reducing total economic output and consumer satisfaction. It is challenging to determine the competitiveness of labor markets due to varying factors such as local, regional, national, or international scopes, and the difficulty in measuring competitiveness. Labor market changes can also impact the dynamics of bargaining power. Labor markets can be local, regional, national, or international. Governments may intervene to reduce earnings inequality through measures like unionization. Unions provide workers a \"voice\" in the workplace for dispute resolution and communication with management. Workers can use dispute resolution or formal grievance procedures to communicate with management instead of quitting. Collective bargaining by unionized workers can lead to higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions. The impact of card check certification or secret ballot elections depends on policymakers' objectives. Increasing workers' bargaining power may affect economic efficiency and equality, depending on labor market competitiveness. Requiring card check certification may boost organizing campaigns and union success rates. Requiring card check certification or secret ballot elections can impact unionization rates and economic efficiency, depending on labor market competitiveness. Card check certification may increase unionization and reduce inequality, while secret ballot elections may lower unionization levels and increase earnings inequality. The effects of these changes are difficult to predict or measure accurately."
