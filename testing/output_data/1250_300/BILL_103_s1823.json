    "content": "The \"Video Game Rating Act of 1994\" aims to provide parents with information about video games used in homes or public areas. It defines video games and video devices as interactive computer games in interstate commerce and the video game industry as manufacturers of video games. The Act establishes the Interactive Entertainment Rating Commission. The Interactive Entertainment Rating Commission (the \"Commission\") is established as an independent executive branch establishment. It consists of 5 members appointed by the President, with no more than 3 members affiliated with the same political party. The Chairman is designated by the President, and all members serve until the Commission's termination. Vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment, and the Chairman is compensated at a rate equivalent to the minimum annual pay for level IV of the Executive Schedule. The Chairman and members of the Commission are compensated based on the minimum annual pay for levels IV and V of the Executive Schedule. The Chairman can appoint an executive director and additional staff without following civil service laws. The Chairman of the Commission has the authority to appoint an executive director and additional staff without following civil service laws. The Chairman can also determine their compensation, with limits set by the Executive Schedule. The Commission may hire consultants through contracts and receive funding through appropriations. The Commission can hire consultants through contracts under section 3109 of title 5, United States Code, and set a reasonable user fee to reimburse the United States. The Commission's funding is authorized to carry out its duties until December 31, 1996. The Commission will terminate either on December 31, 1996, or 90 days after submitting a determination to the President on voluntary standards for video game content warnings. The Commission has authority and functions outlined in section 4. The Commission is tasked with coordinating with the video game industry to develop voluntary standards for informing purchasers about the content of video games, particularly violence and sexually explicit material. After a year, they will evaluate the industry's proposed standards to determine if they adequately warn users. If deemed sufficient, the Commission will enforce these standards. The Commission will submit a report to the President and Congress if they determine industry response and voluntary standards are adequate within a year of the Act's enactment. After one year, the Commission may create regulations for video game manufacturers to provide information on violence and sexually explicit content to purchasers and users. Antitrust laws do not apply to joint efforts in the video game industry to create voluntary guidelines for disclosing sex or violence content to consumers. This exemption does not cover actions leading to a boycott."
