    "content": "Climate change responses at the national level in the United States have included monitoring power plant emissions, improving appliance efficiency, and promoting renewable energy sources. Despite these efforts, carbon dioxide emissions have continued to rise. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol and mandatory emissions reductions, focusing instead on voluntary initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The Administration's 2002 Climate Action Report highlighted over 50 programs aimed at addressing climate change. The U.S. climate change policy under the Bush Administration in 2002 focused on voluntary initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Only six out of over 50 programs were regulatory, aimed at achieving energy or environmental goals with a side effect of reducing emissions. Congressional proposals in the 109th Congress aimed to improve monitoring of emissions and implement market-oriented reduction programs. The focus of Congressional proposals in the 109th Congress was on improving monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions and implementing market-oriented reduction programs. This report specifically compares two proposals introduced by Senators McCain and Lieberman in 2005, aimed at reducing U.S. emissions through flexible, market-based mechanisms. The Climate Stewardship Act of 2005, introduced by Senators McCain and Lieberman, aims to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases through flexible, market-based mechanisms. The bill includes provisions for mandatory economy-wide emission reductions, allowing participation in international trading systems and carbon sequestration programs. Residential and agricultural sources of greenhouse gases are excluded from the bill. The draft amendment, based on the National Commission on Energy Policy report, mandates an accelerated reduction in greenhouse gas intensity of the economy. It requires a 2.4% annual reduction in emissions per dollar of GDP from 2010 to 2019, increasing to 2.8% annually after 2019. Implementation is through a market-oriented allowance trading program. Residential and agricultural sources of greenhouse gases are excluded from the bill. The draft amendment proposes an accelerated reduction in greenhouse gas intensity of the economy, with a 2.8% annual reduction in emissions per dollar of GDP after 2019. It includes a cost-limiting safety valve for covered entities to make payments to DOE instead of reducing emissions. The amendment aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity, unlike another proposal that would place an absolute cap on emissions. The draft amendment aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity by implementing a 2.8% annual reduction in emissions per dollar of GDP after 2019. It includes a cost-limiting \"safety valve\" for covered entities to purchase tradeable allowances or make payments to DOE. The proposal differs from another plan by not placing an absolute cap on emissions and allowing for potential growth in overall U.S. emissions based on economic factors. The two proposals differ in various aspects, such as covered entities, primary agency responsibility, credit generation for early action, and utilization of proceeds from allowance sales/auctions. Emission reduction estimates for both options have some uncertainty, with the draft amendment showing a 2.5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 compared to the business-as-usual scenario. The Energy Information Administration's analysis of an earlier version of S. 1151 projected a 6.7% reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2010. The draft amendment would not return greenhouse gas emissions to their 2000 or 1990 levels. CRS estimated a 2.5% reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 compared to EIA's business-as-usual scenario. Emissions would likely continue to increase under both options, albeit more slowly than business-as-usual. In the longer term, emissions could potentially rise faster under the draft amendment. The draft amendment may lead to faster emissions growth compared to S. 1151. The estimated reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 is 2.5%. Emissions are projected to increase under both options, but at a slower rate than business-as-usual. The draft amendment's estimated emission reductions are more uncertain than S. 1151 due to uncertainties in the number of covered entities. Higher coverage leads to more reductions but lower compliance costs, while lower coverage results in greater uncertainty. The draft has uncertainties regarding emission reductions compared to S. 1151, which defines a historic emissions baseline for covered entities to achieve. The draft amendment has uncertainties in emission reductions compared to S. 1151, as it calculates a future baseline from projections of 2009 GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement, which are uncertain variables. The estimated emission reductions are more uncertain due to uncertainties in the number of covered entities. The draft amendment uses a carbon intensity target of 159MMTCE/M$GDP for 2009, but current levels are higher at 183MMTCE/M$GDP. There are uncertainties in coverage and the safety valve triggering, adding uncertainty to emission reductions. The safety valve in the Administration's analysis is projected to be triggered around 2015, adding uncertainty to emission reductions. S. 1151 establishes a firm cap on greenhouse gas emissions based on 2000 levels, with costs influenced by future growth in emissions. Cost estimates for S. 1151 are affected by uncertainties, with potential permit prices ranging from $9 to $15 per ton in 2010. The cost estimates for S. 1151 are uncertain due to various factors such as energy efficiency improvements, non-CO2 greenhouse gas reductions, carbon sequestration, and natural gas supply. The potential permit prices range from $9 to $15 per ton in 2010, illustrating the sensitivity and uncertainty surrounding the costs. In contrast, the draft amendment's cost estimates are less sensitive and require fewer emission reductions than S. 1151. The draft amendment's cost estimates are less sensitive than S. 1151, incorporating economic growth into emissions targets to allow for some increase in future emissions. Fewer offsets are required, leading to lower costs. The draft amendment does not include international credits in its flexible market program, reducing uncertainty and potential costs. The National Commission on Energy Policy set the permit price at $5 per ton in 2010. The draft amendment's safety valve limits potential costs to $7 per ton in nominal 2010 dollars, with a projected permit price of $4.8 - $5.9 per ton in 2001 dollars. Market-based mechanisms focus on emissions levels or compliance costs, allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution. Market-based mechanisms for reducing CO2 emissions focus on setting either acceptable emissions levels or compliance costs, allowing the marketplace to determine the economically efficient solution. This can be achieved through tradeable permit programs or carbon taxes, depending on one's confidence in achieving specific CO2 reduction levels and the associated costs and benefits. A tradeable permit program for CO2 emissions can efficiently reduce emissions by allowing trading of permits, focusing efforts where control costs are lowest. However, including a safety valve may be more appropriate if concerned about potential high control costs to the economy. This approach caps the marginal cost of control but makes the precise level of CO2 reduction less certain. The safety valve on the draft amendment could be seen as a contingent carbon tax, raising a major policy question about economic costs and emission reduction levels. S. 1151 and the draft amendment both aim to limit greenhouse gas emissions through market-based systems, but differ in their approach - S. 1151 establishes an absolute cap on emissions with trading allowed, while the draft amendment focuses more on price mechanisms. Both S. 1151 and the draft amendment aim to establish market-based systems to limit greenhouse gas emissions. S. 1151 proposes an absolute cap on emissions with trading allowed, while the draft amendment focuses on limiting emissions intensity with a cost-limiting safety valve. S. 1151 is expected to result in larger and more certain emissions reductions, while the draft amendment is likely to have lower and more predictable costs. However, both proposals are projected to slow the rate of U.S. emissions growth compared to current forecasts."
