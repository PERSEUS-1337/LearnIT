Former defense minister Irakli Okruashvili accused President Mikheil Saakashvili of ordering him to commit murder, leading to calls for Saakashvili's resignation. Police dispersed demonstrators, resulting in injuries, and the independent Imedi television station was shut down. Saakashvili declared a state of emergency, claiming the events were a Russian-backed coup attempt. International criticism followed the crackdown. Saakashvili declared a state of emergency for 15 days, accusing Russia of orchestrating a coup attempt. He stepped down as president to hold early elections for a clear mandate to deal with foreign threats.

Imedi TV resumed broadcasts and became a platform for opposition candidates. Electoral code amendments were made to enhance democracy. Significant amendments to the electoral code were adopted to make elections more democratic, including adding opposition party representatives to electoral commissions. The adoption of new rules shortly before the election led to haphazard implementation, according to the OSCE. Most observers found the nomination process for presidential candidates to be inclusive and transparent. Saakashvili and six other candidates were successfully registered. Saakashvili campaigned on reducing corruption and crime, improving living conditions, and restoring Georgia's territorial integrity peacefully. Gachechiladze aimed to create a parliamentary system, nominate Zourabichvili as prime minister, and promote private enterprise and poverty alleviation. Gamqrelidze pledged to consider supporting a certain approach. During the election campaign, presidential candidates in Georgia proposed various reforms, including creating a parliamentary system with a constitutional monarchy, boosting social services, and promoting business creation.
