The Congress recognizes the significant contributions of the United States Merchant Marine in various wars, including serving as the Nation's first navy, keeping the lifeline of freedom open during World War II, and facing dangers from enemies. President Franklin D. Roosevelt praised their role as the \"Fourth Arm of Defense\" during the war, with over 250,000 men and women serving in the Merchant Marine. During World War II, the United States Merchant Marine faced dangers from submarines, mines, armed raiders, and aircraft. Over 6,800 members were killed at sea, 11,000 were wounded, and 604 were taken prisoner. Their death rate was higher than any other armed service, but they continue to serve the nation. The United States Merchant Marine faced dangers during World War II, with many members killed, wounded, or taken prisoner.
