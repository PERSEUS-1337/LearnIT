The President requested $324.2 million for FY2008, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding for state grants in FY2008. For FY2007, the President requested $216.0 million for national programs only. Congress appropriated $568.8 million for the SDFSC program in FY2006. The 107th Congress approved reauthorization legislation for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, with funding recommended at $492.5 million, including $310 million for state grants. The program operates at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution, with funds awarded to state and local educational agencies to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. The No Child Left Behind Act amended and reauthorized the SDFSCA as Part A of Title IV\u201421st Century Schools. Funds from the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act are allocated to SEAs, LEAs, and national programs to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. For FY2002, $650 million was authorized for state grants, with specific allocations for territories and special populations. The remaining funds are distributed to states based on population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. The remaining funds from the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act are distributed to states, DC, and Puerto Rico based on population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. State grant funds may be redistributed if not used within two years. There is a provision that state grant funding must increase by at least 10% for national programs appropriations to increase. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act negated the \"limitation\" provision for FY2006, as the national programs appropriation was less than the previous year. For FY2007, the Administration did not suggest funding for state grants. 20% of the state allotment goes to the Governor for competitive grants, with 3% for administrative costs. SEAs must distribute at least 93% of their allotment to LEAs for drug and violence prevention programs. LEAs may use up to 2% of state funds for administrative costs. In FY2002, LEAs received funds under ESEA Title I, Part A based on school enrollments. They could use up to 2% for administrative costs. SEAs could use up to 3% for program administration and an additional 1% for a management information system. The system collected data on truancy, violence, drug-related crimes, curricula, and drug use among minors. SEAs could also use up to 5% for state activities. The SDFSC program allows SEAs to use up to 5% of funds for state activities, including capacity building, technical assistance, and program improvement. The state grants component of the program was rated as \"ineffective\" in 2002 and 2006 due to a lack of demonstrated effectiveness and funds being distributed too thinly. Approximately 64% of LEAs received less than $10,000 per year, which was deemed insufficient for effective drug prevention and school safety programs. The Administration decided to terminate the state grants program due to funding being distributed too thinly, with 64% of LEAs receiving less than $10,000 per year. The program lacked measurable outcomes and was deemed ineffective. Instead, the focus was shifted to national programs under SDFSC, which were seen as more promising in achieving results and enhancing knowledge on effective drug and violence prevention methods. The Department of Education believes that national programs provide direct support to select LEAs with sufficient funding to make a difference. They use national survey data to assess progress and measure the effectiveness of interventions. The authorization for national programs is for FY2002 through FY2007. The Department of Education provides technical assistance to improve data collection and analysis for SDFSC programs. National programs are authorized for FY2002 through FY2007, allowing funds for violence prevention and drug use programs. Up to $2 million may be reserved for program evaluation, and funds are allocated for the Safe Schools/Healthy Students initiative. The National Coordinator Initiative was created in FY1999 to recruit coordinators for middle schools to address drug use and violence among students. The SDFSC program coordinators were hired and trained for middle schools to address drug use and violence among students. Funding for the initiative was terminated in FY2004, but national program funds may be made available as formula grants to states. Competitive grants may also be awarded to develop programs to reduce alcohol abuse in secondary schools. The SAMSHA, within HHS, provides grants to LEAs for programs to reduce alcohol abuse in secondary schools and support mentoring programs for children in middle schools. Other initiatives include grants for hate crime affected localities, a School Security Technology and Resource Center, and a National Center for improving school security. Enforcement in Little Rock, Arkansas, administered by the Attorney General as a resource for LEAs to assess school security, develop technology, evaluate and implement security measures, and provide technical assistance. Establishing a National Center for School and Youth Safety jointly created by the ED Secretary and the Attorney General to provide emergency assistance, establish a student hotline for reporting violent behavior, offer consultation on school safety, compile best practices for violence prevention, and outreach to rural communities. President requested $324.2 million for the SDFSC program in FY2008. House Appropriations Committee recommended $526.0 million for FY2008. The President requested $216.0 million for the SDFSC program in FY2007, with no funding for state grants. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $526.0 million, including $310 million for state grants. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million, with $310 million for state grants. The President's FY2006 request was $317.3 million, but Congress appropriated $568.8 million, including $346.5 million for state grants. The Administration cited fiscal constraints for not requesting state grant funding in FY2007. The Administration did not request state grant funding for FY2007 due to fiscal constraints and an ineffective PART review. The President requested $216.0 million for national programs, $6.3 million less than FY2006. Funding for the mentoring program was not requested for FY2008, with $19 million requested for FY2007 as part of a phase-out. Congress appropriated $48.8 million for mentoring in FY2006 after a 1% budget reduction. The President requested $49.3 million for mentoring, but funding was slightly reduced to $48.8 million due to a budget reduction. The Alcohol Abuse Reduction program did not receive funding from FY2005 to FY2008, but Congress allocated $32.7 million for FY2005 and FY2006. The Gun-Free Schools Act was included in the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. Funding for the SDFSC program remains at FY2006 levels. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) was incorporated into the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. It requires states to have laws expelling students who bring weapons to school, with some flexibility for LEAs. States must report expulsion details to the Secretary of Education annually. LEAs must have policies for reporting students with weapons to law enforcement to receive GFSA funds. The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) requires states to expel students who bring weapons to school and report expulsion details to the Secretary of Education annually. LEAs must have policies for reporting students with weapons to law enforcement to receive GFSA funds. Bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced during the 109th Congress, but only one (H.R. 3010) passed, which required a study on the effectiveness of violence prevention programs funded under SDFSCA. During the 109th Congress, various bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced, including H.R. 283, H.R. 284, H.R. 3655, H.R. 5295, S. 1974, and S. 4028. These bills aimed to address issues such as bullying, gang prevention, school violence, and drug-free sports. One of the bills, H.R. 283, introduced by Representative Sanchez, focused on bullying and gang prevention under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (SDFSCA). The Bullying and Gang Prevention for School Safety and Crime Reduction Act of 2005 (H.R. 283) introduced by Representative Sanchez aimed to cover bullying and gang prevention under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. H.R. 284, introduced by Representative Shimkus, sought to include bullying and harassment prevention programs. The School Violence Prevention Act of 2005 (H.R. 3655) introduced by Representative Baca focused on addressing school violence prevention. The School Violence Prevention Act of 2005 (H.R. 3655) introduced by Representative Baca aimed to include bullying and harassment prevention programs under the definition of violence. H.R. 5295, the Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006, introduced by Representative Geoff Davis, focused on allowing full-time teachers or officials to search students on school property under reasonable suspicion to ensure safety. The Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005 (S. 1974) and the Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006 (S. 4028) aimed to address drug use and gang violence in schools by implementing policies for searching students under suspicion and increasing funding for prevention programs. The bill introduced on September 29, 2006 aimed to reauthorize SDFSCA, increase state grants to $700 million for FY2007, allocate $400 million for national programs, and require LEAs to hire gang prevention coordinators. It also included provisions for mentoring program grants, prioritizing funding for elementary and middle school children in high crime areas. Additionally, it proposed an Anti-Gang Discretionary Grant of $50 million for nonprofit groups to create programs. The Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act (SAVE Act) introduced in the 110th Congress aims to combat gang activity in schools by allowing students in unsafe environments to transfer to safer schools within the same district. The bill also includes provisions for an Anti-Gang Discretionary Grant of $50 million for nonprofit groups to create programs targeting teens in high crime areas. The Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act (SAVE Act) allows students in unsafe school environments to transfer to safer schools within the same district, including private charter schools. The bill also provides options for counseling or removal of offenders in cases of violent crimes on school property, while riding a school bus, or attending a school function. H.R. 354 differs from current law by expanding the scope of protection for students and removing the term \"persistently dangerous.\" H.R. 354 expands protection for students in unsafe school environments, including on school grounds, school buses, or school functions. The bill also offers counseling or removal of offenders. The Administration recommends restructuring the SDFSC program to focus on creating safe, drug-free, healthy school environments. Congress may consider reauthorizing SDFSCA in the 110th Congress. Congress may consider reauthorizing the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (SDFSCA) in the 110th Congress, focusing on improving school safety by requiring schools to report school crime data to law enforcement agencies. There is a proposal to shift responsibility for school safety and crime data collection from the Department of Education to the Department of Justice, which has more expertise in this area. The Department of Justice is suggested to take the lead in school safety and crime data collection due to its expertise beyond that of the Department of Education. Restructuring state grant programs is recommended as the current ones are deemed ineffective. One option is to keep responsibility for certain programs at ED in collaboration with HHS, while placing school safety and emergency preparedness programs under DOJ. Another potential solution is to allow K-12 schools to apply for Department of Homeland Security funding for increased security against possible terrorist attacks. K-12 schools may be eligible for DHS funding for security and emergency preparedness. The Unsafe School Choice provision of the ESEA could have unintended consequences, leading to underreporting of school crime. Legal concerns may arise due to varying definitions of \"persistently dangerous\" schools across states. Some school officials may underreport school crime and violence to avoid being labeled as persistently dangerous, impacting funding for violence prevention grants. The 'persistently dangerous' component of NCLB lacks funding to improve school safety programs, while budgets cut school safety funds."
