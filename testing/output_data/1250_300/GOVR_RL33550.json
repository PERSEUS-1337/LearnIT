    "content": "Countervailing duty laws aim to help domestic industries affected by subsidized imports in the U.S. The relief is an additional import duty equal to the subsidy amount. Two conditions must be met for relief: the International Trade Commission must find material injury to the domestic industry, and the International Trade Administration must confirm the subsidies. In a 2007 investigation on Chinese paper imports, the ITA changed its stance on applying CVD laws to nonmarket economy countries like China, believing it could identify subsidies. In a 2007 investigation, the International Trade Administration (ITA) changed its stance on applying countervailing duty (CVD) laws to China, a nonmarket economy country. The ITA determined that subsidies could be identified in China due to many industries operating according to market principles. China was previously designated as a nonmarket economy country by the ITA based on specific criteria. The International Trade Administration (ITA) determines nonmarket economy (NME) countries based on currency convertibility, wage rates, foreign investment, government control of production and resources. NME countries include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. In 1983, CVD action was not applied to NME countries like China, the US's second largest trading partner. China, designated as a nonmarket economy (NME) country by the International Trade Administration (ITA) in 1983, is a major trading partner of the United States. The U.S. has a significant trade deficit with China, leading to concerns about the impact of Chinese imports on American industries and workers. There have been allegations of China using illegal subsidy programs to support its industries and boost exports. Despite over 80 antidumping duty orders in place against Chinese imports, concerns remain about the effectiveness of addressing subsidies due to the ITA ruling in 1984. The U.S. has over 80 antidumping duty orders against Chinese imports, with higher duty amounts due to ITA methodology. Concerns about China's undervalued currency impacting trade deficit and U.S. industries. Allegations of Chinese currency manipulation leading to congressional interest in countervailing action. The U.S. has over 80 antidumping duty orders against Chinese imports, with higher duty amounts due to ITA methodology. Concerns about China's undervalued currency impacting trade deficit and U.S. industries. Allegations of Chinese currency manipulation leading to congressional interest in countervailing action. \"Misalignment\" and NME classification with regard to China have led to renewed congressional interest in countervailing action and currency manipulation issues. The ITA reaffirmed the NME classification for China in various investigations, with the designation remaining in effect until revoked. Countervailing action against China had not been initiated since 1991 until the CFS paper investigation in 2007. The ITA did not initiate countervailing action against China since 1991 until the CFS paper investigation in 2007. China's NME designation can only be used for a limited time, as specified in its WTO accession package. The United States and other WTO members may no longer use nonmarket economy methodology for CVD or AD investigations after December 11, 2016. The U.S. had two countervailing duty laws in force during the 1983-1984 investigations. States had two countervailing duty laws in force, imposing duties on subsidized products from countries not \"under the Agreement.\" One law required a finding of injury to U.S. industries, while the other did not. The earlier law, repealed in 1995, was a modified version of a law from 1897. The United States had countervailing duty laws in force, with one requiring injury determination and the other not. Section 303, repealed in 1995, allowed for levying a countervailing duty without injury determination. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 implemented broader country applicability for countervailing legislation. The URAA, agreed upon in multilateral trade negotiations under the GATT in April 1979, amended countervailing duty laws by requiring a determination of injury to US industries from subsidized imports. It also expanded the scope of countries subject to countervailing investigations. The URAA amended countervailing duty laws to require injury determination in investigations of subsidized imports from countries not covered by the Subsidies Agreement. Investigations were initiated on carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland due to alleged public benefits received by manufacturers. The URAA amended countervailing duty laws to require injury determination in investigations of subsidized imports from countries not covered by the Subsidies Agreement. Czechoslovakia and Poland had different trade policies, but the determinations on common issues were mostly the same. The ITA found both countries to be \"countries not under the Agreement\" and considered them nonmarket economy countries. The ITA considered Czechoslovakia and Poland as nonmarket economy countries and addressed the question of whether countervailing duty laws apply to such countries. The ITA found that nonmarket economy countries are not exempt from the countervailing duty law based on statutory terms and legislative history. The ITA, in its analysis of nonmarket economies like Czechoslovakia and Poland, focused on the effects of government intervention on prices. It noted that in nonmarket economies, central planners set prices without considering economic value, leading to prices not reflecting scarcity or abundance as in market economies. This difference in pricing was a key factor in determining countervailable benefits in nonmarket economy countries. In nonmarket economies, prices do not naturally increase for scarce goods unless mandated by central planners. The ITA analyzed alleged subsidization programs, determining their impact in market and nonmarket economies. It found that certain programs did not confer subsidies, such as multiple exchange rates and price equalization payments. The ITA preliminarily concluded that practices in Czechoslovakia and Poland did not violate the CVD law. The ITA preliminarily determined that Czechoslovak and Polish practices did not violate the CVD law, despite the unresolved issue of applying the law to nonmarket economy countries. Congress never directly addressed this issue in 1974 or 1979 when amending trade legislation. The Trade Act of 1974 and subsequent amendments in 1979 addressed remedial provisions for injurious imports from nonmarket economy countries, specifically dealing with dumping. Congress recognized the need for special legislation due to the ineffectiveness of traditional trade remedies in State-controlled-economy countries. Special legislation was needed for State-controlled-economy countries due to the ineffectiveness of traditional trade remedies. The Trade Act of 1974 and subsequent amendments in 1979 addressed remedial provisions for injurious imports from nonmarket economy countries, specifically dealing with dumping. Congress recognized the difficulty of applying fair- or unfair-trade remedies in these countries where supply and demand forces do not operate to produce prices. The legislative history of the CVD law restructuring by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 did not address the application of the CVD law to NME countries, but the Subsidies and Countervailing Code of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade allowed GATT signatories to regulate unfairly priced imports from NME countries under either antidumping or countervailing duty legislation. The ITA consulted with various sources and concluded that identifying and quantifying subsidies in NMEs was challenging. The ITA consulted various sources and concluded that identifying and quantifying subsidies in nonmarket economy countries was challenging. The countervailing duty law requires measuring a resource transfer from the state to the producer, which is difficult in nonmarket economies. The ITA determined that a \"bounty or grant\" cannot be found in nonmarket economy countries like Czechoslovakia and Poland. The ITA determined that Czechoslovakia and Poland were nonmarket economy countries and did not receive bounties or grants, leading to final negative countervailing duty determinations. Subsequent investigations on potassium chloride imports were rescinded due to the same determination for these countries. The ITA rescinded countervailing duty investigations on potassium chloride imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland, as they were determined to be nonmarket economy countries without bounties or grants. Following this, the ITA initiated a countervailing duty investigation on Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China, based on a petition claiming that the PRC fan sector operates substantially under market principles. The ITA introduced the concept of market-oriented industry (MOI) in antidumping investigations of imports from NME countries to determine if an industry is free from state control. In the Chinese fan CVD case, the ITA found that the industry was not an MOI due to non-market-determined input prices. This led to the conclusion that the PC fans industry is not an MOI, impacting the CVD investigation. The ITA concluded that the PC fans industry is not an MOI, leading to the inability to apply the CVD law to the PRC fan industry. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed the carbon steel wire rod cases and ordered the resumption of the potassium chloride cases investigations. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed the carbon steel wire rod cases and remanded them to the ITA for further determinations. The court also set aside the rescissions of the potash cases and ordered their investigations to be resumed. The CIT addressed the grounds on which the ITA based its determination of nonapplicability of countervailing procedure to NME countries, emphasizing that subsidies can exist in nonmarket economies according to the plain language of the CVD law. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed the carbon steel wire rod cases and remanded them to the ITA for further determinations. The court emphasized that subsidies can exist in nonmarket economies according to the plain language of the CVD law, rejecting the ITA's attempt to exempt countries with nonmarket economies from countervailing procedures. The court criticized the ITA for redefining the term \"subsidy\" and concluded that the agency has the authority to address measurement issues within its expertise. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed the carbon steel wire rod cases, emphasizing that subsidies can exist in nonmarket economies according to the CVD law. The court criticized the ITA for redefining the term \"subsidy\" and stated that the agency has the authority to address measurement issues within its expertise. The CIT also pointed out that antidumping law is not a substitute for the CVD law in dealing with subsidization from NME countries. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 allows countries to choose between subsidy law or antidumping law for imports from state-controlled economies. The court dismissed the ITA's reliance on economic academia's views and criticized administrative actions that were deemed contrary to law. The U.S. government appealed the CIT decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reviewed the legislative history of relevant trade remedy laws. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the legislative history of trade remedy laws, focusing on the CVD statute under the Tariff Act of 1930. The court concluded that Congress had not defined terms like 'bounty' and 'grant' in the statute, making it unclear if the law applied to nonmarket economies. Since nonmarket economies did not exist when the law was enacted in 1897, the court had to determine how Congress would have applied the statute in that context. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the legislative history of trade remedy laws, focusing on the CVD statute under the Tariff Act of 1930. Congress had not defined terms like 'bounty' and 'grant' in the statute, leaving it unclear if the law applied to nonmarket economies. The court determined that the economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany for potash exports did not constitute bounties or grants under the CVD law. The court also upheld the ITA's discretion in determining the existence of bounties or grants, concluding that their decision was not unreasonable or an abuse of discretion. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned the CIT order regarding CVD determinations in wire rod and potash cases. The decision triggered a reaction in Congress, leading to the introduction of H.R. 3 in the 100th Congress, which aimed to apply countervailing duty laws to nonmarket economy countries. The House passed a bill applying countervailing duty laws to nonmarket economy countries, with detailed procedural provisions. The Senate version did not include a similar provision, and the House language was dropped in conference. Companion bills were introduced in the 100th Congress but not further considered. The issue was revisited in the 103rd and 104th Congresses. In the 103rd and 104th Congresses, bills were introduced to expand the definition of \"countervailable subsidy\" to nonmarket economy countries and prescribe the determination of its amount using a surrogate market-economy country method. Identical bills were introduced in subsequent Congresses to apply countervailing duty laws to NME countries for investigations of subsidies. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duties to subsidized imports from nonmarket economy (NME) countries, with provisions included in broader trade-remedial legislation. Additionally, a bill focused on trade issues with China subjected all NME countries to countervailing action for petitions filed after the enactment date. The \"Fair Trade with China Act of 2005\" focused on trade issues with China and subjected all NME countries to countervailing action for petitions filed after the enactment date. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed to apply countervailing duty law to NME countries. In the 110th and 111th Congress, various bills were introduced to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies without considering ownership or economic reforms. The bills introduced in the 110th and 111th Congress aimed to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies without considering ownership or economic reforms. The administering authority is not required to consider the effect of the subsidy in determining its existence. The bills also prevent the ITA from considering market economy treatment for individual businesses in AD proceedings, and provide a China-specific alternate methodology for determining subsidy amounts. The bills introduced in the 110th and 111th Congress aimed to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies without considering ownership or economic reforms. Administrative authorities would use methodologies to calculate subsidies in China, considering terms and conditions prevailing in China or outside if necessary. China's NME status can only be revoked with a joint resolution of Congress.

China's NME status can only be revoked with a joint resolution of Congress. In response to concerns, the Bush Administration took steps to address China's alleged subsidies of exports, including initiating CVD investigations and consultations in the WTO. The ITC preliminarily determined on December 15, 2006, that a U.S. domestic industry is materially injured by subsidized coated paper from China. The ITA also found affirmative preliminary determinations of subsidy in the CVD investigation, with subsidy rates ranging from 10.9% to 20.35%. The final determination revealed countervailable subsidies provided to producers and exporters of coated free sheet paper from China, with subsidy amounts ranging from 7.40% to 44.25%. The ITA noted China's significant state role in the economy despite economic reforms. The ITA found that China's economy is significantly different from Soviet-style economies, with market forces determining prices for over 90% of products. Wage negotiations, accessible foreign currency, and private ownership rights are acknowledged by the Chinese government. The ITA found that market forces determine prices for over 90% of products in China, with wages negotiated and private ownership rights acknowledged by the government. Despite being an NME country, the Chinese government has limited state control over the economy, allowing the ITA to assess benefits to Chinese producers. The ITC's negative determination of injury in CFS paper investigations was based on factors like modest production capacity increases in China and Indonesia, no potential for product shifting, and lack of significant price effects from imports. The investigation found that material injury by reason of subject imports will not occur without antidumping and countervailing duty orders against imports from China and Indonesia. The domestic CFSP industry is not threatened with material injury from these imports. The ITA was able to measure subsidies in China, but no CV duties were ultimately imposed. The ITA's investigation resulted in refunds or cancellations of products. While no countervailing duties were imposed on Chinese products, subsequent investigations led to the first CVD order on products from an NME country since 1983. China filed a lawsuit to prevent further CVD investigations, but the Court ruled it lacked jurisdiction due to no final determination being made. The Court ruled it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case regarding the application of CVD law to NME countries. China requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with the United States on CFS paper duties. China has been active in AD investigations against the US and initiated its first CVD case in 2009. The US requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over alleged illegal subsidies. On February 2, 2007, the United States requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over alleged illegal subsidies. China agreed to terminate one of the challenged subsidy programs. The subsidies included tax laws and measures that provided advantages to Chinese businesses purchasing domestically produced goods. These subsidies were seen as distorting trade conditions for U.S. manufacturers and SMEs across various industries. The USTR reported that China agreed to terminate illegal subsidies that distorted trade conditions for U.S. manufacturers and SMEs. China signed MOUs with the U.S. and Mexico to eliminate WTO-prohibited subsidies by January 1, 2008. In 2010, the USTR confirmed that China had eliminated the subsidies as agreed. In December 2009, a settlement agreement was reached regarding certain measures offering incentives to Chinese enterprises meeting export criteria. In December 2009, a settlement agreement was reached with China regarding export-contingent benefits. Despite the ITA's ability to identify subsidies in China, Congress may consider legislation to address unfair trade practices. This decision does not affect China's status as a nonmarket economy or the designation of other countries. Congress may want to ensure that CVD laws apply to all nonmarket economy countries. The ITA's ability to identify subsidies in China does not affect its determination for other nonmarket economy countries. Congress may need to consider legislation to ensure CVD laws apply to all nonmarket economy countries, including Vietnam. There are no significant trade disputes with other NME countries at present. The trade remedy laws lack specific factors for identifying subsidies in nonmarket economies. The antidumping statute provides a methodology for determining normal value in NME countries. The antidumping statute allows for determining normal value in NME countries using inputs from a market economy. AD duties are generally higher than countervailing duties, especially for imports from NME countries. There is uncertainty about the total protection level for Chinese products due to potential revisions in AD duties to avoid double counting of subsidies. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted uncertainty regarding the level of protection for Chinese products due to potential revisions in antidumping (AD) duties. This could lead to lower combined rates than expected. Addressing subsidies in China through ITA or legislative changes may unintentionally reduce overall protection. However, different forms of price manipulation could allow some U.S. industries to seek relief through countervailing duty (CVD) procedures."
