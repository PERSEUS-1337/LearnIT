    "content": "The Act titled \"Conventional Arms Threat Reduction Act of 2004\" is cited as the short title. It includes findings and the sense of Congress. The global proliferation of MANPADS, small arms, and tactical missile systems poses a direct threat to US national security. Terrorist and insurgent groups using these weapons hinder peace efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Government Accountability Office estimates 500,000 to 750,000 MANPADS worldwide. Many countries no longer need these weapons for security but lack the means to eliminate or secure them. The United States lacks a program to address conventional arms threat reduction and tactical missile elimination in other countries. The Department of State has not used the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund for this purpose since 2002. Congress believes the US should assist countries in securing, removing, or eliminating proliferation threats like MANPADS and other weapons. There is a need to combat global terrorism networks linked to the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons. The United States Government should focus on combating the proliferation of MANPADS, small arms, light weapons, and tactical missile systems as part of its nonproliferation strategy, given the links between global terrorism networks and illicit arms trade. The United States aims to assist other countries in safeguarding or eliminating stocks of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems that pose a proliferation threat through a global program. The Secretary of State is authorized to implement a global program to secure, remove, or eliminate stocks of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems that pose a proliferation threat. This program may include activities such as humanitarian demining, destruction of small arms and light weapons, and assistance in safe handling and storage of these weapons. Cooperation with international organizations like NATO is also part of the program. The program authorized by the Secretary of State includes cooperative efforts with international organizations to assist countries in handling and eliminating MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems. This involves utilizing funds for elimination, safeguarding, and managing these weapons at secure locations. Additionally, actions are taken to ensure equipment and funds are used for authorized purposes, including security upgrades for storage or disposition of weapons posing a proliferation threat. SEC. 5. OFFICE OF CONVENTIONAL ARMS THREAT REDUCTION. An Office of Conventional Arms Threat Reduction is established within the Department of State to formulate policy and administer programs for conventional arms threat reduction. SEC. 6. REPORT ON CONVENTIONAL ARMS THREAT REDUCTION. The Secretary of State must submit a report on conventional arms threat reduction to congressional committees within 180 days of this Act. The report will detail past Department of State efforts, progress in establishing the Office of Conventional Arms Threat Reduction, and country-specific strategies for eliminating or safeguarding weapons. An evaluation of US and other government programs' effectiveness will also be included. The report required under this Act will evaluate the integration of US programs to reduce conventional arms threats and ensure consistency with US policy in recipient countries. It will also describe US programs related to eliminating tactical missile systems in unclassified form, with a possible classified annex. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $50,000,000 authorized for the President in fiscal year 2005. Limitation: $10,000,000 cannot be obligated until the Secretary of State submits the required report. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"appropriate congressional committees\" refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives.
