    "content": "The \"H-2A Improvement Act\" allows nonimmigrant status for dairy workers, sheepherders, and goat herders coming temporarily to the United States to perform agricultural labor. Special rules are established for aliens employed in these roles. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to include special rules for aliens employed as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders, allowing for initial admission of 3 years with the possibility of extension. Employers hiring H-2A workers in these positions are exempt from showing that the positions are seasonal or temporary. Employers filing petitions for H-2A workers as dairy workers, sheepherders, or goat herders are not required to prove the positions are seasonal. Eligible aliens in these roles can apply for lawful permanent resident status after maintaining H-2A status for 33 months out of the last 36. Employers filing petitions for H-2A workers in specific agricultural roles are not required to prove seasonality. Eligible aliens in these positions can apply for permanent resident status after meeting specific criteria. A petition for classification under section 203(b)(3)(A)(iii) can be filed by the employer or the eligible alien. No labor certification is needed for this immigrant visa category, and filing a petition or adjustment of status application will not impact other H-2A worker petitions or nonimmigrant status extensions. Extension of stay for eligible aliens with pending or approved petitions under subparagraph (B) will be granted in 1-year increments until a final determination is made on their adjustment of status eligibility. This extension will not impact other H-2A worker petitions or nonimmigrant status extensions. Extension of stay for eligible aliens with pending or approved petitions under subparagraph (B) will be granted in 1-year increments until a final determination is made on their adjustment of status eligibility. This provision does not prevent an eligible alien from seeking adjustment of status through other legal provisions. Additionally, the term in subsection (j)(1) is modified to exclude cases covered under subsection (h)(2)(A)."
