    "content": "The \"Antitrust Improvements Act of 1998\" aims to empower the Attorney General to prevent mergers and acquisitions that could harm competition in the telecommunications industry. It amends the Clayton Act to address restraints of trade specifically related to telecommunications. The \"Antitrust Improvements Act of 1998\" defines a large local telephone company as one serving more than 5% of telephone access lines in the US. It prohibits mergers or acquisitions of such companies unless approved by the Attorney General and FCC to promote competition in telecommunications. The Antitrust Improvements Act of 1998 defines a large local telephone company as serving over 5% of telephone access lines in the US. Mergers or acquisitions of such companies require approval from the Attorney General and FCC to promote competition in the telecommunications industry. Large local telephone companies proposing mergers must fully implement regulations of the Communications Act of 1934 and submit an application for approval. The Attorney General must report to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees on the effects of the merger on competition within 10 days of making a finding. Large local telephone companies seeking to merge must file an application with the Attorney General and FCC simultaneously. The decision on the application must be made within the specified time frame. The US district courts have jurisdiction to prevent mergers inconsistent with antitrust findings. The Attorney General can initiate legal proceedings in any district court for injunctions. The Attorney General can seek injunctions in US district courts if a proposed merger does not meet conditions or if the FCC finds parties do not meet requirements. SEC. 4 of the Act preserves existing antitrust laws and FCC authority regarding mergers of large incumbent local exchange carriers. SEC. 5 applies the Act to mergers or acquisitions of controlling interests in large local telephone companies."
