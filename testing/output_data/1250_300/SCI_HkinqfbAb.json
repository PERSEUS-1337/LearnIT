Most current methods involve post-processing approaches like parameter tying via quantization or pruning irrelevant edges. In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed that simultaneously learns and compresses a neural network by adding Gaussian priors and a sparsity penalty to the optimization criteria. This approach is easy to implement, generalizes L1 and L2 regularization, and achieves state-of-the-art compression on standard benchmarks with minimal loss in accuracy and little hyperparameter tuning. The new algorithm demonstrates state-of-the-art compression on standard benchmarks with minimal loss in accuracy and little hyperparameter tuning. Neural networks have achieved top performance in various domains but face storage limitations. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, have gained interest to reduce network size without sacrificing performance. Model compression techniques, including pruning, quantization, and parameter tying, have gained interest for improving generalization performance in neural networks. Recent work has focused on automatic parameter tying methods to discover which parameters should be tied together, such as soft parameter tying based on mixtures of Gaussians and random parameter tying based on hashing functions. These approaches aim to reduce network size without sacrificing performance. Several methods have been proposed for model compression in neural networks, including soft-to-hard quantization, Gaussian mixture priors, and scale mixture priors. These techniques aim to reduce network size without compromising performance, achieving high compression rates with minimal loss in accuracy. The soft-to-hard quantization approach proposed by BID1 achieves compression with low-entropy parameter distribution instead of pruning. However, the Gaussian mixture approach of BID24 and K. Ullrich is computationally expensive and suffers from local minima issues. The approach of BID13 uses separate pruning and parameter tying stages, potentially limiting its applications. The BID13 approach uses separate pruning and parameter tying stages, limiting compression efficiency. Parameter tying is only applied layerwise and requires more clusters for effective random weight sharing. The soft-to-hard quantization approach of BID1 is probabilistic and expensive. The full Bayesian approach has additional parameters to tune and requires sampling for prediction. The Bayesian approach, unlike the GMM approach, involves tuning additional parameters such as constraints on variances and careful initialization of variational parameters. It requires sampling for prediction but may not be necessary for good compression. This work proposes compression using quantization and sparsity inducing priors, where each parameter is assigned to independent Gaussian distributions. This method reduces the number of hyperparameters compared to probabilistic methods like Gaussian mixtures and requires only a small change to gradient descent updates with linear time and memory overhead. However, quantization alone is insufficient for achieving the desired compression level. Compression using quantization and sparsity inducing priors is proposed as a method to reduce hyperparameters compared to probabilistic methods like Gaussian mixtures. This approach requires only a small change to gradient descent updates with linear time and memory overhead. By adding a penalty on top of quantization, state-of-the-art compression results are achieved on standard benchmark datasets. The regularization function used encourages sparse or bounded parameter vectors, leading to quantization in a parameter-tied model where parameters are constrained to be equal within sets. In this work, parameter tying is achieved through regularization in a parameter-tied model where weights are shared across specific layers. The goal is to discover parameter tying without prior knowledge, optimizing both parameters and cluster assignments. Automatic parameter tying is sought to address high-dimensional problems with no obvious structure. In this work, parameter tying is achieved through regularization in a parameter-tied model where weights are shared across specific layers. The problem of automatic parameter tying without prior knowledge is addressed by optimizing both parameters and cluster assignments. The approach considers a relaxed version where parameters are softly constrained to values close to their average cluster values using a clustering distortion penalty on the parameters. The k-medians algorithm is used with a shifted 2 norm, representing a prior probability over weights with K independent Gaussian components. Incorporating k-means directly into the objective as a prior guides training towards good parameter tying, inducing effective quantization with fewer parameters to learn compared to a GMM prior. The k-means prior is more natural for models with finitely distinct parameters, performing comparably to GMM when clusters are far apart but avoiding overlap as clusters move closer together. The GMM prior can lead to clusters with significant overlap when distinct parameters are close together, resulting in poor practical performance. In contrast, the k-means prior forces each weight to commit to a single cluster, potentially leading to lower loss in accuracy. However, the GMM prior may encounter numerical issues if variances tend to zero, which can be mitigated with individual learning rates, annealing the objective, or imposing hyperpriors on Gaussian parameters. Tuning may still be necessary for optimal solutions. Quantization and compression techniques can be applied to reduce the storage requirements of parameter-heavy models. By quantizing parameters to a limited number of distinct values, significant savings in storage can be achieved. However, quantization alone may not be sufficient for state-of-the-art compression, and additional techniques such as entropy coding may be necessary. The k-means prior can help improve compression by forcing each weight to commit to a single cluster, potentially reducing accuracy loss. Network pruning is another common strategy for compression, resulting in sparse parameters that can be efficiently stored and transmitted using sparse encoding schemes. Parameters are first stored in regular CSC or CSR format, then compressed further by Huffman coding. By encouraging a large cluster near zero (referred to as the zero cluster), weights effectively zero can be dropped from the model. An additional sparsity-inducing penalty is added to the learning objective to achieve both network pruning and quantization. In network pruning for compression, weights near zero are dropped by encouraging a zero cluster. A sparsity-inducing penalty is added to the learning objective to achieve network pruning and quantization. A two-stage approach is proposed to minimize the objective, with soft-tying in stage one and hard-tying in stage two. The lasso penalty significantly increases model sparsity without loss in accuracy. In network pruning for compression, weights near zero are dropped by encouraging a zero cluster. A sparsity-inducing penalty is added to the learning objective to achieve network pruning and quantization. The data loss is minimized using projected gradient descent. However, the optimization problem is not convex, so methods may converge to local optima. A fast 1-D K-means implementation is used in experiments, with K selected using a validation set. The sparse APT objective is optimized with a block coordinate descent algorithm. The descent algorithm optimizes W and \u00b5 alternatively. Optimizing W involves gradient descent on L with weight decay towards cluster centers. The k-means algorithm solves the optimization problem for \u00b5. The problem is formulated with an N \u00d7 K matrix A of auxiliary variables. The standard EM-style k-means algorithm performs coordinate descent. As k-means can be expensive for large networks, optimizing \u00b5 only is found to be sufficient. The algorithm optimizes cluster means \u03bc under assignments A, using a specialized 1-D k-means approach to speed up the process. The frequency of k-means updates does not significantly impact results, and once the objective is optimized, soft-tying is replaced with hard-tying. The algorithm optimizes cluster means under assignments A using a specialized k-means approach. Once the objective is optimized, soft-tying is replaced with hard-tying, where parameters are updated subject to tying constraints imposed by A. Hard-tying optimizes the data loss via projected gradient descent, setting parameters to their assigned cluster centers. The projected update in cluster k averages the gradient components for parameters, distinct from BID13's method. Our method allows weight tying across layers, with time overhead linear in N and memory requirement O(N). Soft-tying is implemented using Tensorflow for optimization. In our implementation of soft-tying, cluster assignments are represented as an N-vector of integers using Tensorflow BID0 for optimization. K-means is implemented in C++ for efficiency. Hard-tying is achieved by updating parameters and performing assignments. Neural network parameters are initialized using BID9's method. Experiments focus on the effect of k-means prior, number of clusters, and frequency of updates on accuracy. The second set of experiments aims to understand generalization performance of neural networks. Our experiments with APT on LeNet-300-100 focused on the effect of k-means prior, number of clusters, and frequency of updates on accuracy. We also explored the impact of APT on generalization performance of neural networks and compared sparse APT with other compression methods. APT led to clear parameter clustering and improved model performance, as shown in FIG0 and FIG2. In the experiment, FIG2 in the appendix shows loss functions and model performance with and without APT. Soft-tying with K=8 was sufficient, switching to hard-tying at iteration 20000 resulted in some loss but gradually recovered. Soft-tying does not significantly affect convergence speed or final model performance compared to without APT. Hard-tying can lead to accuracy loss for small K, which decreases with increasing K. APT is generally not sensitive to k-means frequency, except for very small K. APT was generally not sensitive to k-means frequency, except for very small K. The extreme case of t = 20000 corresponds to not running k-means, effectively randomly tying the parameters based on their initial values. Random tying is disastrous for small K, inducing significant quantization loss. Specialized training methods exist for K = 2 or 3, but APT cannot effectively quantize with such a small number of clusters. Sparse APT behaves similarly to APT. The penalty \u03bb1 determines model sparsity without strongly impacting k-means loss or cluster convergence. Larger \u03bb1 accelerates the growth of the zero cluster, resulting in higher sparsity and potentially more accuracy loss. In exploring model complexity in neural networks, traditional regularization methods like weight decay may not significantly impact generalization capability. A different notion of model complexity based on the number of free parameters in parameter-tied networks is proposed. The effectiveness of this approach, called APT, is compared against a GMM prior on a toy problem to assess its impact on model generalization. In a comparison between APT and a GMM prior on a toy problem, the effectiveness of APT in improving model generalization was evaluated. The experiment involved detecting shifts in binary strings and comparing different regularization methods, including early stopping, 2 penalty, APT, and GMM prior. Common SGD step sizes and a maximum training budget were set to ensure convergence to zero training error. Regularization parameters were tuned for APT and GMM prior. The comparison between APT and GMM prior on a toy problem involved evaluating regularization methods like early stopping, 2 penalty, APT, and GMM. Common SGD step sizes and a maximum training budget were set for convergence to zero training error. Regularization parameters were tuned for APT and GMM. The results showed minimal impact on test error from regularization choices, with network structure having a stronger effect on performance. More evaluations were done on MNIST and covertype dataset with varying network structures, showing similar final performance with different regularization methods. In comparing sparse APT with other neural network compression methods, changing network structure had a stronger impact on performance than different regularization methods. Sparse APT was evaluated on LeNet-300-100, LeNet-5-Caffe, and VGG-16 using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The experiments involved soft-tying and hard-tying for a fixed budget of iterations. The results suggested that automatic parameter tying or norm restriction did not significantly improve regularization performance. In experiments with sparse APT, soft-tying and hard-tying were used for a set number of iterations. The optimal values for K were found to be in the ranges of [10, 20] for networks with fewer parameters and [30, 40] for larger networks. The tuning of \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 was done within the range of [1e \u2212 6, 1e \u2212 3]. Training LeNets involved Adadelta BID28 without data augmentation, using soft/hard-tying budgets of 60000/10000 iterations. Training VGG-16 included data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalization, with SGD and a learning rate decay strategy. Training from scratch did not achieve the same accuracy as from a pre-trained network. In experiments with sparse APT, soft/hard-tying budgets were used for a set number of iterations. The results showed that training from scratch did not achieve the same accuracy as from a pre-trained solution. The maximum compression scores for DC, BC, and Sparse VD were obtained by clustering the final weights into 32 clusters. The maximum compression scores for DC, BC, and Sparse VD were achieved by clustering final weights into 32 clusters. Sparse APT outperforms competitors on each dataset, except for BC methods in terms of max compression on LeNet-5 and VGG-16. This is due to the use of Huffman coding in sparse APT, which performs best with non-uniform distributions. The sparse APT method aims to compress cluster indices of quantized parameters in CSR format using Huffman coding for non-uniform distributions. By tuning variances of Gaussian priors, higher compression rates can be achieved. APT allows for a trade-off between accuracy and sparsity, with the ability to select desired performance levels using a validation set. The trade-off curve in FIG1 shows that increasing sparsity at the cost of accuracy is possible, with different values of K impacting the level of compression. Selecting the smallest K value that balances accuracy and compression is recommended. In practice, selecting the smallest value of K that exhibits good accuracy and compression is recommended. The evolution of cluster centers and change in assignments in experiments with LeNet-300-100 showed clusters opposing each other due to k-means loss J and independent Gaussian priors. The effect of different K values was examined, with soft-tying and hard-tying iterations conducted without observing overfitting. The best model for each K was selected based on validation performance. The study involved tuning \u03bb 1 in a range of values for soft-tying and hard-tying iterations without observing overfitting. The impact of k-means frequency on model performance was examined for various K values, with no significant sensitivity to the number of gradient iterations t. After hyperparameter search, the study found that the model performance degraded with large t values, especially for smaller K. Structured sparsity in weights was observed, leading to entire units being pruned away. Visualizations showed zero weights in some convolution filters and quantized important stroke detectors. The first layer weights of LeNet-300-100 with different initialization methods resulted in similar error rates. The first layer weights of LeNet-300-100 were visualized after being learned with sparse APT, resulting in a column-sparsity of 48.6%. The weights were marked with magnitude less than 1e \u2212 3 as zero for illustration. The visualization depicted the connections from input units to hidden units, showing structured sparsity and quantized stroke detectors. The 784 input connections to the next layer unit are reshaped as a 28 \u00d7 28 cell, with colors on an absolute scale from -0.3 to 0.3. White cells indicate hidden units disconnected from input, serving as bias for the next layer. Sparse APT results in 76.3% row-sparsity.
