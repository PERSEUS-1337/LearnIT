    "content": "The Internet is a network of interconnected computers identified by unique IP numbers. Domain names provide a simpler way to access information, with TLDs like .com or .org. The DNS system maps addresses to domain names, coordinated by root servers. DARPA funded the Internet's origins for military use. The Internet originated from DARPA funding for military use and evolved into a civilian network with support from NSF. Key entities like IANA and NSF played roles in managing the DNS and IP address space. In 1992, NSF solicited for managing network services, leading to a cooperative agreement with InterNic in 1993. NSI became the sole registration service for .com, .net, and .org domains. Criticism grew over NSI's control and trademark disputes in the .com domain. Concerns about IANA's legal foundation prompted actions in the US and internationally, including the formation of the International Ad Hoc Committee (IAHC). The International Ad Hoc Committee (IAHC) proposed creating seven new gTLDs and introducing additional registrars to compete in granting registration services for new second level domain names. The U.S. government, through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), assessed the IAHC proposal and issued a final statement of policy in June 1998, known as the White Paper, indicating readiness to recognize a new not-for-profit corporation for managing Internet names and addresses. The U.S. government, through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), endorsed the creation of a new not-for-profit corporation to manage Internet names and addresses. This led to the formation of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) after a series of meetings and collaboration with IANA and NSI. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was proposed as a new corporation to manage Internet names and addresses. After several iterations, ICANN's final bylaws and articles of incorporation were submitted to the Department of Commerce. An official Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between DOC and ICANN to transition management responsibility for DNS functions to a private-sector entity. The MOU was extended until 2006, with specific transition tasks outlined. NTIA stated the U.S. government's commitment to preserving the security and stability of the DNS. Gallagher, then-Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information and Administrator of NTIA, outlined the U.S. government's principles on the Internet's domain name system. The U.S. government aims to maintain the security and stability of the DNS, authorize changes to the root zone, recognize governments' interests in managing their country code top level domains, designate ICANN as the technical manager of the DNS, and promote ongoing dialogue on Internet governance. A new Joint Project Agreement (JPA) with ICANN was announced by DOC in 2006 to transition DNS management to the private sector, focusing on transparency and accountability. In 2009, an Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) was agreed upon by DOC and ICANN to formalize global technical coordination of the DNS by a private-sector-led organization. ICANN, a not-for-profit public benefit corporation, operates under California law and is overseen by the California attorney general. It has tax-exempt status and a structure with a Board of Directors advised by supporting organizations and advisory committees. The organization's Affirmation of Commitments with the Department of Commerce ensures accountability, transparency, and the security of the DNS. ICANN, a not-for-profit public benefit corporation based in California, operates under California law and is overseen by the California attorney general. Its organizational structure includes a Board of Directors advised by supporting organizations and advisory committees representing various Internet constituencies. The Board of Directors, consisting of 16 members, is responsible for making final policy and operational decisions. The organization has seen significant growth in budget and staff due to the expansion of the Internet and domain name registration, as well as the rollout of the new gTLD program. The growth of ICANN's budget and staff is attributed to domain name registration and the new gTLD program. ICANN is primarily funded by fees from registrars and registry operators. Congressional committees oversee ICANN's activities, with a focus on issues like intellectual property and privacy. The Department of Commerce oversees ICANN's activities and policies, with congressional committees maintaining an interest in issues like intellectual property and privacy. The U.S. government originally owned and operated key components of the network architecture enabling the domain name system. The 1998 Memorandum of Understanding initiated a transition of DNS coordination to a private-sector entity, with the Department of Commerce retaining a role in the process. The Department of Commerce is transitioning technical DNS coordination to a private-sector not-for-profit entity. The U.S. government retains a role through contractual agreements with ICANN, IANA/ICANN, and VeriSign. An Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) was signed in 2009 to institutionalize global DNS coordination by a private-sector-led organization. The AoC has no expiration date and would conclude only if one party decided to. The AoC was signed in 2009 to institutionalize global DNS coordination by a private-sector-led organization. Various stakeholders disagreed on whether DOC should maintain control over ICANN after the JPA expiration. U.S. groups argued for continued oversight, while international entities believed ICANN had met conditions for privatization. Senator Snowe introduced S.Res. 564 in the 110th Congress regarding this issue. The United States argued that ICANN had met conditions for privatization and that continued U.S. government control over the organization was not appropriate. Senator Snowe introduced S.Res. 564 in the 110th Congress, stating that more progress was needed in achieving accountability and transparency goals. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on the expiration of the JPA between DOC and ICANN, highlighting areas where further work was required for increased institutional confidence in ICANN. The NTIA sought public comments on the transition of DNS management to the private sector, specifically questioning the progress towards the September 30, 2009 deadline. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce recommended extending the JPA or establishing a permanent accountability mechanism between DOC and ICANN. The DOC and ICANN should agree on a \"permanent instrument\" to ensure ICANN's perpetual accountability to the public and global stakeholders. This instrument should maintain the current DOC-ICANN relationship, include periodic reviews of ICANN performance, outline steps for accountability improvement, implement new gTLDs and internationalized domain names, ensure timely access to WHOIS information, and confirm ICANN's not-for-profit status in the US. The AoC also states that ICANN will remain a not-for-profit corporation headquartered in the US with global offices. Review panels will make recommendations to the ICANN Board in four key areas. The AoC calls for the establishment of review panels to ensure accountability, transparency, and the interests of global Internet users. The panels will evaluate ICANN governance, assess transparency, accountability, and responsiveness, and review ICANN's plan to enhance the operational stability, reliability, resiliency, security, and global interoperability of the DNS. The panel composition will include key stakeholders and independent experts. The panel, chaired by the GAC and ICANN, will review plans to enhance DNS operational stability, security, and global interoperability. It will also assess the impact of new gTLDs on competition and consumer trust. Additionally, the panel will review WHOIS policy effectiveness in meeting law enforcement needs and promoting consumer trust. The panel, chaired by the GAC and ICANN, will review existing WHOIS policy effectiveness in meeting law enforcement needs and promoting consumer trust. The panel composition includes representatives from Advisory Committees, Supporting Organizations, independent experts, global law enforcement community, and global privacy experts. ATRT released recommendations for improving ICANN's transparency and accountability, which were adopted by the Board in June 2011. NTIA emphasizes the need for ICANN management and staff to implement these recommendations. The Board adopted all 27 ATRT recommendations in June 2011, focusing on ICANN management and staff implementing them rapidly for meaningful reform. ATRT2 presented 12 new recommendations to the Board in December 2013, stemming from issues raised in the first ATRT report. The \"IANA functions contract\" between DOC and ICANN allows ICANN to manage critical technical functions like IP address allocation and root zone file editing. Additionally, a cooperative agreement with VeriSign authorizes them to maintain the official root zone file for the Internet's root servers. The DOC has authority over the root zone file, allowing the U.S. government to approve or deny changes to the DNS. The U.S. government is committed to preserving the security and stability of the DNS and will maintain its role in authorizing modifications to the root zone file. The expiration of the JPA and establishment of the AoC did not directly impact U.S. government authority over the DNS root zone file. The U.S. government maintains authority over the DNS root zone file, approving changes. The recent IANA functions contract with ICANN includes a separation of policy development and implementation, with transparency and accountability measures. The contractor must be U.S. owned and operated, with operations and systems based in the United States. The IANA contract requires a U.S. owned and operated firm or university, with operations in the U.S. NTIA announced its intention to transition its stewardship role over key domain name functions to the global Internet community. NTIA expects ICANN to work with stakeholders to develop a transition proposal. NTIA is asking ICANN to convene global Internet stakeholders to develop a transition proposal for the IANA functions. The proposal must have broad community support and adhere to four principles, including enhancing the multistakeholder model. The NTIA is requesting ICANN to lead a global effort to develop a transition proposal for the IANA functions. The proposal must have broad community support and adhere to four principles, including enhancing the multistakeholder model. Supporters believe that transferring authority over ICANN and the DNS to the global Internet community will strengthen the multistakeholder model and prevent intergovernmental control over the Internet. They argue that this transition was always envisioned as temporary, and now that ICANN has matured, it is time for the DNS to be fully privatized. Internet stakeholders have long envisioned the privatization of the DNS and the transition of U.S. authority over IANA functions to the global community. NTIA believes ICANN has matured and improved its accountability, making the transition feasible. Critics fear loss of NTIA's oversight could lead to intergovernmental control over the Internet, especially after the Snowden NSA revelations. They are concerned about the development of a new international multistakeholder entity to steward the transition. Critics are concerned about the risks of foreign governments gaining influence over the DNS through a new Internet governance mechanism that no longer has U.S. oversight. H.R. 4342, the DOTCOM Act, would prevent NTIA from relinquishing responsibility over the domain name system until a report on the advantages and disadvantages of the change, including national security concerns, is submitted to Congress by GAO. The DOTCOM Act, H.R. 4342, aims to address national security concerns by preventing NTIA from giving up control of the domain name system without a report from GAO on the advantages and disadvantages of the change. The bill was approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee and later included as an amendment to H.R. 4435, which was passed by the House on May 22, 2014. The House passed H.R. 4435 on May 22, 2014, with a vote of 245-177. The bill included provisions to protect the .mil domain and maintain separation between policymaking and root-zone management functions. The Senate's version of the National Defense Authorization Act, S. 2410, also addressed the future of Internet governance, suggesting a transfer of IANA functions to a global multi-stakeholder community only if national security concerns are addressed. The House passed H.R. 4435 with provisions to protect the '.mil' domain and maintain separation between policymaking and root-zone management functions. The Senate's version of the National Defense Authorization Act, S. 2410, suggested transferring IANA functions to a global multi-stakeholder community, contingent on addressing national security concerns. The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 was signed into law on December 16, 2014. The Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, signed on December 16, 2014, does not include the DOTCOM Act provision. Section 1639 of the Act emphasizes the need for assurances to protect legacy top-level domain names and Internet Protocol address numbers, particularly for national security purposes. It also calls for mechanisms to uphold consensus-based decision making in the multi-stakeholder approach and ensure transparency, security, and efficiency in maintaining a free, open, and resilient Internet. The accountability process of the multi-stakeholder model ensures transparency, security, and efficiency for a free, open, and resilient Internet. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 4660, which does not include funds for the transition and expects NTIA to maintain the existing contract with ICANN. The House Appropriations Committee approved H.R. 4660, which does not include funds for the transition and expects NTIA to maintain the existing contract with ICANN. Representative Duffy's amendment prohibits the use of funds to relinquish NTIA's responsibility for Internet domain name system functions. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed NTIA to conduct a review of any proposed transition to ensure ICANN has an approved oversight plan insulated from foreign government control. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 directed NTIA to conduct a thorough review of the proposed transition of the IANA contract to ensure ICANN has an approved oversight plan insulated from foreign government control. NTIA must report quarterly to the committee on the privatization process and inform them in advance of any decision on a successor contract. Concerns were raised about NTIA's advocacy for U.S. businesses and consumers in ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) prohibits NTIA from using funds for IANA transition activities until September 30, 2015. NTIA must inform Congressional committees 45 days in advance of any decisions related to changing its role with ICANN or IANA activities. NTIA is also required to submit a report to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations within 45 days of enactment regarding potential recourse if a new contract is transitioned to. The NTIA is directed to report to Congress within 45 days of the enactment of P.L. 113-235 on potential recourse if a new contract for Internet governance is deleterious to the United States. Several bills, including H.R. 4367, H.R. 4398, and H.R. 5737, aim to restrict NTIA from relinquishing its responsibilities over DNS and domain name functions. The DOTCOM Act of 2015, reintroduced in the 114th Congress, would prevent NTIA from giving up control of the Internet domain name system until GAO submits a report to Congress on the transfer implications. H.R. 805 directs GAO to issue a report within one year of receiving a transition proposal, analyzing the pros and cons, transfer proposals, evaluation processes, and NTIA criteria. The GAO is tasked with analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed transfer of Internet domain name system control, along with NTIA's criteria and evaluation processes. Legislation in both the House and Senate aims to increase public awareness and understanding of the transition process. Senator Hatch introduced S.Res. 71 on February 5, 2015, to raise awareness about NTIA's proposed transition and the importance of designing accountability and governance reforms for ICANN. The Senate passed S.Res. 71 on the same day. A hearing titled \"Preserving the Multistakeholder Model of Internet Governance\" was held on February 25, 2015, where NTIA, ICANN, and others discussed the transition process. ICANN initiated a multistakeholder process to reach a consensus on the transition proposal, focusing on IANA Stewardship Transition and Enhancing ICANN Accountability. ICANN initiated a multistakeholder process to develop a proposal for the transition of NTIA's stewardship of the IANA functions. A steering group was formed to oversee the process in an open and accountable manner, composed of representatives from various ICANN constituencies and affected parties. The Coordination Group, comprised of 30 individuals from 13 communities, was tasked with preparing the transition proposal. The IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) consists of 30 individuals representing 13 communities, responsible for developing a transition proposal for the IANA functions. The ICG has requested proposals for the three primary IANA functions to be developed by operational communities associated with each function. The current status of the proposals is as follows: Domain Names proposal by CWG-Stewardship is in progress with a target submission date of June 2015, while the Number Resources proposal by CRISP Team is also in development. The CWG-Stewardship group is still working on a domain name function proposal for the ICG, with a best-case submission deadline of June 2015. The CRISP Team has already submitted the final numbering proposal, and the IANAPLAN WG finalized the protocol parameter proposal in January 2015. The domain name proposal has faced challenges in reaching a consensus, possibly due to the unique nature of the domain name IANA function being performed by ICANN itself. The debate within the multistakeholder community is whether a new organization should oversee the IANA function contract or if ICANN should be given authority with enhanced accountability measures. ICANN has also started a process to enhance its accountability mechanisms for when it is no longer under the NTIA contract. ICANN has initiated a process to strengthen its accountability mechanisms in anticipation of the end of its contract with the U.S. government. A Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) has been formed to develop proposals for enhancing accountability towards all stakeholders, with decisions made by consensus. The group includes 25 members appointed by chartering organizations and 141 participants contributing to discussions. Additionally, up to seven advisors will provide independent advice and research to the CCWG. The Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) has formed to enhance ICANN's accountability mechanisms. Up to seven advisors will provide independent advice, while other members, including an ICANN staff member and liaisons, will participate but not be part of the decision-making process. The CCWG is working on two interrelated Work Streams focusing on enhancing accountability mechanisms within the IANA Stewardship Transition timeline and addressing topics extending beyond the transition. If approved, an accountability proposal will be submitted to the ICANN Board for approval. The Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) is working on enhancing accountability mechanisms within the IANA Stewardship Transition timeline. An accountability proposal will be submitted to the ICANN Board for approval. NTIA will have to approve the multistakeholder community proposal for the transition to take place. NTIA Administrator Lawrence Strickling stated that appropriated funds will not be used to terminate the IANA functions. NTIA Administrator Lawrence Strickling clarified that no funds will be used to terminate the IANA functions contract with ICANN before September 30, 2015. NTIA will actively monitor the transition process, participate in discussions with stakeholders, and provide regular updates to Congress as required by legislation. The NTIA will actively participate in discussions with ICANN, Verisign, and other stakeholders regarding the transition plan. They support an open and participatory multistakeholder process and emphasize the importance of developing a well-thought-out plan. Administrator Strickling urges the CWG-Stewardship group to consider all transition proposal models and ensure accountability in any new organizational structures replacing NTIA's oversight of the IANA functions contract. NTIA urges the CWG-Stewardship group to consider all transition proposal models and ensure accountability in new organizational structures replacing NTIA's oversight of the IANA functions contract. Stress testing of proposed solutions is crucial to safeguard against future contingencies, and the accountability process should address issues like board member removal and improving current accountability tools. NTIA emphasizes that both transition processes should remain in sync and a coordinated and complete transition plan will be required. The groups aim to deliver a transition plan in the summer. NTIA emphasizes that both transition processes (IANA function stewardship and accountability) should remain in sync, with a coordinated and complete transition plan required. The timing for delivering the plan is targeted for the summer, with flexibility to extend if needed. ICANN is an international organization with a diverse membership influencing policy decisions, including the Governmental Advisory Committee providing advice on public policy matters. The ICANN Board considers GAC advice but is not obligated to follow it. The Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC) advises the ICANN Board on public policy matters and government concerns, but the Board is not required to follow its recommendations. There are calls for greater international involvement in Internet governance, with the United Nations proposing a new global forum for this purpose. The UN's Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) released a report in 2005 advocating for the internationalization of Internet governance and the removal of any single government's preeminent role in this area. The WGIG released a report in 2005 advocating for further internationalization of Internet governance and the creation of a new global forum for Internet stakeholders. The report proposed four possible models, including ones where ICANN would be supplanted or made accountable to a higher intergovernmental body. The U.S. opposed transferring control of the domain name system from ICANN to any international body, while the EU initially supported the U.S. position but later shifted towards favoring an enhanced international role in governing the Internet. During the WSIS Tunis Summit in 2005, conflict over control of the domain name system was averted by an Internet governance agreement between the United States, the EU, and over 100 other nations. The agreement maintained ICANN and the United States' roles, while establishing the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) under the U.N. to provide a forum for stakeholders to discuss Internet policy issues. The IGF, which does not have binding authority, was renewed by the U.N. General Assembly in 2010 for another five years, with a Working Group formed to improve its governance. The U.N. General Assembly renewed the IGF for another five years and tasked the U.N.'s CSTD to develop a report on how the IGF might be improved. A Working Group on Improvements to the Internet Governance Forum was formed, including 22 governments and Internet stakeholder groups. Controversies surrounding new gTLDs and the .xxx TLD led to debates on government influence on ICANN policy. Some nations favored enhancing the role of the GAC, while others, like Brazil, South Africa, and India, proposed creating a U.N. entity for Internet policy development. Some nations, including Russia and China, proposed an \"International Code of Conduct for Information Security\" for discussion in the U.N. General Assembly, promoting a multilateral, transparent, and democratic international management of the Internet. They released a revised version emphasizing equal responsibility for all states in governing the Internet to ensure stability, security, and equitable access. The World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) was held in Dubai on December 3-14, 2012, to revise the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITRs). The key policy question was how to address Internet traffic and governance in the updated ITRs. Some nations proposed an \"International Code of Conduct for Information Security\" for U.N. discussion, promoting a multilateral, transparent, and democratic approach to Internet management. The Administration and Congress emphasized that the new ITRs should focus on traditional international telecommunications traffic and maintain the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. Concerns arose in the 112th Congress about potential intergovernmental control over the Internet at the WCIT. A hearing was held on \"International Proposals to Regulate the Internet,\" and H.Con.Res. 127 was introduced to support the multistakeholder governance model. H.Con.Res. 127 and S.Con.Res. 50 were resolutions passed by Congress to promote a global Internet free from government control and uphold the multistakeholder model of Internet governance. The House resolution passed unanimously on August 2, 2012, while the Senate resolution passed by unanimous consent on September 22, 2012. S.Con.Res. 50, passed by the Senate on September 22, 2012, and later by the House on December 5, 2012, aimed to promote a global Internet free from government control. During the WCIT, a proposal to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance was supported by certain countries but later withdrawn. As a compromise, the ITU adopted a nonbinding resolution to foster an enabling environment for Internet growth. The ITU adopted a nonbinding resolution titled \"To Foster an enabling environment for the greater growth of the Internet\" after a proposal to extend ITR jurisdiction over Internet governance was withdrawn. The resolution includes language on equal government roles in international Internet governance and invites Member States to elaborate on their positions on Internet-related issues. The United States declined to sign the treaty due to Resolution 3 and new ITR articles on spam and cybersecurity. The international debate on Internet governance is expected to continue, with the 113th Congress likely monitoring and opposing any future proposals for intergovernmental control over the Internet. The 113th Congress will likely oversee U.S. efforts to oppose intergovernmental control over the Internet. H.R. 1580 affirms the multistakeholder model for Internet governance. It was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. ICANN and other organizations called for strengthening global multistakeholder Internet cooperation in a meeting in Uruguay. Their recommendations included reinforcing globally coherent Internet operations. In Montevideo, Uruguay, technical infrastructure stakeholders called for strengthening global multistakeholder Internet cooperation. They emphasized the importance of coherent Internet operations, expressed concern over surveillance undermining user trust, and agreed to address Internet Governance challenges. They also advocated for the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions. The President of ICANN met with the President of Brazil to plan an international Internet governance summit in April 2014. The President of ICANN met with the President of Brazil to plan an international Internet governance summit in April 2014. The summit, called NETmundial, was held in Sao Paulo and focused on crafting Internet governance principles. The outcome was a nonbinding statement endorsing the multistakeholder model of Internet governance and the transition of IANA functions to the global community. The outcome of the international Internet governance summit reaffirmed the multistakeholder model, endorsed the transition of IANA functions, emphasized strengthening the Internet Governance Forum, and highlighted the importance of human rights in a free and open Internet. ICANN formed a Panel on the Future of Global Internet Cooperation, which released a report on collaborative, decentralized Internet governance. Additionally, a NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development was announced in partnership with the World Economic Forum. The NETmundial Initiative for Internet Governance Cooperation and Development was announced in August 2014 by the World Economic Forum in partnership with ICANN and other stakeholders. The ITU's Plenipotentiary Conference in November 2014 reaffirmed the multistakeholder model of Internet governance and decided not to expand the ITU's role in Internet governance or cybersecurity. The State Department had concerns about ITU members expanding their role in Internet governance, but the conference concluded successfully with no expansion. Top Level Domains (TLDs) are suffixes at the end of web addresses, with 22 gTLDs currently in operation. Applicants for new gTLDs are typically organizations seeking to become ICANN-recognized registries. The ICANN Board of Directors approved the launch of the new gTLD program in 2011, allowing for the introduction of potentially hundreds of new gTLDs into the DNS. Applications for new gTLDs were accepted from January 12 through April 12, 2012. The ICANN Board of Directors approved the new gTLD program in 2011, allowing for the introduction of hundreds of new gTLDs into the DNS. Applications were accepted from January 12 to April 12, 2012, with a required fee of $185,000. The program has faced controversy from trademark holders concerned about higher costs and difficulties in protecting their trademarks. Governments and law enforcement also expressed concerns about intellectual property protections and combating cybercrimes across new gTLDs. The GAC advocated for more intellectual property protections in the new gTLD process, despite opposition from some U.S. government bodies. ICANN defended the gTLD program, stating it would offer more consumer and trademark holder protections, competition, choice, and innovation. The application window for new gTLDs opened on January 12, 2012, with 1,930 applications received by June 13, 2012. ICANN opened the application window for new gTLDs on January 12, 2012, receiving 1,930 applications by June 13, 2012. The evaluation process for new gTLDs is complex and can take 9 to 20 months for approval and delegation into the DNS. Rules and procedures are outlined in ICANN's gTLD Applicant Guidebook. ICANN opened the application window for new gTLDs on January 12, 2012, receiving 1,930 applications by June 13, 2012. The evaluation process for new gTLDs is complex and can take 9 to 20 months for approval and delegation into the DNS. Rules and procedures are outlined in ICANN's gTLD Applicant Guidebook. As of February 28, 2015, 521 gTLDs have been added to the Internet, and 894 gTLDs are currently proceeding through the process. ICANN plans for a second round of applications with changes to the process to address concerns about domain name abuse. The effectiveness of ICANN's approach to addressing intellectual property protection and unlawful behavior in the domain name space is of interest as the new gTLD program progresses. Legislation has been enacted to create a \"kids-friendly top level domain name\" for age-appropriate content, while the idea of an adult content top level domain name has also been considered in past Congresses. In past Congresses, bills were introduced to establish a mandatory top-level domain name for material harmful to minors, but they did not advance. ICANN considered creating a .xxx domain for adult content, which would be voluntary for adult websites to register in. The announcement of the .xxx domain was controversial. The creation of a .xxx domain for adult content was voluntary, with controversy surrounding the announcement. The ICANN Board faced objections and requests for more time before final approval. Despite initial rejection of the proposed agreement in 2006, negotiations continued, leading to a revised agreement published for public comment in 2007. However, the ICANN Board ultimately voted to deny the establishment of the .xxx domain. On January 5, 2007, ICANN published a proposed revised agreement with ICM Registry for a .xxx domain. However, on March 30, 2007, the ICANN Board voted 9-5 to deny the .xxx domain, citing reluctance to assume ongoing management of Internet content. ICM Registry challenged ICANN's decision before an Independent Review Panel, which ruled in favor of ICM Registry on February 19, 2010. The IRP found that ICM's application for the .xxx TLD met required criteria and criticized the ICANN Board's reversal as not consistent with fair policy application. The decision was non-binding, leaving the approval of ICM's .xxx TLD application to the ICANN Board of Directors. The ICANN Board's initial approval of ICM's .xxx TLD application was deemed inconsistent with fair policy application. The Board later voted to allow the application to move forward, with next steps including due diligence, negotiations on a registry agreement, and consultation with the Governmental Advisory Committee. The Board intended to enter into a registry agreement with ICM but would consult with the GAC on conflicting advice. The ICANN Board approved a resolution to establish the .xxx TLD with ICM Registry, despite conflicts with GAC advice. The domain became available in December 2011, with a vote of nine in favor, three opposed, and four abstentions. DNS security and stability remain a priority. The .xxx top-level domain was approved by the ICANN Board in December 2011, with concerns about DNS security and stability. DNSSEC technology was developed to address vulnerabilities in the DNS system, with a focus on \"signing the root\" to protect against malicious attacks. NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public input on DNSSEC deployment, collaborating with ICANN and VeriSign to enhance Internet security. The NTIA issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) for public comment on deploying DNSSEC in the Internet's DNS infrastructure, including the root zone. Collaboration with ICANN and VeriSign led to the development of an interim approach for DNSSEC deployment. ICANN published the root zone trust anchor, allowing root operators to serve the signed root zone. DNSSEC adoption by registries, registrars, and DNS server operators worldwide is crucial for enhanced security against fraudulent DNS redirection. Domain name registrants are required to provide contact information for the WHOIS database. ICANN's debate on the accessibility of WHOIS database information led to the approval of a narrow technical definition for public display. Privacy advocates, registries, registrars, and non-commercial users supported limiting access, while intellectual property interests and businesses favored broader access. The GNSO supported a narrow technical definition for public WHOIS information, favored by privacy advocates, registries, registrars, and non-commercial users. Opponents urged ICANN to reconsider the working definition, leading to a vote to defer a decision on WHOIS database privacy in October 2007. The GNSO rejected a proposal to list third party contact information instead of private data and is currently exploring extensive studies on WHOIS. ICANN initiated four separate studies on WHOIS in June 2011, examining misuse, registrant identification, proxy and privacy abuse, and the feasibility of a WHOIS proxy and privacy. The ICANN initiated four studies of WHOIS recommended by the GAC in 2008, focusing on misuse, registrant identification, proxy and privacy abuse, and feasibility of a new system. A WHOIS policy review team issued 16 recommendations for strengthening WHOIS, including improving data accuracy. The ICANN Board approved a resolution to redefine the purpose of collecting gTLD registration data and consider safeguards. An Expert Working Group recommended a next-generation Registration Directory Service to replace WHOIS, with ICANN currently developing implementation steps. The Working Group released its final report with recommendations for a next-generation Registration Directory Service to replace WHOIS. ICANN is working on implementing the Expert Working Group report. Concerns about domain name ownership and registration have led to the development of a dispute resolution policy for trademark/domain name disputes. This policy requires registrars to take no action until instructed by the domain-name holder or a court/arbitrator, except for cases of abusive registrations which are resolved through a special administrative procedure. The implementation of ICANN's Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy began in 1999, with a special procedure for resolving abusive registrations like cybersquatting.
