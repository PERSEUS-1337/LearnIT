    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 21107.8 of the Vehicle Code allows cities or counties to declare privately owned offstreet parking facilities open to the public for parking, with regulations on unauthorized parking. If a city or county enacts an ordinance allowing regulation of unauthorized parking in privately owned offstreet parking facilities, the owner must provide instructions on contesting parking fees. Additionally, they are prohibited from involving the Department of Motor Vehicles in collecting unpaid fees. An ordinance or resolution regulating offstreet parking facilities must include a notice at each entrance warning of public moving vehicle laws and potential parking invoice fees. Enforcement can occur without prior notice or posting if necessary. The department is not required to patrol or enforce parking regulations on privately owned offstreet parking facilities, except for provisions applicable to private property. Cities or counties authorizing private parking regulation must include dispute resolution procedures in their ordinance, including a written policy with specified time periods and an administrative hearing process. The dispute resolution policy for private parking regulations must include specified time periods and an administrative hearing process with options for in-person or mail hearings, administrative review, and a third-party examiner. The examiner must provide an independent, fair, and impartial review, with the authority to allow payment in installments for those unable to pay in full. Incentives based on the number of invoices or disputed invoices are prohibited, and there is a cap on parking invoice fees. The private parking regulations include a prohibition on incentives based on the number of invoices or disputed invoices, a cap on parking invoice fees, and measures to prevent private parking regulators from posing as government enforcement agencies."
