    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Vaccine Accessibility for Children and Seniors Act of 2005\" or the \"VACS Act of 2005\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of vaccines in public health, highlighting their role in saving lives and preventing disabilities. Vaccines are available for various diseases, reducing medical costs and benefiting the community. However, the threat of litigation and high manufacturing costs have led to a decrease in vaccine production by companies. The decrease in vaccine production by manufacturers, driven by costly liability lawsuits, has left only 4 companies producing the majority of vaccines in the US. In response, the Congress created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in 1986 to lower legal risks for manufacturers and ensure timely compensation for injured patients. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was created in 1986 to lower legal risks for manufacturers and ensure timely compensation for injured patients. Individuals can file claims for vaccine-related injuries and receive economic damages, with some awards exceeding $1,000,000. Vaccine companies still face significant litigation exposure despite the program. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program allows individuals to opt out and pursue lawsuits in State and Federal courts, leading to significant litigation exposure for vaccine companies. Trial attorneys often bypass the program by alleging that certain vaccines or ingredients are not covered. Additionally, individuals ineligible for the program can still pursue civil litigation. To prevent individuals ineligible for the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program from pursuing civil litigation, all vaccine-related lawsuits must be exclusively handled in the district courts of the United States, following the rules set by the United States Supreme Court in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. This ensures that valid scientific evidence is used and upholds the public health policy of promoting life-saving vaccines. Injured patients with legitimate claims should be compensated more quickly and fairly by the Program in a less adversarial manner. The Act aims to establish legal reforms to facilitate vaccine manufacture, ensure valid scientific evidence in vaccine litigation, discourage frivolous lawsuits, and expedite fair compensation for injured patients through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.

Federal Court Remedy. Section 2122 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to establish a Federal cause of action for claims related to vaccine injuries or deaths occurring after October 1, 1988. The substantive law for such actions will be based on this section and the laws of the State where the vaccine was administered. This cause of action will be the exclusive remedy for vaccine-related injuries or deaths, except for claims under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988 falls under the jurisdiction of the district courts of the United States for actions related to vaccine-related injuries or deaths. Civil actions can be removed to the district court if brought in a State court. The jurisdiction for vaccine-related injuries or deaths after October 1, 1988, falls under the district courts of the United States. State causes of action for such injuries are preempted, and the definition of a vaccine includes preservatives and components. SEC. 4. SANCTIONS FOR FRIVOLOUS VACCINE LITIGATION; 3-STRIKES RULE FOR SUSPENDING ATTORNEYS WHO COMMIT MULTIPLE RULE 11 VIOLATIONS. The text chunk discusses the mandatory suspension of attorneys who violate Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in connection with vaccine-related injury cases. Attorneys with 3 or more violations may be suspended from practicing law in a district court for 1 year, with the possibility of additional suspension. Attorneys have the right to appeal the suspension, which will be stayed during the appeal process. Reinstatement to practice law in a district court is possible after completing the suspension. To be reinstated to practice law in a district court of the United States after a suspension under subsection (a), attorneys must petition the court for reinstatement following prescribed procedures and conditions. SEC. 5. TRIAL PROCEDURE. Section 2123 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new subsection (b) regarding causation in fact in civil actions related to vaccine injuries. If the evidence shows that the injury or death was caused by the vaccine, a second stage of the trial procedure will follow. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new subsection regarding causation in civil actions related to vaccine injuries. If the injury or death was caused by the vaccine, subsequent stages of the trial procedure will follow. Amendments are made to subsections (d) and (e) to reflect this change. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to section 2122(b)(2) of the Act. Transition rules are outlined in Section 6. If a State law claim for damages or relief related to a vaccine injury is pending in court, the plaintiff can elect to treat it as a Federal law claim under the Public Health Service Act within 30 days of the enactment of this Act. Failure to file notice within the specified period will result in dismissal of the claim. The plaintiff can remove a pending State court claim related to a vaccine injury to a federal district court by filing a notice of removal within 30 days. Failure to do so will result in dismissal of the claim. The removal process follows specific procedures outlined in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. If a case is not properly removed within 40 days, it will be dismissed with prejudice. The state court must stop proceedings unless the case is remanded. The order to remand is appealable. SEC. 7. STUDY AND REPORT. The Congress intended the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program to be a flexible, no-fault system to handle claims quickly and avoid traditional litigation. Recent reports suggest delays, increased adversarial process, and a drift towards full-blown litigation, contrary to Congress' intent. After considering these findings, a study will be conducted in consultation with the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines.

The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General will submit a report to Congress with recommendations to ensure injured patients with legitimate claims are compensated in a less adversarial manner."
