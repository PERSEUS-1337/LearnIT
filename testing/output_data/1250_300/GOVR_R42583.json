    "content": "Federal job training and employment programs aim to connect vulnerable youth to work and school. These young people are typically low-income with barriers to employment, such as dropping out of school or being in foster care. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides job training and related services for unemployed and underemployed individuals, including youth. Programs under WIA, such as Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild, are carried out by the Department of Labor. These programs make up the federal job training system for youth. The federal job training system for youth includes programs like Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild. These programs aim to connect youth to educational and employment opportunities, leadership development, and community service activities. The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 provides funding for these programs, with potential reauthorization in the future. Relevant bills include H.R. 803 and S. 1356. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) includes various job training and employment services for youth, such as WIA Youth Activities, Job Corps, YouthBuild, Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, and Youth Opportunity Grants. Despite WIA's authorization expiring in FY2003, Congress continues to appropriate funds for youth job training programs. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 included programs for youth job training and services in low-income communities. Despite WIA's authorization expiring in FY2003, Congress continues to fund youth job training programs, except for the Youth Opportunity Grants program. These programs aim to connect low-income youth with educational and employment opportunities, with specific focuses on high school dropouts, youth offenders, and those at risk of dropping out. The YouthBuild program targets high school dropouts and focuses on construction-related activities. Job Corps offers residential services along with employment and educational support. The Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program provides various activities for youth offenders and at-risk individuals, including mentoring and educational services. Funding for these programs is allocated differently, with DOL distributing funds to states based on a formula. The Department of Labor (DOL) funds various youth programs such as YouthBuild, Job Corps, and the Reintegration of Ex-Offenders program. Funding is allocated based on formulas to states, which then distribute funds to local Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). DOL also partners with nonprofit and for-profit organizations to operate Job Corps centers and cooperates with the USDA Forest Service for Job Corps programs on USDA lands. Congress has been working on reauthorizing the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) and addressing issues related to youth programs under WIA. Recent hearings and listening sessions have addressed issues regarding the WIA youth programs. The Senate HELP Committee and Subcommittee discussed refining the law to improve the Youth Activities grant program. The House Education and Workforce Committee focused on declining youth employment and removing inefficiencies in job training programs. Discussions were held on updating WIA to meet the demands of a changing economy. During the 112th and 113th Congress, hearings were held to address inefficiencies in job training programs and modernize the Workforce Investment Act (WIA). Legislation was introduced to reauthorize WIA, including the Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2012 (H.R. 4297) and the Supporting Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong Skills Act (SKILLS Act). The House Committee on Education and the Workforce ordered reported and passed these bills to update WIA for a changing economy. The Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training held a legislative hearing on H.R. 803, which was later reported and passed by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. In the Senate, the Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) was introduced and discussed, addressing issues such as consolidating workforce programs to make them more efficient. Advocates for consolidation argue that combining workforce programs could increase efficiency and reduce costs, but concerns exist about potentially overlooking at-risk youth and other disadvantaged groups. Coordination between the workforce system and other systems serving youth, like education, is seen as crucial to meeting the diverse needs of young people. Congress is also interested in evaluating the effectiveness of youth workforce programs, with ongoing impact evaluations being conducted for Job Corps and YouthBuild. DOL awarded a contract to evaluate YouthBuild. Concerns include eligibility requirements for Youth Activities program and serving older youth. ARRA temporarily allowed youth ages 22-24 to access services. Stakeholders are discussing reauthorization legislation. In response to concerns about the Youth Activities program, stakeholders are debating whether to include older youth aged 22-24 and focus more on out-of-school youth. There are proposals to address the performance of Job Corps centers and potential overlap in federal workforce programs, as highlighted in a 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office. The report highlighted overlap in federal workforce programs, recommending consolidation of selected programs like the Employment Service and services under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Legislation in the 113th Congress aimed to consolidate various workforce programs, including those for youth. The Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2013 would consolidate Youth Activities, YouthBuild, and Reintegration of Ex-Offenders, among others. The Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2013 in the 113th Congress aimed to consolidate various workforce programs, including those serving youth, into a single Workforce Investment Fund allocated to states and local areas for employment and training activities. Required activities would include providing \"work ready services\" in the one-stop delivery system, such as assessment of skills, job search assistance, career planning, case management, internships, and work experience. Funding allocation to states would be based on factors like the number of disadvantaged youth. The Workforce Investment Improvement Act of 2013 aimed to consolidate workforce programs into a single fund for employment and training activities. States would allocate funding based on factors like the number of disadvantaged youth. States would set aside funding for a competitive grant program for individuals with barriers to employment, including low-income youth. State and local workforce boards would describe strategies to assist at-risk and out-of-school youth in acquiring education, skills, and credentials. The bill aims to assist at-risk and out-of-school youth in acquiring education, skills, and credentials for employment. It defines at-risk youth as those ages 16 through 24 who are low-income and high school dropouts, youth in foster care, youth offenders, youth with disabilities, children of incarcerated parents, or migrant youth. Chairman Kline stated that consolidating workforce programs would eliminate duplicative and ineffective programs while ensuring accountability. Chairman Kline emphasized the consolidation of workforce programs to eliminate duplication and ensure accountability during the markup of H.R. 803 on March 6, 2013. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on youth programs under the proposed WIF, as no minimum funding was specified for youth. S. 1356 aims to maintain youth programs and introduce Youth Innovation and Replication Grants for states and localities to enhance education and employment outcomes for youth. The role of one-stop centers in serving youth may need to be considered if youth programs are consolidated with other workforce programs. One-stop centers play a crucial role in connecting youth to job training and employment services in the community. Various methods are used to attract youth to these centers, such as active recruitment and staff training. However, some areas face challenges in attracting youth, who often only visit the centers when referred by schools or service providers. Some local areas struggle to attract youth to one-stop centers, with youth typically only visiting when referred by schools or service providers. Recommendations include catering more to youth, training service professionals on youth matters, and enhancing youth connections through funding and guidance. Methods to improve access for youth include co-locating youth program staff, customizing centers to be more \"youth-friendly,\" and establishing separate satellite centers for youth. Under H.R. 803 and S. 1356, states would be required to continue funding one-stop centers to provide job search and other assistance, with a focus on making the facilities more \"youth-friendly.\" The bills do not specify how youth would be served at these centers, and there is discussion about the consolidation of youth services and the role of youth councils in developing workforce plans. Members of the youth council include representatives from various agencies and parents of eligible youth seeking assistance through WIA's grant programs. The National Youth Employment Coalition advocates for youth employment and youth interests. The National Youth Employment Coalition (NYEC) has documented challenges faced by youth councils in developing beyond advisory roles to Workforce Investment Boards (WIBs). Reports in 2002 by GAO and DOL identified difficulties in establishing youth councils, including lack of participation due to transportation issues and conflicting schedules. Innovative youth councils have succeeded with enabling conditions such as established intermediary organizations and strong school-to-career partnerships. Stakeholders recommend a stronger role for youth councils in coordinating activities and consolidating funding streams for youth. Reauthorization legislation may make youth councils optional, as proposed in H.R. 803 in the 113th Congress. H.R. 803 in the 113th Congress proposes making youth councils optional and not requiring local workforce investment boards to have youth representatives, but state boards must have youth representatives. S. 1356 would change local workforce investment boards to local workforce development boards and require them to establish standing committees for youth services, disability services, and the one-stop system. The bill aims to address the needs of vulnerable youth and involve community-based organizations with a successful track record in serving eligible youth. The bill aims to address issues related to providing youth services by involving community-based organizations with a successful track record. It suggests enabling existing entities to fulfill requirements for standing committees. Coordination between the workforce system and education system is highlighted as a concern, with existing provisions in WIA intended to facilitate this coordination. Some stakeholders suggest that greater coordination between education entities and youth programs can help meet the needs of youth as intended by WIA. Existing WIA infrastructure like one-stop centers and youth councils can facilitate this coordination, as highlighted in a 2004 report by the Government Accountability Office on the Youth Activities program. The report found that about half of all youth received services through community-based organizations, secondary schools, and colleges or universities. The report highlighted that some education entities were cautious about partnering with WIA's Youth Activities program due to perceived inconsistencies with schools' academic mission. Collaboration between the Department of Labor and Department of Education was emphasized to ensure that all youth, whether in-school or out-of-school, receive necessary services and support. Jane Oates from the Department of Labor testified about the commitment to collaboration between the Department of Labor and Department of Education to provide services and support for youth. The School-to-Work program was a past example of this collaboration, offering grants for work-based learning and job training. H.R. 803, a reauthorization bill, includes provisions for coordination between workforce and education systems, but it is not explicit. Lessons from the STW program can inform Congress on successful partnerships between school and work systems. The bill H.R. 803 allows local areas to include education officials on the local workforce investment board, aiming to facilitate coordination between the workforce and education systems. The Senate bill S. 1356 also addresses coordination with the education system by requiring states to submit a Unified State Plan every four years covering various programs related to workforce and education. The bill H.R. 803 and Senate bill S. 1356 aim to improve coordination between workforce and education systems. States are required to submit a Unified State Plan every four years covering programs related to workforce and education, including WIA Title I and II programs. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of youth programs under WIA, but evaluations show that programs like Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild have met or exceeded their goals under common performance measures. The three programs under WIA have met or exceeded their goals as per the Department of Labor's common measures. Evaluations are required to assess program effectiveness and cost efficiency, with legislation calling for periodic independent evaluations. Limited information exists on the overall effectiveness of these programs, with only a few impact studies conducted since 2004. The GAO report highlighted limited information on the effectiveness of workforce programs, with only a few impact studies conducted since 2004. Rigorous impact studies are crucial to determine program effectiveness, but none of the five programs identified in the report were youth programs authorized under WIA. Policy makers may struggle to assess program effectiveness without sufficient data. The Youth Activities program has not been formally evaluated for impacts on participants, with only a few studies focusing on program implementation. While the Youth Activities program has not been formally evaluated for impacts on participants, a few comprehensive studies have been conducted, primarily focusing on program implementation. The Department of Labor (DOL) has contracted a research organization to conduct an impact evaluation of YouthBuild, with initial results expected in 2015. Additionally, DOL completed a process evaluation of the Job Corps program to identify center practices associated with performance measures. The study examined center practices in various areas such as general management, academic and Career Technical Training practices, student life, staff dynamics, and community relations. Factors linked to strong performance included robust student support, staff accountability, and strong partner relationships. Job Corps program was evaluated in the late 1990s to early 2000s, showing positive outcomes in education and employment for youth ages 16-24. A follow-up study found positive employment impacts 5 to 10 years later for individuals aged 26-34. The follow-up report analyzed the longer-term impacts of the program on earnings and employment rates 5 to 10 years after random assignment. Positive employment effects diminished, with similar rates and earnings between program and control groups. However, older youth aged 20-24 at the time of program application saw increased earnings. WIA specifies performance measures for Youth Activities, Job Corps, and YouthBuild programs. Concerns have been raised about performance measures potentially discouraging serving youth with significant barriers to employment. H.R. 803, the WIA reauthorization bill, aims to address concerns about performance measures for Youth Activities and Job Corps by introducing new indicators for measuring outcomes such as entry into unsubsidized employment, retention in employment, earnings growth, and attainment of credentials within one year of program completion. The WIA reauthorization bill introduces new indicators for measuring outcomes for eligible youth in activities funded by the WIA Youth Activities program, including entry into education, training, or employment, retention in education, training, or employment, earnings for employed youth, attainment of credentials or diploma, participation in education or training programs leading to credentials or employment, and program effectiveness in serving employers. States may also require additional performance indicators, and the DOL Secretary must establish performance measures for Job Corps center operators based on these indicators. The DOL Secretary must establish performance measures for Job Corps center operators based on indicators for youth eligible under the WIA Youth Activities program. State and local performance measures are set forth in WIA to assess the effectiveness of workforce investment activities. Core indicators for youth ages 14-18 include basic skills, secondary school diplomas, and placement in postsecondary education or employment. The core indicators for youth ages 14-18 include basic skills, secondary school diplomas, and placement in postsecondary education or employment. For youth ages 19-21, the core indicators are entry into employment, retention in employment, earnings, and attainment of a credential. Stakeholders have raised concerns that performance measures may not accurately reflect the progress of at-risk youth, leading programs to focus on higher-functioning individuals to meet targets. Some programs only accept youth at specific grade levels to ensure goal achievement. The Government Accountability Office found that some programs funded with Youth Activities dollars only accepted youth at specific grade levels to meet program goals. The Department of Labor issued guidance in 2010 to help service providers assist lower-skilled youth while still achieving performance goals. This guidance included strategies like multiyear contracting and using real-time indicators to assess provider performance. The Government Accountability Office found that some programs funded with Youth Activities dollars only accepted youth at specific grade levels to meet program goals. In 2010, the Department of Labor issued guidance to assist service providers in helping lower-skilled youth while still achieving performance goals. The guidance included strategies like using \"real-time\" indicators to assess provider performance and encouraging interagency collaboration to meet the needs of youth before enrollment in WIA programs. The Department of Labor encourages local Workforce Investment Boards to use \"real-time\" indicators like changes in attitudes, behaviors, and skills to assess youth program effectiveness. Suggestions have been made to adjust performance levels for serving higher-risk youth populations, similar to adjustments made under the Job Training Partnership Act. Governors could adjust standards based on economic and demographic factors to better serve needy youth. The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) allowed for adjustments to national performance standards based on economic and demographic factors in service delivery areas (SDAs). Under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA), Job Corps is required to establish over 20 core performance metrics, with an additional 33 metrics implemented by the Department of Labor. These metrics cover outcomes such as entered employment, average wage, and retention in postsecondary education or employment. The Department of Labor (DOL) has implemented 33 performance metrics to assess the Job Corps program's performance, which cover outcomes such as employment, average wage, and retention in postsecondary education or employment. A report by the DOL Office of the Inspector General raised concerns about inaccurate reporting of results and miscalculations in the program. YouthBuild program applicants are required to include a description of results to be achieved with respect to common indicators of performance for youth and lifelong learning. Applicants for the YouthBuild program must include a description of performance results based on common indicators. The final regulation for YouthBuild, issued in February 2012, outlines performance measures including employment or education placement, degree attainment, and literacy gains. The Department of Labor (DOL) provides guidance on performance indicators for grantees, including retention rates and placement in employment or education after program completion. The YouthBuild program aims to track retention rates and recidivism rates of participants. Stakeholders discuss eligibility criteria and serving out-of-school and older youth. H.R. 803 requires states to assist at-risk and out-of-school youth. Under H.R. 803, states and local areas must have strategies to assist at-risk youth, defined as low-income individuals with barriers to employment, and out-of-school youth ages 16-24. Eligibility for the Youth Activities program includes being age 14-21, low-income, and facing barriers like literacy deficiencies or homelessness. Discussions around the WIA Youth program include the requirement for youth to prove their low-income status. The WIA Youth program faces challenges in verifying youth eligibility, particularly regarding income documentation. State and local officials reported difficulties in obtaining necessary proof of eligibility, diverting resources from service delivery. GAO's research highlighted that income requirements may exclude some needy youth from the program. According to GAO, state and local workforce officials noted challenges with youth providing required documents for WIA program eligibility, especially regarding income requirements. Some youth may struggle to prove eligibility under various criteria, such as involvement in foster care or the justice system. States have requested waivers for certain eligibility criteria, but DOL cannot waive participant eligibility requirements. States and localities face challenges in verifying youth eligibility for WIA programs, particularly regarding income requirements. While DOL cannot grant waivers for participant eligibility, states have the authority to establish their own policies. Some stakeholders argue that WIA lacks flexibility in documenting income and other eligibility factors. In the past, some states preferred using eligibility criteria from WIA's predecessor, JTPA, which included criteria like participation in the free lunch program or being economically disadvantaged. The eligibility criteria for WIA programs are being debated, with suggestions including basing it on means-tested programs like the free lunch program, residency in high-poverty areas, or certain risk factors. Stakeholders are concerned about how changing the criteria would impact the number of eligible youth and whether those with more opportunities would still receive services. The Youth Activities program under WIA is required to allocate at least 30% of funds for out-of-school youth, but challenges persist in recruiting and retaining them. Serving out-of-school youth is more costly and maintaining contact with them is difficult, especially due to transportation issues. Serving out-of-school youth under the WIA Youth program is more costly and challenging due to difficulties in maintaining contact, especially with transportation issues. Some stakeholders suggest allocating more funding to dropouts and high-risk youth, even those in school. There are debates on whether to prioritize out-of-school youth or maintain the current funding share, with some advocating for increased technical assistance for these youth. Flexibility in funding allocation is also seen as necessary. Some argue for maintaining current funding for out-of-school youth but increasing technical assistance. DOL has provided guidance on serving out-of-school and at-risk in-school youth. In response to concerns, DOL recommended strong alternative education programs for out-of-school youth. DOL also funded Multiple Education Pathways Blueprint Grants to reconnect dropouts to education pathways. A 2004 report identified successful ways local areas served out-of-school youth. The 2004 report for DOL addressed the implementation of WIA programs for out-of-school youth, highlighting successful strategies such as technical assistance, resource lists, and contracting with experienced service providers. WIA eligibility is for youth ages 14-21, with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 temporarily extending services to youth up to age 24 to reach more unemployed young adults. The WIA Youth services have expanded the upper age limit to reach more unemployed young adults. Research suggests that many young people are taking longer to transition to adulthood due to various factors. Older youth are more likely to be disconnected from work or school. Addressing whether WIA should target these older youth in reauthorization legislation is a consideration, but it may strain program resources if funding remains stable. Increasing the age limit for WIA Youth program to include older youth, specifically those aged 22-24, could strain program resources if funding remains stable. DOL allows co-enrollment of older youth in both Youth and Adult programs to meet individual needs, such as mentoring services and occupational skills training. The extent to which youth ages 18-21 self-select or are targeted for these programs is unclear. The Youth program offers mentoring services and the Adult program provides individual training accounts for occupational skills training. There is uncertainty about whether youth ages 18-21 choose to participate in the Youth program, Adult program, or both. Exiters ages 19-21 in the Youth program have increased, while youth ages 18-21 in the Adult program make up a smaller portion of the exiter population. The Youth program offers more academic services, while the Adult program focuses on dropout services during the core phase. The Youth program offers academic services like tutoring and alternative secondary school services, leadership development, and community service activities. The Adult program provides information on dropout services, job search assistance, workplace training with related instruction, and referrals to supportive services like child care and transportation. Training activities are available mainly to Adult program participants in the training component. The Youth program offers academic services like tutoring, leadership development, and community service activities. The Adult program provides job search assistance, workplace training, and referrals to supportive services. The DOL published a request for comment on selecting low-performing centers for closure based on performance rating, on-board strength, and facility condition. The Department of Labor (DOL) is considering closing low-performing centers based on factors like on-board strength, facility condition, and student outcomes. DOL aims to improve center performance through federal oversight and resource optimization, considering the impact on students and taxpayers. The comment period ended in February 2013, with no decision made as of February 2014. The Department of Labor is considering closing low-performing centers to maximize results for students and taxpayers. H.R. 803 includes provisions to improve and close underperforming centers, with new performance measures and a program improvement plan for those reporting less than 50% on certain indicators. The bill also mandates an audit of center performance over the past 10 years and ranking based on performance and incidents of violence. Three months after H.R. 803 is enacted, the DOL Secretary will audit centers based on the past 10 years of performance, ranking them based on incidents of violence. A report to Congress will identify underperforming centers, with a directive to close the bottom 25 out of 125 centers within a year. Similar proposals to close inefficient Job Corps centers have been suggested in the past but were not implemented. Legislation in the 104th Congress aimed to close 25 underperforming centers based on audits and performance criteria. Legislation in the 104th Congress proposed closing 25 underperforming Job Corps centers based on audits and performance criteria, with the idea of transferring operation to states. Concerns were raised about potential limitations on student access and funding shifts. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356) would direct the Secretary to determine center closures and establish performance metrics for the Youth Activities program. It aims to improve performance within a one-year period. The Workforce Investment Act of 2013 aims to improve performance within a one-year period by implementing a performance improvement plan (PIP) and common measures developed by the Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA) for workforce programs. These common measures include placement in employment or education, attainment of a degree or education, and literacy and numeracy gains. ETA has issued policy guidance on the common measures for programs like Youth Activities and Job Corps. The Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA) has issued policy guidance on common measures for workforce programs like Youth Activities and Job Corps. These measures are not meant to replace existing performance reporting requirements but are used to assess program performance under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). Goals for the common measures are set ambitiously and are part of the budget process. The Department of Labor sets ambitious goals for common measures in workforce programs like Youth Activities and Job Corps as part of the budget process. Performance targets are developed using regression analysis to account for different economic circumstances and labor market conditions. YouthBuild targets are based on the same analysis as Youth Activities, and Job Corps targets are set similarly. The Department of Labor sets performance targets for employment and training programs like YouthBuild and Job Corps based on regression analysis. The targets are determined by economic assumptions, program results, and unemployment rates. Both programs have met or exceeded their goals in recent years. Key measures include placement in employment or education and attainment of a degree or certificate. The program measures the attainment of a degree or certificate for youth participants who are not in school or employed when they enter. It excludes those in postsecondary school and focuses on literacy or numeracy gains for those deficient in basic skills. The measure focuses on literacy or numeracy gains for out-of-school youth who are deficient in basic skills. It assesses the increase in educational functional levels for youth participants who complete a year in the program. Testing is done at regular intervals to track progress and exclude those not in need of remediation. The program focuses on literacy or numeracy gains for out-of-school youth deficient in basic skills. Testing is done to track progress and exclude those not in need of remediation, with guidance on types of tests and accommodations for students with disabilities provided by DOL."
