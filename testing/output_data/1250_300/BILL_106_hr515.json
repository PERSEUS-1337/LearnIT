    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Handgun Injury Prevention Act.\" The Congress findings show that in the 10 years from 1987 to 1996, nearly 2,200 children aged 14 or younger died from unintentional shootings in the US. The country leads in rates of children lost to unintentional firearms-related death compared to other industrialized nations. Additionally, the number of nonfatal unintentional firearm injuries treated in US hospitals annually is significantly higher. In the United States, the number of nonfatal unintentional gunshot wounds in children treated in hospital emergency rooms is nearly 8 times higher than the number of unintentional deaths from firearms. Studies have shown that children as young as 3 years old are capable of firing most commercially available handguns. In a study, it was found that a high percentage of young children had sufficient finger strength to fire most commonly available handguns. There is public support for safety regulation of the firearms industry, as many trigger locks and safety devices are inadequate to prevent accidental discharge or children gaining access to firearms. Firearms are not subject to minimum safety standards despite being products that move in interstate commerce. Regulation of handgun discharge protection products is addressed in Section 3. The Secretary of the Treasury will regulate handgun discharge protection products to reduce the risk of children being injured by unintentional handgun discharge. Regulations will include a minimum safety standard for these products, ensuring they are of high quality and cannot be easily removed from a handgun. The Secretary of the Treasury will regulate handgun discharge protection products to prevent children from operating a handgun. The standard will ensure quality construction and restrict removal without specific access methods. Test protocols related to poison prevention packaging standards may be considered. The standard must be issued within 12 months and will take effect 6 months after issuance. SEC. 4. ORDERS; INSPECTIONS. The Secretary has the authority to issue orders prohibiting the manufacture, sale, transfer, or delivery of a handgun discharge protection product that violates the Act. They can also require the manufacturer and dealers to provide notice of associated risks and how to avoid them. The Secretary can take various actions to ensure compliance with the Act, including bringing products into conformity, repairing or replacing them, issuing refunds, recalling products, or submitting a plan for implementation. Additionally, inspections may be conducted to verify compliance with regulations. The Secretary has the authority to enter places where handgun discharge protection products are manufactured, stored, or transported for inspection. SEC. 5 prohibits licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers from selling handguns without a handgun discharge protection product. There is an exception for sales to government agencies. SEC. 6 addresses warning labels for handguns. SEC. 6 requires licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers to include warning labels on handgun packaging to prevent child access and potential injuries or death. SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. This section mandates that licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers must include warning labels on handgun packaging to prevent child access and potential injuries or death. Additionally, it specifies that the warning label should be in contrast with other printed matter on the package and descriptive materials. The effective date for this section is 60 days after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 7. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. Licensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers must report any information indicating a child's unintentional or self-inflicted gunshot wound from a handgun they sold after the Act's effective date, resulting in death, serious injury, or medical treatment. The Secretary may assess civil penalties up to $10,000 for violations of the Act, revoke federal firearms licenses for violations, and allow individuals to bring a private cause of action for damages in court. Private individuals can enforce the Act in court and may be awarded attorney's fees if successful. Compliance with the Act does not excuse liability under common law or state statutes. Under this Act, failure to take action authorized by the Secretary will not be admissible in litigation under common law or State statutory law. Criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment, may be imposed on individuals who knowingly violate provisions of the Act regarding handgun discharge protection products. SEC. 9. NO EFFECT ON STATE LAW. This Act does not affect State laws unless they conflict with it, in which case the Act takes precedence. State laws providing greater protection for children regarding handguns are not considered inconsistent with this Act. SEC. 10. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 10. DEFINITIONS. This section defines terms such as \"handgun discharge protection product,\" \"children,\" \"licensed importer,\" \"licensed manufacturer,\" \"licensed dealer,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"handgun\" in relation to their use in the Act."
