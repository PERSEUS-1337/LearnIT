    "content": "The \"Worker Protection Warnings Act of 1993\" is referenced in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The Act includes a short title and findings section. The Congress finds that the absence of uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use increases worker exposure to workplace injuries and illnesses. The absence of Federal standards leaves questions about the adequacy of warnings to be determined by inconsistent State requirements, placing a burden on interstate commerce. The purpose of this Act is to enhance workplace safety by establishing uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use and preempting any conflicting State standards. Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 655) is amended to include a new subsection requiring the Secretary, in consultation with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, to establish uniform warnings for personal protective equipment within 12 months. Personal protective equipment includes gear for eyes, face, head, hearing, extremities, or respiratory tract protection in the workplace. Warnings are statements directing actions or procedures related to the use of such equipment. The amended Section 6 requires the establishment of uniform warnings for personal protective equipment within 12 months. Warnings are statements directing actions or procedures related to the use of personal protective equipment to prevent personal injury or death. Standards issued under this section must include the full text of each warning and require employers to communicate and train employees on the proper use of the equipment. The amended Section 6 mandates uniform warnings for personal protective equipment within 12 months. Employers must train employees on the proper use of equipment and consequences of not following warnings. The standards exempt warnings for equipment placed in commerce before the effective date unless communicated to the employer. The Secretary considers manufacturer experience and worker opinions when promulgating standards. The Secretary, when creating standards for warnings on personal protective equipment, must consider factors like manufacturer experience, means of communication, worker opinions, and expert input on effectiveness. SEC. 6. PREEMPTION. The amendment to Section 4 clarifies Congress's intent to regulate warnings for personal protective equipment. The amendment to Section 18 prohibits states from establishing standards different from those set by the Secretary of Labor for personal protective equipment. The Secretary cannot approve a state plan that includes requirements different from those in occupational safety and health standards."
