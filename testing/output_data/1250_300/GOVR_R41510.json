    "content": "The House PAYGO rule for the 116th Congress prohibits legislation affecting direct spending and revenues that would increase the deficit or reduce the surplus over a 6 or 11-year period. Direct spending is mandatory and includes programs like Medicare, while revenues are funds collected through taxes. Revenues collected by the federal government consist of various taxes and are under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means in the House. The House PAYGO rule applies to legislation affecting direct spending and revenues, requiring measures to offset any deficit increases with equivalent reductions in spending or increases in revenue. The House PAYGO rule requires measures to offset deficit increases with spending reductions or revenue increases. Savings from a previously passed measure can be used to offset a separate measure's deficit increase if they are combined upon engrossment. The rule specifies that deficit or surplus effects are based on estimates by the Committee on the Budget relative to CBO baseline estimates. The House PAYGO rule requires offsetting deficit increases with spending cuts or revenue increases. Baseline estimates by the CBO project revenues, spending, and deficit levels under existing law. The rule exempts direct spending increases or revenue reductions under existing law and provisions designated as emergencies from PAYGO compliance. Legislation with an emergency designation requires a full House vote for consideration. The House PAYGO rule requires offsetting deficit increases with spending cuts or revenue increases. Legislation with an emergency designation requires a full House vote for consideration. The rule is enforced by a point of order to prevent the consideration of legislation that violates it. The House PAYGO rule, established in the 110th Congress, requires deficit increases to be offset with spending cuts or revenue increases. It can be waived by special rules or unanimous consent. The rule is not self-enforcing and must be raised by a Member. The PAYGO rule was established in the 110th Congress and replaced with the CUTGO rule in the 112th Congress, focusing on mandatory spending effects. In the 116th Congress, the PAYGO rule was reinstated to cover both mandatory spending and revenues with modifications. The House adopted its own PAYGO rule, prohibiting legislation projected to increase the deficit or reduce the surplus over 6 and 11 years, including on-budget and off-budget entities like Social Security. The original PAYGO rule counted on-budget and off-budget entities to determine the deficit impact. The Budget Committee used CBO baseline estimates for this purpose. In the 111th Congress, the rule was adopted with amendments, including the requirement to use CBO baseline estimates. In the 111th Congress, the House amended the PAYGO rule to align with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, making changes to baseline estimates and exceptions for compliance. The House amended clause 10 of Rule XXI to align the House PAYGO rule with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. The changes focused on scoring issues, such as excluding off-budget effects and requiring consistency with the Statutory PAYGO Act. Scoring requirements were incorporated into the House PAYGO rule, including budgetary effects from outyear modifications but excluding timing shifts and extensions of current policy. The House amended its rules to align with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, focusing on scoring issues and consistency. The new Cut-As-You-Go (CUTGO) rule replaced the PAYGO rule, emphasizing the net effect of new legislation on mandatory spending only. This rule excluded revenue effects and prohibited legislation increasing mandatory spending over specific periods. The CUTGO rule replaced the PAYGO rule, focusing on the net effect of new legislation on mandatory spending only. It excluded revenue effects and prohibited legislation increasing mandatory spending over specific periods. The rule did not continue the \"adjustments for current policies\" and generally retained procedures from the previous PAYGO rule. The new House PAYGO rule, reinstated by the Democratic majority in the 116th Congress, incorporates projected revenue effects into determining violations, including off-budget effects like those impacting Social Security trust funds. It retains procedures from the previous CUTGO and PAYGO rules, allowing for combining budgetary effects under certain circumstances and excluding emergency budgetary effects. The House PAYGO rule, along with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, aims to prevent legislative actions that would increase the on-budget deficit. While similar, they differ in enforcement, with the House rule applying during legislation consideration on the House floor. The House PAYGO rule and the Statutory PAYGO Act have similar goals of preventing deficit increases but differ in enforcement. The House rule applies during legislation consideration on the House floor, while the statutory rule applies after legislation is enacted, requiring the net effect of all bills affecting spending and revenues to not increase the deficit over a specified period. The Statutory PAYGO Act requires that the net effect of all legislation enacted during a session of Congress must not increase the deficit over a 5 or 10-year period. It is enforced through sequestration, which cancels budgetary resources to offset deficit increases. This differs from the House PAYGO rule, which is enforced by a point of order during legislation consideration on the House floor. The Statutory PAYGO Act enforces deficit reduction through sequestration if legislation increases the deficit over 5 or 10 years. This differs from the House PAYGO rule, which is enforced by a point of order during legislation consideration on the House floor. The President issues a sequestration order to cancel budgetary resources in non-exempt direct spending programs to eliminate the balance. The Statutory PAYGO Act has no expiration date and prohibits considering any bill that increases the deficit over specific periods. The effect on the deficit is determined by estimates from the Committee on the Budget relative to baseline estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. The deficit or surplus is determined based on estimates by the Committee on the Budget relative to baseline estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. If a bill or amendment includes provisions from a separate measure passed by the House, those provisions are included in the evaluation. Certain emergency provisions may be excluded from the evaluation under specific circumstances. The evaluation of a bill or amendment considers budgetary impacts, excluding emergency designations. Terms like \"budget year\" and \"current year\" are defined as per the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Direct spending includes outyear modifications to substantive law in appropriations Acts."
