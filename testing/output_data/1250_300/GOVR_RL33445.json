Despite some unresolved trading issues, support for continuing negotiations on certain topics like government procurement, competition policy, intellectual property rights, and labor conditions was reaffirmed. Concerns were raised in Malaysia about opening up financial markets to U.S. companies due to the financial crisis in the United States. Various interest groups in Malaysia, including SMEs, called for the Malaysian government to address these issues.

President Obama signaled that workers' rights and environmental issues would be prioritized in trade negotiations. Ron Kirk was nominated as U.S. Trade Representative to ensure agreements protect workers' rights and promote American interests. Talks for the Free Trade Agreement were postponed in 2008, leading to a perception in Malaysia that the Bush Administration did not prioritize relations with Malaysia. In December 2007, Ambassador Keith reassured the press of the U.S. commitment to Malaysia despite low-level delegation sent to Malaysia's National Day celebrations. U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Weisel confirmed the U.S. aim to conclude the Free Trade Agreement by summer 2008. Negotiations for the agreement began in January 2008 in Kuala Lumpur. On January 14, 2008, Malaysia and the United States began their seventh round of formal negotiations in Kuala Lumpur over the terms of a possible U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement. The United States sought \"real, demonstrable progress\" during the talks, with hopes of completing the agreement by the middle of 2008. Assessments of the outcome were mixed, with discussions on investment, trade, intellectual property rights, and legal issues. Both countries were optimistic about concluding the free trade agreement by summer. The United States and Malaysia were hopeful of concluding their free trade agreement by summer, with significant progress made during the seventh round of talks. However, later reports indicated less optimism, with the possibility of the agreement not being completed by the end of July leading the U.S. to focus on other FTA agreements. Ambassador Keith indicated that if the FTA with Malaysia was not completed by the end of July, the United States would focus on other FTA agreements with South Korea and Colombia before the end of the Bush Administration. The lack of a decision on the date and place for the next round of talks was also a negative sign. Minister Rafidah mentioned that most issues had been cleared, and there might not be a need for another meeting. The eighth round of negotiations took place in Washington, DC from July 14-18, 2008, with Abdul Rahman Mamat leading the Malaysian delegation and Assistant USTR Weisel as the chief negotiator for the U.S. government. The negotiations in Washington, DC from July 14-18, 2008, were overshadowed by political events in both nations. The talks focused on trade in agricultural goods, services, investment, IPR, SPS measures, and legal provisions. The upcoming U.S. presidential elections and Malaysia's general elections influenced the discussions. The uncertain status of U.S. FTAs with Colombia and South Korea also impacted the talks.

The key issue for the July 2008 talks was foreign access to Malaysian government procurement contracts. Malaysia excluded rice from FTA negotiations and indicated progress in exploring business collaboration in the services sector with the U.S. In talks with the U.S., Malaysia considered business collaboration and capacity-building in the services sector within the Malaysia-U.S. FTA framework. The U.S. hoped Malaysia's government procurement reforms would advance FTA negotiations. Malaysia's willingness to discuss government procurement was a positive development. The U.S. took a pragmatic approach in negotiations, but using the Singapore FTA as a model caused issues in talks with Malaysia. Plans for the ninth round of negotiations in late 2008 were postponed after the U.S. presidential elections. Malaysia's use of the Singapore FTA as a negotiation model caused issues in talks with the U.S. The ninth round of negotiations scheduled for late 2008 was postponed after the U.S. presidential elections.

In Malaysia, there is opposition to Israel and the United States, with calls for a boycott of U.S. goods like Coca Cola, KFC, McDonalds, and Starbucks. The Malaysian Bar Council urged a review of FTA negotiations with the U.S. due to perceived support for \"Israeli atrocities against Palestinians.\" Minister Muhyiddin suspended FTA talks in response to events in Gaza, with negotiations postponed at the request of the United States. Minister Muhyiddin postponed FTA talks with the U.S. at their request until after the presidential inauguration. Key unresolved issues include intellectual property rights, market access for U.S. goods in Malaysia, trade in services, and government procurement policies. Malaysia's enforcement of intellectual property laws remains a concern, with software piracy at 59% in 2007, costing the industry $311 million. Malaysia has tightened laws on intellectual property protection and enforcement, with software piracy at 59% in 2007 costing $311 million. The USTR noted Malaysia's efforts to improve IPR regime but urged further improvements, including through the creation of a specialized IPR court. Concerns exist over IPR protection for pharmaceuticals in the U.S.-Malaysia FTA negotiations. Malaysia is concerned about the U.S. push for stricter intellectual property provisions in the U.S.-Malaysia FTA, particularly regarding compulsory licensing for pharmaceuticals. Opposition in Malaysia fears that the FTA could lead to costly patents on anti-retroviral AIDS drugs, hindering access for HIV/AIDS patients. Malaysia has utilized compulsory licensing to provide affordable anti-retroviral drugs and has a growing automobile industry. Malaysia's automobile industry, including manufacturers like Proton and Perodua, is successful globally. The government protects the industry with high tariffs and policies favoring domestic producers. The Malaysian government protects its automobile industry with high tariffs and policies favoring domestic producers, such as rebates on excise taxes for national car manufacturers. However, in order to meet WTO and ASEAN Free Trade Agreement commitments, some protections are being dismantled. Malaysia imposes tariffs on assembled vehicles from outside ASEAN and excise taxes ranging from 80-200% on automobiles. During negotiations, Malaysia is concerned about U.S. measures protecting its domestic automobile industry, including a 25% tariff on pickup truck imports. The U.S. Automotive Trade Policy Council supports the proposed FTA to access a historically protected market. Malaysia designates rice as a \"strategic crop\" not included in the FTA and maintains tariffs on agricultural goods to protect local farmers. Minister Mustapa Mohamad reaffirmed Malaysia's stance on rice as a strategic crop. Malaysia also raises concerns about U.S. SPS regulations. Malaysia remains firm in designating rice as a strategic crop excluded from any FTA with the United States. Concerns are raised about U.S. SPS regulations and restrictions on agricultural trade. Financial services, particularly foreign ownership limits in banks and insurance companies, pose challenges in negotiations.

Malaysian government procurement restrictions favor bumiputera participation, leading to challenges in negotiations. Malaysian negotiators faced constraints in opening the government procurement market. There is interest in Malaysian businesses gaining preferential access to the U.S. government procurement process. The Malaysian business community is interested in accessing the U.S. government procurement market, which is significantly larger than Malaysia's. The U.S. has offered limited access to bid on contracts worth $250 billion to maintain proportional market access. The government procurement issue was not a major topic in negotiations in 2008, as Malaysia was reviewing its position. The proposed U.S.-Malaysia FTA requires congressional approval and is of interest to Congress.

Initial responses were positive, with support from Senator Max Baucus and Representatives Jim Kolbe and Dan Burton. The National Association of Manufacturers and a U.S.-Malaysia FTA Business Coalition also support the agreement. However, objections have been raised by some Malaysian and U.S. labor unions, farmers, fishermen, and academics. Malaysia's role in countering radical Islamic influences aligns with U.S. interests in economy and trade. The U.S.-Malaysia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) Business Coalition was formed in 2006. Objections to the FTA have been raised by Malaysian and U.S. labor unions, farmers, fishermen, and academics. The proposed FTA aligns with U.S. interests in economy and trade, countering radical Islamic influences, promoting democracy, and securing safe shipping channels. It is part of the Bush Administration's strategy for regional and bilateral trade initiatives to stimulate global economic growth through free markets and trade. The FTA is a step towards realizing APEC's vision of free and open trade in the Pacific. The United States proposed forming a Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific at the 2006 APEC meetings. The USTR listed four major goals for a U.S.-Malaysia FTA, including creating new opportunities for U.S. manufacturers and strengthening economic partnerships in the region. Other benefits mentioned were increasing exports, diversifying exports, and enhancing economic growth and job creation. The Ministry of International Trade in Malaysia is leading negotiations for a proposed Free Trade Agreement with the United States. The objectives include seeking better market access for Malaysian goods and services, promoting bilateral trade and investment flows, enhancing competitiveness of Malaysian producers, and building capacity through technical cooperation. The proposed FTA aims to cover liberalization of goods and services, trade and investment promotion, investment protection, and economic and technical cooperation programs. The Ministry of International Trade in Malaysia is leading negotiations for a proposed Free Trade Agreement with the United States, aiming to seek better market access for Malaysian goods and services. Malaysian industries, such as clothing, textiles, ceramics, lumber, rubber, and consumer electronics, support the FTA for increased access to the U.S. market.

Chile and Malaysia announced negotiations for a bilateral FTA in June, with the first round of talks held in Kuala Lumpur. The U.S. government aims to strengthen relations with Malaysia, a key player in Asia's economic transformation, through the proposed FTA. Malaysia's strategic role in U.S. foreign policy as a moderate, democratic Muslim nation is highlighted, with hopes to enhance cooperation in multilateral and regional forums. Malaysia plays a strategic role in U.S. foreign policy, promoting moderate Islam and cooperation in various areas.

The AFL-CIO opposes FTAs without worker rights and environmental protections. Labor organizations, including the AFL-CIO, oppose U.S.-Malaysia FTA and other FTAs without meaningful protections for workers' rights and environmental standards.

Barack Obama supported labor unions' concerns about FTA labor provisions during his presidential campaign. Labor conditions in Malaysia have faced international criticism, with only 9.5% of the labor force represented by trade unions. Malaysian trade union officials report delays in obtaining legal recognition, and there are concerns about the working conditions of the 2.5 million immigrant workers, mostly from Indonesia. Opposition to a U.S.-Malaysia FTA has been organized in Malaysia, with a campaign resulting in petitions from farmers and fishermen. Opposition to a U.S.-Malaysia FTA has been organized in Malaysia, with concerns raised about the impact on rice farmers and the fishing industry. Public Citizen criticizes the FTA model for its effects on labor and environmental standards. In Malaysia, there are also concerns about the cost of pharmaceutical drugs. The FTA with Central America is criticized for promoting privatization and deregulation of public services. In Malaysia, concerns about the cost of pharmaceutical drugs, especially for HIV/AIDS treatment, are raised. U.S. relations with Israel could complicate negotiations due to Malaysia's lack of diplomatic relations with Israel and export license requirements for goods sent there. Opposition to U.S. products and calls to suspend FTA negotiations have arisen due to U.S. support for Israel's military operations in Gaza. During recent congressional consideration of FTAs, opposition concerns have been addressed through legislation or commitments from the Administration. For example, in the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States FTA negotiations, the Bush Administration promised actions to address labor, sugar, and textile interests' concerns. This included allocating $40 million for labor and environmental enforcement assistance and ensuring no interference with the sugar program through FY2007. Promises were also made regarding rules of origin and customs enforcement for textile and apparel products. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 promised actions to address concerns in the textile and apparel industry, including rules of origin and customs enforcement. Free trade agreements aim to reduce barriers to trade and investment by eliminating tariffs, import quotas, and non-tariff barriers. FTAs also provide access to services, open markets for investment, strengthen intellectual property protection, and include dispute settlement processes. Winners of FTAs are exporters, investors, and consumers, while losers are companies and workers in import-competing industries. Non-party countries can also be affected by the terms of the FTA. FTAs create winners and losers, benefiting exporters, investors, and consumers while impacting companies and workers in import-competing industries. The United States has negotiated FTAs with Southeast Asian nations like Singapore and is in talks with Malaysia. Both countries participate in the Information Technology Agreement, ensuring tariff-free trade on information technology products. An FTA with Malaysia would eliminate tariffs on various U.S. exports, including semiconductors and computer parts. This agreement would benefit both countries by opening up markets currently restricted by tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Key economic indicators of Malaysia are summarized in Table 1. Malaysia's key economic indicators show it as one of the fastest-growing economies, with a significant GDP and per capita income. The United States is Malaysia's largest trading partner and foreign investor, with strong bilateral trade relations. According to U.S. trade figures, Malaysia was the tenth largest trading partner of the United States in 2007, with U.S. exports to Malaysia totaling $10 billion. The United States also invested $1.8 billion in Malaysia in the first 10 months of 2008, making it the second largest foreign investor in the country after Australia. Free trade agreements (FTAs) can impact trade flows by diverting exports and imports towards the countries involved, lowering tariffs, and creating a substitution effect where imports replace domestic production. Table 2 displays U.S. trade data with Malaysia from 2000 to 2007, showing steady U.S. exports to Malaysia around $10 billion annually until a peak of $12.5 billion in 2006, then declining to $11.7 billion in 2007.

These rates indicate the actual level of tariff protection in the country, which can be lower than the MFN rates due to various factors. For sectors like transport equipment, non-electrical machinery, and electrical machinery, Malaysia's tariff rates are significantly higher than those of the United States. In 2006, Malaysia had an average applied tariff rate of 8.4%, more than twice the U.S. rate of 3.7%.
