    "content": "The secondary liability under 18 U.S.C. 2 holds individuals accountable for aiding and abetting federal crimes. Aiding and abetting requires actively participating in the crime and seeking its success. This principle is based on the idea that society fears the crimes of multiple individuals more than those of a single person. Aiding and abetting involves actively participating in someone else's crime and consciously contributing to its success. The defendant must know about the offense before it occurs to be convicted. The level of assistance provided is not a determining factor, as even minimal aid can lead to liability. However, mere knowledge or assistance without intent is not sufficient. Additionally, aiding and abetting is not a federal offense itself but describes how a defendant's conduct led to the commission of a federal offense. A completed offense is a prerequisite to conviction for aiding and abetting, but the hands-on offender need not be named or convicted. The defendant's aiding and abetting must occur before or at the time of the offense, as assistance given after the crime is a separate offense. Sometimes accomplices can avoid federal principles of secondary criminal liability, especially when there is a substantial culpability gap. Accomplices can sometimes avoid federal principles of secondary criminal liability, especially when there is a significant culpability gap. This typically occurs with accomplices who are victims, customers, or subordinates. For example, victims who are willing participants in corrupt schemes may be convicted for bribery or as accomplices to extortion. Customers like drinkers, bettors, johns, and drug addicts have also escaped conviction in certain cases. Customers such as drinkers, bettors, johns, and drug addicts have escaped conviction as co-conspirators or accomplices in certain cases, as seen in examples from the Supreme Court cases United States v. Farrar and Rewis v. United States. The Court ruled that mere bettors or customers of illegal establishments cannot be prosecuted as aiders and abettors. The federal Controlled Substances Act also reinforces the view that a drug trafficker's customers cannot be prosecuted as co-conspirators or aiders and abettors in his trafficking. The federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) reinforces the view that a drug trafficker's customers cannot be prosecuted as co-conspirators or aiders and abettors in his trafficking. Prior to the act, federal law punished the trafficker but not his customer. Since enactment of the CSA, federal law punishes the trafficker severely for possession with intent to distribute, but it punishes the customer for simply possession, ordinarily as a misdemeanor. The Supreme Court held in Gebardi that a woman agreeing to be transported for immoral purposes could not be charged with conspiracy under the Mann Act. Lower federal courts continued to honor this ruling, limiting it to cases where the prostitute did not actively participate in her transportation. Employees of an OSHA offender cannot be prosecuted as aiders and abettors, but no such benefit applies to subordinates supervised by offenders. The Occupational Safety and Health Act's provisions do not allow employees of an OSHA offender to be prosecuted as aiders and abettors. In contrast, subordinates supervised by offenders of the federal gambling business statute can be prosecuted. There is ambiguity regarding how subordinates of a drug kingpin may be treated. Section 2(b) applies to defendants who work through intermediaries, whether witting or unwitting, guilty or innocent. The intermediary may be aware that their conduct constitutes an element of the underlying offense. Section 2(b) applies to defendants who work through intermediaries, whether witting or unwitting, guilty or innocent. The intermediary may be aware that their conduct constitutes an element of the underlying offense. Congress made changes in 1951, adding the word \"willfully\" without clear explanation. This amendment may have been influenced by Judge Learned Hand's observation about the mental element in \u00a72(a). The addition of the word \"willfully\" in Section 2(b) of the law was influenced by Judge Learned Hand's observation about the mental element in Section 2(a). Courts interpret \"willfully\" to mean intentionally causing an offense by intending the criminal conduct and using someone else to commit it. Liability can be incurred even if the individual is unaware that the conduct is a crime. Federal courts mention a withdrawal defense similar to conspiracy cases, where withdrawal is not a defense for the conspiracy itself but for crimes committed after the defendant's withdrawal. In aiding and abetting, withdrawal defense may be limited in federal cases, with uncertainty on whether a defendant can withdraw from aiding and abetting a crime. Proponents argue for a general withdrawal defense, citing recent dicta in Rosemond. The question arises when the crime continues despite the abettor's abandonment, with varying results in different courts regarding the applicability of the withdrawal defense to federal accomplice liability statutes. Proponents of a general withdrawal defense may claim support from recent dicta in Rosemond, where the Supreme Court suggested that an accomplice might be able to withdraw and escape liability prior to the commission of the substantive offense. This raises uncertainty on whether a defendant can withdraw from aiding and abetting a crime under federal accomplice liability statutes. Courts do not presume that plaintiffs can sue aiders and abettors for a defendant's violation of statutory norms. Aiders and abettors are not held civilly liable for violations of various acts such as the Anti-Terrorism Act, Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Stored Communications Act, or RICO."
