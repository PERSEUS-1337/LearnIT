    "content": "North Korea's development of prohibited weapons and illicit activities have been a persistent challenge for U.S. foreign policy. Despite efforts through negotiations, aid, and sanctions, North Korea's capabilities continue to grow. U.S. interests in the region include security concerns due to military alliances with South Korea and Japan, which require defense against potential North Korean attacks. Thousands of U.S. troops and civilians in these countries are within range of North Korean missiles. North Korea's rapid advances in nuclear and missile capabilities pose a threat to U.S. troops and civilians in South Korea and Japan. The potential for conflict or regime collapse in Pyongyang could have severe economic implications. Negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program impact U.S. relations with major regional powers like China and South Korea. The totalitarian regime's self-reliant philosophy resists outside influences. North Korea, with a population of 25 million, was founded on the philosophy of juche by Kim Jong-un's grandfather, Kim Il-sung. The regime's near-totalitarian control has allowed it to resist outside influences and build one of the world's largest militaries. This militarization has deterred outside intervention but also hindered economic growth by limiting interactions with the outside world. Despite signs of economic strengthening, North Korea's opaque policymaking and provocative behavior continue to pose challenges. North Korea's opaque policymaking system and defiance of international conventions have hindered its economic growth by limiting interactions with the outside world. Despite indications of economic strengthening, the majority of the population remains impoverished. Congress plays a significant role in shaping U.S. policy towards North Korea through sanctions legislation and the North Korean Human Rights Act. Past nuclear agreements have also involved Congress authorizing millions of dollars in energy assistance with conditions based on North Korean compliance. The U.S. government has addressed North Korea's poor human rights record and accepted North Korean refugees. Congress has authorized millions of dollars in energy assistance in past nuclear agreements with conditions based on North Korean compliance. Congress will need to authorize funds for future aid in exchange for DPRK steps on denuclearization. Recent advances in North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons capabilities have increased the threat to the United States. North Korea's accelerated nuclear and missile capabilities have shifted U.S. policymakers' assessment of the regime's threat. Recent tests have shown North Korea's ability to strike the continental United States with a nuclear-armed ballistic missile, making it a top U.S. foreign policy and national security concern. Pyongyang's threats have increased across various domains, including nuclear weapons, long-range missiles, submarine-based missiles, short-range artillery, and cyberattacks. North Korea conducted multiple nuclear tests and missile tests in 2016 and 2017, with the last nuclear test being its most powerful. Additionally, satellite imagery suggests North Korea is developing a submarine-based ballistic missile program to evade U.S. missile defense systems. North Korea is developing a submarine-based ballistic missile program to evade U.S. missile defense systems. The Trump Administration blamed North Korea for the \"WannaCry\" cyberattack and implemented a \"maximum pressure\" policy to coerce Pyongyang through economic and diplomatic measures. The policy included increasing economic pressure, persuading China and others to apply more pressure, and strengthening alliances with South Korea and Japan. The Administration successfully led the United Nations Security Council to address North Korean threats. The Trump Administration implemented a \"maximum pressure\" policy to coerce North Korea through economic and diplomatic measures, leading the UN Security Council to pass sanctions resolutions. There have been contradictory statements on U.S. conditions for negotiations and the possibility of a preventive military strike against North Korea. The Trump Administration's \"maximum pressure\" policy aimed to coerce North Korea through sanctions. Despite contradictory statements on U.S. conditions for negotiations and the possibility of a preventive strike, North Korea's participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics led to warmer relations and eventually the historic Singapore Summit between Kim and Trump. Kim's \"charm offensive\" was likely driven by a combination of factors. Xi Jinping set the stage for the unprecedented meeting between U.S. and DPRK heads of state. Kim's \"charm offensive\" was likely driven by factors such as harsh rhetoric from the Trump Administration, punishing sanctions, Moon Jae-in's outreach, and Kim's confidence in his nuclear deterrent. Trump and Kim met in Singapore on June 12, 2018, to discuss North Korea's nuclear program and future relations. They issued a joint statement with Trump committing to provide security guarantees to North Korea. Following the summit in Singapore on June 12, 2018, Trump and Kim issued a joint statement committing to security guarantees for North Korea and complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The agreement focused on establishing new bilateral relations, building a lasting peace regime, working towards denuclearization, and recovering the remains of U.S. troops from the Korean War. No mention was made of North Korea's ballistic missile program, and follow-on negotiations were planned, led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The agreement made after the summit did not address North Korea's ballistic missile program. Trump announced the suspension of annual U.S.-South Korea military exercises, aiming to save money and potentially withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea. The Defense Department later canceled the \"Ulchi Freedom Guardian\" exercises. Analysts noted similarities to previous agreements with North Korea, while supporters believe the suspension of tests will hinder North Korea's advancements. Critics argue against the agreement. The recent agreement with North Korea, not directly made by Kim Jong Un, has supporters citing reduced missile and nuclear tests, while critics highlight the lack of a clear timeframe and verification for denuclearization. Uncertainties remain regarding the definition of denuclearization, sequencing, peace regime, and diplomatic ties normalization. Some analysts view North Korea's push for a peace treaty before denuclearization talks as a tactic to delay and gain recognition as a nuclear state. Concerns persist about North Korea's potential to prolong the process while sanctions ease. Maintaining political momentum for existing sanctions implementation is challenging amidst engagement efforts. The UNSC, led by the United States, adopted resolutions imposing sanctions on North Korea in response to its nuclear tests. These sanctions target arms sales and materials aiding North Korea's weapons programs, with a total of 10 resolutions passed between 2006 and December 2017. The sanctions aim to halt military, diplomatic, and economic interactions with the DPRK, but concerns persist about North Korea's potential to delay the denuclearization process while sanctions ease. The U.N. sanctions on North Korea have expanded since its fourth nuclear test in January 2016. Six resolutions have been adopted, the latest in December 2017, banning financial interactions, trade in various sectors, and activities with North Korea. This has led to a significant decline in North Korean exports by over 30% in 2017. The U.N. sanctions have caused a sharp decline in North Korean exports by over 30% in 2017. The Obama and Trump Administrations pushed for global countries to cut ties with North Korea, imposing unilateral sanctions and executive orders targeting North Korean entities. The Obama and Trump Administrations have issued executive orders targeting North Korea and its entities. U.S. sanctions limit trade to humanitarian goods, prohibit financial transactions, new investments, and give the President authority to restrict certain sectors. Foreign aid to North Korea is minimal and emergency-based, with strict controls to prevent the government from benefiting. Transactions involving North Korea's transportation, mining, energy, or financial sectors are restricted. U.S. foreign aid is minimal and administered through centrally funded programs to prevent the government from benefiting. U.S. persons are prohibited from trading with designated North Korean entities. Foreign financial institutions could face sanctions for facilitating transactions for DPRK entities. U.S. travel to North Korea is limited and requires a special validation passport. North Korea's demands in negotiations regarding its weapons programs have varied, including recognition as a nuclear weapons state and a peace treaty with the U.S. as prerequisites for denuclearization. Identifying patterns in North Korean behavior is challenging. North Korean behavior fluctuates between cooperation and provocations, driven by internal conditions like food shortages. They exploit divisions among parties and stall negotiations, raising doubts about the utility of talks. North Korea's behavior fluctuates between cooperation and provocations, exploiting divisions among parties and stalling negotiations. Analysts debate the feasibility of negotiations, with some arguing for a basic bargain where North Korea would denuclearize in exchange for economic benefits and sanctions relief. Kim Jong-un's focus on economic development is seen as a potential sign of willingness to denuclearize, but many believe the regime will not give up its nuclear weapons voluntarily. Despite efforts to break free from North Korea's isolation and obtain relief from sanctions, achieving economic goals will be difficult. Analysts believe that the regime will not give up its nuclear weapons voluntarily, viewing them as essential for regime survival. Pyongyang's frequent statements reaffirming its commitment to its nuclear weapons program cast doubt on any intentions to denuclearize in exchange for aid and recognition. North Korea has modernized its nuclear deterrent, declaring itself a \"nuclear-armed nation\" in 2012. They view their nuclear weapons as essential for regime security and have stated they will not give them up even for billions of dollars. The successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile in 2017 marked the completion of their state nuclear force. North Korea has indicated they will only relinquish their nuclear stockpile once all nuclear weapons are eliminated globally. The 2011 intervention in Libya, which gave up its nuclear program for sanctions relief, may have reinforced the value of nuclear arms for regime security in North Korea. North Korean leaders believe nuclear weapons are crucial for regime security, fearing overthrow with outside military intervention. The 2018 Singapore summit legitimized North Korea as a nuclear state, meeting past demands like canceling military exercises and easing sanctions. Previous nuclear negotiations with the US include the Agreed Framework, missile talks, Six-Party Talks, and the Leap Day Deal. The proposed formula involves North Korea halting its nuclear or missile programs in exchange for concessions. The Agreed Framework, missile talks, Six-Party Talks, and the Leap Day Deal were part of previous nuclear negotiations with the US. North Korea's nuclear programs led to discussions of sanctions and a possible military strike in the 1990s. Diplomatic efforts, including a mission from former President Jimmy Carter, eventually resulted in the U.S.-North Korea 1994 Agreed Framework. The U.S.-North Korea 1994 Agreed Framework was established after diplomatic efforts, including a mission from former President Jimmy Carter, to persuade North Korea to engage in negotiations. The agreement involved the United States providing North Korea with light water reactor nuclear power plants and heavy fuel oil in exchange for North Korea freezing and eventually dismantling its plutonium program under IAEA supervision. Despite facing delays, the agreement saw North Korea freezing its plutonium program and receiving heavy fuel oil, although it did not fully comply with all commitments to the IAEA. In 2002, the George W. Bush Administration confronted North Korea about a suspected secret uranium enrichment program, leading to a halt in heavy fuel oil shipments. In 2002, the George W. Bush Administration confronted North Korea about a suspected secret uranium enrichment program. North Korea denied the existence of the program publicly, leading to the United States halting heavy fuel oil shipments and construction of light water reactors. North Korea then expelled IAEA inspectors, withdrew from the NPT, and restarted its reactor and reprocessing facility. In 1996, the Clinton Administration began negotiations with North Korea to curb its missile program and exports. In 1999, North Korea agreed to a moratorium on testing long-range missiles in exchange for the partial lifting of U.S. sanctions. In 2000, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Pyongyang to finalize an agreement where North Korea would end ballistic missile development in exchange for international assistance in launching satellites. Negotiations expanded under the George W. Bush Administration, leading to six rounds of the \"Six-Party Talks\" from 2003 to 2008. Despite occasional progress, the talks failed to resolve the issue of North Korean nuclear arms. A promising breakthrough in 2005 resulted in a Joint Statement where North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons programs for aid and talks with the U.S., but the process eventually broke down due to verification measures. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea, known as \"strategic patience,\" aimed to pressure Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks for denuclearization. The policy involved coordinating with Japan and South Korea, urging China to take a tougher stance, and applying pressure through arms interdictions and sanctions. The US sought a comprehensive deal for North Korea's denuclearization in exchange for normalization of relations and aid, with a freeze on nuclear activities and testing as a precondition for negotiations. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea, known as \"strategic patience,\" aimed to pressure Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks for denuclearization. They sought a comprehensive package deal for North Korea's complete denuclearization in exchange for normalization of relations and aid, with a freeze on nuclear activities and testing as a precondition for negotiations. Additionally, the administration issued sanctions targeting entities and individuals involved in illicit activities supporting North Korea's WMD programs, including money laundering, arms sales, counterfeiting, narcotics, and luxury goods. In response to the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment attributed to North Korean hackers, President Obama issued E.O. 13687 allowing the U.S. government to seize assets of designated DPRK officials. Despite efforts for engagement, provocations by Pyongyang led to a cycle of action and reaction. The \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012 committed North Korea to a moratorium on nuclear tests and missile launches in exchange for assistance and cultural exchanges. The Obama Administration pledged nutritional assistance and cultural exchanges with North Korea in exchange for halting missile launches and uranium enrichment activities. However, North Korea violated the agreement by conducting a long-range rocket launch and a third nuclear test in 2013. China plays a crucial role in pressuring North Korea economically and diplomatically, despite providing food and energy aid to the regime. Beijing's priority is to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula and prevent the collapse of North Korea. China's overriding priority is to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula and prevent the collapse of North Korea. Beijing sees strategic value in having North Korea as a buffer between China and South Korea. China often obstructs U.S. efforts to impose harsher punishments on North Korea in international forums. Despite some improvement in enforcing sanctions in 2017, Chinese companies have been found violating sanctions against North Korea. In 2017, China increased enforcement of UNSC sanctions to deter US military action against North Korea. Chinese trade and aid to North Korea are limited, as Beijing aims to appear responsible internationally. Relations between Beijing and Pyongyang soured after Kim Jong-un's rise to power in 2011, with China displeased by his actions. Beijing's displeasure with Kim Jong-un grew after he executed his uncle Jang Song-taek in 2013, who had been a key figure in China-North Korea relations. Chinese President Xi Jinping held summits with South Korean leaders but not with Kim, reflecting a shift in China's stance. Chinese public opinion turned against North Korea, with many supporting a US airstrike on North Korea's nuclear sites. China agreed to strict UNSC sanctions in 2017, signaling a change in their approach. Trump and Kim's diplomatic efforts in 2018 improved North Korea-China relations. In 2018, Trump and Kim's diplomatic efforts improved North Korea-China relations. Kim Jong-un's visit to Beijing signaled a reaffirmation of the close relationship ahead of the meeting. Kim's actions, including deescalation of hostilities and cancelation of military exercises, likely earned him goodwill and leverage with China. Kim is the third generation of the Kim family to rule North Korea, following his grandfather Kim Il-sung and father Kim Jong-il. Kim Jong-un's bold emergence on the global stage in 2018 may have significant implications. Kim Jong-un ruled North Korea for nearly 17 years until his death in December 2011. His bold emergence on the global stage in 2018 suggests he has consolidated power and pursued a two-track policy of economic development and nuclear weapons. Kim has achieved a \"limited nuclear deterrent\" and improved relations with South Korea, China, and the United States to stave off sanctions. Kim Jong-un has pursued economic opportunities by improving relations with South Korea and China, as well as achieving a temporary breakthrough with the United States to avoid harsher sanctions. Despite initial hopes of political reform, Kim's actions have shown a ruthless drive to maintain the dynastic dictatorship. He has carried out purges of senior officials and displayed a brutal ruling style, different from his father's. Kim Jong-un's ruling style differs from his father's, allowing Western influences and appearing informal in public. His wife has been introduced to the public, but their children remain hidden. Analysts see these changes as an attempt to appear modern and evoke his grandfather's image. North Korea remains one of the world's poorest countries with a centrally planned economy. Kim Jong-un has implemented economic policy changes that have led to some growth in North Korea's economy, despite being one of the world's poorest countries. Market principles have been allowed in certain sectors, leading to an expansion of consumer and business markets. This has helped North Korea withstand international sanctions and improve living standards for some citizens. Kim Jong-un's economic policy changes in North Korea have led to the partial legalization of consumer and business markets, facilitated by international trade with China. This has resulted in larger harvests in agriculture and stable food prices since 2012. However, food security remains a concern for many North Koreans. Since 2012, North Korea's economy has seen stability, with some benefiting more than others. Despite this, over 10 million North Koreans still face food insecurity. Analysts question the extent of Kim's economic reforms, as private enterprise is prohibited by the penal code. The government's stance on marketization is uncertain, with occasional crackdowns reported. Access to healthcare is limited, and food shortages are prevalent, despite the regime's claim of providing universal healthcare. The North Korean regime controls access to healthcare and restricts movement within the country based on loyalty. Many citizens face shortages of food and medical care, with limited access to quality facilities. Despite efforts to control information flow, some North Koreans are turning to outside sources for news. The government tries to block foreign broadcasts and alter radios to prevent citizens from accessing outside information. The North Korean government tries to prevent its citizens from accessing foreign broadcasts by jamming stations and altering radios. However, some citizens have illegal or modified radios to listen to outside programs. A 2015 survey found that 29% of North Korean defectors listened to foreign broadcasts. The regime restarted a mobile phone network in 2009, with over 3 million subscribers in 2017. Chinese cellphones are used near the border for international calls, despite being illegal in North Korea. Reports indicate that North Korean cadres consume foreign media and are involved in smuggling and selling operations. Chinese cellphones, although illegal, can be used near the border for international calls. The spread of cell phones allows for faster dissemination of information in North Korea. Increased access to information could weaken the Kim regime, according to Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean deputy ambassador. The regime has long indoctrinated its citizens to be loyal to the Kim family and view the outside world as inferior. North Korea has indoctrinated its citizens to be loyal to the Kim family and view the outside world as inferior. The regime fields one of the largest militaries in the world, with a significant portion deployed near the border with South Korea. North Korea is developing its WMD capabilities to offset deficiencies in its conventional forces, particularly focusing on nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. North Korea is prioritizing the development of nuclear weapons, long-range ballistic missiles, and cyber warfare capabilities to offset deficiencies in its conventional military forces. The country also possesses a large stockpile of chemical weapons and potentially biological weapons. Despite its outdated weapons systems, North Korea could still cause significant damage to Seoul through artillery and rocket attacks. The U.S. intelligence community considers North Korea as one of the top cyber threats to the United States. North Korea's military has atrophied significantly since 1990, with outdated weapons systems and inadequate training. Despite this, they could still inflict enormous damage on Seoul with artillery and rocket attacks. Analysts estimate that North Korean artillery forces could fire thousands of rounds at Seoul in the first hour of a war. North Korea has focused on improving asymmetric capabilities like UAVs, cyber operations, special forces, GPS jamming, and stealth technology to compensate for their outdated traditional forces. North Korea has made advancements in various military areas including long-range artillery, tanks, infantry weapons, and submarines. The country's military suffers from institutional weaknesses due to a highly centralized command structure and lack of resources affecting readiness. The country's general resource scarcity affects military readiness in several ways, including lack of fuel for pilots, logistical shortages for troops, lack of spare parts for equipment, and food shortages for North Korean forces. U.S. analysts are concerned about North Korea's nuclear weapons development and skepticism remains about Pyongyang's willingness to denuclearize despite talks with the United States. North Korea's commitment to possessing nuclear weapons and fielding long-range missiles raises skepticism about its willingness to negotiate them away. The regime views its nuclear arsenal as vital for survival and has emphasized developing smaller, lighter, and more diversified warheads. Despite international concerns, North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests since 2006, including a hydrogen bomb test in 2017 aimed at perfecting delivery on an intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea conducted six nuclear tests since 2006, including a hydrogen bomb test in 2017 for an intercontinental ballistic missile. In early 2018, North Korea announced the completion of its nuclear goals and the closure of its test site, but fissile material production continues. The North Korean nuclear program began in the late 1950s with cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union on a nuclear research program near Yongbyon. North Korea's nuclear program started in the late 1950s with cooperation from the Soviet Union. The program includes a reactor and reprocessing facility that have been operational on and off since 1986. North Korea has produced between 30 and 40 kilograms of separated plutonium for nuclear weapons. In addition to a plutonium-based program, North Korea has also developed a uranium enrichment program. North Korea openly acknowledged a uranium enrichment program in 2009, with a newly built gas centrifuge uranium enrichment plant at the Yongbyon site. U.S. officials suspect other clandestine enrichment facilities exist, with one identified at Kangson in July 2018. Estimates on warhead and material stockpiles are uncertain due to lack of transparency. Scholarly analyses suggest North Korea could produce 20 warheads by 2020. Recent scholarly analyses provide low, medium, and high scenarios for North Korea's potential production of fissile material by 2020, estimating 20 to 100 warheads. Despite international condemnation, North Korea has prioritized developing its ballistic missile technology, conducting numerous test launches since Kim Jong-un took power in 2011. In 2016, they conducted 26 ballistic missile tests, followed by 18 tests in 2017, including suspected ICBM launches. North Korea also possesses around 700 short-range ballistic missiles. North Korea has conducted multiple ballistic missile tests, including suspected ICBM launches. They have around 700 short-range ballistic missiles and are focused on developing a nuclear warhead small enough to mount on long-range missiles. The Nodong missile poses a threat to the Korean Peninsula, Japan, and some U.S. military bases. North Korea could potentially mount nuclear warheads on the KN-08 and Taepodong-2 ICBMs to target the continental United States. North Korea has shown progress in its missile programs, including successful tests of solid fuel MRBMs. The KN-08 and Taepodong-2 ICBMs are potential platforms for nuclear warheads. North Korea conducted ICBM tests in 2017, with the intelligence community noting advancements in their missile capabilities. North Korea is advancing towards solid rocket motors for its ballistic missiles, opting for solid fuel for stability and quicker reaction times. Successful tests of the Pukguksong-2 solid fuel MRBM in 2017 led to plans for mass production. Recent focus is on developing missiles to counter missile defense systems like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD. Tests in 2016 involved lofting missiles to higher altitudes and shorter ranges to make interception more challenging. North Korea also demonstrated the ability to launch multiple missiles in quick succession in 2017. North Korea's advancements in solid fuel missile technology aim to counter missile defense systems like Patriot, Aegis BMD, and THAAD. They demonstrated the ability to launch multiple missiles in quick succession in 2017, potentially complicating interception efforts. Previous attempts to negotiate limits on North Korea's missile program have been unsuccessful. North Korea's missile program has been a point of contention in negotiations. Despite promises made in talks, deals have not been reached. The UNSC has imposed resolutions to restrict North Korea's ballistic missile activities, but they have continued to conduct tests. Recent discussions have not focused on missiles specifically. Additionally, North Korea is reported to have significant stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons. North Korea possesses one of the world's largest chemical weapons stockpiles, including mustard, phosgene, and sarin gas. They have multiple facilities for production and storage, with an estimated capability of up to 4,500 metric tons of chemical weapons in a typical year. North Korea is not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention. If they were to use chemical weapons, South Korea and Japan would be the most likely targets. North Korea's chemical weapons stockpile poses a significant threat, with the potential for tens of thousands of fatalities. The country is not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention and is suspected of maintaining a biological weapons production capability. The U.S. intelligence community believes North Korea has the infrastructure to support biological weapons and a munitions production capacity for weaponization. South Korea estimated in 2012 that North Korea possesses anthrax and smallpox. Pyongyang's proliferation of WMD and missile-related technology is also a serious concern, as they have sold missile parts and technology to other countries. North Korea's proliferation of WMD and missile-related technology is a serious concern for the United States. Pyongyang has sold missile parts and technology to several countries, including Egypt, Iran, Libya, Burma, Pakistan, Syria, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. North Korea has also assisted Syria with building a nuclear reactor, destroyed by Israel in 2007, that may have been part of a Syrian nuclear weapons program. The U.N. Panel of Experts has reported transfers of chemical weapons-related materials to Syria by North Korea. North Korea and Iran have cooperated on missile development since the 1980s, exchanging information and components. China may have also assisted the North Korean missile program. Scientific advisors from Iran's ballistic missile research centers were observed in North Korea before the December 2012 missile launch, potentially contributing to its success. China has also been implicated in supporting North Korea's missile program through trade in sensitive materials. The North Korean regime engages in various illicit activities to earn foreign currency, including drug trafficking, counterfeiting, and selling pharmaceuticals. One agency, Office 39, oversees many of these illicit dealings. North Korea engages in illicit activities such as drug trafficking and arms sales to earn foreign currency. Office 39 oversees many of these dealings, including the production of methamphetamine and smuggling operations. The country has also become a provider of cheap weapons, selling arms to states in the Middle East and North Africa. The source of direction for these activities is unclear, with speculation on involvement by state authorities or local criminal gangs. North Korea is known for engaging in illicit activities such as drug trafficking and arms sales to earn foreign currency. They have sold weapons to countries in the Middle East and North Africa, with some speculation on involvement by state authorities or local criminal gangs. In August 2016, a shipment of rocket-propelled grenades destined for the Egyptian military was seized outside the Suez Canal. North Korea has cooperated with Iran and Syria in developing ballistic missiles and supplying weapons and equipment. The regime uses front companies based in China to mask its illicit dealings and keep earnings in overseas bank accounts to evade detection. The U.S. government has been sanctioning companies working on behalf of the North Korean regime, including a Chinese bank and Banco Delta Asia in Macau. These companies help North Korea keep its earnings in overseas bank accounts to evade detection in the international financial system. The U.S. government sanctioned a Chinese bank for laundering money for North Korea's criminal enterprises, leading to a freeze of $24 million in North Korean accounts. This caused North Korea to boycott talks until the funds were returned. Past administrations have highlighted North Korea's severe human rights abuses, including denial of liberties, ideological indoctrination, and physical abuse for violators of laws. The North Korean government lacks an independent judiciary and citizens cannot choose their own government. Reports detail extensive ideological indoctrination and severe physical abuse for law violators. There are multiple prison camps (kwanliso) holding around 100,000 political prisoners, with harsh conditions leading to many deaths. The United Nations Commission of Inquiry reported nearly 400,000 prisoner deaths due to starvation, disease, executions, and torture. Korea's human rights violations have led to the deaths of close to 400,000 prisoners in the past 31 years, with reports of starvation, disease, executions, and torture. The number of political prisoners in North Korea has decreased, likely due to high mortality rates in the camps. The United Nations has been actively addressing human rights violations in North Korea, establishing positions like the Special Rapporteur and the Commission of Inquiry to investigate and ensure accountability for these grave violations. The Commission of Inquiry (COI) investigated human rights violations in North Korea, concluding that the regime committed \"crimes against humanity.\" Despite recommendations to refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court (ICC), no action has been taken due to resistance from China and Russia. The UN Human Rights Council established a repository to archive evidence of violations for potential future prosecutions. Food shortages, persecution, and awareness of better conditions have led to tens of thousands fleeing the country. The evidence of human rights violations in North Korea could be used for future prosecutions. Tens of thousands of North Koreans have fled to China, facing abuse and trafficking. Some refugees make their way to Southeast Asia and then to South Korea, where they receive citizenship. The number of defectors has declined in recent years. In recent years, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased, with 1,127 defectors in 2017, a 21% drop from the previous year. Elite defections in 2016, including senior officials, have highlighted a shift in the demographic profile of defectors, with more individuals of higher social status defecting. This change may be attributed to increased border security, making it harder for less fortunate individuals to escape. Diplomats, responsible for earning foreign currency, may choose to defect if unable to meet expectations, fearing repercussions if they return to North Korea. Since the late 2000s, diplomats have been tasked with earning foreign currency and procuring illicit goods for the regime. Elite defectors face imprisonment or execution if caught, leading some to flee to China where thousands are in hiding. China has been criticized for repatriating North Korean defectors, with accusations of aiding crimes against humanity. China has intensified its crackdown on North Korean refugees, with efforts to repatriate them back to North Korea. China's policy towards North Korean defectors involves intensified crackdowns and efforts to repatriate them, despite contravening the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention. The Chinese government labels defectors as \"illegal economic migrants\" and deports them, based on a repatriation treaty with North Korea. Assisting refugees is illegal in China, but defectors who reach foreign embassies can leave the country. Once back in North Korea, defectors face imprisonment, torture, and executions. Beijing allows political refugees to leave if they reach foreign embassies, despite facing imprisonment, torture, and executions in North Korea. China's policy aims to maintain ties with North Korea and prevent destabilization in its provinces. The North Korean Human Rights Act was passed in 2004 to support human rights efforts and information flow in North Korea. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) authorized new funds to support human rights efforts and improve information flow in North Korea. It included provisions for U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance to be linked to human rights improvements, the appointment of a Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea, and the facilitation of asylum applications for North Koreans in the U.S. Congress reauthorized the act in 2008, 2012, and 2018, with amendments to enhance resettlement and processing efforts for North Korean refugees. The North Korean Human Rights Act was reauthorized in 2018, emphasizing increasing freedom of information into North Korea and addressing the working conditions of North Korean overseas workers. President Trump signed the bill into law, highlighting efforts to resettle North Korean refugees and process them in third countries. The State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report has consistently cited North Korea's overseas-labor program for forced labor conditions. North Korean overseas workers face exploitative conditions akin to \"state-sponsored slavery,\" toiling long hours with a significant portion of their earnings taken by the regime. The labor program has been ongoing for decades, with workers mainly in Russia and China, but also in 25 other countries. The Trump Administration has pushed for the expulsion of North Korean laborers through a UNSC resolution. The Trump Administration has pressured foreign governments to expel North Korean laborers working overseas, with a UNSC resolution requiring all member countries to send workers home by 2019. Additionally, the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act prohibits North Korean-produced goods from entering the United States and sanctions foreign entities using North Korean labor. The United States provided over $1.2 billion in assistance to North Korea between 1995 and 2008, with aid ending in early 2009 due to the breakdown of the Six-Party Talks. In 2009, the United States provided heavy fuel oil and technical assistance to North Korea, tied to progress in the Six-Party Talks. However, after North Korea's actions in spring 2009, Congress rejected requests for additional funds. U.S. food aid ended due to disagreements with Pyongyang, and North Korea has since appealed for international support. The abrogated Leap Day Agreement would have provided food aid for vulnerable populations. The U.S. issued appeals for international support for food aid. Nearly 7,700 U.S. personnel from the Korean War are unaccounted for, with efforts made to recover their remains through joint investigations with North Korea. 229 sets of remains were recovered, and 107 have been identified.
