    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for students from kindergarten to 12th grade. The findings by Congress highlight the importance of physical education for children's development, health, self-esteem, and overall well-being. It emphasizes the benefits of physical education in improving cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, flexibility, and promoting healthy lifestyle habits. The increasing rates of childhood obesity and its economic impact are also addressed. Low levels of activity contribute to high obesity rates among children in the US, leading to over $100 billion in obesity-related costs annually and at least 300,000 deaths. Physically fit adults have lower risks of heart attacks and stroke. Only 1 in 4 children get enough daily vigorous activity. Recommendations include daily physical education for all students from kindergarten to grade 12. Twelve years after Congress passed a resolution encouraging quality physical education programs for all students in kindergarten through grade 12, little progress has been made. It is essential for every student to have the opportunity to participate in quality physical education to develop health-related fitness and adopt healthy lifestyles. Students should have the chance to achieve the goals set by Healthy People 2000 and Healthy People 2010. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and staff training. Local educational agencies must submit applications to the Secretary outlining plans to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet national goals and state standards. These programs aim to improve children's physical, mental, and social development through fitness education, motor skills instruction, and cognitive concepts. Physical education programs focus on enhancing children's physical, mental, and social development through activities promoting cognitive concepts, positive social skills, and healthy habits. Teachers receive professional development to stay updated on research and trends. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC are not part of the assisted curriculum. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural educational agencies, as well as those serving large and small student populations. Funding applications can include participation of private school and home-schooled students. Reporting is required for continued funding. \"Annual reports are required for continued funding of grants or contracts under this program, demonstrating progress towards goals. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress detailing program success and recommendations for improvement. Administrative costs are limited to 5% of funds, and the federal share must supplement, not supplant, existing funds.\" The text outlines limitations on administrative costs for grant funds, specifies the federal share of project costs, and authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 2000-2004 for physical education activities."
