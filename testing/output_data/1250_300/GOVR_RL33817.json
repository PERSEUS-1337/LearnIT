    "content": "Human-driven climate change has shifted from a scientific topic to a policy debate, with Congressional proposals focusing on observation, pollution control, financial assistance for technology, and adaptation. Federal funding for climate change activities was $6.37 billion in FY2008, with a total budgetary impact of $7.73 billion including tax incentives. Funding for FY2009 remains at or below these levels, with a Continuing Resolution in place. Tax incentives for renewable energy passed in late 2008 may have affected budgetary impacts in FY2009. The report provides an overview of federal funding and tax incentives for climate change from 2001 to 2008. President Obama aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and has appointed Carol Browner to assist in coordinating government efforts. President Obama aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and has appointed Carol Browner to assist in coordinating government efforts. President Bush set goals to cut U.S. greenhouse gas intensity and announced a national goal to halt increases in emissions by 2025. President Bush announced a new national goal in 2008 to halt increases in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, with emissions declining thereafter as technology advances. Regulatory measures and market incentives were to encourage clean technology use. Specific outcome-oriented performance targets were set for some programs, but most requested climate-related funding lacked quantitative targets. The Obama Administration and Congress may consider clearer relationships among programs, funding, and contributions to measurable climate goals, especially if greenhouse gas targets are legislated. The Obama Administration and the 111th Congress may consider the funding and contributions of programs towards meeting climate change goals, especially if greenhouse gas targets are legislated. Congressional appropriations alter the total funding requested by the President across agencies, but lack coordination in prioritizing climate change policy goals and consistency across activities. Congressional attention to human influence on climate began in the 1980s, leading to expanded federal funding for research and addressing the phenomenon. Human influence on Earth's climate gained attention in the 1980s, leading to a scientific research program enacted by Congress in 1990. Federal funding has since expanded to address climate change, with funding levels evolving since 1990. This report details federal funding across 14 agencies, focusing on changes from FY2007 and FY2008 to President Bush's FY2009 request. However, limited political agreement on climate change has hindered full understanding of federal efforts and their effectiveness. The limited political agreement in the United States has led to all climate change activities being labeled as research or international assistance. There is a historic emphasis on climate change science, with concerns first raised by the research community. Some decision-makers prioritize improving science to inform policy decisions, while others worry it may delay concrete actions. Despite calls for greater action on GHG abatement and adaptation, there is consensus on the need for continued scientific research on climate change. Funding for climate change research increased from 1989 to 1995 but has declined since then. Scenario analyses in the mid-1990s showed that major technological changes are needed to avoid human-induced climate change. There is consensus on the importance of federal support for technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions without harming the economy. President Clinton and President Bush both introduced initiatives to support clean technologies as part of the climate change effort. President Clinton and President Bush introduced technology programs as a major component of the climate change effort, accounting for two-thirds of all funding. Developing countries require financial and technical assistance to adopt less emitting economic paths. Funding for international assistance, primarily through US AID, has generally declined since the late 1990s. The $25 million Country Studies Program aims to help developing and transition countries implement climate change policies. Funding for international assistance, mainly through US AID, has decreased since the late 1990s. The report discusses climate change funding in science, technology, and international assistance areas, as well as tax provisions to reduce greenhouse gases. There are overlaps and gaps in these program areas, and alternative categorizations may be beneficial for Congressional decision-making. The report also highlights legislative issues related to federal funding for climate change programs. The report identifies legislative issues related to federal funding for climate change programs. Funding for climate-related programs has been extended through a Continuing Resolution, with levels varying from the requested amounts. The Bush Administration has categorized funding into three major program areas: Climate Change Science Program, Climate Change Technology Program, and International Assistance. Funding has fluctuated over the years, with notable increases in FY2008 and FY2009 for new satellites, nuclear energy, and international technology financing. The federal government has increased funding for climate-related programs, including new satellites, nuclear energy, and international technology financing in FY2008 and FY2009. Changes in budget accounting methods and program scope make it difficult to track the level of effort over time. Additionally, tax incentives totaling $1.52 billion in FY2008 and FY2007, projected to decrease to $1.44 billion in FY2009, are offered to encourage reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. These tax incentives, although not federal spending, reduce government revenues and are categorized as \"tax expenditures\" by the OMB. The federal government has increased funding for climate-related programs, including tax incentives categorized as \"tax expenditures\" by the OMB. These incentives aim to encourage reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The loss of revenues resulting from tax incentives is often presented as \"tax expenditures\" of the federal government. Examples include credits for cleaner automobiles and investment in renewable electricity generation technologies. Table 1 shows the total impact on the federal budget from FY2001 to FY2008 and the FY2009 request, illustrating the overall level of federal effort and cost of identified climate change programs and incentives. The budgetary impact of reported climate change activities has increased by nearly 85% from FY2001 to the enacted FY2008 level. The federal government has increased funding for climate-related programs, including tax incentives to stimulate greenhouse gas reductions. The budgetary impact of reported climate change activities has increased by nearly 85% from FY2001 to FY2008. President Bush's budget request for FY2009 aimed to bring funding back up to the FY2001 level in real terms. Budget authority in FY2008 for activities related to climate change totaled $5.44 billion. The funding levels for climate change activities have been approximate due to reporting issues. In FY2008, budget authority totaled $5.44 billion, with President Bush's FY2009 budget request aiming to increase funding by 12.3% to $7.15 billion. A Continuing Resolution extended FY2008 enacted levels for climate-related programs. Changes to climate change funding for FY2009 have not been reported yet. Major changes requested included increasing funding for nuclear energy research and demonstrations, as well as fossil energy research. The FY2009 budget request aimed to increase funding for climate change activities, including nuclear energy research, fossil energy R&D, satellite sensors, and international technology deployment. However, the emphasis on researching the impacts of climate change and adaptation was not clearly reflected in the documentation. The FY2009 proposal for the CCSP focused on increasing funding for climate change activities, particularly in observational capacities and technological research. However, there was a lack of emphasis on researching the impacts of climate change and adaptation in the available documentation. Several programs dedicated to impacts and adaptation received less funding, and some programs specifically funded by Congress were not continued in FY2009. The Administration's requested changes are detailed in later sections by major program area and agency. Funding related to climate change is grouped into three program areas by OMB. The FY2009 budget proposal for climate change includes three program areas: Climate Change Science Program ($2.08 billion), Climate Change Technology Program ($4.42 billion), and International Climate Change Assistance ($0.66 billion). Funding growth is mainly focused on technology research, demonstration, and deployment, with a significant increase in funding for FY2009 compared to FY2007. The most recent growth in funding to address climate change supports technology research, demonstration, and deployment, with a proposed expansion of almost $1 billion for FY2009 compared to FY2007. The requested funding growth within the Climate Change Technology Program was mainly for nuclear energy research. If the Congress had approved the requested $400 million for the Clean Technology Fund, international assistance would have seen a 325% increase over the FY2008 enacted budget authority. Understanding the specific uses of climate change funds can be challenging due to unreported or unclear funding levels for specific activities. Preliminary analysis by CRS shows that a large portion of the FY2009 funding request is allocated to various applications such as satellite-based observing systems, technology R&D, and inventories of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks. The FY2009 funding request for climate change includes significant allocations for various applications, with nuclear energy research receiving the largest share at $1.40 billion (19.6%). Satellite-based observations would constitute about 11.8% of all federal climate change funding, totaling $843 million proposed for FY2009. Climate change funding for FY2009 is proposed at $843 million, representing 11.8% of all climate change funding and 40.5% of the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) funding. The Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Space and Aeronautics Administration (NASA) receive 74% of the climate change request budget authority. The FY2009 climate change funding proposal of $843 million represents 11.8% of all climate change funding and 40.5% of the CCSP funding. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) requested $2.08 billion for climate change science, a 12% increase from FY2008. President Bush's request also included tax provisions to encourage greenhouse gas reductions. President Bush requested $2.08 billion for climate change science under the CCSP for FY2009, a 12% increase from FY2008. The funding would be distributed to 11 federal agencies, with NASA receiving the largest share at 58%. The proposed funding also included allocations for NOAA, NSF, and DOE. The history of U.S. funding for climate change science since FY1989 is detailed in Figure 3 and Appendix C. The CCSP budget for climate change science declined by 11% from FY2001 to FY2008, down 25% from the peak in FY1995. NASA's climate-related budget also decreased by 24% from FY2000 to FY2008, with a proposed increase for space-based observations in FY2009. Funding for climate change has been shifted to other priorities due to tightening fiscal budgets. In FY2009, NASA proposed a $126 million increase (12%) for space-based observations, reflecting a shift in funding priorities towards space exploration. Climate change-related funding at NASA and other agencies has declined, with NOAA being the only agency to see an increase in climate science budget. This has led to tension among agencies over funding for climate change research. Federally-supported research on greenhouse gases and climate change has been ongoing for decades. The National Academy of Sciences recommended increasing research funding for climate change to $111 million for the 10-year period of 1970-1979. Federal support for climate change research peaked at $2.28 billion in FY1995 before declining to $1.83 billion in FY2008. The Global Change Research Act established the U.S. Global Change Research Program, leading to rapid growth in funding from 1989 onwards. The U.S. Global Change Research Program (US GCRP) was established to improve understanding of uncertainties in climate science, expand global observing systems, develop resources for policymaking, and communicate findings broadly. However, it has been criticized for focusing mainly on physical science and neglecting behavioral, economic, and ecological aspects of environmental problems. The U.S. Global Change Research Program (US GCRP) has primarily focused on physical science, neglecting behavioral, economic, and ecological aspects of environmental problems. Critics argue that the program lacks ecosystem-scale research, adaptation research, and integrated assessments needed for public and private decision-making. Calls for restructuring and expansion have been made due to perceived gaps in the program's effectiveness. There are gaps in the federal climate change research program, leading to calls for restructuring and expansion. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) has not been formalized through legislation, with proposals for potential fixes being considered. Bills may be introduced in Congress to amend or replace the current framework. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) is undergoing potential restructuring and expansion, with bills likely to be introduced in Congress to amend or replace the current framework. The CCSP is outlined in the Climate Change Science Program Strategic Plan, which was updated in 2008. The plan groups research into seven elements and lays out five goals, with proposed funding for each goal in FY2009. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) is undergoing potential restructuring and expansion, with bills likely to be introduced in Congress to amend or replace the current framework. The CCSP is outlined in the Climate Change Science Program Strategic Plan, which was updated in 2008. The plan groups research into seven elements and lays out five goals, with proposed funding for each goal in FY2009. The identified funding levels for each goal do not include all funding for federal climate-related science. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) is facing potential restructuring and expansion, with proposed funding levels for different goals in FY2009. Some activities within CCSP may not be directly related to climate change, leading to challenges in identifying primary funding for climate change science. Proposed funding applications include satellite-based observations, basic science research, and climate models. The Global Change Research Act of 1990 (GCRA) requires regular scientific assessments on climate change to Congress. The CCSP Strategic Plan aimed to produce 21 Synthesis and Assessment Products (SAPs) by 2007, but faced criticism for not meeting statutory requirements or policy needs. Environmental groups sued the Bush Administration for a revised research plan. Several environmental groups filed suit against officials in the Bush Administration to force production of a revised research plan and an integrated, national scientific assessment. A Court Order of August 21, 2007 required the release of the CCSP Revised Research Plan (RRP) by the Administration in compliance with the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The RRP focused on the 2008 to 2010 period as a first step towards a new strategy by 2010 covering 2013 to 2023. Public outreach for the new strategy has begun, retaining the same goals and structure as the 2003 Strategy. The CCSP will focus on providing physical science to understand Earth's climate, conducting ongoing research on climate processes and forcing factors, addressing research needs on the impacts of climate change, and supporting decision-making on climate variability and change. There will be an increased emphasis on generating scientific results at regional and local scales and communicating with users and stakeholders. The CCSP will focus on generating scientific results at regional and local scales, communicating with users and stakeholders, and producing integrative scientific assessments. The Congress may consider legislative options to clarify the goals and processes of federal climate change scientific research. The CCSP will produce the CCSP Unified Synthesis Product (USP) in 2009, synthesizing information from various sources on climate change science. Concerns include weaknesses in leadership and budget coherence, with reviews suggesting a lack of overarching authority to align agency interests and budgets with cross-cutting priorities. The CCSP lacks sufficient overarching authority to align agency interests and budgets with cross-cutting priorities. There is a debate on where to invest such authority, with options including the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, the National Science Foundation, or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Some experts suggest a \"climate czar\" in the White House or a new entity like the U.S. Trade Representative. Some experts propose a \"climate czar\" in the White House or a new entity like the U.S. Trade Representative to lead climate change programs, including science programs, adaptation, greenhouse gas mitigation, policy analysis, and international strategies. President Obama's appointment of Carol Browner as Assistant for Energy and Climate Change may address this role, but lacks defined functions and authority. The lack of clearly articulated and measurable goals is a challenge for the CCSP, with goals defining directional change without definable end-points or milestones. The CCSP lacks clearly articulated and measurable goals, making it challenging to determine priorities and evaluate program contributions. A National Academies panel highlighted the need for metrics to measure progress but noted the considerable challenge in developing them. The CCSP Strategic Plan lacks measurable goals and clear metrics for success, making it difficult to assess program contributions. A National Academies panel highlighted the challenge and cost of developing metrics to measure progress for all elements of the program. The 2008 review of the CCSP noted the absence of detailed management metrics, relying on qualitative goals instead. Additionally, the Government Accountability Office found data and reporting limitations in determining actual levels of climate change funding. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found unclear and inconsistent reporting of climate change programs and funding in 2005. Despite some improvements, fundamental problems with lack of clarity and consistency persist, hindering understanding of how funds are used and their effectiveness. The 2007 National Academies panel also noted a lack of detailed budget and management information for evaluating the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP). The 2008 National Research Council report highlighted the need to address the imbalance between space-based observations and other research components within the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP). It emphasized the importance of integrating observations from land, sea, air, and space into forecast models for decision-making. The report identified weaknesses in current observation systems and prioritized continuous observations over individual space missions for improvement. Strong observation systems were deemed valuable only if they could provide a range of continuous observations. The NRC panel identified weaknesses in observation systems and emphasized the need for continuous observations over individual space missions. They highlighted the importance of analyzing and applying data effectively. The panel recommended focusing resources on sustained observations, complementary non-space-based observations, turning observations into knowledge, and sustaining the information system. Additionally, there was a discussion on the tension between science for expanding knowledge and practical applications in the climate change science enterprise. The tension in climate change science is between expanding knowledge and practical applications. Critics argue that the emphasis has been on observing and predicting global change rather than providing useful information to policymakers. Oversight committees are mainly composed of scientists, and there is a belief that basic research will eventually benefit society. The scientific community's internal norms prioritize basic research, but changes may be needed for a more societal-focused approach. Involving users in research prioritization is crucial for maximizing societal benefits. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program needs to produce actionable information for addressing climate change effects. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program may need adjustments to achieve its vision of producing actionable information for addressing climate change effects. Various proposals suggest restructuring the program to enhance budgetary control, input from users, and overall decision-making. Some proposals aim to expand applied research and analysis for private and government needs, as well as increase public outreach. Bills introduced in Congress aim to implement some of these proposals. Several bills introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to expand federal research on energy technologies and carbon storage. President Clinton initiated the Climate Change Technology Initiative in 1998, followed by President Bush's U.S. Climate Change Technology Program in 2002. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized the CCTP, directing the President to establish a Committee on Climate Change Technology to integrate federal climate reports and implement a strategy. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) to promote the deployment of greenhouse gas reducing technologies. The program, chaired by the Secretary of Energy, produced a strategic plan in 2006 with a $3 billion budget. The CCTP is required to update its strategy every five years and carry out programs authorized under the Act. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established the Climate Change Technology Program within the Department of Energy to promote greenhouse gas reducing technologies. The program is required to update its strategy every five years and carry out authorized programs, including inventories, technology demonstration projects, standards development, and cooperative research agreements. President Bush's CCTP, as described in the FY2009 budget request, involved programs administered by 11 agencies and overseen by the interagency Committee on Climate Change Science and Technology Integration. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) was established to accelerate technological advances for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It is coordinated by the Department of Energy and overseen by the Committee on Climate Change Science and Technology Integration. The program aims to develop technologies for reducing emissions, capturing carbon dioxide, and improving monitoring capabilities. Federal funding for climate change technology has increased significantly over the years. Federal funding for climate change technology has increased significantly from $845 million in FY1993 to $4.53 billion enacted for FY2008, with President Bush's FY2009 budget requesting $4.41 billion. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) constitutes 62% of federal funding on climate change, but tracking the evolution of specific efforts and funding is challenging due to redefinitions of initiatives over time. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has also noted difficulties in tracking technology funding. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified challenges in tracking climate change technology funding due to redefinitions of initiatives over time, making it difficult to compare funding trends. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) presents funding by agency and program, with 29% of funds requested for CCTP in FY2009. This funding is a subset selected according to OMB guidelines, not including all financial incentives for technology research, development, and deployment. The reported CCTP funds for FY2009 do not represent all funding for technology research, development, and deployment. 29% of the funds requested would support nuclear energy, which is more than twice the amount requested for any other technology category. Other significant categories include programs supporting multiple technologies or unspecified technologies (13%) and funding for renewable energy technologies other than biomass and biofuels (12%). The Administration's priorities for specific technologies planned for development by DOE and EPA under the CCTP are highlighted in the funding table in Appendix F. The CCTP funds for FY2009 do not represent all technology research funding. There is broad support for federal interventions to stimulate technological advance for stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. technology strategy involves federal sponsorship of research on specified technologies, but success in commercialization is not guaranteed. The CCTP supports technological advance at all stages of research, development, demonstrations, and deployment. More than two-thirds of CCTP funding supports basic research and development of specific technologies, with programs also supporting demonstrations and commercialization efforts. The CCTP funding supports technological advance at all stages, including basic research, development, demonstrations, and deployment. Federal programs encourage technology deployment through various measures, with a small portion of funding allocated for this purpose. Multiple agencies administer over 60 programs to promote the adoption of efficient and greenhouse gas-reducing technologies. The CCTP funding supports technological advance at all stages, including basic research, development, demonstrations, and deployment. In FY2009, DOE would have represented 87% of the new budget authority for CCTP, with USDA receiving about 4%, and DOD and NASA each receiving about 3%. EPA and NSF would have received 2% and 1%, respectively. President Bush's climate change strategy also included International Climate Change Assistance to encourage other countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The International Climate Change Assistance program aims to encourage countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Negotiating international commitments post-2012 is a key challenge, with developing countries linking their participation to industrialized nations fulfilling their commitments under the UNFCCC. The United States, as a major emitter, is seen as having a significant responsibility in addressing climate change. President Bush proposed a substantial increase in funding for international climate change programs. President Bush proposed a significant increase in federal funding for climate change-related international programs, including a $400 million first installment to the Clean Technology Fund managed by the World Bank. The US Treasury committed $2 billion for the Clean Technology Fund, with other countries pledging up to $6.14 billion for the Climate Investment Funds. These funds aim to support developing countries in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for climate change impacts. The Climate Investment Funds aim to provide grants and concessional loans to developing countries for greenhouse gas emission reductions and climate change adaptation. Two trust funds are being created: the Clean Technology Fund for low-carbon technology projects and the Strategic Climate Fund for innovative climate change programs. The funds will help meet financial assistance commitments from developed countries. The Climate Investment Funds aim to provide grants and concessional loans to developing countries for greenhouse gas emission reductions and climate change adaptation. Energy Program expected to be created soon to help meet existing commitments of the United States and other developed countries. Debates have emerged over which technologies and countries should receive assistance, and how the funds fit into the overall strategy for reducing GHG emissions. President Bush's request aimed to increase international climate change assistance through USAID by $50 million, from $115 million enacted for FY2008 to a proposed $165 million in FY2009. A Continuing Resolution extended the FY2008 funding level through March 6, 2009. The FY2009 requested amount would still be lower than the level of $190 million enacted for FY2006, with a decrease due to $28 million eliminated for \"modern energy services\" in Afghanistan. USAID does not distinguish funding for measuring, monitoring, reporting, verification, and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from other activities in the relevant sectors. In the FY2009 request, the international assistance category included $52 million for the Department of State, $37 million of which would support the APP. In FY2009, international assistance included $52 million for the Department of State to support the Asia Pacific Partnership (APP). Additional funds for the APP were requested for the Department of Energy, Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency. However, both the House and Senate rejected the request to fund the APP, consistent with past appropriations. The partnership aims to advance technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Asia Pacific Partnership (APP) funding request was rejected by both the House and Senate, consistent with past appropriations. The voluntary partnership aims to advance technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in partner nations. Critics argue it diverts from UN cooperation, but technological advances in developing countries are crucial for reducing emissions. The United States, Canada, China, India, South Korea, Australia, and Japan are involved in the partnership. In 1992, Annex I Parties committed to providing financial resources for developing countries to meet climate change obligations. The United States contributed $26 million to the Global Environment Facility in FY2009. The GEF supports clean energy projects and is managed by the World Bank. The Least Developed Countries Fund assists the poorest countries in adapting to climate change. The Least Developed Countries Fund (LDC Fund) assists the poorest countries in adapting to climate change by providing short-term, urgent projects that meet high priority needs. The Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) was set up to leverage additional resources for adaptation, technology transfer, and diversification of economies. The United States has not contributed to the SCCF. The United States has not contributed to the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) or the Adaptation Fund (AF) under the Kyoto Protocol. Congress's appropriation of assistance to developing countries will impact U.S. credibility in garnering new GHG mitigation commitments post-2012. Financial assistance alone may not ensure developing countries view it as measurable, reportable, and verifiable support as required by the Bali Action Plan of 2007. The United States encourages countries to conserve tropical rainforests to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect carbon dioxide removal by trees. This is done through debt restructuring for tropical forestry conservation, authorized by the Tropical Forest Conservation Act. The FY2009 budget included $20 million for this purpose. The FY2009 budget included $20 million for debt restructuring for tropical forestry conservation under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act. Tax provisions also support climate change activities by incentivizing investments in technologies that emit less greenhouse gases. OMB's estimates of tax expenditures rose sharply from $580 million in FY2003 to $1.52 billion in FY2007. The estimated tax expenditures rose sharply from $580 million in FY2003 to $1.52 billion in FY2007, primarily due to tax incentives in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Projections indicated a decrease to $1.4 billion in FY2009, with potential alterations due to extensions of renewable energy incentives. One policy issue is the continuity of tax provisions for long-term planning and construction of capital projects like wind energy installations. Tax provisions for renewable energy installations may not be available predictably for a sufficient period, affecting their effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The incentives aim to stimulate new technologies rather than support already planned facilities. However, incentives for both low and high-GHG-emitting technologies may counteract each other, masking the true cost of energy to consumers. Revising conflicting provisions could lead to overall efficiencies in meeting multiple policy objectives. The federal funding related to climate change has expanded over the past two decades to support various programs and objectives. However, there is a lack of an overarching policy goal guiding the funded programs, resulting in separate goals for science, technology, energy production, foreign assistance, and trade. The current federal effort on climate change lacks a single, integrated strategy. The U.S. federal policy on climate change lacks a single, integrated strategy and is built \"bottom up\" from various existing programs and initiatives. President Obama aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a cap-and-trade system, but the effectiveness of these goals remains uncertain. President Obama aims to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. However, there is uncertainty on how his goals will be funded and aligned with programs. In FY2008, there was no requirement for a cross-cut budget for climate change activities, leading to a lack of consolidated annual reports on funding. The absence of this requirement continues into FY2009, with agencies varying in their identification and explanation of climate-related activities in their budget justifications. In FY2009, agencies differ in identifying and explaining climate-related activities in their budget justifications. OMB's cross-cut spreadsheets may include activities not noted in agency justifications, while agencies may identify activities as climate change-related not tallied by OMB. Constructing an accurate overview of climate change funding without OMB's assistance would be challenging. Congress may choose to maintain separate agency budget reports or reinstate a reporting requirement for climate change funding and tax incentives. If annual reports are required, specifying criteria for funding inclusion and providing detailed supporting information could enhance clarity and usefulness to Congress. Budget justifications should also clearly outline both increases and decreases in funding. In recent years, agencies have categorized climate change efforts into science, technology, and international assistance programs. However, these broad groupings may not accurately reflect the objectives of many activities, such as impact assessment or policy analysis. The traditional OMB reporting by three broad programs may not meet Congress's oversight and appropriations needs. It may be helpful for budget justifications to provide clear information on increases and decreases to activities, stakeholders affected, and priorities to facilitate transparency for decision-making. The assessment and management of adaptation, or policy analysis, may not fit neatly into the traditional OMB reporting by three broad programs for climate change efforts. Congress may need more specific funding or expenditure reports organized to align with climate change legislation and measurable objectives. The Climate Change Science Program has undergone numerous evaluations, but a more integrated level of evaluation is needed for funded climate change efforts. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) has undergone evaluations, but similar evaluations have not been conducted for the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) or international assistance efforts. No comprehensive evaluation of the federal climate change effort has been provided. Federal funding for climate change activities totaled $7.73 billion in FY2008, showing an 85% increase since FY2001. However, caution is advised when comparing data over time due to reporting issues. Federal funding for climate change activities in FY2008 totaled $7.73 billion, showing an 85% increase since FY2001. The increase in funding is mainly attributed to technology research and development expansion and new tax incentives. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) received $1.86 million in funding in FY2008, constituting about 29% of federal funding for climate change. Funding for climate change science decreased by 23% after adjusting for inflation from FY2001. Satellite-based observing systems received a significant portion of climate science funding. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) received about 29% of federal funding for climate change in FY2008. Satellite-based observing systems received a significant portion of climate science funding. External evaluations suggest improvements in leadership, budget coherence, progress metrics, reporting, and balance among research elements. Revision of the strategic plan for 2013-2023 is underway, with potential legislative options to clarify goals and processes. The Congress may consider legislative options to clarify federal climate change research goals and measures of progress. Funding for the Climate Change Technology Program has doubled since FY2001. Nuclear energy research receives the largest funding among climate change programs. Stakeholders agree on the importance of advancing low-emitting technologies. Stakeholders agree on the importance of advancing low-emitting technologies and suggest greater continuity of programs and incentives. No rigorous evaluations of the CCTP have been done, but opportunities exist to support exploratory and revolutionary technologies. Improving efficiencies of federal stimulation of technological advance is recommended. Opportunities exist to improve federal stimulation of technological advance by strategically reviewing and evaluating programs together. Climate change funding includes international programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change impacts. Negotiating international commitments post-2012 is a major policy challenge, especially in gaining global engagement in greenhouse gas mitigation. Developing countries' participation depends on industrialized countries' actions. The major policy challenge post-2012 is negotiating international commitments to address climate change, with a focus on gaining global engagement in greenhouse gas mitigation. Developing countries' participation hinges on industrialized countries fulfilling their commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including financial and technological assistance. The United States, as a leading emitter of greenhouse gases, is seen as having a significant responsibility in addressing climate change globally. The United States, along with other wealthy countries, committed in 1992 to provide financial and technological assistance to emerging economies to address climate change. The US has contributed to the Global Environmental Facility but not to special funds for the least developed countries. In 2008, the US Treasury committed $2 billion for the Clean Technology Fund, with a pledge of up to $6.14 billion for the Climate Investment Funds. However, the US commitment has not been appropriated by Congress. The United States, along with other wealthy countries, committed in 1992 to provide financial and technological assistance to emerging economies to address climate change. In 2008, the US Treasury committed $2 billion for the Clean Technology Fund, with a pledge of up to $6.14 billion for the Climate Investment Funds. However, concerns about promoting coal use and forestalling GHG abatement have delayed the US appropriation. The US role as a leader, collaborator, or follower in providing assistance and technological cooperation will depend on future actions. Congressional funding for cooperation with developing countries will impact the Department of State's ability to enhance US credibility and engage developing countries in new GHG mitigation commitments post-2012. Providing assistance to developing countries for GHG mitigation commitments post-2012 may not guarantee their compliance with Bali Action Plan requirements. Controversies arise over whether financial aid outside UNFCCC mechanisms fulfills commitments, management of multilateral funds, and the adequacy and predictability of funds. Tax provisions aim to promote low-GHG technologies, but their continuity for long-term projects like renewable energy installations is uncertain. Tax provisions for renewable energy projects may not be predictably available for long-term planning and construction due to delays in renewing incentives. This uncertainty reduces investor confidence and effectiveness in reducing GHG emissions. Tax credits may not be effective in the current economic situation, especially for individuals or entities with limited tax liability. Evaluations of tax incentives' efficiency and effectiveness are lacking, leading to debates over the most efficient mechanisms for achieving policy goals. Tax incentives for renewable energy projects face uncertainty in availability, impacting investor confidence and GHG emission reduction efforts. Evaluations on the efficiency of tax incentives are scarce, leading to debates on the most effective policy mechanisms. The existence of tax incentives for both low and high GHG-emitting technologies may counteract each other, masking the true cost of energy to consumers. Executive Branch reporting on climate change expenditures focuses on tax incentives stimulating GHG reductions, but lacks data on broader policy objectives like energy security and employment. Revising conflicting tax provisions could enhance overall efficiency in meeting multiple objectives and supporting \"win-win\" measures. The lack of a unified mission across agencies in packaging existing programs into a climate change strategy hinders effective action. The Obama Administration is expected to provide more action-oriented leadership in aligning climate-related programs into an effective cross-agency mission. There are gaps in U.S. governance infrastructure for climate change, such as data management and public communications. Federal resources for economic evaluations of climate options are minimal. Stakeholders argue for programs to assess potential impacts of climate change. Federal resources for economic evaluations of climate options are minimal, with stakeholders arguing that programs to assess potential impacts of climate change and plan for adaptation are under-funded. There are opportunities to improve efficiencies across programs addressing issues like carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions estimates. Administrative constraints on funding, such as authorities to use contracts versus grants, may weaken the efficiency and effectiveness of climate change-related programs. Administrative constraints on funding, such as authorities to use contracts versus grants, may weaken the efficiency and effectiveness of climate change-related programs. Barriers to job mobility of federal personnel across programs and departments also likely discourage development, interaction, and collaboration across agencies and disciplines. Finding funds can be problematic for interagency teams to accomplish specific \"common good\" tasks. Many proposals in the 111th Congress aim to restructure and expand climate change programs, with a focus on integrated strategies and minimizing fragmentation of legislative measures. There is interest in how federal funding can support an overall strategy to address climate change, but challenges may arise in demonstrating program benefits amidst budget pressures and competing demands. The new President's pledges and evolving Congressional debate on appropriate policies further complicate the issue. Calls to expand funding for climate change programs may face challenges in demonstrating benefits that can compete with other demands. The new President's direction-changing pledges and evolving Congressional debate on climate change policies will likely shift priorities. Improved reporting of funding and aligning funding with strategic policy goals are suggested. The Congress did not include statutory language in the FY2008 appropriations law or in the FY2009 Continuing Resolution requiring the Administration to report to Congress on federal expenditures for climate change activities, unlike in previous years. The FY2008 appropriations law and FY2009 Continuing Resolution did not include statutory language requiring the Administration to report on federal expenditures for climate change activities. However, previous laws mandated the President to report on climate change obligations and expenditures for foreign operations and federal agencies. The Consolidated Appropriations Acts of 2004 and 2005, along with the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act of 2006, require the President to report to Congress on climate change expenditures within 60 days of submitting the budget. The report must detail federal agency obligations and expenditures for climate change programs in fiscal years 2005 and 2006. In fiscal year 2006, agencies must report climate change activities and costs in line with the President's Budget Appendix. The United States Agency for International Development is required to provide details on funds allocated for promoting clean energy technologies, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, carbon capture, meeting climate change responsibilities, and assessing vulnerability to climate change impacts. President George W. Bush aimed to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas intensity in 2002. President George W. Bush announced goals to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas intensity by 18% by 2012 and to halt increases in U.S. emissions of GHG by 2025, with a focus on advancing energy-efficient technologies and setting performance targets for selected programs. President George W. Bush announced a new national goal for climate policy in 2008 to halt increases in U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases by 2025, with emissions declining thereafter. The plan involved regulatory measures and market incentives to promote clean technologies. Some stakeholders criticized the policy for proposing emission caps, while others deemed it insufficient. President Bush also established a Cabinet-level Committee on Climate Change Science and Technology Integration to oversee research programs. The Bush Administration established a Committee on Climate Change Science and Technology Integration to oversee research programs across agencies. This decentralized approach puts accountability and leadership within each agency, leading to concerns about collaboration and accountability for climate change goals. Communication and coordination are facilitated through inter-agency working groups, and budget levels are primarily established through dialogue between agencies and OMB. President Bush also set up the Climate Change Research Initiative to supplement the U.S. Global Change Research Program. President Bush established the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) in 2002, which includes the Climate Change Research Initiative (CCRI) and the Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP). The Department of State leads international cooperation efforts, and funding for CCSP activities is detailed in appendices. President Bush's FY2009 proposal includes an increase in NASA's CCSP funding by $125.6 million, with a focus on boosting satellite-based observations. NASA's share of all CCSP funding remains approximately 58% under the Continuing Resolution for FY2009. President Bush's FY2009 proposal includes a $125.6 million increase in funding for NASA, with a focus on acquiring observations by satellites. This would boost the satellite share to $769 million (64% of NASA's total) and restore key climate-related data sensors like TSIS and CERES. These sensors would help determine the impact of solar variability and atmospheric changes on climate. The FY2009 NASA budget proposal includes increased funding for satellite observations, specifically for acquiring key climate-related data sensors like TSIS and CERES. However, Earth Sciences have been low among NASA's priorities, with funds being shifted from climate change programs to other priorities such as the Vision for Space Exploration. An NRC report in 2006 highlighted the lack of balance in the proposed space and Earth science program, stating it is not robust, properly balanced, sustainable, or capable of making adequate progress towards recommended goals. Under the FY2009 proposal, the Earth System Science Pathfinder's funding would decrease by 22%. Under the FY2009 proposal, NASA's budget would decrease funding for the Earth System Science Pathfinder by 22%. The budget projection includes funding for the SMAP mission for soil moisture mapping and a second generation ICESat mission to measure ice topography. NASA plans to develop additional missions by 2013 based on the NRC Decadal Survey. Changes in accounting methods since 2005 make budget comparisons difficult. Newly included satellite systems in the budget request include the Landsat Data Continuity Mission and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment. NASA's FY2009 budget includes funding for satellite systems like Landsat Data Continuity Mission and GRACE. NASA collaborates with other agencies like NOAA and USGS for climate-related observations. Applied Sciences and Education and Outreach aim to connect NASA's missions with potential users for societal benefits. The budget supports evaluation of policy, market, and technology approaches to climate change impacts. NASA's FY2009 budget supports evaluation of policy, market, and technology approaches to climate change impacts. Despite declining funds for satellite-based observations, funding for other observations and research has decreased even faster. Recommendations have been made to correct reductions in research and analysis programs to improve the return on investment from satellite-based data. Users of NASA data require better access to the data in order to maximize its benefits. In FY2009, NASA's budget focuses on evaluating policy, market, and technology approaches to climate change impacts. Recommendations have been made to improve the return on investment from satellite-based data. NOAA's budget for climate change science would increase by $20 million in FY2009. NOAA leads the interagency Climate Change Science Program and is working on the court-ordered Capstone Synthesis and Assessment Product. The FY2009 budget proposal would increase NOAA's budget for climate change science by $20 million (8.3%) over the FY2008 enacted level. The proposal includes funding for observational capacities, not applied research or planning. A $74 million increase is designated for developing key satellite climate sensors, including the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) sensor and the Total Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS) sensor. The Continuing Resolution until March 6, 2009, delays funding redistributions within NOAA. The FY2009 budget proposal includes a $20 million increase for NOAA's climate change science, with funding for developing key satellite climate sensors like CERES and TSIS. These sensors are crucial for distinguishing solar influence from other factors driving climate variability and change. The reinstatement of these sensors is essential for ensuring overlapping data series for calibration of measurements. The Administration is adjusting funding for climate-related items to provide a more accurate representation of its climate funding. This includes increasing funding for key satellite climate sensors like CERES and TSIS. The proposed changes would raise NOAA's budget authority for the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) by $7 million for FY2007 and FY2008, and by $81 million for FY2009. However, there are proposed reductions in funding for Congressionally directed programs like the Regional Climate Centers and for \"Archive, Access, and Assessment.\" NOAA's FY2009 budget justification outlines objectives such as developing an integrated earth system analysis capability, creating a high-quality record of the atmosphere and ocean since 1979, and enhancing carbon cycle research. The FY2009 proposal aims to enhance climate research by increasing funding for various projects, including an end-to-end hydrologic projection capability, carbon cycle research in high latitude systems, and quantification of climate forcing by aerosols and greenhouse gases. Funding would also support research on the \"Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation\" (A-MOC) and the development of an abrupt change early warning system. Additionally, there would be increased funding for the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) and Water Vapor Process Research. The FY2009 proposal includes increased funding for the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) to develop the next-generation Climate Forecast System and improve understanding of water vapor distribution. It also proposes the creation of a National Climate Service within NOAA to enhance seasonal forecasts and drought information. The proposed National Climate Service aims to improve provision of routine seasonal to multi-annual forecasts and data products, including expanded drought information. It focuses on variability on shorter time frames, not the longer-term climate change debate. The FY2009 proposal includes increased funding for NIST activities in the CCSP to resolve discrepancies in satellite measurements. The NIST contribution to the CCSP would increase by $5.0 million to $5.2 million in FY2009 for resolving discrepancies in satellite measurements of radiation and providing critical information about aerosols. NSF funding for FY2008 was just over $205 million, constituting about 11% of the CCSP. President Bush's budget proposed a $16 million increase to $220.6 million in FY2009, with proposed increases for Geosciences. NSF's funding for climate change programs increased by $16 million to $220.6 million in FY2009. The funding increase was proposed for Geosciences and the Office of Polar Programs. The programs focus on fundamental discovery, research infrastructure, and educational activities, with priorities including data acquisition, model enhancement, and new research methods. Additionally, NSF planned to initiate a program on climate change impacts on water. NSF proposed a program on climate change impacts on water. DOE's funding for the CCSP was enacted at $128.3 million for FY2008, with a proposed increase to $145.9 million in FY2009. The largest component supports research on climate forcing, including funding for Atmospheric Radiation Measurement to reduce scientific uncertainty in climate change prediction. Additional funding would support research on atmospheric aerosols and their effects on the Earth's energy balance. The proposed increase in funding for climate change research in FY2009 includes $13.0 million for research on atmospheric aerosols, $13.6 million for Ameriflux, $1.9 million for the Carbon Dioxide Information and Analysis Center, and $45.4 million for climate change modeling in DOE's Office of Science. Additionally, funding would support work towards a first-generation Earth System model and exploration of past and potential future abrupt climate change. In FY2009, funding for climate change research would have increased, with $7.8 million for an Earth System model, $2.6 million for abrupt climate change studies, and $19.4 million for the Climate Change Response program. Research on carbon capture and sequestration would increase to $17.4 million, with $12.3 million for biological sequestration and $4.7 million for soil sequestration. The USGS restructured its climate change science research in 2007, with a proposed budget of $31.4 million in FY2009. The USGS restructured its climate change science research in 2007 and requested $31.4 million for CCSP-related work in FY2009. This included $26.6 million consolidated into one Global Change activity account, $3.7 million for the National Satellite Land Remote Sensing Data Archive, and $1.1 million for Biological Research and Monitoring. The USGS is implementing a new climate change science strategy called the National Climate Effects Research and Monitoring Network, which includes long-term monitoring in focus areas, field study sites, regional and national surveys, and expanded use of space-based remote sensing. The USGS restructured its climate change science research in 2007 and requested $31.4 million for CCSP-related work in FY2009. This included funding for a network of field study sites, regional and national surveys, and expanded use of space-based remote sensing to track environmental changes. The Bureau of Reclamation also reported climate change-related activities, with a budget justification indicating a greater funding level for impact assessment and adaptation compared to other agencies in the CCSP. The Bureau of Reclamation's budget justification in FY2009 requested $31.9 million for climate change activities, with $19.0 million allocated to the Water for America Initiative. Funding would support projects for endangered species recovery and investigation programs, focusing on managing water resources under changing conditions. In the Water for America Initiative, $12.9 million would fund projects for endangered species recovery and investigation programs. Reclamation's efforts focus on two of the Initiative's strategies: Plan for Our Nation's Water Future and Expand, Protect, and Conserve Our Nation's Water Resources. The third strategy, Enhance Our Nation's Water Knowledge, will be handled by USGS. The $46.8 million enacted for HHS for climate change science is for health effects of ultra-violet radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion, not strictly climate change. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is engaged in work on climate change impacts on health, including emerging infectious diseases and allergens. Additional scientific research is needed to understand the potential health effects of global climate change. The CDC has identified 11 priority health actions and developed a policy statement in response to this need. The World Health Organization (WHO) has released research priorities to address the health effects of climate change globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) released research priorities to address health effects of climate change globally, including interactions with other health determinants, long-term climate change effects, effectiveness of interventions, and assessing health impacts of non-health sector policies. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) contributes to research on air and water quality effects of climate change. The EPA's research on climate change impacts has faced funding reductions, raising concerns about its ability to address future problems adequately. The agency's Science Advisory Board warned that the declining budget could lead to larger costs and inappropriate regulatory responses in the future. The EPA's research on climate change impacts faces funding reductions, raising concerns about addressing future problems adequately. The Science Advisory Board warned that the declining budget could lead to larger costs and inappropriate regulatory responses in the future. The SAB recommended that EPA adopt long-term GHG reduction objectives to better define their research portfolio. The USDA's funding for climate change science in FY2008 was $64.4 million, but the FY2009 request proposed a decrease to $60.3 million. Most of the decrease would come from cuts to various climate change programs in the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), with a focus on activities like the GRACEnet and Agriflux network. Additionally, funding would be allocated to study the impacts of climate change on rangelands and agricultural ecosystems. The FY2009 USDA budget proposed changes in funding for climate change research, including reductions in Forest Services research by $2.2 million and an increase in funding for CSREES by $1.7 million. Research on ultraviolet radiation effects and the carbon cycle would also see increases in funding. The National Research Initiative (NRI) was proposed to receive $0.5 million, despite not being reauthorized in the 2008 farm bill. In FY2009, funding for plant and animal physiology, ecosystems, and the carbon cycle increased. The National Research Initiative (NRI) received $0.5 million in the proposed budget. The Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP) funding levels for FY2008 and FY2009 were reported, with the Department of Energy (DOE) being the largest component at 85% of the FY2008 enacted total. President Bush's FY2009 request for the CCTP included changes to funding approved by OMB. It is uncertain how President Obama may propose similar modifications. President Obama may re-propose modifications to the Department of Energy's Climate Change Technology Program (CCTP). The FY2009 request includes changes to funding for energy efficiency, renewable energy, hydrogen fuel cell research, geothermal systems, biofuels, vehicle, building, industrial technologies, Fossil Energy Research and Development, nuclear energy supply, and conservation. Notable increases include a 51% increase for Fossil Energy Research and Development/Efficiency and Sequestration, a 71% increase for nuclear energy supply and conservation, and a 42% increase for carbon sequestration. The FY2009 request includes significant increases in funding for various energy programs, such as a 52% increase in carbon sequestration, a tripling of funding for FutureGen, a 71% increase for nuclear energy supply and conservation, and a 42% increase for nuclear fusion research, sequestration, and hydrogen research. Both the House and Senate passed bills in 2008 covering most of the CCTP appropriations, with deviations from the FY2008 levels and the FY2009 request. The Continuing Resolution added $250 million for weatherization grants. The total budget authority for DOE for the CCTP rose from FY2003 to FY2004 due to increased funding for the Clean Coal Power Initiative. The FY2009 budget includes increased funding for various energy programs, with a focus on nuclear energy. The Clean Coal Power Initiative saw a shift towards improving efficiency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Funding for nuclear energy has significantly increased, making it a large share of CCTP funding. DOE's nuclear energy R&D program aims to develop new technologies to meet energy and climate goals, but critics argue it provides wasteful subsidies to a hazardous industry. The energy R&D program aims to develop new nuclear technologies to meet energy and climate goals. Critics argue that DOE's nuclear research program provides wasteful subsidies to a hazardous industry. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) aims to develop technologies for recycling uranium and plutonium from spent nuclear fuel to reduce nuclear weapons proliferation risks. However, opponents dispute the feasibility of making nuclear recycling technology proliferation-resistant. In 2008, the House Appropriations Committee criticized GNEP as rushed, poorly-defined, and expensive, eliminating funding for the program. The House Appropriations Committee sharply criticized the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) as rushed, poorly-defined, and expensive, eliminating all funding for the program. President Obama supports harnessing nuclear energy to address climate change. Funding for advanced nuclear reactors was proposed to be boosted, while USDA's contributions to the CCTP included both mandatory and discretionary funding. The enacted FY2008 funding levels for USDA were estimated at about $205 million, up from $48 million in FY2007. In FY2007, the mandatory share was estimated to increase to $151 million in FY2008 under President Bush's proposals for the Farm Bill. President Bush's FY2009 budget foresaw a $22 million decrease in CCTP funding of the USDA, primarily from the renewable energy program. The increases in FY2007 to FY2008 were due to increases in mandatory funding for various energy programs. The 2008 farm bill reauthorized, modified, and expanded programs related to renewable energy and energy efficiency grants and loans. Additionally, funding for bioenergy research, renewable energy, and value-added producer grants saw increases. The Department of Defense reported an increase in funding for climate change initiatives from $100.9 million in FY2007 to $109.6 million in FY2008. The Department of Defense's funding for climate change initiatives increased from $100.9 million in FY2007 to $109.6 million in FY2008. President Bush's budget proposal aimed to raise this funding to $131.0 million in FY2008, with varying allocations across different services. The Administration requested to increase Air Force funding by $81.7 million in FY2009, while decreasing funding to the Army and Navy. Details on the specific uses of these proposed funds are not available. The Department of Defense's funding for climate change initiatives increased from $100.9 million in FY2007 to $109.6 million in FY2008. President Bush's budget proposal aimed to raise this funding to $131.0 million in FY2008, with varying allocations across different services. The Administration requested to increase Air Force funding by $81.7 million in FY2009, while decreasing funding to the Army and Navy. CCTP-related funding to the Army was reduced by $41.9 million to $16.4 million in FY2009, and to the Navy by $16.2 million to $11.1 million in FY2009. The DOD has incentives to engage in advanced, low-greenhouse gas technologies due to high fuel consumption and energy vulnerabilities identified by the Defense Science Board. The 2008 report recommended that the Department of Defense establish oversight and accountability for implementing energy recommendations, including a strategic plan with measurable goals. Currently, decisions on energy demand are scattered with little accountability. Senior leadership needs to ensure effective implementation and ongoing measurement of progress across the organization. The 2008 report recommended that the Department of Defense establish a strategic plan with measurable goals to enhance energy security, with implications for greenhouse gas decisions. Controversy surrounds the use of alternative fuels from unconventional sources due to potential increased emissions. Legislation in 2007 restricted agencies from procuring alternative fuels with higher emissions, impacting DOD's significant oil consumption. The Defense Science Board (DSB) recommended that the Department of Defense (DoD) invest in low carbon synthetic fuel technologies to address climate change implications and reduce carbon emissions. The Task Force advised DoD to avoid investing in processes that exceed the carbon footprint of petroleum and to continue researching alternative, non-petroleum, renewable, and low-carbon footprint fuels for long-term sustainability. DARPA's contributions to technological advancement were also acknowledged. The DOD's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has been praised for its technological advancements. Some experts suggest expanding DARPA's program to focus on advancing energy technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Congress allocated funds for DARPA-E in FY2007, but the Administration proposed cutting this funding in FY2009. The 110th Congress amended DOD's authorization to consider the effects of climate change on its facilities and missions. This law requires military planners to assess the risks of climate change in defense missions. The law requires military planners to assess the risks of climate change to defense missions, update defense plans, engage with allies on climate mitigation strategies, and develop capabilities to reduce future impacts. The next quadrennial defense review must assess DOD's capacities to respond to climate change consequences, using mid-range scenarios. The Secretary of Defense must submit a plan to Congress to improve DOD's participation in interagency coordination on national security strategy. The Environmental Protection Agency's funding for the Climate Change Technology Program was proposed to decline from 3.0% in FY2007 to 2.2% in FY2009. EPA's role includes inventorying greenhouse gas emissions, operating voluntary programs, and providing future emission scenarios and economic impact analyses. President Bush's proposal aimed to reduce EPA's funding. The EPA's funding for greenhouse gas emissions programs, including Energy Star and transportation activities, faced significant cuts under President Bush's proposal. This included reductions in funding for voluntary GHG reduction initiatives and biofuel mandates. Additionally, funding for a greenhouse gas reporting registry was eliminated. President Bush's FY2009 proposal would have eliminated funding for a greenhouse gas reporting registry, causing backlash from Senators. Consistent GHG reporting is crucial for emission control programs, and early reporting may incentivize leadership in reducing emissions. Various initiatives are in progress to develop guidance for reporting greenhouse gas emissions. Various initiatives are underway to develop guidance for reporting greenhouse gas emissions, with the EPA's FY2009 budget justification mentioning the existence of other initiatives. The FY2009 request proposed adding $5.0 million to support the Asia-Pacific Partnership, which had been repeatedly denied in previous years' appropriations. Without FY2008 enacted funding, no funding is available under the Continuing Resolution through March 9, 2009. Appropriations for the EPA no longer reflect current organization and activity levels of climate-technology related initiatives. The FY2009 budget for EPA and NASA's CCTP funding proposed changes in funding levels and activities. NASA's share of CCTP funding was set to decline, with a focus on developing environmentally friendly aircraft. The 2009 defense reauthorization law included a provision for NASA to support research on environmental issues. President Bush's FY2009 budget proposal aimed to reduce NASA's funding for environmentally friendly aircraft research by $19.5 million to $100.5 million. The budget also included cuts to projects for lithium-ion batteries, regenerative fuel cells, and nuclear fission. Additionally, funding for measuring surface radiation and renewable energy assessment would remain constant. The Bush Administration identified specific technologies as \"high priority\" within the Climate Change Technology Priorities program. The Bush Administration identified specific technologies as \"high priority\" within the Climate Change Technology Priorities program, with funding evolution tracked by the CCTP. Funding status for these technologies remains unclear."
