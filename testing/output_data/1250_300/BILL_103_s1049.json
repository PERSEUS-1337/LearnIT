    "content": "The \"Lechuguilla Cave Protection Act of 1993\" aims to protect significant cave resources in Carlsbad Caverns National Park and adjacent public lands from adverse effects of mineral exploration and development. The Act defines key terms and designates a cave protection area to be retained in public ownership. The \"Lechuguilla Cave Protection Act of 1993\" withdraws approximately 6,280 acres of public lands within the cave protection area from all forms of appropriation or disposal under public land laws. The lands are described in a map filed with the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy. The withdrawn lands must have a legal description and detailed map filed with the House of Representatives and Senate committees. The map and description will have the same legal force as the Act, with the Secretary allowed to correct errors. Copies of the map and description will be available for public inspection. The public lands will be managed by the Secretary through the Bureau of Land Management in accordance with relevant laws. SEC. 5. MANAGEMENT OF EXISTING LEASES. The Secretary is prohibited from allowing new drilling on valid mineral or geothermal leases within certain lands to protect cave resources. Activities on existing leases may be suspended if necessary to prevent adverse impacts. The prohibition on new drilling will last until a decision is made on the proposal or for 12 months after the enactment of the Act. During the specified period, the Secretary must negotiate with lease holders for termination or restrictions on activities to protect cave resources in Carlsbad Caverns National Park. The Secretary must negotiate with lease holders to protect cave resources in Carlsbad Caverns National Park, taking appropriate steps if no agreement is reached. The Secretary may acquire lands within the cave protection area to protect resources of Carlsbad Caverns National Park. Cooperation with other parties owning lands in the area is sought to further the protection of Lechuguilla Cave and other significant cave resources. SEC. 6. ADDITIONAL PROTECTION AND RELATION TO OTHER LAWS. The Secretary will take additional steps to protect Lechuguilla Cave and other significant cave resources in Carlsbad Caverns National Park, including limiting access and prohibiting removal of resources, if deemed necessary based on scientific analysis. If existing laws are insufficient, the Secretary may take further actions to ensure protection. The Secretary will inform the appropriate committees if additional authority is needed to protect Lechuguilla Cave and other significant cave resources in Carlsbad Caverns National Park. This Act does not affect the ability to seek compensation under existing laws."
