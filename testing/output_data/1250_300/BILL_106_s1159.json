    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for students from kindergarten to 12th grade. The findings of Congress highlight the importance of physical education for children's development, health, and well-being. It emphasizes the benefits of physical education in improving cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, flexibility, self-esteem, and overall health. The increasing rates of childhood obesity and its economic impact are also addressed. Low levels of activity contribute to high obesity rates among children in the US, leading to over $100 billion in obesity-related costs annually. Inactivity and poor diet cause 300,000 deaths yearly. Physically fit adults have lower risks of heart attacks and stroke. Only 1 in 4 children get enough daily vigorous activity. Recommendations include daily physical education for all students from kindergarten to grade 12. Twelve years after Congress passed a resolution encouraging daily physical education programs for all K-12 students, little progress has been made. Quality physical education is essential for developing fitness, competence, and understanding of physical activity to promote healthy lifestyles for all students. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and staff training. Applications and program requirements are outlined. Each local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary outlining a plan to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet specific requirements. These requirements include providing students with a minimum of 150 minutes of instructional physical education per week, fitness education, and instruction in various motor skills. The physical education program aims to improve children's physical well-being through instruction in motor skills, cognitive concepts, social skills, and healthy habits. Teachers must have baccalaureate degrees and receive professional development opportunities. Teachers of physical education must have baccalaureate degrees and receive professional development opportunities to stay updated on the latest research and trends in the field. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC programs are not considered part of the physical education curriculum. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural educational agencies, as well as between agencies serving large and small student populations. Funds can include participation of home-schooled and private school students. Reports are required for continued funding. \"Annual reports are required for continued funding of grants or contracts under this program, showing progress towards program requirements. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress detailing program success and recommendations for improvement. Administrative costs are limited to 7% of funds, and the federal share must supplement, not supplant, local funds.\" \"Administrative costs for local educational agencies are capped at 7% of grant funds. The federal share of project costs cannot exceed 90% in the first year and 75% in subsequent years. Funds must supplement, not replace, other federal, state, and local funds for physical education activities. $30,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2000, increasing to $100,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2004.\""
