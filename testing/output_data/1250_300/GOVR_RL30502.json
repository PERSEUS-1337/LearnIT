    "content": "P.L. 106-554, signed in December 2000, enacted the Treasury, Postal Service, Executive Office of the President, and General Government Appropriations, 2001. Prior to this, P.L. 106-275 provided funding for most Treasury and General Government accounts at the FY2000 level. Additionally, P.L. 106-346 partially funded select accounts from the primary funding measure. Various measures were considered before the enactment of P.L. 106-554. Several measures were enacted to fund affected accounts, including House bill H.R. 4871, Senate bill S. 2900, and Legislative Branch Appropriation H.R. 4516/H.R. 4985. Transportation Appropriations P.L. 106-346 provided partial funding, while FY2001 Continuing Funding Resolution P.L. 106-275 and P.L. 106-426 authorized funding for the presidential transition. The bulk of accounts were funded through P.L. 106-554, with supplemental funding from P.L. 106-346. The Executive Office of the President, Postal Service, and General Government FY2001 are funded through P.L.106-554 (H.R. 4577/H.R. 5658).

Congress passes a concurrent resolution establishing the congressional budget and allocates discretionary funding levels to subcommittees. Treasury and General Government appropriations for FY2001 are discussed in the report. Treasury and General Government appropriations fund various law enforcement organizations under the Department of the Treasury, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Customs Service, Secret Service, and others. The U.S. Postal Service is mostly self-supporting, with limited federal contributions for specific purposes like free postal service for the blind. Appropriations for the Executive Office of the President cover salaries, expenses, and operations of various agencies within the EOP. The Treasury and General Government appropriations fund various agencies within the Executive Office of the President (EOP) and independent agencies. Funding is also allocated for drug control initiatives through the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). The appropriations include restrictions and rules that apply government-wide. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 includes provisions such as prohibiting the use of funds for employing non-U.S. citizens, maintaining drug-free workplaces, and authorizing travel expenses for family members of federal employees serving overseas. Additionally, there will be a .22% across-the-board rescission of FY2001 discretionary budget authority affecting all accounts in the Treasury and General Government appropriations. The Office of Management and Budget is required to report on the implementation of the rescission when the FY2002 budget is submitted. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidelines for the implementation of a .22% across-the-board rescission of FY2001 discretionary budget authority. The rescission applies to all net positive discretionary budget authority and obligation limitations, including advance appropriations for FY 2001 provided in FY 2000 or earlier years. Discretionary emergency appropriations are also subject to the rescission, with a requirement for equal reduction across all programs, projects, and activities. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued guidelines for a .22% across-the-board rescission of FY2001 discretionary budget authority. Agencies must allocate the reduction to every program, project, and activity without exception. The rescission cannot be applied to mandatory funds or transfers. Subsequent to FY2000 appropriations, the FY2000 Consolidated Appropriations Act included a 0.38% across-the-board rescission. OMB reported specific reductions in the accounts for FY2001 budget submission. The FY2000 Consolidated Appropriations Act included a 0.38% across-the-board rescission. The Office of Management and Budget reported specific reductions in accounts for the FY2001 budget submission. The law stipulated that each department had to achieve the 0.38% savings, with some flexibility to protect high-priority programs. Certain programs were exempt from the rescission provisions, but it was otherwise universally applied. The FY2001 Military Construction Appropriations Act affected some accounts covered by the Treasury/Postal Service measure. Service measures are impacted by language changes, such as pay dates for federal civilian personnel reverting to FY2000 levels. The term \"net\" in the report refers to FY2000 appropriated levels reduced by rescinded amounts.

The FY2001 budget request for the Department of Treasury is $13.89 billion, with $8.86 billion allocated for the IRS. A .22% rescission would result in a departmental reduction of approximately $30 million. The budget request aims to double the account for department-wide systems, increase funding for the Money Laundering Strategy, interagency crime and drug enforcement, and agencies like the Secret Service, ATF, and Customs Service. The IRS would see an increase of just under 10%.

For FY2001, Congress appropriated $772,843,000 for ATF, a 28% increase over the previous year. The agency received funding for salaries and expenses, counter-terrorism, and other initiatives, with most of the administration's FY2001 request being fully funded. The vetoed Legislative Branch conference agreement would have provided $768,695,000 for ATF, while the House and Senate versions proposed slightly lower amounts.

The Administration requested $338 million for automation modernization in FY2001, including $123 million for ACS, $5 million for ITDS, and $210 million for ACE. Congress rejected the fee proposal and provided over $258 million in direct appropriation for ITDS and ACE development. The total cost of ACE development, operation, and maintenance over 7 years is estimated to be around $1.4 billion. The development of ACE is a high-risk endeavor costing between $1.4 and $1.8 billion over 7 years. Customs received $5 million for ITDS and at least $130 million for ACE development. GAO noted Customs' efforts to implement recommendations and generate revenue from user fee programs. The first fee program includes seven user fees established by COBRA and a fee for processing bulk cargo from Mexico and Canada. The second fee program consists of the merchandise processing fee (MPF) established by OBRA. COBRA fee receipts are not appropriated by Congress and fund a significant portion of Customs' expenditures. From FY1992 to FY2000, COBRA fee receipts increased from $176 million to $299 million, with limitations on their use. Surplus revenues are carried over to fund recurring costs, including permanent inspector positions and equipment. The COBRA fee receipts have funded an increasing share of permanent inspector positions and information technology costs. However, there are concerns about a drop-off in air passenger processing fee receipts and the reliance on COBRA fees to fund base positions. The authorization for COBRA fees expires at the end of FY2003. The FY2001 request for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was $8,986,084,000, representing a 9.36% increase over the previous year.
