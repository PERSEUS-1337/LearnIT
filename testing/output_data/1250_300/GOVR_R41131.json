    "content": "The alternate engine program for the F-35 Lightning II fighter was a significant issue for Congress in FY2012, with implications for the defense budget and military capability. The program developed the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. Despite successive Administration proposals to terminate the program, Congress continued to fund it until the announcement of its termination in December 2011. The Department of Defense selected the Lockheed Martin F-35 with the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine as the winner of the Joint Strike Fighter competition. Congress required the development of the alternate F136 engine, but it was terminated in 2011 despite Congress funding it against Administration proposals. The alternate engine program for the F-35 was terminated in 2011 despite Congress funding it against Administration proposals. Supporters of the termination argued that developing a second engine would significantly increase costs and reduce the number of F-35s that could be procured. The program office stated that reducing F-35 procurement over the next five years could total 50 to 80 aircraft. Procuring a second engine would increase F-35 life-cycle operation and support costs by requiring DOD to maintain two engine maintenance pipelines. Supporting two engines on aircraft carriers would be challenging due to limited space. Having a second engine is not necessary to sustain international interest in the F-35, as significant potential foreign buyers are already committed to the program. Congress accepts the risk of using single designs across fleets, including powerplants and airframes. The F-35 program office is considering reducing procurement by 50 to 80 aircraft over the next five years. Congress and DOD accept the risk of using a single airframe design, even though it could lead to fleet grounding in case of design flaws. The development of the F135 engine has progressed to a point where having an alternate engine program is no longer necessary. Critics argue that terminating the alternate engine program goes against the FY2008 defense authorization act. The Secretary of Defense must ensure annual funding for the development and procurement of 2 options for the propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter to avoid grounding the entire F-35 fleet due to engine issues. Having a second engine in production allows for competition in procurement, potentially reducing costs compared to sole-source procurement. Having a second engine in production for the F-35 program allows for competition in procurement, potentially reducing costs and improving performance. It also enables quicker production surges and sustains international interest in the program by offering choices to potential foreign buyers. The F-35 alternate engine program was terminated by DOD on April 25, 2011, with General Electric and Rolls-Royce ending their self-funded development of the F136 engine on December 2, 2011. Pratt & Whitney, the incumbent engine maker, received $7.3 billion in funding for the F-35 program. Pratt & Whitney received $7.3 billion in funding for the F-35 program, including $6.1 billion for F135 System Development and Demonstration work. The F135 SDD contract cost increased to $6.7 billion by September 2009. General Electric/Rolls-Royce received $2.4 billion, with $1.7 billion for F136 engine SDD work. The F136 team did not work on STOVL Lift System components and exhaust systems, which were developed under the F135 Pratt & Whitney contract. The F136 team did not work on design, development, test, or delivery of STOVL Lift System components and exhaust systems, which were provided under the F135 Pratt & Whitney SDD contract. The F136 SDD contract had fewer test hours and ground test engines. During a series of continuing resolutions, some members of Congress questioned the status of the program due to the Administration's opposition to further funding for the alternate engine program. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act and FY2010 Omnibus set funding levels for military construction and base budget, with reductions for BRAC funding not requested in FY2011. The Office of Management and Budget Director assured funding on a pro-rata basis during the CR ending March 4, 2011. The alternate engine program was funded at FY2010 levels until March 24, 2011, when a stop-work order was issued. Secretary of Defense Gates testified about the program's cost and minimal taxpayer advantage. The Congress has allocated $1.8 billion for the program, with an estimated additional cost of $2.9 billion over the next five years. The need for a second engine is questioned as most customers will only buy one engine due to limited logistics and space. The F135 engine program is progressing well, completing 13,000 hours of testing out of 14,700, while the F136 engine has only completed 50 hours of testing. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley expressed concerns about the development problems the second engine may face. The Air Force is hesitant about investing in a second engine for the F-35 due to uncertainties about its development and cost effectiveness. General Norton Schwartz argues against an alternate engine, citing advancements in engine technology and the potential negative impact on the Air Force and Department of Defense if more engines lead to fewer F-35s. The Air Force is cautious about investing in a second engine for the F-35 due to uncertainties about its development and cost effectiveness. General Norton Schwartz argues against an alternate engine, highlighting advancements in engine technology and the potential negative impact on the Air Force and Department of Defense if more engines lead to fewer F-35s. General Schwartz also questions the need for an alternate engine, suggesting that the current single-engine airplanes like the F-22 and F-18E/F have proven reliability. Marine Corps Gen. James Cartwright questions the need for an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter, suggesting that the cost could be better spent on acquiring more Predators. Developing a second engine would require significant upfront investment for infrastructure and tooling, with uncertain returns in terms of lower prices through competition. The Administration considered terminating the alternative engine program in FY2010. The Administration believed the alternative engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter was no longer needed as a hedge against failure, citing high costs and minimal financial benefits. The Office of Management and Budget estimated over a billion dollars in near-term savings from canceling the program. GAO testified that competitive pressures could offset costs over the program's life, but continuing the alternate engine program would require an additional investment of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion. The GAO testified that continuing the JSF alternate engine program would require an additional investment of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, with potential savings of 9 to 11 percent. They highlighted the benefits of competition, citing the \"Great Engine War\" of the 1980s which resulted in significant cost savings and nonfinancial benefits such as better performance and increased reliability. Cost has been a significant issue in the alternate engine debate for the F135 engine. Proponents argue that a competitor is needed to control costs, while the Administration believes the benefits of a second engine do not outweigh its costs. In July 2009, Pratt & Whitney reported a 24% cost increase for the F135, prompting Secretary Gates to mention cost growth is expected for developmental aircraft. The Department of Defense created a Joint Assessment Team to investigate Pratt & Whitney's cost structure and production issues. The Joint Assessment Team (JAT) was tasked with understanding Pratt & Whitney's cost structure and production issues related to the F135 engine for the F-35 Lightning II program. A Pentagon study indicated that adding a second engine would cost the same as sticking to a single-source plan, supporting the decision to reject proposals for a competitive engine acquisition strategy. The JAT's charter included developing a plan to address F135 cost and affordability, but the Department of Defense has not provided access to the JAT results. The Pentagon memo explains that the development of the F136 engine has reduced costs, but still does not justify having two competing F-35 engine programs. Pratt & Whitney received $1 billion for additional engines and improvements, with a focus on the F135 engine for the F-35B. About $400 million is allocated for engine enhancements, with a third aimed at meeting original specifications and two-thirds going beyond. The Pentagon memo states that $400 million is designated for engine improvements, with a third aimed at meeting original specifications and two-thirds going beyond. Three independent cost analyses of the F-35 engine program were directed by Section 211 of the 2007 defense authorization act, with differing conclusions on the financial benefits of an alternate engine program. The studies highlighted non-financial benefits such as improvements in fleet readiness, contractor responsiveness, sustainment of the industrial base, and stronger international relations. The CAIG study examined the benefits of engine competition for various fighter programs, noting improvements in fleet readiness, contractor responsiveness, sustainment of the industrial base, and international relations. The study assumed favorable cost performance for a dual-source case, predicting a 5% immediate price decrease in engine procurement costs and a steeper reduction in production costs with competition. The CAIG study estimated that a 21.1% reduction in engine procurement costs would be needed for a break-even point in a potential F-35 engine competition. However, on a net-present-value basis, a 25.6% reduction would be required. The study suggested that DOD would need to compete engine operations and support contracts to achieve the necessary savings, but even then, it seemed skeptical that a 25.6% reduction could be attained. The report suggested that competing engine operations and support contracts could lead to a 25.6% savings by 2040, reaching a break-even point. Concerns were raised about achieving this level of savings even with competition. The CAIG study highlighted the need for engine thrust growth in the F-35 due to aircraft weight increases, particularly with Pratt & Whitney's F135 engine nearing its temperature limits. The IDA study examined engine competition in other fighter programs. The IDA study analyzed engine competition for the F-16 and F/A-18 programs, estimating a 11% to 18% savings with an F-35 engine competition. They found that an alternate engine program for the F-35 would require $8.8 billion in investment costs, with a 40% savings needed to break even. Competing engine O&S contracts could reduce this to 18%. The study noted the lack of historical data linking procurement and O&S costs in competitions. The study highlighted the potential savings of 18% if engine O&S contracts were competed. It emphasized the importance of contractor responsiveness in the Great Engine War and the need for an alternate engine to mitigate risks for the F-35 fleet. The GAO study indicated that a 10.3% to 12.3% procurement-cost savings would be necessary for the alternate engine program to break even, with past competitions showing savings of up to 20%. Overall, competing the engine was seen as a viable option to recoup investment costs. The study concluded that financial savings of up to 20% can be achieved through past engine competitions, with potential for recouping investment costs. The alternate engine program is expected to reach its break-even point by the late 2020s, despite marginal financial benefits. The size of the F-35 production run will impact the possibility of reaching a break-even point, influenced by U.S. and foreign governments' procurement decisions. The F-35 production run is influenced by U.S. and foreign governments' decisions on procurement numbers and engine choices. These decisions can change over time due to international security and budget fluctuations. Offers for fixed-price contracts for F135 and F136 engines have been made by Pratt & Whitney and GE/Rolls-Royce. Pratt & Whitney and GE/Rolls-Royce made fixed-price offers for F135 engines. A fixed-price contract for F135s was agreed upon for F-35s in Low Rate Initial Production Lot IV, with costs 16% lower than the previous lot. A Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2006 includes production of JSF Air Vehicle with F135 and F136 propulsion systems. The Air Force confirms the scope of work includes development of primary and alternate propulsion systems for the JSF. The Air Force confirms that the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) remains unchanged, with provisions for cooperative production and procurement of F135 and F136 propulsion systems. The Department will continue to fulfill its obligations under the MOUs, contingent on the availability of funds from the U.S. and partner nations. European countries, like the Netherlands, have firms involved in both F135 and F136 programs, as they secure more F-35-related contracts. European countries, including the UK, are concerned about the potential cancellation of the F136 engine for the F-35 program. The UK's Secretary of State for Defence supports the F136, citing long-term cost implications. Both F135 and F136 engines have faced development challenges, including failures during ground testing due to high-cycle fatigue. The F135 engine experienced failures during ground testing in 2007 and 2008 due to high-cycle fatigue, delaying the first flight of the F-35B aircraft. These engine malfunctions contributed to a reported cost overrun of up to $850 million. In 2009, an F135 engine was damaged due to a worn bushing, leading to a minor modification in production engines. The F136 engine also encountered three test incidents, including one where it ingested a test sensor. The F136 engine encountered three test incidents, including ingestion of a test sensor, impact damage to turbine blades, and damage to fan and compressor. Pratt & Whitney confirmed replacing a 'small number' of F135 engines due to a possible misassembly issue identified in a ground-test engine. Pratt & Whitney confirms that a 'small number' of F135 test and production engines have been replaced with spares since March due to a mis-assembly issue. In response to criticism about quality control deficiencies, Pratt & Whitney stated that only a few parts had a high scrap rate, with some parts achieving a 70 to 80 percent yield rate. Pratt & Whitney responded to quality control criticisms by stating that only a few parts had a high scrap rate, with some achieving a 70 to 80 percent yield rate. The company emphasized that the overall engine scrap rate was 97 percent, refuting claims of a 50 percent scrap rate. General Electric's F136 engine achieved 115% of required thrust in testing, while Pratt & Whitney planned to test a higher-thrust F135. The future of the alternate engine program, including funding sources and Congressional decisions, remains a key issue. The alternate engine program's funding sources, including potential impacts on other DOD programs, are a key concern for Congress. Money for the program has been drawn from various sources, such as existing F-35 program funds and additional DOD topline funds. The allocation of funds within the F-35 budget lines could affect other F-35 activities. Increasing the F-35 program topline without a corresponding increase in the DOD topline may require transferring funds from other defense programs to support the alternate engine program. Congress may need to decide on the future of the alternate engine program. The F-35 program may need to transfer funds from other defense programs to support increased alternate engine funding. Congress faces a decision on whether to continue the alternate engine program, which could impact the number of F-35s procured, cause delays, or reduce other defense capabilities. Additional funding of $2.9 billion over six years is needed to develop the F136 engine for competition. The $2.9 billion funding projection for developing the F136 engine does not have a detailed estimate and assumptions regarding competition's impact on cost are crucial. Competition is seen as a way to control cost growth and without it, contracts are negotiated based on past experience. The GAO and advocates argue that competition is essential to control cost growth in defense procurement. Without competition, contracts are based on past experience. Congress must weigh the risk of relying on a single engine for the F-35 fighter fleet, as a single engine failure could ground all aircraft. Previous incidents with engine issues in other aircraft fleets highlight the potential consequences of such a risk. The Marine Corps grounded 106 AV-8B Harriers in July 2000 due to a faulty engine bearing causing a crash. Engine issues accounted for 18% of Navy groundings from 1997 to 2006. The Air Force grounded two fleets between 1990 and 2006 for engine issues. DOD argues that terminating the F136 alternate engine program poses little operational risk, citing advancements in technology for early detection of engine failures. The Navy and Air Force have concerns about using multiple engines due to limited facilities and logistical issues. Admiral Gary Roughead prefers one engine for carriers, while Air Force Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz sees the alternate engine as problematic for the Air Force. Despite advancements in technology for early detection of engine failures, the termination of the F136 alternate engine program is argued to pose little operational risk. The Air Force has experience with multiple engine types for single-airframe fleets, like the F-16 and F-15. Congress may need to decide on using multiple engines for the F-35 or just one. The debate includes whether to pay General Electric $3 billion to compete with Pratt & Whitney. General Electric's ability to compete for future fighter aircraft engines could be affected if the F136 engine is terminated. General Electric has a significant share of the commercial aircraft engine market and also works on military engines. A study noted that General Electric produced more commercial engines than Pratt & Whitney in 2007. The company derives 15% of its business from military engines, while Pratt & Whitney derives 50%. There are concerns about General Electric's ability to design fighter engines if the F136 program is terminated, as some military jet engineers may not be able to transfer their skills to commercial engines. The termination of the F136 program could impact General Electric's ability to design fighter engines and compete for military engine contracts. It may also reduce the number of suppliers for F-35 engine spare parts, increasing vulnerability to disruptions. Maintaining competition between F135 and F136 could create uncertainty for suppliers and reduce workload for individual F135 suppliers. Multiple vendors could potentially create parts for each engine. The 2007 IDA study found that having multiple vendors for F136 engines could strengthen the U.S. industrial base. It raised concerns about relying solely on a firm with limited commercial presence for fighter engine production. The study also concluded that terminating the F136 program would not cause suppliers to exit the domestic industrial base. The IDA study found that having multiple vendors for F136 engines could strengthen the U.S. industrial base. Competition between General Electric and Pratt & Whitney improved engine development. Congress may consider non-monetary value of competition. H.R. 1540 includes language on competitive procurement for F-35's engine. The competitive procurement language in H.R. 1540 limits funds for performance improvements to the F-35 Lightning II aircraft's propulsion system unless there is competitive development and production. Performance improvement is defined as increasing fan or core engine airflow volume or maximum thrust for better takeoff performance. The Secretary of Defense is required to develop a plan for preserving and storing property related to the F136 propulsion system, ensuring it can be restarted after a period of idleness and allowing for long-term sustainment and repair. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan to preserve and store property related to the F136 propulsion system, allowing for restart, sustainment, and repair. This includes identifying costs for restarting development, providing support for research activities by contractors, and prohibiting disposal of the property. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit a report on the plan to preserve property related to the F136 propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft program. The committee supports the contractor's efforts to continue development and testing of the system despite the program cancellation, emphasizing the importance of competition for better engine performance in the Joint Strike Fighter program. The Department of Defense plans to cancel the F136 program, but the committee believes competition is crucial for the success of the Joint Strike Fighter program. The Administration opposes limiting funds for F-35 propulsion system improvements without competitive development. This could lead to extra costs and destabilize the program. The Administration opposes funding for the F136 engine program, citing extra costs and destabilization of the F-35 program. They also object to a requirement to store and preserve property from the terminated program, which would add significant costs. The Senate passed a bill prohibiting funds for the F136 engine. The Senate passed S. 1867, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which includes language prohibiting funds for the F136 engine. The bill also addresses the preservation and storage of property related to the F136 propulsion system. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 includes language on the preservation and storage of property related to the F136 propulsion system. The Secretary of Defense must develop a plan for the disposition of government-owned property acquired under the F136 contract, ensuring long-term sustainment, repair, and potential future use within defense programs. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan for the disposition of government-owned property related to the F136 propulsion system. This plan must identify necessary contract modifications, additional facilities, or funding. No funds can be used for destroying or disposing of the property until a report is submitted to the congressional defense committees. The report must detail how to maximize the government's investment in the F136. The report on the plan for the F136 propulsion system must describe how to maximize the government's investment. The 2012 Department of Defense Appropriations Act did not include funds for the F-35 alternate engine. The legislative history appendix covers FY1996-FY2010. The legislative history appendix covers details of the F-35 alternate engine program from FY1996-FY2010, focusing on final bill language and reports. In FY1996, funds were authorized for the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program, including $7 million for competitive engine concepts. Section 213 of the FY1996 legislation allocated $7 million for competitive engine concepts in the JAST program. The Senate report raised concerns about the program's ability to meet service needs and directed the inclusion of two propulsion concepts to reduce risk. The conferees emphasized the importance of engine competition in the program and directed the Under Secretary of Defense to ensure adequate competition. The conferees directed the Under Secretary of Defense to ensure engine competition in the JAST program and scale of demonstrator aircraft align with program goals. They recommended authorization of funds for competitive engine concepts and emphasized the importance of reducing risk through competitive propulsion programs. The FY1996 defense authorization bill emphasized the importance of competitive propulsion programs in the JAST program to reduce risk and achieve more affordable life cycle costs. The House Appropriations Committee report highlighted the challenges in developing new fighter engine propulsion plants and the dissatisfaction with early model engines. The Navy and Air Force have faced engine performance issues with early model fighter aircraft. The Air Force spent over a billion dollars to introduce competition between engine manufacturers for future aircraft. The F-22's new engine is undergoing redesign due to technical problems. The JAST program aims to create a common aircraft for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, but selecting a single unproven engine design is deemed unwise by the Committee. They believe competition in engine manufacturing is essential for cost-effectiveness. The Committee believes it is crucial for the JAST program to actively pursue an engine design from a second manufacturer to ensure cost-effectiveness and competition in engine manufacturing. Additional funds have been allocated for this purpose in the FY1997 Defense Authorization Act and DOD Appropriation Act. The DOD Appropriation Act (H.R. 3610 / P.L. 104-208) included funding for the JAST program, with a recommendation to accelerate development of an alternate engine. The FY1998 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1119 / P.L. 105-85) required a report on the production and fielding sequence of the joint strike fighter variants. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress on the production and fielding sequence of joint strike fighter variants, including funding for an alternate engine development program. The House Armed Services Committee expressed concerns about insufficient funding for the alternative fighter engine and directed the Secretary of Defense to provide a report to Congressional defense committees. The committee directs the Secretary of Defense to provide a report detailing funding for full development and flight testing of the AFE for the JSF program. The Senate Armed Services Committee recommends an increase in the budget request to accelerate the alternative engine program. The committee recommends an increase in the budget request of $28.0 million to accelerate the alternative engine program for the JSF program, with funding provided in fiscal year 1999 and beyond. The Senate Armed Services Committee report discussed the JSF program and the certification of a funded program for an alternate engine. The committee recommends an increase of $15.0 million to accelerate the development of an alternative engine for the JSF program. The House Armed Services Committee report on the JSF program expressed support for the development of an alternate engine. The House Armed Services Committee report expressed strong support for the development of an alternate engine for the JSF program to ensure sustainment of critical industrial base capabilities, control engine cost growth, and reduce risk to the planned fleet of 3,000 JSF aircraft. The committee recommended an increase in funding to accelerate the development of the alternative engine. The committee recommends increasing funding for the development of an alternate engine for the JSF program to reduce backlog and prioritize new engine development. The Senate Armed Services Committee supports this recommendation and directs an increase in funding for JSF to be used solely for accelerating alternate engine development. The committee recommended increasing funding for the development of an alternate engine for the JSF program to reduce backlog and prioritize new engine development. The budget request included $476.6 million for continued development of the joint strike fighter, with $33.0 million allocated for the alternate engine program. The committee remains concerned about the viability of the alternate engine and recommends an additional $15.0 million to reduce risk and accelerate development. The conferees expressed concerns about additional contractor funding required for the JSF program and opposed industry making unreimbursed investments beyond existing agreements. They emphasized the need for additional DEMVAL funding to execute projects on an extended schedule and expect risk mitigation projects, including the alternate engine, to be funded as requested. The House Armed Services Committee is reviewing the \"winner take all\" strategy for the JSF program to address aircraft industrial base concerns. The committee report on H.R. 4205 discussed the JSF program and supported the continuation of the JSF alternate engine program to ensure the health of the fighter aircraft engine industrial base. They recommended measures to accelerate the development of the alternate engine to reduce risk to JSF production and aircraft fielding. The Committee supports accelerating the development of the alternate engine for the JSF program to reduce risk to production and fielding. They recommend funding allocations to ensure completion of configuration compatibility for the JSF airframe. The Senate Appropriations Committee and the FY2002 Defense Authorization Act also express support for the Alternate Engine Program without impacting the current schedule or diverting funds. The FY2002 Defense Authorization Act supports the JSF program's alternate engine development to reduce technical risks without affecting the current AEP schedule or diverting funds. The House Armed Services Committee report highlights the need for funding to mitigate development schedule risks for the alternate engine common hardware components. The committee recommends increased funding of $779.5 million in PE 64800F to reduce development schedule risk of the common hardware components for the JSF program's alternate engine. The JSF joint program office encourages two engine manufacturers to collaborate on developing interchangeable propulsion systems while preserving proprietary interests. The committee recommends increased funding of $779.5 million in PE 64800F to reduce development schedule risk of the common hardware components for the JSF program's alternate engine. Additionally, the FY2003 DOD Appropriations Act allocated an additional $29,750,000 for the Joint Strike Fighter Interchangeable Engine Program to maintain two competing engine programs. The FY2004 Defense Authorization Act recommended $56 million in additional funding for the JSF program, emphasizing the need for competitive procurement of the interchangeable engine. The committee recommends increased funding for the JSF program, including $56 million for the interchangeable engine development. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concern about a reduction in funding for the F136 Interchangeable Engine. The companion bill to H.R. 2658 discussed the JSF program, expressing dismay over a $56 million reduction in funding for the F136 Interchangeable Engine in fiscal year 2004. The Committee recommends restoring the cut to the engine program and adding $20 million for risk reduction. The Committee recommends restoring the $56 million reduction in funding for the F136 Interchangeable Engine program and adding $20 million for risk reduction. Congress mandated funding for an alternate engine program to maintain competition for the JSF program. The JSF Joint Program Office is working on interchangeable engines and plans to compete for engine common hardware and turbomachinery. The House Armed Services Committee report discussed efforts to maintain funding for the JSF competitive engine development program, emphasizing the importance of a two-engine source for the single-engine JSF. The FY2007 Defense Authorization Act also highlighted the acquisition of competitive engines for the JSF program. The Navy and the Department of the Air Force are committed to developing competitive engines for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program. The FY2007 Defense Authorization Act emphasizes the acquisition of two interchangeable propulsion systems for the JSF by two separate contractors throughout the aircraft's life cycle. The FY2007 Defense Authorization Act requires two interchangeable propulsion systems for the Joint Strike Fighter program, with modifications allowed under certain conditions. Independent cost analyses of the JSF engine program are mandated to be conducted by various entities. The FY2007 Defense Authorization Act mandates independent cost analyses of The FY2007 Defense Authorization Act mandates independent cost analyses of funded research and development centers. The centers must submit reports to congressional defense committees detailing key assumptions, methodologies, life-cycle costs, manpower estimates, engine maturity projections, and benefits of competition. Acquisition strategies are also described in the reports. The report mandated by the FY2007 Defense Authorization Act requires an assessment of benefits provided by competition, acquisition strategies used in past engine programs for tactical fighter aircraft, a comparison of sole-source vs competitive programs, the impact of canceling the F136 competitive engine, and conclusions/recommendations. The report mandated by the FY2007 Defense Authorization Act requires an assessment of benefits provided by competition, acquisition strategies used in past engine programs for tactical fighter aircraft, a comparison of sole-source vs competitive programs, the impact of canceling the F136 competitive engine, and conclusions/recommendations. The Comptroller General and the chief executive officer of the federally funded research and development center must certify if the Secretary of Defense provided sufficient information for informed judgments in the report. The term ''lifecycle costs'' includes elements for a life-cycle cost analysis for a major defense acquisition program, such as procurement of engines, spare engines, and engine components. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 5122 discussed the JSF program. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 5122 discussed the JSF program, specifically mentioning the lack of funds for research on a second aircraft tire source and an alternate JSF engine. The report also highlighted the development of the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine for the JSF. The committee expressed disappointment that the budget did not include funds for an alternate JSF engine beyond fiscal year 2006. The Department of Defense's analysis focused on potential savings for engine acquisition without fully examining other potential savings. The committee recommended an increase of $408.0 million to continue the JSF alternate engine program for fiscal year 2007, emphasizing the need for competition to analyze potential costs and savings over the engine's lifecycle. Additionally, a provision was recommended to obligate funds for the development of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter. The committee recommended an increase of $408.0 million for the JSF alternate engine program in fiscal year 2007. A provision was also suggested to obligate funds for the development of an alternate engine for the Joint Strike Fighter, with independent analyses required by March 15, 2007. The committee supported the Department's transformational activities by authorizing funds for the construction of eight ships totaling $12.1 billion, promoting joint development of unmanned systems, adding funds for the Joint Strike Fighter engine, and increasing funding for science and technology programs. Emphasizing the importance of coalition operations, the committee previously addressed concerns about engine competition in the Joint Strike Fighter program. The committee supported the development of two competitive propulsion systems for the Joint Strike Fighter program, adding $400.8 million for the F136 engine in fiscal year 2007. They emphasized the need to avoid relying on a single engine provider for operational and financial reasons. The report recommended continuing the Joint Strike Fighter program with two competitive propulsion systems or a single firm-fixed-price contract for one system. Congress previously directed the development of an engine to compete with Pratt & Whitney due to engine problems in the 1970s and 1980s. The Department of Defense was directed by Congress to develop an engine to compete with Pratt & Whitney engines for F-14, F-15, and F-16 aircraft due to persistent engine problems. This competition resulted in improved performance, reduced risk, increased readiness, and over $4.0 billion in cost savings. Congress has consistently supported engine competition for the Joint Strike Fighter program for the past 10 years, with concerns about lack of competition. The JSF program is the largest acquisition program in Department of Defense history, with potential for over 4,000 aircraft deliveries worldwide. The committee is concerned about relying on a sole engine supplier for the JSF program, citing operational and financial risks. They believe that a competitive engine strategy could result in significant cost savings over the aircraft's life cycle. The committee recommends a provision for independent life cycle cost analyses of the Joint Strike Fighter program with two competitive propulsion systems to generate savings and mitigate risks associated with relying on a sole engine supplier. The committee recommends an independent life cycle cost analysis of the Joint Strike Fighter program with two competitive propulsion systems to reduce operational risk and achieve more affordable life cycle costs. The committee recommends funding for the development of the F136 interchangeable engine for the Joint Strike Fighter program to reduce operational risk and achieve more affordable life cycle costs.

Section 242 of the FY2010 Defense Authorization Act requires the Secretary of Defense to include in the annual budget request and future-years defense program sufficient amounts for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II. The Secretary of Defense is required to request funding for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II in the annual budget and future-years defense program. Additionally, funds must be obligated and expended for the continued development and procurement of two options for the propulsion system to ensure competitive production. The House report emphasizes the need for competitive funding for the F-35 program, specifically for the development of the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. This funding is crucial for ensuring competitive production and development of the propulsion system. The committee recommended increases for the F-35 competitive propulsion system, despite the Department of Defense not complying with the requirement to include funds for this purpose in the budget request. The F135 engine development program for the F-35 has experienced significant cost growth since its inception in 2002, with development costs increasing by 38% to $6.7 billion by 2008. The F135 engine procurement costs have also risen by 38-43% for the F-35C and F-35A variants, and by 47% for the F-35B due to both the engine and lift fan. In contrast, the F136 engine program has not seen any cost growth. The F135 engine development program for the F-35 has seen significant cost growth since 2002, with procurement costs increasing by 38-43% for the F-35C and F-35A, and by 47% for the F-35B due to the engine and lift fan. In contrast, the F136 engine program has not experienced any cost growth. The committee questions the Department's decision not to include a competitive propulsion system program in its budget requests, citing F135 cost growth and test failures. The committee recommends a total increase of $463.0 million for the competitive F-35 propulsion system program and an aggregate increase of $140.0 million for the procurement of four F136 engines and related components. The Administration strongly objects to the additional $603 million for the F-35 program. The Administration strongly objects to the $603 million addition for the F-35 program, specifically for the development and procurement of the alternative engine program. They argue that the current engine is performing well and that funding a second engine is unnecessary and will delay the fielding of the Joint Strike Fighter capability. The Air Force operates several fleets with single engines, minimizing risks of fleet-wide grounding. The Administration opposes limiting JSF development funding until all funds for the alternative engine program are obligated. Any bill disrupting the F-35 program may face a presidential veto. The FY2010 defense authorization bill recommends increased funding for the F-35 program, including the F136 alternate engine. The FY2010 defense authorization bill recommends increased funding for the F-35 program, including the F136 alternate engine.

The committee recommends funding for the F136 competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in fiscal year 2010 to ensure system development and demonstration. The budget request included funds for the JSF program but not for the SDD phase of the F136 program. The committee believes in continuing the F136 program based on studies by the Department of Defense and other organizations. The committee recommends an increase of $438.9 million for continuing the F136 SDD phase of the JSF program, citing non-financial benefits such as better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, and increased operational readiness. The committee recommends a $438.9 million increase for the F136 SDD phase of the JSF program, supported by non-financial factors. The recommendation was approved in full-committee markup with a vote of 12-10. The Administration strongly objects to this additional funding for the alternative engine program. The Administration strongly opposes the $438.9 million increase for the alternative engine program in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program. They argue that the current engine is performing well and that the risks of a single engine provider are manageable. The Administration also objects to the limit on overall JSF development funding until a certification is submitted for the alternative engine program. If the final bill disrupts the F-35 program, a veto may be recommended. The Senate rejected an amendment to preserve additional funding for the alternative engine program in the F-35 program. Instead, they adopted an amendment to remove the research and development funding for the alternate engine program and require certifications for cost-effectiveness before any funding can be used.

Additionally, offsets are made by decreasing funding for the Navy and Air Force F136 development. The Air Force's test and evaluation budget is reduced by $219.45 million, with the decrease coming from funds for the Joint Strike Fighter F136 development. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Bill (H.R. 3326) was passed into law on December 19, 2009, providing $2,083.8 million for Air Force F-35 procurement, including $35 million for the F-35 alternate engine program. The explanatory statement allocated $2,083.8 million for Air Force F-35 procurement, including $35 million for the F-35 alternate engine program. Additional funds were designated for the Joint Strike Fighter program, with concerns raised about its progress and cost. The Department of Defense established a Joint Estimating Team (JET) to evaluate the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, reporting cost growth and schedule issues. Despite this, the Department insists the program is on track. The JSF procurement program is allocated $6,840,478,000, with a directive to procure all 30 aircraft as requested. The findings of the JET and causes of cost growth are to be provided to congressional defense committees by January 15, 2010. The House Appropriations Committee recommends increasing funding for the F-35 program, including $18.6 million for Air Force procurement and $215 million each for Navy and Air Force research and development for the alternate engine. They oppose terminating programs prematurely and support realistic budgeting matching available funding to programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommends increasing funding for the F-35 program, including $18.6 million for Air Force procurement and $215 million each for Navy and Air Force research and development for the alternate engine. They oppose terminating programs prematurely and support realistic budgeting matching available funding to programs. The Committee believes that continuing certain efforts, such as the presidential helicopter and Joint Strike Fighter alternative engine, may yield significant payback. The F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter program plans to procure over 2,500 stealthy aircraft with a single propulsion engine for all variants. Concerns arise about potential technical issues grounding the entire fleet, limiting flexibility in times of crisis. Lack of competition in the engine program is also a worry for the Committee. The Committee is concerned about the lack of competition in the Joint Strike Fighter engine program, which could limit flexibility in times of crisis. Despite a business case analysis showing cost parity between a sole source and dual source strategy, the Committee recommends an additional $430,000,000 for the continued development of an alternate engine program. The Committee recommends an additional $430,000,000 for the continued development of the alternate engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter, making it the most cost-effective method moving forward. The Secretary of Defense is directed to include funding for the alternate engine program in future budget requests. The Administration strongly objects to the additional funding, stating that expenditures on an alternate engine are unnecessary and divert resources from the overall JSF program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends no funding for the F-35 alternate engine development, as it is deemed unnecessary and diverts resources from the overall JSF program. The current engine is performing well, and risks associated with a single engine provider are manageable. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act included $485 million for the development of an alternate F-35 engine, with a provision limiting DOD spending until all alternate engine funds are obligated. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act included language limiting DOD spending on the F-35 program until all alternate engine funds are obligated. This provision also sets criteria for DOD to acquire more than 30 F-35 aircraft. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act limits DOD spending on the F-35 program until all alternate engine funds are obligated. The Act also requires certifications before acquiring more than 30 F-35 aircraft. The FY2011 Defense Authorization Act limits DOD spending on the F-35 program until all alternate engine funds are obligated. It also requires certifications before acquiring more than 30 F-35 aircraft. H.R. 5136 mandates the inclusion of alternate engine funding in DOD's annual budget submission for the continued development and procurement of competitive propulsion systems for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft. The Secretary of Defense must request funding for the development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in the annual defense budget. This funding must also be included in future-years defense programs to ensure continued development and procurement of the propulsion system. Additionally, funds for research, development, test, and evaluation for the F-35 program must be obligated and expended as required. The Secretary of Defense must ensure funding for the development and procurement of two options for the propulsion system for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in each fiscal year to support competitive production. This includes obligating and expending funds for research, development, test, and evaluation for the F-35 program. The Secretary of Defense must secure funding for competitive propulsion systems for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft each fiscal year. H.R. 5136 designates the F-35 engine programs as major subprograms, increasing oversight and reporting requirements. The F-35 engine programs, including the F135 and F136, are designated as major subprograms under H.R. 5136, increasing oversight and reporting requirements. The Secretary of Defense must secure funding for competitive propulsion systems for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft each fiscal year. In 2010, reassessment and actions for F135 and F136 engine programs must meet requirements of section 2433a of title 10, US Code for designated major subprograms. Actions taken must comply with limitations and not meet requirements if program costs increase by critical threshold post-enactment. The report accompanying H.R. 5136 includes language on the F-35 alternate engine program, with a budget request for development and procurement of F-35 aircraft. The competitive F-35 propulsion system program is developing the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. The committee has recommended increases for the competitive propulsion system for the past four years. The committee has recommended increases for the F-35 competitive propulsion system, developing the F136 engine as an alternative to the F135 engine. Despite Congress appropriating funds for this purpose, the Department of Defense has not included funds for the competitive propulsion system in the budget request for the fifth consecutive year. The committee noted cost increases in the F135 development program and procurement between 2005 and 2008. In 2010, the committee highlighted cost increases in the F135 engine development program and procurement between 2005 and 2008. The Government Accountability Office reported a 50% increase in F135 engine development costs, with negotiated prices for F-35 engines exceeding budget estimates. The Under Secretary of Defense directed a review of the F135 cost structure, which concluded that improvement plans by the engine contractor were credible but challenging. The committee noted that additional investment by the engine contractor would be needed for cost reduction initiatives in the F136 engine development program. The report highlighted the need for $2.9 billion over six years to finish the engine development and prepare for competitive procurement of F-35 engines in 2017. Despite the long-term costs being the same for a one-engine or two-engine competitive acquisition strategy, the committee questioned the Department's decision to not include a competitive F-35 engine program in its budget requests. The committee questions the Department's decision to exclude an F-35 competitive propulsion system program from its budget requests over the past five years. They recommend a $485.0 million increase for the competitive engine program. The F-35 Joint Program Office and contractor have not met cost and schedule expectations, leading to additional reviews of the program. The F-35 program faced challenges with cost and schedule estimates, leading to additional reviews by the JET 2 and IMRT. Recommendations include procuring an additional test aircraft, adjusting production rates, and increasing budget for development. These actions are projected to delay completion by 13 months and cost $2.8 billion more. The Secretary of the Air Force informed the committee about the F-35 program exceeding cost thresholds by more than 50% compared to the original estimate. The program faces challenges with unprecedented concurrency of development, test, and production activities. Late delivery of test aircraft and failure to adjust to reality are primary issues highlighted in recent testimonies. The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation highlighted issues with the Joint Strike Fighter program, including late delivery of test aircraft and unrealistic system development plans. The Department of Defense plans to procure 307 aircraft at a cost of $58.2 billion before completing developmental flight testing by mid-fiscal year 2015. Despite findings and concurrency challenges, the request for 43 F-35 aircraft for fiscal year 2011 remains unchanged from projections in fiscal year 2009. The committee remains concerned about the F-35 program despite recent reductions in aircraft numbers. They recommend authorizing 42 aircraft for fiscal year 2011 and suggest further reductions until developmental testing is complete. The Department of Defense is urged to meet certain milestones before proceeding with production. The committee recommends authorizing 42 aircraft for fiscal year 2011, subject to completion of certain milestones by the Department. The Under Secretary of Defense and Director of Operational Test and Evaluation must certify milestones before procurement of more than 30 F-35 aircraft. Administration opposes additional funding for the extra engine program and legislative provisions limiting JSF development funding. The funds for FY 2011 have been obligated for the extra engine program, requiring sufficient funding to continue the program. The Department does not believe the cost will ever be recovered or that funds should be diverted from important defense needs. The current engine is performing well, with over 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours. If the final bill includes funding for the extra engine program, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto. A certification requirement is included before further funding for the alternate engine. The report recommends a provision for certification before spending additional funds on the F136 engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The Secretary of Defense must certify that the alternate propulsion system will reduce costs, improve fleet readiness, and not disrupt the program or result in fewer aircraft procurement. H.R. 6523 did not include program-level detail. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2011, H.R. 6523, did not specify funding for the F-35 alternate engine. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees issued a joint explanatory statement designating an F-35 engine development and production subprogram as a major subprogram of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft major defense acquisition program. The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2011 did not allocate funds for the F-35 alternate engine. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees designated an F-35 engine development and production subprogram as a major subprogram of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft major defense acquisition program, using the Milestone B decision as the original baseline. Actions following critical cost growth are outlined, including potential restructuring of the program. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act outlined actions to meet requirements for major subprograms designated under subsection (a) of section 2433a of title 10, United States Code. Actions taken must prevent program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost from increasing by a percentage equal to or greater than the critical cost growth threshold. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act included $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine program, with funds added by a vote of 11-5. The Senate version did not allocate funds for the program, but the House and Senate passed a continuing resolution maintaining FY2010 spending levels until March 24, 2011, when a stop-work order was issued. The FY2011 Defense Appropriations Act allocated $450 million for the F-35 alternate engine program, but a stop-work order was issued on March 24, 2011. The House approved an amendment to eliminate funding for the program in February 2011. The FY2011 DOD and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act signed into law on April 15, 2011, did not include funds for the F-35 alternate engine program. Congress's interest in the program may have been influenced by the \"Great Engine War\" between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric from 1984 to 1994. Between 1984 and 1994, Pratt & Whitney and General Electric competed to produce and maintain engines for Air Force F-16 fighters. Pratt & Whitney's F100 engine was originally developed for the F-15, while General Electric's F110 was an alternate engine for the F-16. The Air Force's interest in an alternate engine stemmed from frustrations with Pratt & Whitney in the 1970s. Congress funded General Electric's F110 development through the Engine Model Derivative Program. The competition between the F100 and F110 was unprecedented and controversial, leading to improvements in both engines. The competition between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric to produce and maintain engines for Air Force F-16 fighters led to improvements in both engines. Annual competitions for engine procurement were controversial but believed to produce better engines at better terms. Contractor responsiveness was seen as the primary benefit of the competition, generating benefits for the DOD in terms of contract terms, warranties, and support stability. The Great Engine War resulted in benefits such as early engine improvements offered by the incumbent (Pratt & Whitney) to the Air Force. The Great Engine War led to improvements in engine competition management, with contractors providing cost projections for six years before the first contract award. This was a significant change from previous practices, where firm-fixed price contracts were negotiated only after engines had been in operation for several years. This shift helped prevent disruptions in production and protected against price gouging. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter due to uncertainty in the program's development and production schedules. This decision was made to protect against potential disruptions in production and price gouging, with contractors now required to provide cost projections for future contracts. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team decided to discontinue self-funded development of the F136 engine for the Joint Strike Fighter due to uncertain circumstances impacting the program's potential benefits. Despite being almost 80 percent complete, the U.S. Department of Defense terminated the program in April. The FET had offered to self-fund development through fiscal year 2012 but will now end its work, fulfilling termination responsibilities with the government. The F136 program had achieved significant testing milestones and received high marks for cost and schedule performance. The F136 program, led by GE and Rolls-Royce, underwent over 1,200 hours of testing since early 2009. The FET consistently met cost and schedule goals, earning high marks from the DoD. GE and Rolls-Royce advocated for defense acquisition reform and offered competitive fixed-price proposals for F136 production engines for the JSF program. They expressed gratitude to Congressional supporters and military experts for backing competition in defense acquisition reform."
