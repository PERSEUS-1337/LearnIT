    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Honoring Promises to Service-Disabled Veterans Act of 2011\". Congress acknowledges the slow progress in meeting the Government-wide goal for service-disabled veterans and emphasizes the obligation of federal agencies and prime contractors to comply with the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999. The public has a right to know if the goal is being met. SEC. 3. Transparency in contracting goals for small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. Section 15 of the Small Business Act is amended to include transparency in contracting goals for small businesses owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. Executive departments are required to submit reports to the Administrator regarding the percentage of prime contracts awarded to these small businesses. The Executive department must report on prime contracts awarded to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans, including contractor names, subcontractor utilization goals, and subcontract values. The report must include the percentage of subcontracts awarded to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans, the negotiated subcontractor utilization goal, and the percentage of subcontracts awarded to these small businesses for completed contracts. The report must include the percentage of subcontracts awarded to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans, the negotiated subcontractor utilization goal, and rankings of Executive departments based on the percentage of contracts awarded to these small businesses. The Administrator is required to publish a report on a website containing information submitted by covered contractors regarding subcontracts awarded to small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. This report also includes rankings made by the Administrator based on these subcontract awards. Publication may be exempted for national security reasons. The Administrator must update a website quarterly with subcontracting information from covered contractors, including rankings. Reports to Congress on Executive departments' progress towards meeting contracting goals are also required annually. Each report under this paragraph shall include a statement on the website's latest data and a recommendation for a prime contractor recognized by Congress for outstanding progress in contracting with small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans."
