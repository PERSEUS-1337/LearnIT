It oversees the transfer of radio frequencies to the commercial sector, with proceeds going to the U.S. Treasury. In 2013, the NTIA focused on supporting the innovation economy and promoting broadband infrastructure deployment. The NTIA is focused on supporting the innovation economy by promoting broadband infrastructure deployment and advocating for more spectrum for wireless technologies. This includes identifying spectrum for commercial wireless use, administering grants programs like BTOP, and ensuring efficient use of federal spectrum. The NTIA is administering grants programs like BTOP and starting a $135 million grant program to help states plan for a new public safety broadband network. FirstNet, funded through the Public Safety Trust Fund, has access to $2 billion from the U.S. Treasury and expects $5 billion more from auction revenues. The President's budget request for the NTIA for FY2014 was $52.1 million. The NTIA's budget for FY2014 includes $52.1 million for salaries and expenses. In FY2010, the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP) represented half of the NTIA's budget appropriations. The total enacted budget appropriations for the NTIA increased by 4% in FY2011 to $41.6 million. Funding for the PTFP was transferred to administrative expenses and salaries. The increase in funding for salaries and expenses in FY2011 was largely due to costs associated with broadband deployment. Requests for funding to administer grant programs totaled $32.3 million in FY2012. The NTIA's budget for FY2014 includes $52.1 million for salaries and expenses. Funding requests for broadband grant programs totaled $32.3 million in FY2012, with $25.8 million designated for FY2013 and $24.7 million for FY2014. Reimbursable funding for FY2014 is estimated at $37.5 million, with $28.9 million from spectrum management fees. The budget request also includes $7.5 million for a new spectrum monitoring system program. The NTIA's budget for FY2014 includes $7.5 million and staff increases for a new program to develop a spectrum monitoring system and assess technologies for sharing radio frequency spectrum. Funding of $1.25 million and five FTEs are requested for the Office of Spectrum Management for Wireless Broadband Access. Total FTEs for both directly funded and reimbursable programs is estimated at 309 FTEs, compared to 302 FTEs for FY2013 and 257 FTEs in FY2012. The NTIA fulfills many responsibilities for different constituencies, often working in consultation with the FCC on spectrum management. The NTIA collaborates with the FCC, Department of State, and other agencies on spectrum management and Internet policy. They work with NIST, FCC, and DHS to provide guidance on grants for building wireless broadband networks. The NTIA collaborates with various agencies to provide expertise and guidance for grants to build new wireless networks for broadband communications. The Office of Spectrum Management formulates plans to ensure effective spectrum use nationally and internationally, including addressing federal government spectrum requirements and handling frequency assignments for federal agencies. The Office of Policy Analysis and Development supports the NTIA's role as adviser on telecommunications and information policy. The NTIA consists of different divisions such as the Office of Policy Analysis and Development (OPAD), Office of International Affairs (OIA), Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS), and Office of Telecommunications and Information Applications (OTIA) that support various aspects of telecommunications and information policies, research, technical support, and international competitiveness. The Office of Telecommunications and Information Applications (OTIA) focuses on telecommunications and information infrastructure development, domestic competition, U.S. telecommunications trade opportunities, and efficient use of the radio spectrum. It administers grant programs to deploy technology and support national priorities. The Public Telecommunications Facilities Program was terminated in FY2011, and the Office of Public Safety Communications was created in 2012 to administer provisions of the Spectrum Act. The budget categories include Domestic and International Policies, Spectrum Management, Telecommunication Sciences Research, and Broadband Programs. The Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP) received $20 million in FY2010 for broadcast and non-broadcast projects. Grants were used for equipment replacement, expanding services to underserved communities, and converting analog to digital broadcasting for public television and radio stations. These grants supported the Public Broadcasting Service's role in the Emergency Alert system and Wireless Emergency Alerts. The Spectrum Act of 2012, also known as the Public Safety and Spectrum Act, allocated more spectrum for commercial services and established the NTIA's role in supporting FirstNet. The NTIA manages the Public Safety Trust Fund and oversees the State and Local Implementation Fund grant process through the Office of Public Safety Communications. The NTIA has established an Office of Public Safety Communications to oversee the State and Local Implementation Fund grant process for FirstNet. FirstNet operates autonomously with the power to select its manager and other personnel. However, the NTIA may be overstepping its role by setting its own requirements for FirstNet's operations, potentially hindering long-term planning and investments. The act re-establishes the federal 9-1-1 Implementation Coordination Office (ICO) to plan for next-generation systems and administer a grant program. The ICO will provide matching grants for improvements in 911 emergency services, funded by auction revenue after a certain threshold. It will report on costs and specifications for NG 9-1-1 services in consultation with NHTSA and DHS. The ICO, in consultation with NHTSA and DHS, is to report on costs and specifications for NG 9-1-1 services. NTIA ensures that auction revenues for the Public Safety Trust Fund are placed in the Network Construction Fund for FirstNet expenditures. The fund is also used for grants to states for building radio access network links to FirstNet. The FY2014 budget estimates $1.908 billion in the Trust Fund, with $257 million designated for the Network Construction Fund. The Safety Trust Fund allocates $1.902 billion for purchases from government accounts. $257 million is designated for the Network Construction Fund in FY2014. A State and Local Implementation Fund was established, providing grants for planning, consultation, and education activities. NTIA reported $300,000 in administrative costs for FY2012. Grants totaling over $116 million were awarded to states and territories in FY2013, including projects for broadband communications for public safety. Funding for these projects was partly suspended after the Spectrum Act passage to align with FirstNet's plans for a nationwide network. After the Spectrum Act passage, funding for public safety projects was partly suspended to align with FirstNet's nationwide network plans. FirstNet was granted the national license for public safety broadband, requiring separate lease agreements for spectrum access. Negotiations on leasing agreements began in February 2013, with agreements reached with four BTOP grant recipients. The Spectrum Act updated procedures for reallocating spectrum from federal to commercial use, requiring collaboration between NTIA and FCC to identify bands for release. It also addressed spectrum repurposing through auction or sharing, defining compensation for reassignment. Spectrum sharing for transitioning to commercial use is supported in the act's provisions. The Spectrum Act updated procedures for reallocating spectrum from federal to commercial use, emphasizing collaboration between NTIA and FCC. It requires spectrum to be repurposed through auction or sharing, with compensation defined for reassignment. The act supports spectrum sharing for transitioning to commercial use, with a Technical Panel established within NTIA to review federal agency transition plans. Members of the panel must be qualified as radio engineers or technical experts, appointed by key officials. Provisions regarding the panel and dispute resolution have been published by NTIA as part of the rulemaking process. The Administration and Congress have taken steps to increase the amount of radio frequency spectrum available. The NTIA has published provisions regarding the technical panel and procedural requirements for reallocating spectrum from federal to commercial use. The Administration and Congress aim to increase spectrum capacity for mobile services like Internet access, with proposals including clearing federal frequencies for commercial use, sharing federal frequencies, improving spectrum efficiency, and utilizing emerging technologies for network management. The NTIA supports increasing spectrum capacity by 500 MHz and has produced a 10-year plan for this purpose. The NTIA supports increasing spectrum capacity for mobile broadband by 500 MHz and has produced a 10-year plan with input from the PPSG. Specific recommendations include making available 15 MHz of spectrum between 1695 MHz and 1710 MHz, and 100 MHz within bands from 3550 MHz to 3650 MHz. The fast track evaluation also suggests studying two 20 MHz bands within 4200-4400 MHz for possible repurposing. The proposal will be considered at the WRC-2015. The World Radio Conference is a key forum for negotiating international spectrum use treaties. The Interdepartmental Radio Access Committee (IRAC) makes decisions on federal spectrum use, with members from the U.S. military and federal agencies. The Commerce Spectrum Advisory Committee advises the NTIA on spectrum policy. The NTIA studied federal spectrum use in the 1755-1850 MHz band, estimating an $18 billion cost to clear federal users. The NTIA evaluated transferring current uses and users to other frequency locations in the 1755-1850 MHz band, estimating an $18 billion cost to clear federal users. Recommendations included sharing frequencies between federal and commercial users, with some frequencies cleared for auction. The GAO testified on undeveloped spectrum sharing technology and policies, suggesting options like spectrum usage fees, more unlicensed spectrum, research on sharing technologies, and improving regulatory processes. The GAO found that further study by the NTIA and the FCC was needed for implementing spectrum sharing policies. The Department of Defense offered to release frequencies between 1755-1780 MHz to control relocation costs. NTIA endorsed the DOD proposal for releasing frequencies at 1755-1850 MHz. The NTIA endorsed the DOD proposal to release frequencies at 1755-1850 MHz, but their assumptions on relocation costs were challenged in a congressional hearing. The GAO found that DOD's cost estimates partially met best practices, noting variable assumptions on spectrum characteristics, technology availability, and market demand. The NTIA works with stakeholders to develop Internet policy and participates in interagency efforts. It also collaborates with other governments and international organizations on Internet policy issues. The NTIA plays a role in the Internet Policy Task Force and assists in establishing a code of conduct on mobile application transparency. Additionally, the NTIA leads on Domain Name System (DNS) issues to ensure the Internet's long-term viability for innovation and economic growth. The NTIA, as the lead agency on DNS issues, supports a multi-stakeholder approach for Internet innovation and economic growth. The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences in Boulder, CO, conducts research and engineering for enhanced competition, new technology deployment, and spectrum efficiency. Key activities for FY2014 include evaluating federal spectrum repurposing, overseeing FirstNet, shaping Internet policies, and monitoring broadband grants. The NTIA leads in forming Internet policies, including data privacy and global information flow. It monitors broadband grants and collaborates with other agencies, which may lead to overlapping responsibilities. Rapid advances in technology have shifted the NTIA's focus to areas like spectrum policy. Policy makers may consider transferring some shared obligations to partners to allow the NTIA to concentrate on key communication policies for future economic growth. Congress may review the NTIA's spectrum management activities and assess its compliance. The NTIA's focus has shifted to spectrum policy, prompting a need for Congress to review its spectrum management activities and compliance with the Spectrum Act. Congress may also consider restructuring the NTIA to better align with its new responsibilities."
