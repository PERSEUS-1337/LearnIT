    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Positive Behavior for Safe and Effective Schools Act.\" Congress finds that ineffective school discipline policies are a major challenge in public schools, with overly harsh practices like suspension and expulsion being counterproductive. Research shows that tough disciplinary approaches lead to higher rates of misbehavior. Despite this, suspensions and expulsions are increasing nationally, disproportionately affecting students of color and those with disabilities. Over 3,300,000 students were suspended and 100,000 expelled annually. Students of color and those with disabilities face higher disciplinary actions. School discipline is linked to dropout rates, teacher turnover, and student behavior affecting academic outcomes. Schools implementing high academic and behavior standards see improvements in student behavior and school climate, leading to better academic outcomes. Evidence-based practices like school-wide positive behavior supports are effective in improving behavior and creating a conducive learning environment. Effective implementation of these supports results in higher academic achievement, fewer disciplinary problems, lower suspension rates, and increased instructional time. Early intervening services are also effective, as seen in a school in Illinois where out-of-school suspensions decreased by 85% after implementing positive behavior supports, resulting in 386 additional days of instructional time. In Illinois, out-of-school suspensions decreased by 85% at an elementary school, resulting in 386 additional days of instructional time. In Maryland, implementing early intervening services led to a 42% decrease in office discipline referrals for major rule violations, recouping 119 days of instructional time for students. Positive behavior supports create safer teaching environments and reduce disciplinary issues. Schools implementing school-wide positive behavior supports create safer teaching environments. In South Carolina, teacher transfer requests decreased by 100% and teacher absence days by 36%. These approaches help all students, including those with challenging behaviors, to succeed. The Act aims to expand the use of positive behavior supports in schools to improve learning environments, reduce discipline referrals, and enhance student academic outcomes. The Act defines positive behavior supports as a systematic approach to reinforce desired behaviors and eliminate problem behaviors in order to improve social outcomes and learning for all students. Title I funds can now be used to implement school-wide positive behavior supports, including early intervening services for students who need additional academic and behavioral support. These funds must align with those authorized under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Title I funds can now be used to implement school-wide positive behavior supports and other effective approaches to improve the learning environment in schools, aligning with funds authorized under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Technical assistance will be provided for the implementation of these supports to supplement existing funds.
