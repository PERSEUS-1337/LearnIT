    "content": "The consumer data industry provides information to firms about consumer behavior during financial transactions. Firms use this data to assess potential risks and benefits. For example, lenders use credit reports to determine loan repayment likelihood. Consumer data is also used by banks, insurance companies, payday lenders, and merchants for various purposes such as offering checking accounts, setting insurance premiums, and predicting repayment behavior for cash advances. Consumer data is utilized by various firms to assess risks and benefits in financial transactions. This data influences decisions on offering insurance products, setting policy premiums, approving payments, screening employees, and determining credit access. Negative information like overdrafts, account closures, loan defaults, and fraud incidents can restrict consumer access to financial opportunities for years. The consumer data industry may deny credit access based on defaults and fraud incidents, which can stay on reports for years. Inaccurate negative information limits consumers, and correcting data can be time-consuming. Exclusion of positive information like timely repayments hinders credit access. The report covers consumer scoring, credit score calculation factors, regulatory framework, and policy issues on inaccurate data. The report discusses policy issues related to consumer data reports, including inaccurate information, negative data retention periods, billing practices, consumer rights, alternative data usage, and data protection. Legislative and regulatory developments are also addressed in the 116th Congress. In the 116th Congress, the House Financial Services Committee addressed consumer data industry issues, including credit reporting. Chairwoman Maxine Waters introduced two draft bills, the CCRRA and Protecting Innocent Consumers Affected by a Shutdown Act, to tackle these issues. The report provides background on credit reporting agencies (CRAs) and credit scoring factors. Credit reporting agencies (CRAs), also known as credit bureaus, prepare consumer reports based on financial transaction history data. This data includes information on credit repayment, tenant payment, employment, insurance claims, bankruptcies, and account management. Consumer reports do not include details on income, assets, race, ethnicity, religion, political preference, or medical history. The three largest nationwide providers of credit reports are Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, while other CRAs offer specialized consumer reporting services. Specialty CRAs may collect data on phone, utilities, and telecommunication services payments. Some CRAs specialize in various consumer reporting services such as payment for phone, utilities, and telecommunication services. They are used by service providers to verify customer identities and determine downpayment requirements. Other CRAs focus on rent payment data for tenant and employment screening, debt collection, and fraud verification. Firms using consumer reports may also report information to CRAs as furnishers, providing tradelines voluntarily to serve as records of transaction activity. A tradeline is an account reported to a CRA by a furnisher, serving as a record of transaction activity. Furnishers have different reporting practices, choosing what to report and when. Benefits increase as more companies participate, but there are costs and security risks involved. Firms must comply with CRA policies to become furnishers. To become furnishers, firms must comply with CRA policies, including fee registration requirements. Compliance may involve investing in technology compatible with CRAs' systems. Furnishers have legal obligations under the FCRA to report accurate information and investigate disputes, which could result in legal costs. Different CRAs may collect the same information but store it differently. Compliance costs may be burdensome for smaller firms, leading some to choose not to become furnishers. Consumer credit scores are used by lenders to predict loan default likelihood and other adverse financial behaviors. Different credit reporting agencies may have varying policies on how they report information, leading to differences in consumer reports. Some firms focus on producing consumer scores rather than maintaining credit records. Consumer scores are computed using information from consumer reports, with firms specializing in this service. Different scoring firms may use varying data sources and statistical models, leading to differences in calculated scores. Each firm has its own proprietary algorithms for weighting information. Consumer scores are calculated by firms using information from consumer reports, with each firm having its own proprietary statistical model and weighting algorithms. The Fair Credit Reporting Act, enacted in 1970, is the main regulation governing the credit reporting industry, ensuring fair and equitable treatment of consumer information. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) regulates the credit reporting industry, ensuring fair treatment of consumer information. It establishes consumers' rights regarding their credit reports, including free annual reports, disclosure of information after adverse actions, and the right to dispute inaccurate information. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) grants consumers rights to access their credit reports annually, dispute inaccuracies, and have negative information removed after a certain period. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) oversees credit reporting agencies, enforcing consumer protection laws and conducting examinations on larger agencies. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) supervises credit reporting agencies (CRAs) to enforce consumer protection laws and conduct examinations. In 2012, the CFPB announced supervision of CRAs with $7 million or more in annual receipts, covering 30 firms. The CFPB reviews procedures and systems for managing consumer data and enforces laws. In 2017, a report highlighted efforts to improve data accuracy, dispute resolution, and furnisher reporting in the credit reporting system. Credit bureaus and financial firms have developed programs to monitor data accuracy, improve dispute processes, and provide more informative resolutions for consumers. Congress is also interested in enhancing consumer protections in the credit reporting system. The CFPB has encouraged credit bureaus to improve dispute resolution processes for consumers. Congress is interested in enhancing consumer protections in response to the Equifax data breach. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act established new protections, including the right to a free credit freeze to prevent fraud and identity theft. Selected policy issues regarding credit reports and scores in lending decisions are discussed, along with legislative proposals from the 116th Congress. Accuracy of consumer information in credit reports remains a key concern. The accuracy of consumer information in credit reports is a key concern, with potential errors affecting access to credit and costs for consumers. In a survey, the FTC found that correcting errors in credit reports led to score increases for participants, with over 40% seeing a rise of more than 20 points. Credit reporting inaccuracies can stem from various sources, such as consumers providing inaccurate data or furnishers inputting incorrect information. The accuracy of consumer data in credit reports is crucial for offering consumers better credit terms. Errors in credit reporting can arise from various sources, including consumers providing incorrect information and furnishers inputting inaccurate data. Matching information to the correct individual can be challenging, especially in cases of similar names or identity theft. The CFPB has been pushing for improved data accuracy in credit reporting, requiring regular accuracy reports from major consumer reporting firms since 2014. This helps enhance the predictive power of consumer data in assessing credit risk. The CFPB has required consumer reporting firms to provide accuracy reports since 2014, detailing dispute frequency and resolution information. Top furnishers update tradeline information regularly, and CRAs have improved dispute resolution tools. As of July 1, 2017, CRAs enhanced public record data standards for civil judgments and tax liens. Credit report accuracy relies on consumers monitoring and disputing discrepancies. The Comprehensive Credit Reporting Reform Act of 2019 (CCRRA) proposed by Chairwoman Waters aims to address concerns regarding inaccurate or disputed data on credit reports. It would establish new consumer rights around the dispute process, including providing more information about dispute investigations, granting the right to appeal disputes to credit bureaus, and allowing consumers to seek injunctive relief. Additionally, the bill would offer credit restoration to victims of predatory activities. Policymakers are also considering the appropriate length of time negative information should be allowed to remain on a credit report. The appropriate length of time negative information should be allowed to remain on a credit report is being considered by policymakers. Negative information, such as delinquencies or defaults, can impact a consumer's access to financial services and job opportunities. Retaining negative information for an extended period may have both benefits and detriments. Retaining negative information on credit reports for an extended period may impact job opportunities and financial challenges. It can lead to inaccurate risk assessments, resulting in costlier credit options or denials. However, longer retention may help lenders identify long-term trends in consumer behavior. Shorter periods of negative tradelines may compromise credit score reliability. Maintaining negative information on credit reports for longer periods can help lenders identify long-term trends in consumer behavior. However, premature removal of negative information may lead to unreliable credit scores, causing lenders to adopt stricter underwriting policies and potentially reducing credit access and competition. Additionally, early removal of negative information can make it harder to detect fraud, which can be costly for small businesses and nonprofit organizations. The CCRRA aims to shorten the time adverse information stays on credit reports by three years, reducing it to four years in total. Inconsistent reporting practices by different holders of consumer debt lead to variations in when unpaid debts appear on reports. Inconsistent reporting practices by different holders of consumer debt lead to variations in when unpaid debts appear on credit reports. Medical providers may assign unpaid bills to debt collectors or sell outstanding debts, with some doing so after 30 days and others after 60 days. Debt collectors or buyers furnish negative information to CRAs, causing tradeline accounts to appear on consumer reports. Approximately 33% of credit reports surveyed had collection tradelines, with 52% related to medical collections. The remaining collection tradelines were associated with unclassified debts. Approximately 52% of collection tradelines on credit reports were related to medical collections, with the median amount owed for medical debt being $207. 85% of respondents had medical debt amounts under $1,000. Medical debt is often disputed by consumers due to inconsistent billing practices and lack of upfront cost information. According to a CFPB study, consumers struggle with understanding medical costs, co-pays, and deductibles, leading to delayed payments and medical debt appearing on credit reports. Regulators and industry actions aim to reduce medical tradelines and negative credit effects, such as the IRS rule requiring nonprofit hospitals to assess patient eligibility for financial assistance before pursuing collection actions. Tax-exempt hospitals must determine patient eligibility for financial assistance before taking collection actions, giving patients 120 days to pay before collections start. Nonprofit hospitals are affected by an IRS rule, while credit reporting agencies now wait 180 days before posting medical collections. Veterans are protected under P.L. 115-174, with certain medical debts excluded from credit reports and settled debts removed. The Credit Card Reporting Reform Act (CCRRA) imposes restrictions on medical collections on credit reports, including the 180-day rule. It requires expedited removal of fully repaid or settled debts, provides free credit monitoring for active duty military personnel, and establishes dispute processes for veterans' medical debt. Consumers often struggle to advocate for themselves due to lack of awareness of their rights and understanding of credit reports. The CFPB receives more credit reporting complaints than any other industry it regulates, offering financial education resources to help educate consumers. The CFPB receives numerous credit reporting complaints and provides financial education resources to help consumers understand their rights. The CCRRA proposes free credit scores and reports for consumers, along with more information on dispute rights and extended time for certain credit inquiries. The CCRRA aims to provide consumers with more information on dispute rights and extend the time limit for certain credit inquiries. There are policy questions surrounding the use of credit bureau data, such as for employment decisions, where credit background checks are used by some organizations to reduce risks like employee theft. Employers must comply with the FCRA by informing applicants about credit report usage and obtaining written permission before making hiring decisions based on the report. The FCRA requires employers to inform applicants about the use of credit reports in hiring decisions and obtain written permission. If an adverse action is taken based on the report, the applicant must be provided with a copy and summary of their rights. The CCRRA proposes to ban the use of credit information for employment decisions, except when required by law or for national security reasons. The CFPB estimates that 20% of the U.S. population cannot have credit scores due to limited credit histories. The CFPB estimates that credit scores cannot be generated for approximately 20% of the U.S. population due to limited credit histories. Credit invisibles have no credit record at the three largest credit bureaus, representing 11.0% of the U.S. adult population. Nonscorable consumers, with insufficient or outdated credit histories, make up 8.3% of the adult population. Younger adults may lack a sufficient credit history, leading to credit invisibility or nonscorable status. Older adults may encounter credit issues due to reduced credit usage as they prepare for retirement. Credit scoring models vary, so being nonscorable depends on the data records and models used. Borrowers with missing credit histories can improve scores with credit building loans like secured credit cards. These cards require security deposits as collateral and can help lenders recover funds if payments are missed. Secured credit cards require security deposits or links to accounts for lenders to recover funds if payments are missed. The deposit is refunded if payments are made on time, helping borrowers build or repair credit histories. Alternative credit scoring models may benefit credit invisibles by considering additional payment activity beyond traditional credit reports. Increasing options for calculating scores for nonscoreable consumers could help lenders establish financial relationships with these groups more accurately. Some credit scoring models may benefit from including additional information beyond traditional credit reports, such as utility and rent payments. Newer versions of credit scoring may apply less weight to medical debt, as its reliability as a predictor of creditworthiness is questioned. Developing credit scores with new information could help lenders identify new creditworthy consumers, potentially increasing access to credit. Regulators and Congress have considered alternative credit scoring methods. In 2014, the FHFA directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider using updated credit scoring models in mortgage underwriting. The CCRRA would require the CFPB to report to Congress on the impact of using nontraditional data on credit scoring. Implementation of newer credit scoring models may be slow due to the high cost of upgrading automated underwriting systems in the mortgage market. Upgrading automated underwriting systems is costly for GSEs, FHA, and loan originators. Not all originators will choose to update their systems. Alternative credit scoring models may not significantly change credit access. Congressional interest in data protection has increased after the Equifax breach. The Equifax cybersecurity breach in 2017 led to increased focus on data protection in the consumer data industry. CRAs must adhere to data protection requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The FTC enforces these standards for nonbank financial institutions like CRAs. The CFPB does not have authority in this area. The FTC enforces data protection standards for nonbank financial institutions like CRAs under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Bills in Congress aim to strengthen consumer information safeguarding, while a Government Accountability Office report suggests actions to enhance oversight of credit bureaus' data security. P.L. 115-174 mandates credit bureaus to provide fraud alerts and free freeze/unfreeze alerts to consumers. The CCRRA would expand protections for identity theft victims, including free credit monitoring and identity theft services, with new regulations to define the parameters for these benefits."
