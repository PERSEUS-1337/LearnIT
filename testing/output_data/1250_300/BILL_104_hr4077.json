The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, later amended to include agreements with Mexico, Japan, and the former Soviet Union, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to regulate hunting of migratory birds. These regulations, in place for over 60 years, include prohibitions on certain hunting methods to prevent overharvesting, with the exception of issues related to hunting migratory birds using baiting. The regulations on hunting migratory birds using baiting have been problematic, leading to confusion and inconsistent enforcement. Clarification is needed to ensure the protection of the bird resource while maintaining consistency in enforcement. The regulations on hunting migratory birds using baiting must be clarified to protect the bird resource while ensuring consistent enforcement and upholding principles of \"fair chase\". Baiting restrictions should not hinder habitat management benefits. SEC. 3. CLARIFYING HUNTING PROHIBITIONS. Section 3 of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act is amended to prohibit the taking of migratory game birds using specific methods and equipment, including traps, firearms with certain capacities, sinkboxes, and motor vehicles or aircraft. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits the taking of migratory game birds using specific methods and equipment, including motor vehicles, motorboats, and live birds as decoys. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits the use of air conveyance, sailboats, live birds as decoys, recorded or electrically amplified bird calls, and possession of certain types of shot for hunting migratory birds. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits the use of certain types of shot for hunting migratory birds, including Anatidae, coots, and species in nontoxic shot zones designated by the Secretary of the Interior. It also prohibits taking migratory birds by baiting, except for specific exemptions like hunting over standing crops or flooded croplands. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits the taking of migratory game birds over lands where grains have been scattered as a result of normal agricultural operations or wildlife management practices. It also prohibits hunting migratory birds over moist soil on emergent marsh plants that have been manipulated as part of wetland habitat practices. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits hunting migratory birds over moist soil on emergent marsh plants that have been manipulated as part of wetland habitat practices, including various wetland plant species. Baiting is defined as the intentional placement of food for birds. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits hunting over baited areas where food is intentionally placed to attract migratory game birds. Baiting is defined as the intentional placement of corn, wheat, or other feed to attract birds for hunting purposes. The term 'normal agricultural operations' under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act includes various activities such as growing crops, planting for erosion control, and distributing grains in a region. Other activities can be considered normal only after consultation with relevant authorities and publication in the Federal Register. The term 'attraction' and 'attracting' in the Migratory Bird Treaty Act refers to bait being a significant factor in luring birds within shotgun range, considering factors like location, terrain, and hunting methods. This determination is published annually in the Federal Register alongside other hunting regulations after public review. SEC. 4 of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act is amended to deposit fines into a conservation fund for acquiring bird refuges. SEC. 5 outlines penalties for violations, allowing owners to post bond instead of property seizure."
