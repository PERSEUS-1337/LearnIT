    "content": "The \"Spending Safeguard Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. It includes a spending limitation on direct spending programs. The Spending Safeguard Act establishes a spending limitation for direct spending programs, determined by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The limitation is set at 120% or 110% of the program cost, depending on the budget function category. The Spending Safeguard Act sets spending limits for direct spending programs based on program costs. The Director determines the cost using scorecards or estimates from the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act. A spending safeguard limitation scorecard is maintained and made public, showing spending levels for applicable programs. Monthly reports on program costs are transmitted to the Director by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury sends monthly reports to the Director listing total spending for direct spending programs. The Director submits biannual reports to Congress on program spending levels and their relation to spending safeguard limitations. Additionally, the President's annual budget submission includes a report on spending levels for programs subject to spending safeguards. The Director submits reports to Congress on spending levels for direct spending programs subject to spending safeguard limitations. If a program is projected to breach its spending limit within six months, a report is sent to the relevant committees in Congress. The Director submits reports to Congress on direct spending programs reaching spending safeguard limitations. If a program exceeds its limit, funds cannot be obligated, and a report is sent to relevant committees. Federal agencies must follow procedures for listed programs on the scorecard. Any Federal agency implementing a direct spending program listed on the scorecard must inform participants about spending safeguard limitations that could affect future funding. Definitions in the Act include the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the meaning of direct spending, and what constitutes a direct spending program. No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated for new programs enacted or reauthorized after this Act, if they do not specify a dollar amount for funding."
