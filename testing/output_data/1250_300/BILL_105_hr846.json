    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, SEC. 1259, which deals with constructive sales treatment for appreciated financial positions. SEC. 1259 of the Internal Revenue Code deals with constructive sales treatment for appreciated financial positions. It states that if there is a constructive sale of an appreciated financial position, the taxpayer must recognize gain as if the position were sold for its fair market value on the date of the constructive sale. Proper adjustments are made for any subsequent gain or loss realized, and the holding period is determined as if the position were acquired on the date of the constructive sale. An appreciated financial position refers to any position with respect to stock, debt instrument, or partnership interest where there would be gain upon sale. SEC. 1259 of the Internal Revenue Code defines an appreciated financial position as any position with potential gain upon sale, including stock, debt instruments, or partnership interests. A constructive sale occurs if a taxpayer engages in certain transactions related to the same or similar property, leading to recognition of gain as if the position were sold at fair market value. The term 'constructive sale' refers to specific transactions involving appreciated financial positions, such as futures contracts or acquiring similar property. Exceptions include transactions marked to market under certain sections and sales of nonpublicly traded property like stock or debt instruments. Exceptions to the term 'constructive sale' include contracts for nonpublicly traded property sales within a year and transactions closed by year-end, disregarding certain conditions. For tax purposes, a transaction must be closed before the end of the taxable year to avoid being considered a constructive sale. Related persons are defined based on specific relationships and the intent to avoid tax rules. Debt instruments are treated as property for this purpose. ``(d) Other Definitions.--For purposes of this section, a forward contract includes a prepaid forward contract, and an offsetting notional principal contract involves paying the investment yield on property in exchange for reimbursement for any decline in value. (e) Special Rules.--If there is a constructive sale of an appreciated financial position and it is subsequently sold or disposed of, special treatment applies.`` For determining constructive sales of appreciated financial positions, if a position is sold or disposed of while the transaction is open, it is treated as a constructive sale. Trust interests actively traded are treated as stock. If a portion of property is constructively sold, the specific property is determined. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for the purposes of this section. Securities traders can elect mark to market accounting method for dealers in securities. Active traders in securities may choose to be treated as dealers for tax purposes. Securities traders engaged in active trading may elect to be treated as dealers for tax purposes, allowing their securities to be treated as not held for investment. This election can be made without the Secretary's consent and applies to the current and future taxable years unless revoked. Sec. 1259 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 addresses the constructive sales treatment for appreciated financial positions. The effective date for the amendments made by this section applies to constructive sales occurring after the date of enactment of the Act, and also to sales after January 12, 1996, but only if certain conditions are met regarding ownership and open transactions. The new provision in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 addresses constructive sales of appreciated financial positions. It applies to sales occurring after the enactment of the Act and includes special rules for decedents with open transactions. The amendment in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 addresses the treatment of positions related to rights to receive income in respect of a decedent. It also allows securities traders to elect to be treated as dealers for taxable years beginning after the enactment of the Act. The net amount of adjustments required under section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be spread out evenly over a 5-year period starting from the first taxable year after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON EXCEPTION FOR INVESTMENT COMPANIES UNDER SECTION 351. Amends section 351(e) of the Internal Revenue Code to include all stock and securities in determining if a company is an investment company.
