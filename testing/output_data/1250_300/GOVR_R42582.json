The Peace Corps has suspended operations in some Latin American and Caribbean countries due to security concerns. In 2005, volunteers were withdrawn from Haiti and in 2008 from Bolivia. In 2012, volunteers were pulled out of Honduras because of high levels of violence. Volunteer programs in El Salvador and Guatemala were also affected by security concerns, with training classes being cancelled in 2011.

Volunteer programs in El Salvador and Guatemala were affected, with training classes being cancelled in 2011. The Obama Administration's foreign aid budget request for the region prioritizes promoting economic opportunity, citizen security, democratic governance, and clean energy. Citizen security programs in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean account for 45% of the total budget, focusing on strengthening institutions to address crime and ensure public security. The Obama Administration's foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean prioritizes citizen security efforts, with programs focusing on strengthening institutions to address crime and ensure public security. Assistance for Haiti is also emphasized to support earthquake recovery, sanitation, and health services. Budget priorities include \"Peace and Security\" assistance, \"Governing Justly and Democratically\" programs, and other traditional aid programs. The Obama Administration's foreign aid budget for Latin America and the Caribbean prioritizes citizen security efforts, with programs focusing on strengthening institutions to address crime and ensure public security. Assistance for Haiti is also emphasized to support earthquake recovery, sanitation, and health services. The program areas include \"Governing Justly and Democratically,\" \"Investing in People,\" and \"Economic Growth,\" with a decrease in funding compared to FY2012. Positive development trends in the region have allowed USAID to plan to close its mission in Panama this year. USAID plans to close its mission in Panama this year due to positive economic growth and reduced poverty in the region. There are concerns about proposed budget decreases for Latin America and the Caribbean, with a focus on maintaining assistance for citizen security and counter-narcotics efforts in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean. Some Members have expressed worries about declines in aid for these programs. Assistance for Haiti's recovery remains a point of consensus. Some Members oppose parts of the Administration's proposed FY2013 funding for Latin America and the Caribbean, including the Global Climate Change Initiative and increased funding for Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. They also oppose cuts in democracy funding for Cuba and Venezuela. Some committee members opposed cuts in democracy funding for Cuba and Venezuela, which they maintain are vital to help democracy advocates. House and Senate Appropriations Committees have marked up their versions of the FY2013 State Department appropriations measure, potentially leading to significant reductions in assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean. Members of Congress should examine if the FY2013 request adequately reflects U.S. interests and objectives in the region. Members of Congress should examine the FY2013 foreign aid appropriations request for Latin America and the Caribbean to ensure it reflects U.S. interests and objectives in the region. They should consider metrics to evaluate program effectiveness, impact of proposed aid cuts, and identify areas for reduction with the least harm to U.S. interests. Coordination among U.S. government agencies and international donors is crucial to maximize the impact of foreign assistance funds. The U.S. government agencies managing foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean are fragmented, leading to potential overlap and inefficiencies. Better coordination among State Department, USAID, and DOD could ensure complementary efforts and increase program impact. Congress should consider resource coordination to maximize the effectiveness of foreign assistance funds. The U.S. government agencies providing assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean should improve coordination to avoid duplication and inefficiencies. Closer coordination with international donors could enhance the impact of programs and make foreign assistance funds more efficient. The U.S. government agencies in Latin America and the Caribbean should improve coordination with international donors to ensure complementary efforts and efficient use of foreign assistance funds. This coordination may be challenging due to unclear leadership and disagreements among donors. Strategic objectives and development goals should be balanced, and trilateral cooperation agreements with successful countries in the region like Brazil, Chile, and Colombia can provide access to new solutions and expertise for aid programs. The U.S. government aims to enhance coordination with international donors in Latin America and the Caribbean to maximize the impact of foreign assistance funds. Trilateral cooperation agreements with countries like Brazil, Chile, and Colombia offer access to new solutions and expertise for aid programs. Assistance provided to Brazil and Colombia includes strengthening development agencies and supporting counternarcotics efforts. Critics raise concerns about oversight when providing aid through foreign governments. The U.S. government aims to enhance coordination with international donors in Latin America and the Caribbean to maximize the impact of foreign assistance funds. Critics raise concerns about oversight when providing aid through foreign governments, as it could lead to U.S. funds being used for prohibited activities. Members of Congress may consider agencies with comparative advantages in providing assistance, clarifying roles of U.S. agencies, and ensuring controls are in place for funds provided through partner nations. When considering foreign assistance levels for Latin American and Caribbean nations, Congress should examine political will and program sustainability. The State Department's QDDR emphasizes assessing host nations' willingness to implement reforms for effective use of U.S. assistance. Without partner nations' commitment to reforms and program ownership, the impact of U.S. aid may be limited. The Colombian government, a major recipient of U.S. assistance, serves as a case study for demonstrating political will and ensuring program sustainability. The nations of Latin America and the Caribbean have a mixed record in demonstrating political will and ensuring program sustainability. The Colombian government has undertaken reforms and raised revenue with high levels of U.S. assistance. USAID is closing missions in Panama and ending family planning programs in other countries as partner nations can now manage and fund programs independently. However, political will has often been lacking in the region, hindering efforts to sustain initiatives supported by the U.S. The 2003 study highlighted issues with sustaining U.S.-funded programs in Latin America due to lack of resources post-support. Similarly, a 2010 study found countries unable to utilize U.S.-provided equipment for counternarcotics due to funding constraints. Even MCC-funded projects faced sustainability challenges, as seen in a 2011 study on road maintenance in Honduras. Congress should consider partner countries' capacity for equipment maintenance when allocating foreign aid. As Congress considers foreign aid appropriations for Latin American and Caribbean countries, they should assess the host country's ability to maintain provided equipment, their plan for taking financial responsibility, and their political will for necessary reforms. Additionally, they should determine the level of assistance needed to build the host nation's capacity over time. The House Committee on Appropriations marked up a bill totaling $48.3 billion for the Department of State and Foreign Operations in May 2012. In 2012, the House Committee on Appropriations marked up a bill totaling $48.3 billion for the Department of State and Foreign Operations. The bill included $40.1 billion for the core State Department budget and $8.2 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. The Senate Committee on Appropriations also marked up a bill totaling $52.3 billion, with $50 billion for the core State Department budget. The Obama Administration criticized the House bill for exceeding agreed-upon budget cuts and potentially damaging national security. The House bill was criticized as \"unworkable\" for exceeding budget cuts agreed upon in the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Administration warned that the funding levels would harm national security and lead to higher long-term costs. Specific foreign assistance amounts for Latin America and the Caribbean were not detailed in the legislation. However, concerns were raised about conditions in the region, with intentions to provide assistance levels above the Administration's request to some countries. The House report emphasized the need for robust support for counternarcotics and law enforcement efforts in the region. The Committee recommends restoring reductions proposed in the request for key countries in Latin America to support counternarcotics and law enforcement efforts, rule of law activities, and judicial reform. Additional U.S. aid is called for to strengthen democratic institutions, professional police forces, and address poverty in Central and South America. The committee directs additional resources above the budget request to strengthen democratic institutions and address poverty in the region. Specific funding levels are recommended for Colombia and Mexico, with both reports calling for assistance above the requested levels. For Colombia, the House report recommends funding for training and technical assistance, while the Senate report suggests funding for alternative development and institution building. For Mexico, the House report recommends support for anti-crime and counternarcotics efforts. The House and Senate reports recommend additional funding for anti-crime and counternarcotics efforts in Mexico, with variations in priorities such as democracy programs in Venezuela and administration of funds for CARSI and CBSI. The House and Senate reports recommended additional funding for anti-crime and counternarcotics efforts in Mexico, with variations in priorities for regional security programs. Congress took no action on H.R. 5857 or S. 3241, enacting a six-month continuing resolution instead. In response to the delay in FY2013 appropriations bills, a six-month continuing resolution (P.L. 112-175) was enacted, which expired in March 2013. New legislation (P.L. 113-6) was then approved to fund federal programs through the end of FY2013, with State Department and Foreign Operations accounts funded at FY2012 levels, subject to budget sequestration cuts. Sequestration reduced funding by about 5%, applied at the account level, leading to uncertainties in country-level allocations for FY2013."
