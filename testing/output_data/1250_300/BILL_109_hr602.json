    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act\". Congress finds that prior to December 7, 1956, retired uniformed services members were led to believe they would receive fully paid lifetime health care. The Court urged Congress to fulfill these promises made in good faith to veterans of the World War II and Korean War era. The retired officers of the World War II and Korean War era were promised free health care for life, but due to lack of authority to make such promises, the breach-of-contract claim was upheld. Congress is urged to address the moral claims raised by the plaintiffs. The retirees' breach-of-contract claim was upheld as only Congress can fulfill the promises made to World War II and Korean War era veterans for free healthcare. Recruiters and government officials allowed service members to believe they were entitled to medical and dental care in uniformed services facilities. The failure to provide fully paid lifetime health care upon retirement for retired members of the uniformed services is causing difficulties in accessing healthcare in military facilities, leading to reluctance in recommending military service as a career choice. The failure to provide adequate health care for retired members of the uniformed services is hindering recommendations for military service as a career. Provisions in the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act only extended coverage to medicare eligible retirees aged 65 and older, neglecting the health care needs of those under 65. The US should fulfill promises made to previous generations and reinstate high-quality health care for all retired uniformed service members. SEC. 3. COVERAGE OF MILITARY RETIREES UNDER THE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM. The amendment to Section 1108 of title 10, United States Code expands health care coverage for retirees and dependents through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. Eligible beneficiaries include members or former members of the uniformed services, unremarried former spouses, and dependents of deceased members. Eligible beneficiaries, including dependents of deceased members, can enroll in a Federal Employees Health Benefit plan for self-only or self and family coverage. This coverage extends to family members as defined in section 8901(5) of title 5. Eligible beneficiaries can enroll in Federal Employees Health Benefit plans for self-only or self and family coverage, without needing to meet eligibility criteria from chapter 89 of title 5. Those enrolled cannot receive health care under section 1086 or 1097 but can continue to receive care in a military medical treatment facility reimbursed by the program. Eligible beneficiaries enrolled in Federal Employees Health Benefit plans can receive care in a military medical treatment facility reimbursed by the program. They can also change health benefits plans and coverage like any other beneficiary. Government contributions are limited, and separate risk pools are required for health benefits plans under chapter 89 of title 5. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management requires separate risk pools for health benefits plans under chapter 89 of title 5. The Secretary of Defense will reimburse eligible beneficiaries for health care costs not covered by the plan but would have been paid under TRICARE Standard. The amendments made by this section regarding health care coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program will be effective on October 1, 2005. Additionally, reimbursement for TRICARE pharmacy benefits at TRICARE network pharmacy levels will be provided to certain military retirees and dependents in hardship cases. SEC. 4. REIMBURSEMENT FOR TRICARE PHARMACY BENEFITS: The Secretary will reimburse eligible individuals for pharmacy benefits received from non-TRICARE network pharmacies if certified by a physician that they lack access to a TRICARE network pharmacy due to physical or medical constraints. Eligible individuals must have another insurance plan providing primary coverage for health benefits. SEC. 5. WAIVER OF MEDICARE PART B PREMIUM FOR CERTAIN MILITARY RETIREES. The amendment to Section 1839 of the Social Security Act waives the monthly premium for eligible individuals enrolled in Medicare Part B, including retired military personnel, their spouses, and widows/widowers. The amendment to Section 1839 of the Social Security Act exempts eligible individuals, including military retirees, spouses, and widows/widowers, from paying the monthly premium for Medicare Part B starting in January 2005. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will use a rebate methodology to provide rebates to eligible individuals for any premium paid under Section 1839 of the Social Security Act starting from January 2005."
