The Secretary of State must deny visas and exclude from the US any alien who invests $1,000,000 or more in enhancing Cuba's ability to develop petroleum resources off its coast. Spouses, minor children, or agents of such individuals are also included. The Secretary may waive this if certified on a case-by-case basis to congressional committees. The Secretary of State can waive visa denial for individuals investing in Cuba's petroleum development if critical medical reasons, litigation, or specific Act requirements are met.
