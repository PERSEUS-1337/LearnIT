Over 30 PHAs are currently participating in MTW, managing billions in funding. The future of MTW is uncertain, with calls for changes to the program emerging. Critics argue that MTW agencies have too much flexibility without clear outcomes. The future of the MTW program is uncertain as the current HUD-PHA agreements are set to expire in 2018. Critics argue that the program's flexibility has had negative impacts on low-income families, while supporters believe it has allowed PHAs to serve more families in unique and cost-effective ways. Conflicting views on the program's success have led to calls to end, change, or expand it. Evaluating the program's effectiveness is challenging due to its design and implementation. The MTW demonstration program's future is uncertain as current agreements are set to expire in 2018. Critics argue its flexibility has negative impacts, while supporters believe it allows PHAs to serve more families effectively. The program was meant for testing innovations in assisted housing provision, with debates on restructuring it or keeping it as is. Despite controversy, policies from MTW agencies have influenced reforms in mainstream housing programs, providing lessons for future federal housing assistance reforms. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program (MTW) allows PHAs to test innovative approaches for providing housing assistance to low-income families. Congress authorized the program in 1996 to reduce costs and increase cost-effectiveness in assisted housing. Lessons from MTW agencies have influenced reforms in mainstream housing programs, providing insights for future federal housing assistance reforms. The Moving to Work Demonstration Program (MTW) allows PHAs to test innovative approaches for providing housing assistance to low-income families. The program aims to reduce costs, increase cost-effectiveness, encourage self-sufficiency, and expand housing choices for low-income families. MTW agencies have flexibility to develop their own policies to achieve these objectives, including combining funding streams and waiving statutory requirements. The law allows PHAs to combine funding streams for housing assistance, design a \"reasonable\" rent policy to promote employment and self-sufficiency, and be held harmless in terms of funding. However, MTW agencies have limits on flexibility, including serving a specific number of low-income families and meeting housing quality standards. HUD is prohibited from waiving certain provisions of the U.S. Housing Act, such as public housing demolition and labor standards. PHAs must also seek public input. The law prohibits HUD from waiving certain provisions of the U.S. Housing Act, including public housing demolition and labor standards. PHAs must seek public input in developing their MTW policies, hold a public hearing, and incorporate public comments in their MTW application plan. The plan must detail how the PHA will use its flexibilities under the MTW program, which needs approval from HUD. MTW agencies must submit annual reports to HUD on fund usage and activities. The MTW demonstration program allows agencies to implement various policies and activities. The MTW demonstration program allows agencies to implement a diverse set of policies and activities in public housing. The program was developed in response to concerns about rising costs and management issues in public housing during the 1980s and 1990s. Federal policymakers considered strategies to reduce costs and improve management, leading to the development of the MTW program. The concept of \"block granting\" was explored as a way to devolve assisted housing programs to the local level. The MTW demonstration program was developed to explore block granting and devolving assisted housing programs to the local level. It aimed to increase family self-sufficiency, reduce housing costs through market-based approaches, and maintain federal regulation for achieving housing goals like desegregation. The MTW demonstration program, aimed at reducing assisted housing costs through market-based approaches, was announced by HUD in December 1996. 30 PHAs were selected to participate, with agreements signed in 1998 or 1999. Six agencies opted out, possibly due to delays or increased flexibility provided by a housing reform law in 1998. Due to a housing reform law in 1998, six MTW agencies chose not to participate in the program. HUD allocated the remaining spots to housing authorities with over 2,500 units. Congress directed HUD to add more PHAs to the MTW program through various acts, with competitive slots available to high-performing PHAs with fewer than 5,000 units. HUD recently selected four agencies to participate in the MTW program, despite criticisms of their implementation. Some PHAs were chosen despite prior poor performance, leading to a lack of uniformity in program structure and difficulties in data collection. HUD's data systems were unable to accommodate variations in PHA income and rent policies, hindering data collection from MTW PHAs. This resulted in a lack of information on tenant characteristics, making it challenging to evaluate the effects of MTW policies on tenant outcomes and program costs. HUD has faced criticism for insufficient monitoring of the program's implementation, leading to recommendations for improved oversight. In response, a standard MTW agreement with uniform language was introduced in 2008. HUD issued a report recommending improved monitoring and oversight of the MTW program. In response, a standard MTW agreement with uniform language was implemented in 2008, extending participation until 2018. However, the agreement does not standardize performance data, limiting HUD's evaluation of MTW agencies' policies. HUD has increased efforts to monitor compliance with the program's statutory purposes. HUD has increased efforts to monitor MTW agencies' compliance with the program's statutory purposes and requirements. They plan to require agencies to define \"self-sufficiency\" and \"housing choice,\" and provide a template for collecting data on a \"comparable mix of families.\" In a 2011 assessment, HUD found that 91% of individuals served by MTW agencies were low-income, and most agencies served a similar number of families as before entering the program. HUD has made efforts to monitor MTW agencies' compliance with statutory requirements. A GAO report found that HUD's initiatives were moving in the right direction, but without standard definitions and a systematic process, HUD cannot effectively evaluate compliance. A HUD IG report recommended no additional MTW agencies be added until program administration improved. MTW agencies have adopted various program activities. MTW agencies have adopted a wide range of program activities, with some fully transforming their assisted housing programs while others making more modest policy changes. They have discretion in three policy areas: merging funding streams, determining assistance levels and conditions, and other administrative flexibilities. Policies vary among agencies, and changes over time are noted when possible. MTW agencies have the flexibility to merge funding streams, set assistance levels, and make administrative changes. This allows for a departure from traditional program operations, where each program has dedicated funding streams. The report does not evaluate the effectiveness of these policies. Under the non-merged funding structure, Section 8 voucher funding is only for landlord payments, not for PHA administration or other housing programs. MTW agencies can negotiate block grant assistance amounts, with most now opting for merged funding. A 2004 report found limited use of funding flexibility by MTW agencies, mainly to address financial shortfalls and for approved cross-program purposes. MTW agencies used funding flexibility to increase autonomy from regulatory processes and develop additional support services for tenants. Some agencies leveraged block grant assistance for low-income housing development. More agencies are now opting for block grant funding and using funding flexibility broadly for ambitious development activities. MTW agencies like the Chicago Housing Authority and Atlanta Housing Authority have used their funding flexibility to redevelop public housing stocks, attracting private investment for new mixed-income communities. The fixed 10-year merged MTW funding stream played a crucial role in obtaining financing for these transformation plans. The merged MTW funding stream allowed agencies like the Chicago Housing Authority and Atlanta Housing Authority to obtain financing for transforming public housing with private investment. Other MTW agencies, such as Keene Housing Authority and Housing Authorities of Santa Clara and San Jose, used funding flexibility to convert public housing to project-based voucher developments, aiming to leverage additional outside financing. In the traditional Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, PHAs can \"project-base\" vouchers by reserving units for low-income tenants in private buildings. MTW PHAs have more flexibility in project-basing, allowing them to convert public housing to project-based vouchers or serve special populations by project-basing entire buildings. MTW agencies have the flexibility to convert public housing to project-based vouchers or serve special populations by project-basing entire buildings. The majority of MTW agencies are engaged in project-basing vouchers at a higher rate than non-MTW PHAs. This allows for different processes in awarding project-based assistance compared to the standard voucher program regulations. Under the standard public housing and Housing Choice Voucher programs, tenant eligibility for assistance is determined by income and subsidy amount. MTW agencies had discretion for alternative income calculations until 2011 when HUD issued guidance requiring compliance with statutory income calculations. MTW agencies can still implement alternative rent structures and set additional conditions for tenants. Industry groups argue for flexibility in income calculations and rent structures. Some MTW agencies have experimented with alternative income calculations and rent structures, simplifying income calculations by limiting exclusions and deductions. Income is defined as income from all sources, and adjusted income is income less statutory exclusions. MTW agencies have used flexibility to not include income from assets below a certain threshold value. Some MTW agencies have simplified income calculations by limiting exclusions and deductions, not including income from assets below a certain threshold value. Over half of participating agencies used modified income or asset disregard, and a quarter used modified deductions. Many agencies have reduced the frequency of verifying tenants' income, especially for elderly or disabled populations. Some agencies only reexamine income every two or three years and eliminate interim reexaminations. MTW agencies have adopted alternate schedules for recertifying tenant income, potentially forgoing additional revenue or increasing subsidy costs. The cost-effectiveness of this approach is unknown, but agencies may find administrative savings or changes in tenant incentives valuable. These agencies have experimented with various alternative rent structures under the flexibility provided by the demonstration. MTW agencies have experimented with alternative rent structures, including maximum and minimum rents, flat rents, delayed rent increases, stepped rents, and alternative subsidies. Most agencies have their own minimum rent policies, some have tiered rent policies, and others have flat rent policies. Additionally, some agencies have simplified the utility calculation for determining tenant subsidies. Officials believe these alternative rent structures encourage work and provide tenants with exposure to different payment methods. Some MTW agencies believe alternative rent structures encourage work by not penalizing tenants for income increases and mimic the private market. These structures are easier to understand and administer. However, there is a lack of data to evaluate if they have increased tenant earnings or decreased administrative work. MTW PHAs have also implemented new requirements for tenants, such as time limits and work requirements. MTW PHAs have implemented new requirements for tenants, including time limits and work requirements. Approximately one-third of MTW agencies have work requirements, while half as many have time limit policies. These policies aim to promote self-sufficiency and may allow PHAs to serve more families. Supportive services are provided to families subject to these requirements. Time limits for program participation range from three to seven years. These policies help decrease administrative burdens for MTW agencies without changing the level or type of assistance families receive. MTW agencies have adopted policies to streamline operations, such as alternative housing quality inspection schedules and reporting requirements. Some agencies have clustered inspections based on location or implemented risk-based inspection schedules to reduce administrative burdens. These changes aim to ensure decent housing quality without the need for annual inspections for every unit. Some MTW agencies have adopted alternative inspection schedules, including risk-based inspections, to reduce administrative burdens. Only a few agencies cluster inspections, with 38% inspecting less frequently than annually and 19% allowing self-certification under certain conditions. The MTW program requires housing quality standards to be met, and alternative inspection procedures have been suggested to ensure quality in a less burdensome way, although a full evaluation is pending. MTW agencies have implemented alternative HQS inspection procedures to maintain the quality of assisted housing stock in a more efficient manner. However, a comprehensive evaluation comparing the effectiveness of traditional inspection procedures to alternative ones is still needed. MTW agencies also differ in how they report program information to HUD, with MTW agencies submitting Annual MTW Plans and Reports while non-MTW agencies follow more prescriptive guidelines focused on meeting federal rules and regulations. MTW agencies must submit plans that are more prescriptive than non-MTW agencies, focusing on meeting federal rules and regulations. MTW reporting requirements encourage program creativity and strategic planning. Since 2008, MTW agencies need HUD approval for new activities in their Annual MTW Plans. This change allows HUD to have more knowledge of MTW agencies' activities and outcomes. HUD now requires MTW agencies to include new activities in their Annual MTW Plans for approval before implementation, providing more oversight. However, the current reporting process allows agencies to self-report outcomes without verification. Some agencies have struggled with new reporting requirements, and HUD's systems lack capacity for MTW-specific data. There has been no systematic evaluation of MTW agencies' outcomes in achieving program goals. The MTW demonstration program aims to improve cost-effectiveness in assisted housing, promote self-sufficiency for families, and expand housing options for low-income families. While there is a lack of verified evidence on the program's effectiveness, observations from tenant advocates, PHAs, and HUD inform policy debates. Concerns have been raised about the potential negative impact on assisted housing tenants, but a thorough study on the program's effects is still needed. The MTW demonstration program aims to improve cost-effectiveness in assisted housing and expand housing options for low-income families. HUD suggests that participating PHAs can provide more housing units under MTW, potentially benefiting low-income individuals. However, some PHAs may achieve this by reducing assistance to current recipients. Self-sufficiency policies implemented by MTW agencies could benefit low-income individuals in the long term. The MTW demonstration program has raised concerns about tenants paying rent above the affordability standard, potential loss of assistance for needy families due to time limits and work requirements, and reduced access to portability. Further research is needed to determine the overall impact of MTW discretion on low-income individuals. Additionally, the program has led to significant demolition of public housing, affecting tenants in those communities. The flexibility of being an MTW agency may make the demolition and disposition of public housing stock more feasible, as seen in Atlanta and Chicago PHAs. Tenant advocates object to large-scale displacement, arguing it destroys communities and makes social services less accessible. Research has focused on the effects of HOPE VI program on tenants affected by public housing demolition. Research on the effects of public housing demolition, specifically through the HOPE VI program, has shown positive outcomes for tenants. Displaced individuals now reside in better neighborhoods with improved health outcomes. However, vulnerable groups like large families and those with disabilities may not benefit as much and may require additional support services. The success of the program in terms of cost-effectiveness is supported by industry groups and practitioners. The discretion given to MTW agencies allows for cost-effective administration of assisted housing programs, with support from PHA industry groups, practitioners, and some Members of Congress. Most PHAs choose to renew participation, showing the program's popularity. However, some argue that MTW agencies are more costly and negatively impact funding for other PHAs. Advocates argue that MTW agencies administer assisted housing at a higher cost and negatively affect funding for other PHAs. Supporters claim that MTW agencies' increased discretion reduces administrative burdens without increasing oversight risk. Unlike traditional PHAs, MTW agencies are not held accountable through regulatory oversight, which some view as necessary to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. MTW agencies operate without traditional regulatory oversight, defining their own goals and reporting to HUD. Supporters argue this fosters innovation and focus on outcomes. However, concerns remain about monitoring program funds and evaluating outcomes. The future of the MTW program is uncertain, with agreements set to expire in 2018. The future of the MTW demonstration program is uncertain, with agreements set to expire in 2018. Supporters propose expanding MTW into a permanent program, while critics call for its phase-out and replacement with targeted demonstrations for more meaningful evaluations. Policymakers are debating whether MTW should be a testing ground for reforming rental assistance programs or if some version of the program is the future of assisted housing. The future of the MTW demonstration program is uncertain, with agreements set to expire in 2018. Policymakers are debating whether to reform rental assistance programs through MTW or if it should become a permanent program. The purpose of the MTW program is to test different approaches for housing assistance, but its effectiveness has been limited. The MTW demonstration program's design and implementation have limited its effectiveness as a true demonstration. Some suggest changes to allow for more research-oriented purposes. HUD has proposed expanding the program to 60 agencies for systematic evaluation, with a focus on targeted selection and high-performing agencies. HUD has proposed expanding the MTW program to allow for a more targeted selection of agencies with a focus on high-performing agencies. The goal is to evaluate policies for potential national adoption, aligning with legislative proposals for housing reform. The MTW program was initially a compromise between transforming rental assistance programs into a block grant and maintaining existing programs, leading to the creation of a new housing program for a small number of PHAs. The MTW compromise allowed for the creation of a new housing program for a small number of PHAs while maintaining existing programs for most PHAs. There is a growing interest in expanding and making MTW a permanent program, with proposals to increase the number of eligible PHAs and implement block granting and deregulation. Concerns have been raised about potential funding reductions with a block grant model. Some PHA industry groups and tenant advocates have concerns about a block grant funding model for PHAs, fearing potential funding reductions and loss of tenant protections. HUD has expressed concerns about the capacity of some agencies entering the MTW demonstration program, recommending selection based on evaluation of performance. HUD recommends selecting PHAs for the MTW program based on their ability to meet reporting requirements, evaluation capacity, innovation, and local support. It is uncertain if the current MTW program or a fully deregulated block grant program is suitable for small PHAs. Policymakers could choose to maintain the program as is, with existing agreements in place until 2018. Congress may consider adding a few more agencies, and HUD has made some adjustments to address critics' concerns, such as increasing reporting and evaluation requirements. HUD has made adjustments to address critics' concerns by increasing reporting and evaluation requirements for PHAs participating in the MTW program. Policymakers are considering incorporating reforms from MTW agencies into mainstream programs, including changes to inspection rules, income calculation rules, and rent policies. Both the Obama Administration and Members of Congress have proposed changes to HUD rental assistance programs that align with policies experimented with by MTW PHAs. Changes to inspection rules, income calculation rules, and rent policies are being considered, including biennial inspections, alternate sources of income documentation, higher minimum rents, and expanded authority for PHAs. There is bipartisan support for some reforms based on the MTW demonstration, but controversial policies remain, such as changing the amount of assistance and imposing conditions like time limits and work requirements. Tenant advocates and researchers have concerns about the impact of these policies on tenant outcomes."
