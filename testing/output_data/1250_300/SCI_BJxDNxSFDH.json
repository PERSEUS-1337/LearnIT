The model uses a Basis Function Learner network to encode basis functions and a Weights Generator network to generate weight vectors for tasks, outperforming current meta-learning methods in regression tasks. Regression involves learning a model that relates inputs to outputs, typically trained on a large dataset. The learned model functions as y = F(x) for regression tasks, adapting quickly with few examples. A few-shot learning model is proposed for regression tasks, reducing the degree of freedom by using sparsifying basis functions. The model includes a Basis Function Learner network for encoding basis functions. The model proposed for few-shot regression tasks reduces the degree of freedom by using sparsifying basis functions.

The paper proposes a method for few-shot regression using sparsifying basis functions learned from data. The model consists of a Basis Function Learner network and a Weights Generator network to generate predictions for regression tasks. The approach is evaluated on various tasks and shows promising results. Regression is a key topic in machine learning and signal processing. While traditionally seen as a single-task problem, a new approach reformulates regression as a few-shot learning problem. This allows the model to perform regressions on tasks from the same distribution. Meta learning, or learning to learn, is gaining attention for its ability to adapt models across different tasks. It has shown promise in various applications such as style transfer and visual navigation. Additionally, meta learning has been applied to few-shot learning, where models can learn from prior experiences to adapt to new tasks. Meta learning has been applied to few-shot learning problems, such as the one-shot classification introduced by Lake et al. (2011) using the Omniglot dataset. Various meta learning approaches aim to solve few-shot problems by learning a similarity metric or optimizing the model directly. Some methods use similarity metrics like Euclidean distance or cosine similarity, while others focus on learning how to optimize the model directly, such as learning optimal initialization for different tasks in the same distribution. In the context of few-shot learning, various approaches have been explored to optimize model performance. Finn et al. (2017) and Rusu et al. (2019) focused on learning optimal initialization and adapting model parameters effectively. Ravi & Larochelle (2016) used LSTM for optimization, while Hariharan & Girshick (2017) and Wang et al. (2018) proposed generative models. Neural Processes algorithms, like those by Garnelo et al. (2018b) and Kim et al. (2019), model output distributions using Deep Neural Networks. These methods aim to address few-shot regression tasks beyond sinusoidal and linear regression. Our model employs a deterministic approach by learning basis functions for output distribution modeling, without producing latent vectors. It compares favorably to Neural Processes in few-shot regression tasks, resembling dictionary learning in signal representation. The regression problem is similar to dictionary learning but with key differences: it is continuous, with only a small percentage of samples observed. The proposed method aims to rapidly regress to various equations and functions with few training samples, treating each equation as a task sampled from a distribution. Unlike few-shot classification, the tasks distribution is continuous for regression tasks. The regression task involves modeling the unknown function y = F(x) with a sparse representation using a small number of training samples. The function F(x) is approximated as a linear combination of basis functions, such as the Maclaurin series expansion. This approach aims to efficiently regress to various equations and functions with limited training data. The regression task involves modeling the unknown function y = F(x) with a sparse representation using a small number of training samples. The function F(x) is approximated as a linear combination of basis functions, such as the Maclaurin series expansion. Different basis functions like the Fourier basis can provide a sparse representation, allowing for accurate approximation with only a few terms. This approach reduces the degree of freedom of F(x) and enables accurate estimation with limited training data. Our approach aims to estimate the unknown function F(x) with a sparse representation using a small number of training samples. By learning a set of basis functions {\u03c6 i (x)} that can sparsely represent any task, we can reduce the degree of freedom of F(x). A Basis Function Learner Network encodes the set of {\u03c6 i (x)}, while a Weights Generator Network maps training samples to a constant vector w. The model, depicted in Figure 1, is applied to make predictions for any input x during meta-training. During meta-training, a model is applied to predict for input x using task-specific weights and learned basis functions. The loss function includes a mean-squared error term and penalties on the weight vectors to encourage sparsity and reduce variance. The full loss function resembles Elastic Net Regression. The loss function for meta learning is similar to Elastic Net Regression, with L1 and L2 regularization terms. It is used to learn parameters for the Basis Function Learner network and Weight Generator network. In this section, experiments were conducted using different regression tasks to evaluate the method. The learning rate was set to 0.001, and the Adam Optimizer was used for optimization. The experiments included tasks such as 1D Heat Equation and 2D Gaussian regression. The models were implemented using the Tensorflow library, with details provided in the following subsections. For the experiments, the Basis Function Learner for 1D Regression tasks had two fully connected layers with 40 hidden units. The model was trained on sinusoidal regression tasks with different shot cases and compared against other few-shot learning methods. In the training task, there are K \u2208 {5, 10, 20} training samples and 10 validation samples. The method is compared against various few-shot learning methods, and results are shown in Table 1. Two variants of the model are provided, differing in the size of the Weights Generator. The \"small\" model has B = 1 self-attention blocks and a fully connected layer with 40 hidden units, while the \"large\" model has B = 3 self-attention blocks and a fully connected layer with 40 hidden units. The \"large\" model consists of B = 3 self-attention blocks with weight projections of 64 dimensions followed by fully connected layers of 128 and 64 hidden units respectively. Both MAML and Meta-SGD use an architecture of 2 fully connected layers with 40 hidden units. The Neural Process family of methods uses an encoder architecture of 4 fully connected layers with 128 hidden units and a decoder architecture of 2 fully connected layers with 128 hidden units. The \"small\" model consists of 2 fully connected layers with 40 hidden units each, while the \"large\" model consists of 5 fully connected layers with 40 hidden units each. The \"large\" model consists of 5 fully connected layers with 40 hidden units each. BMAML and EMAML use 10 model instances for comparison. An ensemble version of the model is also evaluated on a sinusoidal task with increased ranges for b and \u03c9. The model is trained on 1000 tasks and evaluated for 10 shot and 5 shot cases, showing mean-squared error results in Table 2. The model is evaluated on 1000 tasks, showing mean-squared error results for 10 shot and 5 shot cases. It outperforms recent few-shot regression methods in sinusoidal tasks and is also tested on MNIST and CelebA datasets for image data comparison. During meta-training, K points are sampled from images for regression tasks. MSE is evaluated on remaining pixels. Deeper network structure is used with 5 fully connected layers for Basis Function Learner and 3 attention blocks for Weight Generator. Models are trained for 500 epochs with batch size 80. Results show our method outperforms two NP methods and is close to ANP in terms of MSE. Our method outperforms two NP methods and achieves MSE close to ANP on CelebA image data. The regression outputs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in challenging tasks. Further analysis shows that our method learns sparsifying basis functions for regression modeling, with experiments conducted on sinusoidal regression and image completion tasks. The experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the method in producing accurate regression predictions with a small number of basis functions. Ablation studies were conducted to test design choices, including the addition of self-attention operations in the Weights Generator and the impact of different penalty terms on the loss function. In ablation studies, the effects of adding self-attention operations to the model and using different penalty terms on the loss function were tested. Replacing self-attention operations with fully connected layers improved performance on the sinusoidal regression task. Different penalty terms were also compared for the generated weights vector. In an ablation study, different penalty terms were tested on the generated weights vector to improve performance on the 1D sinusoidal regression task. The combination of both L1 and L2 penalty terms showed the best performance, as demonstrated by the results in Table 5 and histograms in Figure 4. The results in Table 5 and Figure 4 demonstrate that the combination of L1 and L2 penalty terms yields the best performance for the sinusoidal regression task. Additionally, a few-shot meta learning system focusing on regression tasks is proposed, utilizing a Basis Function Learner network and Weight generator network. Competitive performance is achieved in various few-shot regression tasks, with non-zero basis functions illustrated in Figure 5. Our model demonstrates competitive performance in various few-shot regression tasks by learning sparse basis functions to represent the tasks. The basis functions correspond to different components of the sinusoidal function, with some representing peaks or troughs and others capturing the periodic nature. Additionally, experiments show the impact of removing certain basis functions from the prediction. In Section 4.3, the study demonstrates the importance of specific basis functions in prediction accuracy. By removing certain basis functions from the prediction, the results show a drastic change. The Weights Generator Network architecture includes self-attention blocks and a fully connected layer. The Weights Generator Network consists of self attention blocks followed by fully connected layers. A self attention block includes a self attention operation, two fully connected layers, a residual connection, and layer normalization. The input to the first self attention block is the input to the network, while subsequent blocks take outputs from previous blocks. The self-attention operation involves transforming input into query, key, and value vectors for a scaled dot-product self-attention operation. The curr_chunk discusses the application of a method on a 1D heat equation task, where a rod with heat sources is modeled to find the temperature at each point over time. The experiment involves setting parameters, sampling points, and evaluating the model on different shot cases. The curr_chunk discusses experiments on 2D Gaussian regression tasks, training the model to predict a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Evaluation is done on different shot cases and compared to EMAML and BMAML. The evaluation of the model on 10, 20, and 50 shot cases is presented in Table 7, with qualitative results on CelebA datasets shown in Figure 7. The regression results visually outperform NP and CNP, with predictions using the first S largest weights. The sparse linear representation framework for few shot regression is compared to dictionary learning, focusing on efficient signal representations. The few shot regression problem is compared to dictionary learning, which focuses on efficient signal representations. However, few shot regression is continuous, with only a small percentage of samples observed. Unlike dictionary learning, few shot regression aims to predict the entire continuous function y = F(x) with only a few samples given. This makes the problem more difficult and significantly different from dictionary learning. In few shot regression, the problem is more difficult and different from dictionary learning as it aims to predict a continuous function with only a few samples. The basis matrix \u03a6 has infinite entries and is encoded by the Basis Function Learner network."
