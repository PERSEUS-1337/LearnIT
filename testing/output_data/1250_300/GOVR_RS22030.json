    "content": "The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the discovery of Al Qaeda cells in Europe spurred EU efforts to combat terrorism and enhance cooperation in police, judicial, and intelligence fields. The EU aims to harmonize policies among its 28 member states to promote peace, economic prosperity, and internal security while safeguarding citizens' rights and enabling free movement within the Schengen area. The EU's Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) policies cover cross-border crimes, police cooperation, migration, and asylum issues. Initially hindered by member state concerns about sovereignty, the 2001 terrorist attacks prompted increased cooperation in tracking suspects and freezing assets. Germany and Spain were identified as key bases for the attacks, leading to a recognition of the need for improved coordination and security measures within the EU. Following the 2001 terrorist attacks, European leaders recognized the need to address the challenges posed by the EU's open borders and different legal systems. Lack of anti-terrorist legislation and slow extradition processes allowed terrorists to evade arrest by moving between countries with different laws. The EU sought to harmonize national laws against terrorism to enhance cross-border cooperation in countering terrorist threats. EU leaders recognized the need for the EU to support responses to cross-border terrorist threats post-2001 attacks. Efforts included harmonizing national laws, establishing common definitions, an EU arrest warrant, tools to combat terrorist financing, and strengthening border controls. Incidents like the 2004 Madrid bombings further drove EU initiatives to enhance counterterrorism capabilities. The 2004 Madrid bombings and 2005 London attacks spurred EU efforts to improve counterterrorism capabilities, including enhancing travel document security, intelligence sharing, and combating radicalization. EU leaders also established a Counterterrorism Coordinator and adopted a plan to disrupt terrorist activities. In December 2005, the EU adopted its first plan to combat radicalization and terrorist recruitment, with goals to disrupt terrorist networks, promote mainstream voices over extremism, and enhance security and justice. The EU expanded its definition of terrorism in 2008 to include new criminal offenses, aiming to prosecute those involved in terrorist activities and counter terrorist propaganda. In 2011, the EU established the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) to connect key groups and combat radicalization. The EU established the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) in 2011 to connect key groups involved in countering radicalization and violent extremism. Despite political commitment to enhancing EU-wide cooperation against terrorism, challenges remain in forging common EU policies due to national sovereignty concerns and differing views among member states and EU institutions on sensitive issues like data privacy and intelligence sharing. EU policymakers are concerned about the threat posed by European citizens joining terrorist groups in the Middle East and North Africa. Up to 5,000 EU citizens may have traveled to fight in conflict zones, raising fears of potential attacks in Europe. Security services are worried about trained militants returning to Europe and individuals inspired by extremist propaganda to carry out attacks at home. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have heightened these concerns. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe, such as the ones in Brussels, Paris, and Copenhagen, have raised concerns about European citizens joining extremist groups abroad and potentially carrying out \"lone wolf\" attacks at home. These attacks have been linked to individuals with ties to groups like Al Qaeda or the Islamic State. The 2015 shootings in Copenhagen, Denmark, the thwarted attack on a train from Amsterdam to Paris in August 2015, and the coordinated attacks in Paris in November 2015 have highlighted weaknesses in European security. The attackers were self-radicalized individuals with ties to Islamist extremists, some of whom had fought with the Islamic State in Syria-Iraq. European governments and the EU have been working to combat the threat of foreign fighters, but monitoring and border controls remain challenging. The EU has faced challenges in combating the foreign fighter threat, with weaknesses in domestic security and border controls exposed by recent attacks. Difficulties in monitoring potential assailants and insufficient information sharing among EU countries have been noted. Perpetrators have exploited the Schengen system and migrant influxes, traveling between European countries before attacks. Some attackers entered Europe through Greece using fake Syrian passports. The EU has faced challenges in combating the foreign fighter threat, with weaknesses in domestic security and border controls exposed by recent attacks. Perpetrators have exploited the Schengen system and migrant influxes, traveling between European countries before attacks. Two perpetrators who died during the November attacks entered Europe through Greece with fake Syrian passports. Another suspect in the Paris attacks entered Belgium from France the morning after but remains at large. Implementing common EU policies to counter terrorism has been challenging due to sovereignty issues and the need to balance security with human rights. The EU has made progress on initiatives to address the foreign fighter threat, but some analysts are skeptical about their effectiveness. The EU has made progress on initiatives to address the evolving foreign fighter threat, including enhancing information sharing through common EU databases and the establishment of the European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC) for operational cooperation among member states. Success of these initiatives depends on receiving information from national authorities. The EU has been working on monitoring and investigating foreign terrorist fighters, illegal firearms trafficking, and terrorist financing. There have been efforts to increase information sharing through common EU databases, but some experts believe that EU-wide information sharing related to terrorism is still lacking. The establishment of an EU-wide System for the Collection of Airline Passenger Name Record (PNR) Data has been delayed due to data privacy concerns, but there is political pressure to adopt it following the 2015 attacks in Paris. EU officials argue that an EU PNR system would help track foreign fighters and identify unknown terrorist suspects. EU governments are pushing for an EU-wide PNR system to share information on foreign fighters and track their movements. The system aims to harmonize PNR collection practices across member states. Critics raise concerns about data privacy infringement and inadequate protection measures. EU governments are working towards implementing an EU-wide PNR system to track foreign fighters and their movements. Critics argue that the system may violate data privacy rights and lacks a centralized EU PNR database. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the need to strengthen external EU border controls in response to the foreign fighter threat. In response to the surge of migrants and refugees in Europe and the Paris attacks, the European Commission proposed modifications to the Schengen Borders Code. This includes mandatory checks of EU citizens against law enforcement databases at external borders and the establishment of a European Border and Coast Guard. Concerns about infringing on national sovereignty have hindered past efforts to establish an EU border guard corps. The EU is working on establishing an \"EU border guard corps\" to enhance border security and prevent radicalization. Efforts include monitoring and removing terrorist content online, developing communication strategies, and revising the Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism. The EU is revising its Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to criminalize traveling for terrorist purposes and receiving terrorist training across all member states. Harmonizing criminal laws has faced challenges due to differing national policies, but updating the common terrorism definition is necessary to comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178. The EU is updating its terrorism definition to align with U.N. Resolution 2178, focusing on prosecuting foreign fighter-related offenses. This initiative aims to enhance cooperation with the U.S. in combating terrorism and strengthening law enforcement efforts. The U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism has strengthened dialogue on law enforcement and homeland security issues. The partnership is viewed positively by most U.S. policymakers and analysts, with support from the Obama Administration. The EU is a key partner in the Global Counterterrorism Forum, focusing on mobilizing resources to counter violent extremism and enhance international cooperation against terrorism. The U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism has focused on combating the foreign fighter phenomenon, with concerns about European and American Muslims joining Islamist groups in Syria and Iraq. U.S. officials have emphasized the need for shared strategies to address the influx of violent extremists. In September 2014, the U.S. and EU officials collaborated on measures to enhance counter-radicalization and border security to address the foreign fighter threat. EU countries supported U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178 to combat the global foreign fighter phenomenon. After the Paris attacks in January 2015, the U.S. Attorney General joined European and North American ministers to discuss terrorist threats and foreign fighters. European and EU officials also participated in a conference on countering violent extremism hosted by the United States in February 2015. An emergency meeting of European and North American interior ministers and high-ranking EU officials discussed terrorist threats and foreign fighters. US officials urged European governments to enhance information exchanges and utilize existing EU-wide databases. President Obama called on the EU to implement agreements to share passenger information to prevent foreign terrorist fighters from entering undetected. Close law enforcement ties with European allies and existing US-EU information-sharing arrangements are crucial in combating the foreign fighter phenomenon. The foreign fighter phenomenon highlights the importance of close law enforcement ties with European allies and existing U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements. Challenges in the U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship include data privacy concerns, detainee policies, differences in terrorist designation lists, and balancing border security with facilitating transatlantic travel and commerce. U.S. legislation passed in December 2015 aimed to strengthen the security of the U.S. Visa Waiver Program in response to concerns about Europeans involved in terrorist activities. The U.S. legislation passed in December 2015 aimed to strengthen the security of the U.S. Visa Waiver Program in response to concerns about Europeans involved in terrorist activities. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on police, judicial, and border control policy matters have increased substantially since 2001, playing a crucial role in developing closer U.S.-EU ties. The U.S. Departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security, and the Treasury have been actively engaged in this process, meeting with their EU counterparts regularly to discuss cooperation against terrorism and terrorist financing. The United States and the EU have established regular dialogues on terrorist financing, border and transport security, and critical infrastructure protection. U.S. and EU agencies have reciprocal liaison relationships, with Europol and U.S. federal law enforcement agencies collaborating on counterterrorism and international crimes. This cooperation has led to operational successes in countering transnational crimes. Europol collaborates with U.S. law enforcement agencies on approximately 500 cases a year, leading to successes in countering transnational crimes. A U.S. liaison works at Eurojust headquarters in The Hague to facilitate cooperation on terrorism and cross-border criminal cases. U.S.-EU efforts against terrorism have resulted in agreements to improve police and judicial cooperation, including sharing strategic and personal information. U.S.-EU negotiations on sharing personal information were challenging due to concerns about data protection standards. Negotiations between the U.S. and EU on personal information sharing were challenging due to data protection concerns. The EU prioritizes privacy rights and restricts law enforcement access to personal data. In 2007, a security agreement was signed to exchange classified information. In 2010, extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties were ratified to streamline cooperation between the U.S. and EU. The U.S. and EU signed treaties in 2003 to harmonize existing bilateral accords, simplify extradition, and enhance information-sharing to combat terrorism and transnational crimes. Challenges included the U.S. agreeing not to extradite suspects facing the death penalty and not guaranteeing extradition of any EU national. The extradition accord modernizes existing agreements, streamlines information exchange, and sets rules for competing extradition requests. The extradition accord between the U.S. and EU modernizes existing agreements, streamlines information exchange, and sets rules for competing extradition requests. The MLA treaty allows U.S. authorities access to European financial information, speeds up request processing, permits evidence acquisition by video conferencing, and allows U.S. participation in joint EU investigations. Critics question the utility of collaborating with EU-wide bodies, citing existing bilateral relations between agencies and national services in EU member states. Europol's effectiveness depends on national services providing information, while European officials complain about the U.S. expecting intelligence. The United States and EU cooperate on law enforcement, with some challenges such as differing views on the death penalty and extradition. Despite these issues, both sides are committed to enhancing cooperation, as seen in agreements signed in 2015 to combat foreign fighters and illegal immigration. They also work together to track and stop terrorist financing globally through organizations like the Financial Action Task Force. The United States and the EU collaborate to track and suppress terrorist financing globally. They work together through organizations like the Financial Action Task Force and have an agreement allowing U.S. access to financial data from SWIFT. This partnership has generated thousands of investigative leads, aiding in the prevention of terrorist attacks in Europe. However, the sharing of SWIFT data remains controversial in Europe due to privacy concerns. The EU maintains two lists of terrorist organizations and individuals, one focusing on Al Qaeda and the Taliban, and the other on non-affiliated entities. The composition of the second list, known as the EU's \"common terrorist list,\" has been controversial at times due to ongoing data privacy concerns in Europe. The EU's \"common terrorist list\" includes over 80 individuals or entities worldwide, with different law enforcement measures applied based on whether they are considered \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. All EU member states are required to freeze assets, restrict financial resources, and provide law enforcement assistance for \"external\" persons and groups, while measures for \"internal\" entities are focused on EU territory. The EU's common terrorist list includes individuals and entities worldwide. Law enforcement measures differ for \"external\" and \"internal\" entities. All EU member states must freeze assets, restrict financial resources, and provide law enforcement assistance for \"external\" entities. For \"internal\" entities, inclusion on the list subjects them to strengthened police cooperation measures. Unanimous agreement among EU member states is required to add or remove entities from the list. The United States and other countries have successfully lobbied the EU to add organizations like PKK, FARC, Hamas, and Hezbollah to the list. The United States has also designated members of ETA as terrorists. The EU's common terrorist list includes various individuals and entities worldwide. The United States has influenced the EU to add organizations like PKK, FARC, Hamas, and Hezbollah to the list. However, there are frictions in fully harmonizing the U.S. and EU terrorist designation lists, particularly regarding Hamas-related charities and the inclusion of Hezbollah. EU member states have been divided on whether to blacklist Hezbollah at the EU level. The United States considers Hezbollah a foreign terrorist organization and applies sanctions to the group. Some EU countries support adding Hezbollah to the EU's common list, while others argue it could harm relations with Lebanon. In 2012-2013, there was a renewed debate within the EU on Hezbollah's inclusion on the terrorist list. In 2012-2013, events like the Burgas bombing and Hezbollah's involvement in Syria prompted calls for the EU to add Hezbollah to its terrorist list. In July 2013, the EU agreed to list Hezbollah's military wing as a compromise, avoiding destabilizing Lebanon. The EU agreed to add Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list as a compromise, avoiding destabilizing Lebanon. This decision was seen as symbolic, sending a message that terrorist activities would endanger Hezbollah's legitimacy as a political actor. Experts hoped the designation would prompt EU governments to investigate activities tied to Hezbollah's military wing. The EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, hoping to prompt investigations into their activities. Critics argued that this was insufficient as Hezbollah could still fundraise in Europe. The US urged Europe to take proactive action following the Burgas bombing, calling for the disruption of Hezbollah's financing schemes. Members of Congress also pushed for Hezbollah to be added to the EU's terrorist list. In response to the Burgas bombing, US officials and Members of Congress urged the EU to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization and impose sanctions. The EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, a move welcomed by the US. Data privacy remains a key issue between the US and EU, with the EU emphasizing the protection of personal data as a human right. EU data privacy regulations set common rules for public and private entities in the EU that hold or transmit personal data, prohibiting data transfer to countries without adequate legal protections. Concerns have been raised in U.S.-EU information-sharing accords about the protection of European citizens' personal data, with some arguing that U.S.-EU agreements violate privacy rights. Unauthorized disclosures of U.S. surveillance programs have strained transatlantic trust and heightened EU worries about U.S. data protection safeguards. The disclosure of U.S. surveillance programs has strained transatlantic trust and raised concerns about data protection safeguards in the EU. Analysts are worried about the future of U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements, especially with opposition from MEPs. The European Parliament has expressed serious concerns and established a working group to investigate alleged U.S. surveillance activities. The European Parliament's working group, chaired by Claude Moraes, criticized the NSA's mass surveillance programs in the \"Moraes report.\" It called for revisions to U.S. legislation to protect the privacy rights of EU citizens and urged the timely conclusion of negotiations on the U.S.-EU Data Privacy and Protection Agreement. The Parliament's resolution on the report is not binding but reflects its concerns. The European Parliament's resolution on the \"Moraes report\" calls for stronger data protection reforms for EU citizens, including safeguards for data transferred outside the EU. New data protection rules were agreed upon in December 2015, with concerns raised by U.S. officials about potential impacts on law enforcement cooperation and U.S. companies. U.S. officials have reassured EU leaders that surveillance activities comply with U.S. law. Leaders are concerned that new provisions may hinder U.S.-European law enforcement cooperation and burden U.S. companies. U.S. officials assure EU leaders that surveillance activities comply with U.S. law and are overseen by all branches of government. Efforts are being made to address EU concerns and improve transparency to maintain support for agreements. A U.S.-EU working group was established to discuss NSA surveillance operations, including the PRISM program, and assess their impact on EU citizens' privacy rights. The European Commission issued a report with recommendations to address European concerns about data flows and restore transatlantic trust. The European Commission issued a report with recommendations to address U.S.-EU data flows and restore transatlantic trust. Legislation was enacted to provide EU citizens with the right to pursue redress in U.S. courts for law enforcement data privacy violations. Controversy over Europe's role in the U.S. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program dates back to 2006. Controversy arose in 2006 over Europe's involvement in the U.S. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, which allowed U.S. access to SWIFT financial data. Despite assurances from U.S. officials that data was only used for counterterrorism, concerns remained about privacy and data protection. In 2009, changes to SWIFT's systems led to a new U.S.-EU agreement for data sharing, and in November 2009, a new accord was reached between the European Commission and the United States on SWIFT. In 2009, changes to SWIFT's systems led to a new U.S.-EU agreement for data sharing. The European Parliament rejected the new version of the U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement in 2010 due to concerns about data privacy and civil liberties. Negotiations began for a revised U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement in May 2010. In May 2010, negotiations began for a revised U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement to address concerns about data privacy and civil liberties. Key concerns included guaranteeing judicial remedy for European citizens in the U.S. and the use of \"bulk data\" transfers. A new draft SWIFT agreement was concluded in June 2010, providing for administrative and legal redress for EU citizens in the U.S. and giving Europol authority over U.S. Treasury Department requests for SWIFT data. Some MEPs remained unhappy with certain provisions. The final iteration of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord was approved by the European Parliament on July 8, 2010, with 484 votes to 109 and 12 abstentions. The agreement included provisions for an independent observer in Washington, DC, to oversee the extraction of SWIFT data and required the European Commission to present plans for a European equivalent to the U.S. TFTP within a year. The European Parliament approved the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord on July 8, 2010, for a five-year period. Concerns were raised about the EU's role in the U.S. TFTP and the implementation of the SWIFT accord. Recommendations were made to make the TFTP more transparent, including providing more information to Europol in writing. A second review in December 2012 concluded that the TFTP had concrete benefits in fighting terrorism. In December 2012, a second review of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord concluded that it had concrete benefits in fighting terrorism. Concerns were raised in October 2013 about U.S. surveillance activities in Europe, leading to calls for the suspension of the agreement. The European Parliament passed a nonbinding resolution calling for the suspension of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord, but actual suspension would require further action. SWIFT data has been valuable in counterterrorism efforts, including during the 2012 London Olympics and in investigating threats from EU nationals training with extremist groups in Syria and Iraq. In 2004, an agreement was reached allowing airlines to provide passenger data to U.S. authorities. The United States and the EU had a controversial Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement, which was annulled by the EU Court of Justice in 2006. However, in 2007, a new seven-year agreement was reached to transfer PNR data, with provisions allowing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to share data for counterterrorism efforts. The new PNR agreement between the United States and the EU allows for sharing PNR data for counterterrorism efforts. Key provisions include extending data storage time to 15 years, accessing sensitive passenger information, and requiring airlines to send data 72 hours before a flight. The agreement reduced the number of data fields collected from 34 to 19. However, the European Parliament had concerns about the amount of data transferred, data retention time, and redress for possible data misuse. Many MEPs objected to key elements of the 2007 US-EU PNR agreement, such as the amount of data transferred, data retention time, and lack of redress for data misuse. Concerns were also raised about potential data mining by US authorities. The European Parliament postponed its vote on the agreement in May 2010, calling for a \"global external PNR strategy\" from the European Commission. This strategy proposed that PNR data should only be used for combating terrorism and serious crimes, leading to calls for renegotiation of PNR agreements with the US, Australia, and Canada. The EU proposed an \"external PNR strategy\" for agreements with the US, Australia, and Canada, focusing on using PNR data for combating terrorism and serious crimes. The strategy emphasized passenger rights, limited data exchange, and data retention limits. The European Parliament supported the strategy in 2010, calling for necessary and proportional data exchange, no data mining or profiling, and exploring less intrusive alternatives. Despite initial US hesitance, negotiations on the PNR accord were reopened. The Obama Administration agreed to reopen negotiations on the PNR accord with the EU in 2010. U.S. officials maintained that the 2007 accord protected data and privacy rights, and any revised agreement should not compromise operational effectiveness. They also emphasized the importance of not invalidating existing bilateral PNR deals with EU member states. In mid-May 2011, resolutions were introduced in the House and passed in the Senate supporting the existing 2007 U.S.-EU PNR accord. The United States and the European Commission concluded negotiations on a revised PNR agreement in late May 2011, which included new provisions to enhance passenger data protection. The revised U.S.-EU PNR agreement in May 2011 aimed to enhance passenger data protection by depersonalizing and masking data, reducing storage time, and limiting access. It provided legal certainty on passenger rights and clarified that boarding decisions would not be based solely on automated processing. Despite revisions, some MEPs were unsatisfied as the agreement still allowed the U.S. to retain data for up to 15 years, did not reduce data transfer amounts, and increased the time airlines had to transmit data to U.S. authorities. The U.S.-EU PNR agreement in May 2011 aimed to enhance passenger data protection by depersonalizing and masking data, reducing storage time, and limiting access. However, some MEPs were concerned that the agreement allowed the U.S. to retain data for up to 15 years, did not reduce data transfer amounts, and increased the time airlines had to transmit data to U.S. authorities. In November 2011, a new draft PNR agreement was concluded between the United States and the EU, addressing data security concerns and passenger rights. The agreement included limitations on the use of PNR data for serious crimes and varying retention times based on the type of crime. Despite some concerns from EU member states and MEPs, the new U.S.-EU PNR agreement was approved in December 2011. EU member states approved the new U.S.-EU PNR agreement, with Germany and Austria abstaining due to concerns over data retention and redress provisions. Some MEPs also had reservations, but others supported the agreement citing stronger data protection guarantees. The full Parliament later approved the agreement on April 19, 2012, with U.S. officials welcoming the endorsement as a commitment to countering terrorism. The U.S.-EU PNR agreement was approved by the full Parliament on April 19, 2012, with U.S. officials welcoming the endorsement. The agreement was officially adopted by the EU on April 26, 2012, and entered into force on August 8, 2012. It will be valid for seven years and can be renewed for another seven years. In November 2013, the European Commission published the results of a joint review of the PNR program, stating that it is an efficient tool to fight terrorism and serious crimes. Some MEPs have raised concerns about U.S. data protection safeguards following allegations of surveillance activities. Some MEPs have raised questions about the U.S.-EU PNR program due to concerns about data protection safeguards following surveillance allegations. U.S. officials seek easier negotiations with the EU for data-sharing agreements. Washington aims to establish an umbrella agreement for future accords. The EU sought an umbrella agreement with the US on data privacy standards to facilitate future data-sharing agreements in law enforcement. The European Parliament and Commission proposed a framework to protect personal data exchanged in the fight against terrorism and crime. The Commission's mandate was approved by EU member states in December 2010. The EU and the United States began negotiations on a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) in March 2011 to facilitate the transfer of personal data for law enforcement purposes. The agreement aimed to ensure mutual recognition of data protection systems while protecting citizens' rights to privacy and civil liberties. Progress was reported in June 2012, with a focus on data security provisions. The DPPA negotiations between the EU and the United States focused on data security, transparency, and oversight. Controversial issues included purpose limitation, retention times, and redress for EU citizens. The lack of judicial redress for European citizens in the U.S. was a major stumbling block in the negotiations. The DPPA negotiations between the EU and the United States were stalled due to the lack of judicial redress for European citizens. However, the revelations of U.S. surveillance activities in 2013 injected renewed momentum into the discussions. The European Parliament called for the negotiations to resume without delay, emphasizing the need for transatlantic trust and urging the U.S. to provide EU citizens with the right to judicial redress for privacy violations. Attorney General Holder announced the Obama Administration's commitment to seeking legislation to conclude the DPPA negotiations. The Obama Administration announced its commitment to seeking legislation to ensure EU citizens have the same judicial redress rights as U.S. citizens under the proposed DPPA. This decision aimed to restore EU trust in U.S. data privacy commitments. U.S. and EU negotiators finalized the DPPA text in September 2015, but the EU required U.S. judicial redress legislation before signing. In March 2015, Representatives Sensenbrenner and Conyers introduced the Judicial Redress Act to meet EU demands and facilitate DPPA conclusion. U.S. judicial redress legislation, known as the Judicial Redress Act, was introduced to extend privacy protections to citizens of covered countries or regional organizations like the EU. This legislation became significant after the EU invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement in October 2015. The Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement due to inadequate data protection and lack of judicial remedies for EU citizens in the U.S. The Judicial Redress Act was introduced to address European concerns and strengthen confidence in the new \"Privacy Shield\" agreement. The Judicial Redress Act in the U.S. legislation is not equivalent to Privacy Act protections for U.S. persons and residents. It pertains to information transferred in a law enforcement context and its impact on meeting EU \"adequacy\" standards or easing concerns about U.S. government access to personal data in the commercial sector is unclear. H.R. 1428 passed the House on October 20, 2015, and was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 28, 2016, with an amendment by Senator John Cornyn. The amended version passed the Senate on February 9, 2016. The Judicial Redress Act, signed into law on February 24, 2016, is seen as crucial for the U.S.-EU Data Protection and Privacy Agreement (DPPA). The EU welcomed the act, stating it will help restore trust in transatlantic data flows. Approval of the DPPA by EU member states and the European Parliament is needed for it to take effect. Cooperation between the U.S. and EU on border security is emphasized, with thousands of passengers and commercial containers arriving daily from Europe at U.S. ports of entry. The United States and the EU have emphasized cooperation in border control and aviation and maritime security. They have worked on agreements to enhance international information exchanges on passports and promote the use of biometric identifiers for travel document security. Collaboration between the two sides has led to strengthening aviation security measures worldwide and improving cargo security and global supply chain security. In June 2011, they reaffirmed their commitment to bolster supply chain security and foster greater global security. In June 2011, the United States and the EU reaffirmed their commitment to improving cargo security and global supply chain security. Both sides continue to address the balance between border security and facilitating transatlantic travel and commerce. Recent incidents have highlighted the importance of aviation and air cargo security in U.S.-EU discussions. The thwarted October 2010 \"Yemen bomb plot\" involved Chicago-bound printer cartridge packages containing explosives shipped from Yemen. U.S. authorities tightened rules for carrying electronic devices on international U.S.-bound flights in July 2014 due to fears of Al Qaeda-linked groups using devices to disguise explosives. U.S. and EU have collaborated on aviation security measures since 2001, addressing gaps in policies for transatlantic flights. EU countries objected to new U.S. rules requiring armed air marshals on certain flights to and from the United States; U.S. officials pledged to consider alternative measures for European countries opposed to armed air marshals. In 2008, the United States and the EU agreed to coordinate air cargo security measures, including 100% screening of cargo on passenger flights. In June 2012, they reached an air cargo security partnership to recognize each other's security regimes, eliminating duplication of controls. The U.S. and EU have agreed to recognize each other's air cargo security regimes, aiming to enhance cargo security, save time and money for operators, and improve transatlantic shipments. They will exchange information on security regime evolution and implementation. Despite shared goals, some differences in perspective remain, such as the U.S. accelerating body scanner installations post-2009 attack. Despite shared goals, some differences in perspective remain between the U.S. and EU regarding the installation of body scanners at airports. While the U.S. accelerated their installation post-2009 attack, some EU member states were hesitant due to privacy and health concerns. In July 2011, the European Parliament approved the use of body scanners at EU airports with safeguards in place, including producing stick figure images only and allowing passengers to opt for a manual search. The European Parliament approved the use of body scanners at EU airports with safeguards in place, including producing stick figure images only and allowing passengers to opt for a manual search. In November 2011, the European Commission adopted these conditions for setting common standards, but member states are not required to deploy such scanners. Some EU officials and European Parliamentarians have concerns about body scanners at U.S. airports, but in January 2013, the U.S. TSA announced the removal of full-body scanners that produce revealing images. The TSA and EU use different body scanner technologies, with concerns over privacy rights. The US and EU have worked to harmonize liquid restrictions in carry-on baggage, but the EU plans to eliminate these restrictions by 2013. US policymakers have doubts about the effectiveness of current liquid screening technology. In 2010, the EU announced plans to eliminate liquid restrictions in cabin baggage by April 2013, but concerns about security and potential flight delays led to a postponement. In January 2014, the EU lifted restrictions on \"duty-free\" liquids and gels, aiming to end all restrictions by January 2016. The US and EU signed a customs cooperation accord in April 2004, including extending the US Container Security Initiative throughout the EU. The United States and the European Union signed a customs cooperation accord in April 2004, extending the U.S. Container Security Initiative (CSI) throughout the EU. CSI stations U.S. customs officers in foreign ports to pre-screen U.S.-bound maritime cargo containers for dangerous substances. In May 2012, they agreed to recognize each other's trusted shipper programs to improve supply chain security and trade opportunities for trusted traders. The U.S. and EU signed a customs cooperation accord in 2004, extending the U.S. Container Security Initiative throughout the EU. This agreement aims to lower costs and simplify procedures for trusted traders, allowing customs authorities to focus on risky consignments. Tensions arose over a provision for 100% container scanning, with EU officials deeming it unrealistic and costly. U.S. policymakers shared concerns about the effectiveness and financial burden of such scanning, highlighting existing programs to identify high-risk cargo. In 2012, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security extended the 100% scanning deadline for cargo shipments by two years, with an additional two-year extension announced in 2014. Proponents argue that current manifest data is insufficient for determining risk. Tensions between the U.S. and EU have also arisen over the Visa Waiver Program, with new EU members excluded for years due to meeting requirements. Following the EU's enlargement in 2004, new EU members were eager to join the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), but most were excluded for years due to not meeting statutory requirements. Congress passed the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53) to strengthen the VWP's security components and allow more EU members to qualify, despite concerns about security post-9/11. The 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53) made changes to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to enhance security and expand eligibility for EU members. It required countries to meet security standards, share information, and submit biographical data through ESTA. The Act also allowed waivers for admission requirements, enabling new EU states to join. Currently, 23 out of 28 EU member states are part of the VWP, with efforts ongoing to include the remaining five. In 2014, a revised EU reciprocity mechanism aimed to achieve full visa reciprocity with the United States and other countries. The EU implemented a revised reciprocity mechanism in 2014 to achieve visa reciprocity with the US and other countries. The European Commission can suspend visa-free travel for a third country if reciprocity is not met. Concerns have been raised about Europeans fighting in Syria and Iraq being able to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program. The Obama Administration supports the VWP despite these concerns. Many Members of Congress are alarmed by Europeans fighting in Syria and Iraq who can easily return to their home countries and enter the US without a visa. The Obama Administration supports the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) for transatlantic commerce and tourism. Enhanced security measures have been implemented for VWP travelers, including additional biographic information and new screening requirements. Concerns about VWP security were heightened after the 2015 Paris attacks, leading to further changes to strengthen the program's security controls. The Obama Administration announced changes to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to enhance security controls, including capturing past travel to terrorist safe havens. Congress passed legislation prohibiting individuals who traveled to certain countries from entering the US under the VWP without a visitor visa. The legislation prohibits individuals who have traveled to certain countries from entering the US under the VWP without a visitor visa. This includes Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Sudan since March 1, 2011. Dual nationals of these countries must also obtain a visitor visa. Additionally, VWP participant countries must issue electronic passports and implement screening protocols. EU officials are concerned about the new requirements, arguing they could create a de facto visa regime and discriminate against dual nationals. Many European policymakers and EU leaders are troubled by the new VWP requirements, arguing they could create a de facto visa regime and discriminate against dual nationals. U.S. officials defend the exemptions provided in the new law for government and military personnel, with the Secretary of DHS having the authority to waive exclusion on a case-by-case basis. Concerns have been raised about reciprocal measures, potentially restricting visa-free travel to Europe for U.S. citizens. Members of Congress also express worries about discrimination in the new VWP legislation related to dual nationals. EU leaders and Members of Congress are concerned about potential reciprocal measures, such as restricting visa-free travel for U.S. citizens to Europe. Legislation has been introduced to address discrimination against dual nationals in the Visa Waiver Program. Both U.S. and European officials emphasize the importance of balancing freedom and security without compromising civil liberties and human rights standards. The treatment of suspected terrorist detainees has been a point of tension between the U.S. and Europe. The treatment of suspected terrorist detainees has been a point of tension between the U.S. and Europe, with U.S. policies such as Guantanamo Bay, military commissions, and enhanced interrogation techniques facing criticism. European leaders viewed these policies as breaching international and European law. The practice of extraordinary rendition and possible CIA detention facilities in Europe also raised concerns and led to investigations. Many European leaders and analysts criticized U.S. terrorist detainee and interrogation policies as violating international and European law, degrading human rights values, and hindering efforts to counter terrorism. The Bush Administration defended these policies as crucial in fighting terrorism and denied human rights violations. Frictions between the U.S. and EU over detainee policies have eased under the Obama Administration. EU officials welcomed Obama's plan to close Guantanamo in 2009. The Obama Administration faced challenges in closing the Guantanamo detention facility, with some EU countries accepting released detainees while others declined. Congressional opposition and reluctance from other countries, including in Europe, hindered efforts to transfer detainees. The Obama Administration has struggled to close Guant\u00e1namo due to challenges from other countries and Congressional opposition. In March 2011, President Obama signed an executive order allowing indefinite detention for some detainees deemed too dangerous to release. European policymakers fear Guant\u00e1namo serves as a recruiting tool for terrorist groups. The Obama Administration has faced challenges in closing Guant\u00e1namo due to opposition from Congress and other countries. European policymakers are concerned about the facility's impact as a recruiting tool for terrorist groups. In response to these concerns, in May 2013, the European Parliament adopted a resolution expressing worry for hunger-striking detainees at Guant\u00e1namo and calling for the facility's closure. President Obama has reiterated his commitment to shutting down Guant\u00e1namo, with Congress passing measures in the FY2014 defense authorization bill to ease restrictions on transferring low-risk detainees to other countries. However, further restrictions remain in place preventing the transfer of detainees to U.S. prisons for trial in U.S. courts. President Obama sent a proposal to Congress in February 2016 to close the Guant\u00e1namo detention facility before the end of his term. Out of almost 800 detainees, 147 have been resettled overseas, while 91 remain at Guant\u00e1namo as of February 2016. European concerns about U.S. detainee policies have been raised by the European Parliament. The European Parliament has been vocal about investigating EU member states' involvement in hosting CIA detention facilities and aiding rendition flights. In 2015, they directed committees to resume investigations following a U.S. Senate report on CIA programs, calling for cooperation in prosecuting human rights violations. The U.S. Senate released a report on the CIA's detention and interrogation programs, prompting calls for investigations and prosecutions of human rights violations. Concerns arise over potential risks to U.S.-European intelligence cooperation due to allegations of U.S. wrongdoing and rendition-related proceedings in EU states. Despite initial skepticism, efforts to enhance U.S.-EU collaboration against terrorism have been supported since the 2001 attacks. The George W. Bush Administration prioritized U.S.-EU collaboration on police and judicial matters despite concerns about weakening bilateral relationships with EU member states. Improved cooperation aimed to enhance border controls, track suspected terrorists, and prevent their entry into the U.S. or Europe. However, differences in competencies and policy preferences between the EU and the U.S. complicate counterterrorism efforts, leading to potential frictions in negotiations. The United States and the EU prioritize cooperation in counterterrorism, law enforcement, border controls, and transport security. Despite occasional tensions, both sides are committed to closer collaboration. U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism is crucial in combating threats from Western foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. Aviation and cargo security, border control measures, and visa policy are key issues for Congress affecting future cooperation. In the 113th and 114th Congresses, hearings focused on threats from Western foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. Congress passed the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 to enhance security controls. Intelligence reforms and data privacy laws could impact U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation. Changes to U.S. surveillance laws will be closely monitored in Europe. The U.S. Judicial Redress Act was welcomed by EU officials for improving trust in information-sharing arrangements. The U.S. Judicial Redress Act (P.L. 114-126) is seen as a positive step towards finalizing the U.S.-EU Data Privacy and Protection Agreement. It aims to rebuild trust in transatlantic data flows. Members of Congress have engaged in dialogue with the European Parliament on surveillance practices and data privacy rights. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner testified before the European Parliament on potential changes to U.S. surveillance laws, urging cooperation for balanced efforts in protecting nations. The European Parliament and U.S. Congress have engaged in dialogue on surveillance practices and data privacy rights. Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Mike Rogers led congressional delegations to Europe to discuss U.S. intelligence activities. The Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue aims to strengthen ties between the two bodies for enhanced cooperation on counterterrorism issues. The European Parliament and U.S. Congress are interested in strengthening ties and cooperation on counterterrorism issues. This could enhance transatlantic dialogue on a wide range of security matters."
