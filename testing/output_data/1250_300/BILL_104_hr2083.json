    "content": "The Act titled \"Tax Reduction and Economic Growth Act of 1995\" allows for tax reduction in the event of low growth. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must notify the President and Congress if economic growth is below 1.5% and national unemployment is above 6.5% for specific periods. After notification of economic conditions, the President may declare temporary tax reductions for a specified calendar year to stimulate the economy. This declaration must be transmitted to Congress, and if approved, temporary income tax reductions will be effective for the specified year. The President can declare temporary tax reductions for a specific calendar year to stimulate the economy. The rates for the first income bracket in the tax tables will be reduced by up to 3%, and tax amounts will be adjusted accordingly. Withholding tables will be modified to reflect the full-year effect of the reduction through withholding reductions. The President can declare temporary tax reductions for a specific calendar year to stimulate the economy. Withholding tables will be modified to reflect the full-year effect of the reduction through withholding reductions. In the first subsequent calendar year where economic growth requirements are met, tax rates in the tax tables will be increased by a certain percentage. Tax rates for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income below $50,000 and joint filers below $75,000 will not exceed prior year rates after a temporary tax reduction. Withholding tables will be adjusted to reflect the increased tax rates for the subsequent calendar year. The tax withholding tables will be modified to reflect the increased tax rates under clause (i). Economic growth requirements are met if GDP growth is over 4.5% and national unemployment is below 5.5%. The percentage increase in tax rates is determined based on the Internal Revenue Code. The percentage increase in tax rates is determined based on the Internal Revenue Code, with the President estimating the aggregate increase in receipts to offset the decrease caused by certain factors. The tax rates for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income below certain thresholds will not be increased above the prior year's rates. The percentage will be published in the Federal Register before the start of the relevant calendar year. SEC. 3. Treatment under pay-as-you-go procedures: Any changes in receipts from this Act will not affect the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985."
