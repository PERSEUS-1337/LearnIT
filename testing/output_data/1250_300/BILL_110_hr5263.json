    "content": "The Forest Landscape Restoration Act aims to promote collaborative ecosystem restoration of priority forest landscapes, emphasizing ecological, economic, and social sustainability. It seeks to leverage local, national, and private resources to reduce wildfire management costs and demonstrate the effectiveness of ecological restoration techniques. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act defines key terms such as \"covered Federal lands,\" \"Fund,\" \"program,\" and \"Secretaries.\" It establishes the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program under the joint authority of the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, established by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture, selects and funds ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes. Activities must comply with the Endangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act. Eligible proposals must have a complete landscape restoration strategy for a 10-year period on at least 50,000 acres of primarily forested Federal lands. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program funds restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes over a 10-year period on at least 50,000 acres of primarily forested Federal lands. The treatments must incorporate the best available science and tools in ecological restoration strategies. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program funds restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes on primarily forested Federal lands. The restoration strategies must meet requirements for old-growth maintenance, large-tree retention, and ecological restoration projects on covered Federal lands. The process must be collaborative, transparent, and successful in planning and implementing restoration projects. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program funds restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes on primarily forested Federal lands. The program requires successful planning and implementation of ecological restoration projects on covered Federal lands. Plans include using fire for ecological restoration, improving wildlife habitat, maintaining water quality, controlling invasive species, decommissioning roads, utilizing woody biomass, and reporting annually on performance. Additionally, the program aims to develop small business incubators. The 10 Year Comprehensive Strategy Implementation Plan from December 2006 aims to develop small business incubators in rural communities, providing employment and training opportunities through various entities. It also considers community wildfire protection plans. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must consider community wildfire protection plans, analyze cost savings, estimate annual Federal funding needed, leverage non-Federal investment, and comply with additional requirements determined by the Secretaries for efficient administration. The proposal must be submitted to the Director for the nomination process. The nomination process for collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals involves submission to the Bureau of Land Management Director and Regional Forester, nomination by State Director or Regional Forester, and documentation of proposals for selection by the Secretaries. The State Director or Regional Forester making the nomination for collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals must include a proposal to use Federal funds for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands. Evidence must be provided that funds transferred to the Secretaries will be used for restoration treatments consistent with the landscape strategy. The selection process for collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals involves consultation with scientific and technical advisory panels to ensure that Federal funds allocated for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands are used in accordance with the landscape strategy. Additionally, evidence must be provided that non-covered Federal landowners intend to participate and provide funding for activities on their land. The Secretaries will select collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals based on ecological restoration strategies, collaborative process strength, and cost reduction potential. Special consideration will be given to proposals nominated under subsection (d)(2) and meeting eligibility criteria. The Secretaries will select collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals based on ecological restoration strategies, collaborative process strength, cost reduction potential, and leveraging non-Federal investment. They may fund up to 10 proposals per fiscal year and 2 proposals per region in the National Forest System. Advisory panels, including a scientific advisory panel, will be established. The Secretaries will select up to 2 collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals per region in the National Forest System per fiscal year. Advisory panels, including a scientific advisory panel and a technical advisory panel, will evaluate the proposals based on ecological restoration strategies and potential cost reductions. The Secretaries may establish a technical advisory panel of experts in rural business development and woody biomass to evaluate proposals for reducing costs and providing local economic benefits. A Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund is established to cover up to 50% of ecological restoration costs on Federal lands for selected proposals. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund covers up to 50% of ecological restoration costs on Federal lands for selected proposals. The Fund is authorized to receive $40,000,000 annually from 2008 to 2018, with expenditures determined by the Secretaries for restoration treatments. An accounting and reporting system will be established for the Fund. Authorization of appropriations for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund is set at $40,000,000 annually from 2008 to 2018. Within 180 days of selecting a proposal, a work plan and budget must be created by the Secretaries in collaboration with stakeholders, detailing implementation strategies and cost projections. The business plan for ecological restoration treatments must include anticipated cost reductions, infrastructure costs, sustainability of woody biomass supply, and local economic benefits. Non-Federal investments in the priority landscape must be documented. Amounts transferred from the Fund will be used for restoration treatments consistent with the proposal and identified through a collaborative process. The Secretaries from the Fund will carry out ecological restoration treatments consistent with the landscape restoration proposal and identified through a collaborative process. An annual report will be prepared on the accomplishments of each selected collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal, including treated acres, progress evaluation, community benefits, and multiparty monitoring results. The Secretaries will use a multiparty monitoring process to assess the effects of collaborative forest landscape restoration projects for at least 15 years. A report on project performance, community benefits, monitoring results, and costs will be provided every 5 years. The Secretaries will submit a report every 5 years on the ecological restoration program's progress and effectiveness to relevant Senate and House committees."
