Policymakers are reexamining the drivers of poverty and the effectiveness of policy responses. A diverse group of families and individuals are in poverty, with a focus on the role of work in their lives. The report focuses on the diverse collection of families and individuals in poverty, emphasizing the role of work in their economic well-being. It also considers living arrangements and the composition of people in poverty, rather than just poverty rates among different groups. This snapshot examines the composition of people in poverty, focusing on what groups make up the poverty population rather than just poverty rates among different groups. It highlights how different population sizes can impact the share of the poverty population, emphasizing the importance of both perspectives in understanding poverty. The report uses the official measure of poverty by the U.S. Census Bureau to identify individuals as \"poor.\" The report uses the official measure of poverty by the U.S. Census Bureau to identify individuals as \"poor.\" Poverty is a lack of resources to meet basic needs, determined based on family income and composition. For example, in 2015, the poverty threshold for a working-age single person was $12,331. The poverty threshold for a family of two adults and two children in 2015 was $24,036. The official poverty measure has limitations, such as not considering taxes, non-cash benefits, assets, and living costs. The Census Bureau now has a supplemental poverty measure (SPM) that takes these factors into account for research purposes. The Census Bureau's supplemental poverty measure (SPM) considers modern resource-sharing arrangements like cohabiting couples and adjusts for taxes, transfers, and housing costs. In 2015, 43.1 million people had income below the poverty threshold, with 19.4 million living in deep poverty (below 50% of the threshold). This highlights the increasing attention on the very poor. In 2015, an estimated 19.4 million people were living in deep poverty, below 50% of the poverty threshold. Children made up one-third of the population in poverty, with working-age adults comprising the largest share. People aged 65 and older represented 10% of those in poverty. In 2015, non-Hispanic whites were the largest racial/ethnic group in the total population (61.4%) and represented 41.2% of the poverty population. Hispanics were the second largest group in the total population (17.8%) and made up 28.1% of those in poverty. Non-Hispanic African-Americans were the third largest group in both populations, representing 12.3% and 22.0% respectively. Most minority groups were over-represented in the poverty population compared to the overall population. In 2015, minority groups were over-represented in the poverty population compared to the overall population. Hispanics, non-Hispanic African-Americans, non-Hispanic American Indians, and Alaska Natives, and non-Hispanic persons of two or more races were over-represented, while non-Hispanic whites and Asians were under-represented. Children in poverty were more racially and ethnically diverse than adults, with minorities over-represented in all age groups. Women represented a larger share of the population in poverty (55.9%) compared to the overall population (51%). In 2015, white children made up 51.4% of the overall child population, while women accounted for 51% of the total population. However, women represented 55.9% of the population in poverty, possibly due to heading more single-parent households. Men earn more on average, contributing to the disparity. Poverty policies differ for children, working-age adults, and aged adults, with children being dependents, working-age adults expected to support themselves and their children, and aged adults drawing income from benefits. The report explores poverty among children, working-age adults, and aged adults, highlighting the central role of work as the primary means of economic support. Children in America are disproportionately poor, making up one-third of all people in poverty despite being less than a quarter of the total population. Children in America are disproportionately poor, with a poverty rate of 19.7% in 2015. Most children rely on their parents or adult caretakers for support, with over 90% living in families with at least one adult earner. Among poor children, two-thirds lived in families with earners, with 57.5% in families with one earner. In 2015, a majority of children in poor families lived with one earner, while only 10.5% lived with two or more were in families with no income from earnings. Children in female-headed families accounted for 54.1% of all poor children, while those in married couple families made up 33% of the total. In 2015, children in married couple families accounted for one-third (33%) of all poor children, despite having a relatively low poverty rate. Larger families are more likely to be poor due to higher income needs, with 27% of poor children in families with four or more children. Earnings, not family size, determine poverty likelihood. In 2015, larger families with four or more children accounted for 27% of poor children, despite representing only 14.2% of the overall population. Working-age adults (18-64 years old) make up the majority of people in poverty, with 56.6% of individuals in poverty. Among working-age adults who are poor, 61.3% did not have earnings from work in 2015. Among working-age adults who were poor in 2015, 38.8% were working in some capacity, with 10.4% working full-time all year. Reasons for not working included illness or disability (33%), caregiving (24.3%), schooling (19.4%), retirement (9.0%), and job availability (8.2%). Educational attainment is linked to success in the workforce, with higher levels of education leading to higher earnings and more stable employment. Among poor working-age adults in 2015, educational attainment plays a significant role in workforce success. Higher levels of education lead to higher earnings and more stable employment. The largest group of poor working-age adults had a high school diploma but no post-secondary credential, while those without a high school diploma accounted for a significant share. Even among adults aged 25 to 64, those with only a high school diploma remained the largest group among the poor. Among working-age adults in poverty, those with only a high school diploma are the largest group. Family living arrangements are more common in the overall population compared to the poor, with 41% of poor working-age adults living outside of a family. This group includes individuals living alone, with cohabiting partners, or other unrelated adults. Determining the poverty status of individuals living with others is complex and based on each person's income. In 2015, aged adults were the least likely to be living below the poverty line, accounting for 9.7% of the population in poverty despite making up 14.9% of the total population. The poverty rate among aged adults was 8.8% in 2015, with 77.0% of adults aged 65 and older not working. Income from past work, family members, and continued work plays a significant role in the economic well-being of aged adults. In 2015, Social Security income, pensions, and earnings from current work are key sources of income for aged adults, with a higher percentage of the overall aged population receiving these benefits compared to aged persons in poverty. In 2015, survivor pensions were received by 48.5% of all aged persons' families, but only by 7.7% of poor aged persons' families. Earnings from current work were received by 40.7% of aged persons' families, with only 11.0% of poor aged persons' families receiving such earnings. Most aged adults (97.2%) lived in families with income from work, including past work and current work. A significant portion of aged adults in poverty (71.7%) also lived in families with work-derived income. Aged adults in poverty had a higher rate of living alone (50.2%) compared to the overall aged population (28.7%). In 2015, half of aged adults in poverty lived alone, a significantly higher rate than the overall aged population. This report provides information on the 43 million Americans below the poverty line, showing they are a diverse group including children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Certain groups like women, minorities, and those living alone are over-represented among those in poverty. Income from work plays a central role in determining poverty levels. The report highlights that income from work is crucial in determining poverty levels for various groups such as women, minorities, children, and individuals living alone. While work income is a significant factor, sometimes it is not enough to prevent poverty, with many children and aged adults in poverty despite having some form of work-based income. The complexity of circumstances leading to poverty, both individual and systemic, requires further exploration for effective federal policy interventions."
