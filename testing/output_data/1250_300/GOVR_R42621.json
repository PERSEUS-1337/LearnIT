    "content": "Facing pressure to reduce the federal budget deficit, some in the 112th Congress saw international affairs spending, including foreign aid programs, as expendable. However, others believed a strong foreign affairs budget was crucial for national security and foreign policy interests. Congress delayed passing appropriations bills, including State-Foreign Operations, until after the new fiscal year and fall elections. A continuing resolution was passed to fund the government until March 27, 2013, with the House later passing legislation (H.R. 933) on March 6, 2013. The House passed legislation (H.R. 933) on March 6, 2013, to fund federal programs for the remainder of FY2013. The Senate approved an expanded version on March 20, 2013, and the House adopted it the next day. The legislation was signed into law on March 26, 2013 (P.L. 113-6), supporting international affairs programs and activities. The State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill funds Agency for International Development (USAID) operations, public diplomacy, and international broadcasting programs. It does not align perfectly with the international affairs budget as some programs are funded through other appropriations bills. The report provides a chart illustrating the organizational structure of the bill and abbreviations of terms used. It focuses on accounts funded through the bill and provides appropriations figures for the entire international affairs budget. The State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill funds various international programs, including Agency for International Development (USAID) operations and public diplomacy. It provides appropriations figures for the international affairs budget. Recent congressional activity includes President Obama signing resolutions to fund government operations until March 27, 2013. The Senate passed H.J.Res. 117 on September 22, 2012, funding the government until March 27, 2013. The bill provided 0.612% more than FY2012 levels for State and Foreign Operations non-OCO funded activities. OCO-designated activities would be funded at the FY2012-enacted level. The annualized State-Foreign Operations funding rate under the CR was estimated to be $53.52 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved its FY2013 State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill, providing a total of $52.3 billion, including $2.3 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds. The Senate approved $16.3 billion for State Department funding in FY2013, with $1.6 billion for OCO. Foreign Operations received $36.0 billion, including $709.8 million in OCO funds. The House Appropriations Committee passed a bill totaling $40.3 billion for regular funding and $8.2 billion for OCO, 12% less than requested. The total allocation was $48.5 billion, with $15.8 billion for State Department and $32.9 billion for Foreign Operations. The House allocation for State-Foreign Operations was $48.38 billion, almost 12% below the Administration's request. The House approved $48.38 billion for the State-Foreign Operations subcommittee, which was almost 12% below the Administration's request. The Senate allocated $53.02 billion, 3% less than the Administration's request, including $3.2 billion in OCO funds. The Obama Administration's FY2013 budget request sought a 2.6% increase above the estimated FY2012 level for the Department of State-Foreign Operations and Related Agencies. The Administration's FY2013 foreign affairs funding priorities closely aligned with congressional priorities from FY2012. The total request was $54.9 billion, including $46.6 billion for core budget and $8.2 billion for war-related operations. A new bilateral economic aid account, the Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF), was proposed with $770 million. Additionally, $800 million was requested for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF), despite concerns about U.S.-Pakistan relations. The FY2013 foreign affairs funding priorities aligned with congressional priorities from FY2012. The Administration sought $800 million for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) despite concerns about U.S.-Pakistan relations. The funding categories for FY2013 included State Department Administration of Foreign Affairs, bilateral economic aid, and security assistance. These categories made up more than 85% of the total State-Foreign Operations funding requested. The State Department and Related Agencies portion of the international affairs budget request included funding for State Department operations, International Organizations, International Peacekeeping activities, International Broadcasting, National Endowment for Democracy, and U.S. Institute of Peace. The accounts would have seen a 4.5% boost in FY2013 to a total of $18.8 billion, with $14.1 billion for Administration of Foreign Affairs. The FY2013 request focused on supporting military-to-civilian transition in Iraq and State Department-led efforts in frontline states. The FY2013 State Department budget request focused on supporting military-to-civilian transition in Iraq and State Department-led efforts in frontline states, including Afghanistan and Pakistan. The State Department became the lead agency for U.S. programs in Iraq after the departure of military forces in late 2011, taking on a wide range of responsibilities. The FY2013 State Department budget request for Iraq included $2.7 billion, a 23% decrease from FY2012, reflecting a plan to \"normalize\" the U.S. presence. Cost-saving measures included reducing the State Department presence by 25% and cutting security contracts. The House appropriations bill allocated $2.8 billion for State Department operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. In the fall of 2012, reductions in security and sustainment contracts were made, and construction funded in FY2012 was completed. The House appropriations bill allocated $2.8 billion for State Department operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, with funding for increased security but not for increased staff. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided $2.1 billion for Department of State operations in Iraq in FY2013, reflecting reforms outlined in the QDDR. The QDDR, completed in 2010, aimed to shift diplomatic resources towards high-priority countries and programs, including establishing a new Bureau of Energy Resources and elevating the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism to a Bureau in 2011. The QDDR reforms in 2011 included establishing a new Bureau of Energy Resources and elevating the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism to a Bureau. Funding for Counterterrorism operations increased significantly, with additional positions requested. The Bureau of Energy Resources also sought new hires. The Bureau of Energy Resources requested 22 new positions in the FY2013 budget to strengthen market incentives and engage on global energy priorities. The House Appropriations Committee did not include the additional funding. The House Appropriations Committee did not include the additional $5.4 million and 22 new positions specifically for the Bureau of Energy Resources in the FY2013 budget. The Administration's FY2013 request for the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations included a restructuring to increase deployment capacity with fewer staff positions. The Civilian Response Corps model was also modified to fund experts only when deployed, reducing the number of members by 76. The FY2013 budget for Conflict and Stabilization Operations was reorganized to fund experts only when deployed, reducing the number of members by 76. The House Appropriations Committee's proposal included authority for fund transfers and OCO funding, while the Senate proposal authorized fund transfers and additional funding from the Complex Crisis Fund. The Administration's FY2013 request included $2.5 billion for additional human resources, with $24.9 million allocated to bolster State's staffing by 121 new positions. In FY2013, the request for additional human resources for the Department of State was $2.5 billion, $71.2 million higher than the previous year. The funding aimed to hire 121 new positions to fill staffing gaps and support new programs under the \"Diplomacy 3.0\" initiative. Secretary Clinton's goal to increase Foreign Service Officers by 25% by 2014 was adjusted to 18% growth by 2013, with 82 new FSOs and 39 civil servants hired. The department postponed its 25% growth target for the Foreign Service beyond 2014. Additionally, $81.4 million was requested for the final phase of Overseas Comparability Pay implementation for FSOs. In FY2013, $81.4 million was allocated for the final phase of Overseas Comparability Pay (OCP) for Foreign Service Officers (FSOs). This adjustment aimed to address the 23.1% pay cut FSOs experienced when transferring abroad prior to 2009. The funding was crucial for FSO competitiveness and diplomatic readiness, as highlighted by State officials. Congress had previously approved two OCP adjustments, reducing the pay differential by nearly 70%. The FY2013 request sought to bring the comparability pay level to match the Washington, DC, locality pay rate. In FY2013, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not provide funding for hiring above attrition or overseas comparability pay extension. The United States opposed UNESCO's decision to admit Palestine as a full member, leading to a policy debate affecting State-Foreign Operations appropriations. The United States has long opposed Palestinian statehood outside of a negotiated agreement with Israel. U.S. law prohibits funding to any U.N. agency accepting Palestinians as full members. U.S. contributions to UNESCO have been withheld since the vote, with the Administration seeking $80 million for UNESCO in 2012. The House committee report stated it would withhold U.S. contributions to UNESCO and prohibit Economic Support Funds to the Palestinian Authority if they gain full U.N. membership outside of a negotiated agreement. The Senate did not recommend funding for UNESCO. The Senate legislation did not recommend funding for UNESCO within the CIO account, as it is prohibited by law. It also included an explicit prohibition on U.S. funding to UNESCO and other U.N. entities granting full membership to the Palestinian Authority. Both proposals included less funding than requested for the International Organizations and Programs account. The Foreign Operations budget comprises the majority of U.S. foreign assistance programs, managed primarily by USAID and the State Department. The Foreign Operations budget, totaling $36.07 billion for FY2013, includes funding for various foreign assistance agencies and multilateral financial institutions. It also replenishes U.S. commitments to international financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The FY2013 Operations budget request totaled $36.07 billion, a slight increase from FY2012. The request focused on foreign assistance initiatives and funding for war-related states. Congressional debate centered on funding levels and policy issues such as restrictions on international family planning programs. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) to support U.S. engagement in the evolving situation in the Middle East, following popular uprisings in the region. Members of the 112th Congress expressed interest in supporting these uprisings but were concerned about accountability and unintended consequences of providing assistance. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) to support U.S. engagement in the evolving situation in the Middle East. The funds would have supported existing programs like the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI) and regional activities. The remaining $700 million would have been unallocated funds intended to provide incentives for beneficiary countries to move toward democracy. The Administration suggested that the funds could have been used for humanitarian relief, contributions to U.N. peacekeeping activities, or bilateral loan forgiveness, among other possibilities. The Administration proposed a $770 million Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) to support U.S. engagement in the Middle East. Some Members of Congress expressed concerns about the proposed fund, with the House committee bill allocating $175 million within the Economic Support Fund and $25 million in the Foreign Military Finance account for \"Middle East Response.\" The Senate committee report included $1 billion for MENA IF and increased MEPI funding to $70.0 million. Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan have consistently been top U.S. aid recipients due to their strategic significance in the Global War on Terror. The Administration requested increased MEPI funding to $70.0 million for FY2013, with Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan being top U.S. aid recipients due to their strategic significance in the Global War on Terror. For FY2013, the Administration sought $2.1 billion in foreign operations funds for Iraq, including $1.8 billion designated as OCO, representing a 22% increase from FY2012. The department's FY2013 request for Iraq included $1 billion for the Police Development Program (PDP), described as the cornerstone of U.S. security engagement and assistance in Iraq. The Police Development Program (PDP) in Iraq faced scrutiny in 2012 amid reports of reductions, but the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad emphasized its importance. Despite doubts, the House expressed support for the PDP and required a review of its personnel, scope, and costs. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $635 million for Iraq, with funding for the PDP coming from the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) program. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $635 million in foreign operations funds for Iraq, but did not include funding for the Police Development Program (PDP) due to Iraqi disinterest and inadequate planning by the Department of State. The Administration requested $2.5 billion for Afghanistan in FY2013, with almost half designated as OCO. The House legislation withheld assistance to Afghanistan until adequate security is in place for civilian aid workers, while the Senate bill included $1.8 billion for Afghanistan. The Senate bill included $1.8 billion in foreign operations funds for Afghanistan, with funding contingent on adequate security for aid workers. The Administration's FY2013 budget requested $2.2 billion for Pakistan, including $800 million for the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. The House legislation did not specify aid levels for Pakistan but prohibited assistance if Pakistan is uncooperative in anti-terrorism efforts. The Senate bill allocated $842.3 million for Pakistan, including $50 million for the PCCF. The Senate bill included $842.3 million in foreign operations funds for Pakistan, with new conditions on aid including withholding $33 million in Foreign Military Financing until Dr. Shakil Afridi is released. The budget request proposed a cut of $300.0 million for the Global Health Initiative compared to the FY2012 enacted level. The proposed cut of $300.0 million for the Global Health Initiative was the largest reduction requested, marking the end of a decade-long growth trend in global health funding. The request included decreases for all global health activities except for a 1.2% increase in funding for international family planning and a 57% increase ($1.7 billion) for the Global Fund to Fight HIV, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The House provided $8 billion for global health, slightly more than the request, while the Senate proposed $8.5 billion, 8% more than requested. The Senate proposed $8.5 billion for the Global Health Initiative (GHI), 8% more than requested, including $1.7 billion for the Global Fund. Feed the Future (FtF) remains a priority with a request of $1.1 billion in Foreign Operations funds. The initiative emphasizes working multilaterally and with partners to address global hunger, including $134 million for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP). The House supported FtF goals without specifying funding, except for $99.8 million for GAFSP. The Senate recommended $1.2 billion for agricultural assistance. The House proposal for FY2013 included support for Feed the Future (FtF) goals without specifying funding, except for $99.8 million for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP). The Senate recommended $1.2 billion in assistance for agricultural and food security, including $200 million specifically for GAFSP. The FY2013 request for programs supporting the Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) was $770 million, with funds flowing through various appropriations accounts to support activities related to climate change. The Administration promotes World Bank Trust Funds as a cost-effective approach, leveraging funds from other countries. The House and Senate had differing views on GCCI funding in FY2013. The Senate recommended significant funding for climate change programs, exceeding the Administration's request. Additionally, the Administration requested $643 million for family planning and reproductive health activities. The Administration requested $643 million for family planning and reproductive health activities in FY2013, sparking debate in Congress over policy issues like the Mexico City policy and U.S. funding of the UN Population Fund. The House proposed legislation to codify the Mexico City policy, while the Senate bill did not include such language. The Mexico City Policy, which bans U.S. assistance to organizations involved in coercive family planning practices, has been a point of contention between past and current Administrations. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) has faced suspensions of U.S. contributions due to allegations of supporting coercive family planning programs in China. The George W. Bush Administration halted funding to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008, while President Obama resumed contributions in 2009. The FY2013 House legislation included provisions to codify the Mexico City Policy and prohibited funding for UNFPA, while the Senate bill allocated $44.5 million for UNFPA. In FY2013, the House legislation allocated $461 million for family planning and reproductive health activities, with no funding for UNFPA, while the Senate bill included $700 million for family planning and reproductive health, including $44.5 million for UNFPA. The Administration proposed dissolving the AEECA account in FY2013, with a funding cut of 18% from FY2012. The House merged AEECA funds with other accounts, stating it does not signal diminished support for the region. The Senate proposal also included provisions for funding. The U.S. adopted a new approach by merging AEECA funds with other accounts like ESF, GHP, and INCLE, without diminishing support for the region. The Senate proposal allows funds from ESF to assist AEECA-eligible countries. Foreign aid and diplomatic programs have evolved from anti-communist focus during the Cold War to include promoting economic development, trade, education, health care, human rights, and environmental protection. Post-Cold War objectives now include nuclear non-proliferation, drug trafficking prevention, peace efforts in the Middle East, regional stability, religious freedom, and more. After the Cold War, U.S. foreign policy shifted towards new objectives such as nuclear non-proliferation, counterterrorism efforts, and global development as a pillar of national security. President Bush's National Security Strategy in 2002 emphasized development alongside defense and diplomacy. Foreign aid priorities began to focus on supporting countries cooperating in the war on terrorism. In 2002, foreign aid budget prioritized the war on terrorism, focusing on assistance to \"front-line\" states. Reconstruction in Afghanistan and Iraq dominated aid budget, emphasizing national security. State Department focused on diplomatic security and public diplomacy in Muslim communities. Bush Administration increased aid for HIV/AIDS globally with PEPFAR and introduced MCC for countries with good governance. Obama Administration continued these initiatives. The Obama Administration continued Bush's foreign aid initiatives, including the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and global health funding. They also completed the first Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) in 2010, naming USAID as the leading agency for development assistance and implementing reforms within the Department of State. Funding for these initiatives was requested within Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) in regular appropriations bills. The Obama Administration continued Bush's foreign aid initiatives, including the Millennium Challenge Corporation and global health funding. They completed the first Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review in 2010, naming USAID as the leading agency for development assistance. In its FY2012 budget proposals, the Department of State requested the use of OCO funds for \"front line states\" like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Congress adopted the OCO designation and expanded it to include funding for additional accounts and countries. The OCO designation gained significance with the Budget Control Act of 2011, allowing war-related funding to not count towards budget caps. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) determined that OCO funds are not exempt from BCA automatic across-the-board reductions starting January 2, 2013. The OCO approach is similar to past use of supplemental international affairs appropriations. The Obama Administration criticized this practice and increased base funding in FY2010. In FY2010, there was a sharp increase in base funding for international affairs, with supplemental funds requested for emergencies like the Haiti earthquake. FY2011 saw all international affairs funding appropriated in the base budget, before the OCO approach was adopted in FY2012. For FY2013, $8.24 billion was designated as OCO, 5% less than FY2012. The FY2013 OCO funding was $8.24 billion, 5% less than FY2012, and 26% less than the $11.2 billion enacted by Congress. The House legislation allocated $8.3 billion for OCO, while the Senate bill designated $2.3 billion, largely due to no funding for the Iraq Police Development program. State Department-Foreign Operations funding trended upward until FY2011 when Congress reduced foreign affairs spending to meet deficit reduction goals. Funding levels in FY2012 and FY2013 leveled off due to efforts to reduce deficit spending. State-Foreign Operations appropriations for the past decade in both current and constant dollars have leveled off due to congressional efforts to reduce deficit spending. State Department and related agencies funding trends upward at a steeper rate than overall foreign affairs spending, reflecting an interest to increase human resource capacity at the Department of State. Foreign Operations funding has remained relatively stable over the past decade. The appropriations for Foreign Operations in the foreign affairs budget have leveled off in the past decade. Israel and Egypt were top recipients of U.S. foreign aid before 9/11, with Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan receiving significant aid in recent years. Funding for these countries includes temporary OCO appropriations. In recent years, Pakistan has received security assistance and economic aid to combat extremist organizations. The top recipients of U.S. foreign aid in FY2013 were Israel, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, with Iraq moving up to fourth place. Aid to Africa was set to decline by 10%, while aid to the Near East and South Central Asia would increase. In FY2013, U.S. aid to Africa was set to decline by 10% to $6.4 billion, aid to the Near East would increase by 12% to $9.0 billion, and aid to South Central Asia would increase by 6% to $5.3 billion. Aid to Africa supports health programs, while aid to South Central Asia is largely for war-related costs in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Near East region's aid request includes assistance to Israel, Iraq, Egypt, and Jordan. The Western Hemisphere saw a decline in funding for Colombia, Europe and Eurasia had a 14% decline, and aid to East Asia and Pacific remained consistent. Congress has shown interest in various aid sectors like education, trade capacity, health, and biodiversity. In FY2013, U.S. aid to East Asia and Pacific remained low. Congress has expressed interest in aid sectors like education, trade capacity, health, and biodiversity. The Administration's budget requests for key interest areas showed declines in FY2013 compared to FY2012, with reductions in funding for most sectors except five. Notably, major initiatives like Food Security and Global Climate Change also saw decreased funding requests. The Administration's FY2013 request for aid sectors showed declines compared to FY2012, with reduced funding for various areas including Sustainable Landscapes, Neglected Tropical Diseases, Nutrition, Maternal and Child Health, Higher Education, Clean Energy, and Basic Education. However, there was increased funding for Gender Funding and Science, Technology, and Innovation."
