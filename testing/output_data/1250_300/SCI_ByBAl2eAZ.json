Combining parameter noise with traditional RL methods benefits both off- and on-policy methods. Exploration is crucial in deep RL to prevent premature convergence to local optima. Efficient exploration is challenging as it is not guided by the reward function. Various methods have been proposed to address this challenge in high-dimensional and continuous-action environments. Efficient exploration in deep reinforcement learning is challenging as it is not guided by the reward function. Various methods have been proposed to tackle this challenge, such as adding temporally-correlated noise or parameter noise to increase exploratory nature. These methods have limitations in terms of on-policy settings and gradient information. This paper explores the effectiveness of combining parameter space noise with deep RL algorithms like DQN, DDPG, and TRPO to enhance exploratory behavior. Results show that parameter noise outperforms traditional action space noise in tasks with sparse reward signals. The study assumes a fully observable environment modeled as a Markov decision process in the standard RL framework. The environment is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) with states, actions, initial state distribution, reward function, transition probabilities, time horizon, and discount factor. The agent aims to maximize expected discounted return using a policy parametrized by \u03b8. Two off-policy algorithms, Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG), are considered for learning. DQN uses a deep neural network to estimate the optimal Q-value function based on the Bellman optimality equation. Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) are off-policy algorithms used for learning in a Markov decision process. DQN uses a deep neural network to estimate the optimal Q-value function, while DDPG is an actor-critic algorithm for continuous action spaces. Both algorithms involve exploration through action space noise. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) is an on-policy method that improves upon traditional policy gradient methods by ensuring a small change in the policy distribution. It solves a constrained optimization problem using discounted state-visitation frequencies and an advantage function.\u03b4 KL controls the policy's allowed change per iteration. State-visitation frequencies induced by \u03c0 \u03b8, A(s, a) denotes the advantage function estimated by the empirical return minus the baseline, and \u03b4 KL is a step size parameter controlling policy changes. Policies are parameterized as \u03c0 \u03b8, with \u03b8 as the parameter vector, represented as neural networks. Structured exploration involves sampling policies by adding Gaussian noise to the parameter vector. State-dependent exploration distinguishes between action space noise and parameter space noise, highlighting the difference in generating actions in a continuous action space case. In structured exploration, policies are sampled by adding Gaussian noise to the parameter vector, ensuring consistency in actions and introducing a dependence between state and exploratory action. Deep neural networks can be perturbed meaningfully with spherical Gaussian noise, as shown by Salimans et al. (2017). Deep neural networks can be perturbed by applying spherical Gaussian noise, but a simple reparameterization achieves this by using layer normalization between perturbed layers. Adaptive noise scaling resolves limitations by adjusting the scale of parameter space noise over time. Adaptive noise scaling resolves limitations by adjusting the scale of parameter space noise over time for both off-policy and on-policy methods in deep neural networks. Parameter space noise can be incorporated in on-policy methods by perturbing the policy for exploration and training the non-perturbed network on replayed data. This approach optimizes the expected return using likelihood ratios and the re-parametrization trick for N samples, scaling adaptively. The section addresses the benefits of incorporating parameter space noise in state-of-the-art RL algorithms, its effectiveness in exploring sparse reward environments, and its comparison to evolution strategies for deep policies in terms of sample efficiency. Parameter space noise is explored for its benefits in state-of-the-art RL algorithms, aiding in effective exploration of sparse reward environments. The comparison with evolution strategies for deep policies in terms of sample efficiency is also discussed. Reference implementations of DQN and DDPG with adaptive parameter space noise are available online for further exploration. Parameter space noise is utilized to enhance exploration in RL algorithms, with a focus on adapting the noise scale based on KL divergences. The network is reparametrized to represent an explicit policy \u03c0, leading to more meaningful changes in behavior compared to perturbing the Q-function directly. Training the policy involves maximizing the probability of outputting the greedy action. By perturbing \u03c0 instead of Q, more meaningful changes are achieved as an explicit behavioral policy is defined. The Q-network is trained following standard DQN practices, while the policy \u03c0 is trained to output the greedy action based on the current Q-network. Parameter space noise is combined with a bit of action space noise for better performance. Experimental details are provided in Section A.1, with 21 games of varying complexity chosen for training. The learning curves for selected games are shown in FIG2. The study conducted experiments on 21 games of varying complexity, comparing the performance of parameter space noise and action space noise. Results showed that parameter space noise often outperformed action space noise, especially on games requiring consistency. Learning progress also started sooner with parameter space noise. Additionally, a comparison against a double-headed version of DQN with \u03b5-greedy exploration confirmed that the change in architecture was not responsible for improved exploration. The study compared parameter space noise and action space noise on 21 games, showing parameter space noise outperformed especially on consistent games. Results confirmed the change in architecture of DQN was not responsible for improved exploration. Further exploration methods like BID4 may be needed for challenging games like Montezuma's Revenge. Proposed DQN improvements like double DQN, prioritized experience replay, and dueling networks could enhance results. Future work could validate this theory.

Comparison of parameter noise with action noise on continuous control environments in OpenAI Gym BID6 using DDPG BID18 as the RL algorithm with various noise configurations evaluated on several continuous control tasks. In continuous control tasks, parameter space noise outperforms other exploration strategies, especially on HalfCheetah where it breaks out of sub-optimal behavior. It also surpasses correlated action space noise significantly. However, on other environments, parameter space noise performs similarly to other strategies.

It also surpasses correlated action space noise significantly. On other environments, parameter space noise performs similarly to other strategies. In environments with sparse rewards, parameter noise aids in escaping local optima and enables existing RL algorithms to learn effectively. In sparse reward environments, parameter noise helps escape local optima and enhances learning effectiveness. A toy example with a chain of states is used to compare adaptive parameter space noise DQN, bootstrapped DQN, and \u03b5-greedy DQN. The goal is to achieve optimal return in one hundred subsequent rollouts. In sparse reward environments, parameter noise aids in escaping local optima and improving learning efficiency.

The goal is to achieve optimal return in one hundred subsequent rollouts by disabling all noise. The results show that parameter space noise outperforms action space noise and even the more computationally expensive bootstrapped DQN. However, the environment used is simple, where the optimal strategy is always to go right. In sparse reward environments, parameter space noise is compared to action space noise for exploration behavior. Parameter space noise may not guarantee optimal exploration in general, but it can aid in escaping local optima and improving learning efficiency. The study uses challenging continuous control environments with sparse rewards, such as SparseCartpoleSwingup and SparseHalfCheetah, to highlight the difference in exploration behavior. In sparse reward environments, DDPG is used to solve challenging tasks like SparseDoublePendulum, SparseCartpoleSwingup, SparseMountainCar, and SparseHalfCheetah. Results show that only parameter space noise can learn successful policies for some tasks, while others remain difficult to solve even with noise. Parameter space noise is crucial for learning successful policies in challenging tasks like SparseHalfCheetah, while other forms of noise fail to find states with nonzero rewards. DDPG struggles on tasks like SwimmerGather, showing the potential of parameter space noise to enhance exploration in off-the-shelf algorithms. It is important to evaluate the benefits of parameter space noise on a case-by-case basis, as it can improve exploration behavior but is not guaranteed to do so universally. Combining parameter space noise with traditional RL algorithms allows for the inclusion of temporal information and optimization through back-propagation gradients. Parameter space noise is compared with ES and traditional RL in terms of performance on 21 ALE games. DQN with parameter space noise outperforms ES on 15 out of 21 Atari games, showing a combination of exploration properties and sample efficiency. Parameter space noise, when compared with ES and traditional RL on 21 ALE games, outperforms ES on 15 games. This demonstrates a combination of exploration properties and sample efficiency. Various algorithms have been proposed for exploration in reinforcement learning, but in real-world problems with continuous and high-dimensional state and action spaces, these algorithms become impractical. Techniques in deep reinforcement learning have been proposed to improve exploration, but they are often computationally expensive. Perturbing policy parameters has been shown to outperform random exploration in policy gradient methods. The authors propose perturbing policy parameters as a method for exploration in reinforcement learning. Their approach outperforms random exploration in policy gradient methods and is evaluated for both on and off-policy settings with high-dimensional policies and environments. Their work is related to evolution strategies and shows promise for high-dimensional environments like Atari and OpenAI Gym continuous control problems. Parameter space noise is proposed as a more effective method for exploration in reinforcement learning compared to traditional action space noise. This approach perturbs network parameters directly, leading to improved performance in deep RL algorithms like DQN, DDPG, and TRPO.

It perturbs network parameters directly, improving performance in deep RL algorithms like DQN, DDPG, and TRPO. The experimental setup for ALE BID3 includes a network architecture with convolutional layers and a hidden layer with ReLUs and layer normalization. Additionally, a policy network head is added after the convolutional layers for parameter space noise. The network architecture includes ReLUs in each layer and layer normalization in the fully connected part. A policy network head is added for parameter space noise, with target networks updated every 10 K timesteps. The Q-value network is trained using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10 \u22124 and a batch size of 32. The replay buffer can hold 1 M state transitions. The policy is perturbed at the beginning of each episode, with the standard deviation adapted every 50 timesteps. The policy head is perturbed at the start of each episode, with the standard deviation adjusted every 50 timesteps. Policy perturbation is followed by -greedy action selection with = 0.01. Initial data collection involves 50 K random actions, \u03b3 is set to 0.99, rewards are clipped to [-1, 1], and gradients for the output layer of Q are clipped to [-1, 1]. Observations are down-sampled to 84 \u00d7 84 pixels and converted to grayscale, with a concatenation of 4 subsequent frames provided to the network. Up to 30 noop actions are used at the beginning of each episode. The network architecture for DDPG includes 2 hidden layers with 64 ReLU units each for both the actor and critic, with layer normalization applied. The DDPG network architecture includes 2 hidden layers with 64 ReLU units for both actor and critic, with layer normalization applied. The critic is trained with a learning rate of 10^-3 and the actor with a learning rate of 10^-4. Both are updated using the Adam optimizer with batch sizes of 128. The critic is regularized with an L2 penalty of 10^-2, and the replay buffer holds 100K state transitions with \u03b3 = 0.99. Parameter space noise is adaptively scaled for dense and sparse environments. TRPO uses a step size of \u03b4 KL = 0.01 and a policy network with 2 hidden layers for nonlocomotion tasks. TRPO uses a step size of \u03b4 KL = 0.01, a policy network with 2 hidden layers for nonlocomotion tasks, and Hessian calculation is subsampled with a factor of 0.1. The environments used include Swimmer and various sparse tasks modified from rllab. The curr_chunk discusses the use of DQN with a simple network to approximate the Q-value function in various environments. Each agent is trained for up to 2K episodes, with varying chain lengths and seeds. The performance of the policy is evaluated after each episode, and the problem is considered solved if one hundred subsequent trajectories achieve the optimal return. The environment is depicted in Figure 6. The curr_chunk discusses the comparison of adaptive parameter space noise DQN, bootstrapped DQN, and \u03b5-greedy DQN in a simple and scalable environment. Various parameters and settings are detailed, including the use of a stochastic policy \u03c0 \u03b8 (a|s) with \u03b8 \u223c N (\u03c6, \u03a3) and the reparametrization trick for N samples i \u223c N (0, I) and \u03c4 i \u223c (\u03c0. The curr_chunk discusses adapting the scale of parameter space noise over time to improve learning in a stochastic policy setting. This method aims to address the challenges of selecting a suitable scale for parameter space noise, which can vary with network architecture and learning progress. By using a time-varying scale \u03c3k related to action space variance, the proposed approach offers a simple and effective solution to optimize learning. The text discusses updating the scale of parameter space noise over time using a time-varying scale \u03c3k related to action space variance. The approach involves a heuristic to update \u03c3k every K timesteps, with \u03b1 and \u03b4 as scaling and threshold values. The distance measure d(\u00b7, \u00b7) is used to compare non-perturbed and perturbed policies, with different choices for methods like DDPG, TRPO, and DQN. In experiments, \u03b1 is set to 1.01, and for DQN, the policy is implicitly defined by the Q-value function, requiring a careful distance measure selection to avoid pitfalls. The text discusses a probabilistic formulation for measuring the distance in action space between non-perturbed and perturbed policies in reinforcement learning. By using a normalized Q-value approach, the method avoids pitfalls related to comparing policies based on Q-values. This approach also allows for a fair comparison between different reinforcement learning algorithms without the need for additional hyperparameters. The text discusses a method that normalizes Q-values to compare policies in reinforcement learning, avoiding pitfalls and enabling fair comparisons between algorithms without extra hyperparameters. It relates distance measures in action space to -greedy action noise, allowing for a comparison between different noise sources. The text discusses relating noise induced by parameter space perturbations to noise induced by additive Gaussian noise in reinforcement learning. It introduces a distance measure between non-perturbed and perturbed policies, setting an adaptive parameter space threshold for effective action space noise. Scaling the noise for TRPO involves adapting sampled noise vectors and computing a trust region around the noise direction to ensure constraint conformation. Learning curves for Atari games are provided, and final performance of ES is compared to DQN with -greedy. The text discusses the comparison of final performance between Evolution Strategies (ES) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) on Atari games. Results show that adaptive parameter space noise achieves stable performance on InvertedDoublePendulum. TRPO with noise scaled according to parameter curvature is also discussed. Overall, performance is comparable to other exploration approaches, indicating that environments with DDPG are not well-suited for exploration testing. Adding parameter space noise aids in learning much more consistently on challenging sparse environments when using TRPO, as shown in FIG10. The TRPO baseline utilizes action noise with a policy network outputting the mean of a Gaussian distribution, while the variance is learned. This approach outperforms no noise in both action and parameter space, highlighting the effectiveness of incorporating parameter space noise in the learning process."
