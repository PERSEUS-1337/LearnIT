    "content": "The National Security Agency (NSA) conducted a secret Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP), sparking a national debate on its legality under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The program involved warrantless surveillance of international communications involving individuals believed to be associated with al Qaeda. The Bush Administration defended the program citing constitutional and statutory support. Senator Mitch McConnell introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 as a standalone bill, along with the Terrorist Tracking, Identification and Prosecution Act of 2006. Several bills were introduced in the 109th and 110th Congress addressing electronic surveillance programs for foreign intelligence and detecting international terrorist threats. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act provides a framework for electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act authorizes the use of trap and trace devices to acquire foreign intelligence information and allows for the production of tangible things for investigations related to foreign intelligence or international terrorism. The Bush Administration argued that electronic surveillance under FISA was valuable but lacked speed and agility in dealing with terrorists. Attorney General Gonzales informed the Senate Judiciary Committee that orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court now allow for targeted surveillance of international communications involving members of al Qaeda or associated terrorist organizations. The Attorney General announced that surveillance previously conducted under the TSP will now require approval from the FISC. The President has decided not to reauthorize the TSP. The NSA program has faced legal challenges, with a court ruling it unconstitutional for violating the Administrative Procedures Act and Separation of Powers doctrine. In a lawsuit, the American Civil Liberties Union challenged the National Security Agency's Terrorist Surveillance Program, which was deemed unconstitutional by U.S. District Court Judge Anna Diggs Taylor. The program violated various laws and amendments, leading to a permanent injunction. The decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which stayed the judgment pending appeal. The appeal included concerns about orders issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The attorneys for the appellants filed a notification regarding a letter from the Attorney General's Office about orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. S. 3931 and Title II of S. 3929 propose creating a new Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to address electronic surveillance programs. The bills would also amend various provisions of FISA related to electronic surveillance without a warrant, applications for surveillance orders, emergency surveillance, limitations on liability, and congressional oversight. Additionally, the bills would repeal wartime authorities for warrantless electronic surveillance following a congressional declaration of war and update the definitions of \"electronic surveillance\" and \"agent of a foreign power.\" The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 proposes changes to FISA definitions and provisions related to electronic surveillance programs. It creates a new Title VII in FISA to address electronic surveillance programs with a focus on gathering foreign intelligence information and protecting against international terrorism. The new Section 701 of FISA defines electronic surveillance programs for gathering foreign intelligence information or protecting against international terrorism. It allows for flexibility in surveillance targets and immediate action when suspect activity is detected. The FISC has jurisdiction to review, authorize, and reauthorize these programs, with initial authorizations lasting up to 90 days and reauthorizations determined by the FISC. If an application is denied, the program cannot proceed. The authorization of electronic surveillance programs under FISA can last up to 90 days, with reauthorizations determined by the FISC. If an application is denied, the Attorney General can submit new applications or appeal to the FIS Court of Review. Surveillance must be discontinued if criteria for electronic surveillance under a different section of FISA are met, unless certain conditions are fulfilled. The bills authorize the continuation of electronic surveillance under Title VII of FISA only if certain conditions are met. The Attorney General must apply for an FISC order authorizing surveillance under Section 105 of FISA. Additionally, the bills allow for the transfer of cases involving challenges to classified communications intelligence activities to the FIS Court of Review if it is deemed necessary for national security. The proposed legislation allows for the transfer of cases to the FIS Court of Review if the Attorney General deems it necessary for national security. However, there is uncertainty in the language of the proposed subsections of FISA regarding the transfer process and jurisdiction of the courts involved. The FISC has jurisdiction to determine standing and the legality of programs in criminal cases. Disclosure of national security information is governed by specific laws. Decisions of the FISC can be reviewed by the FIS Court of Review and the U.S. Supreme Court. Challenges to surveillance programs can be dismissed by the courts for legal reasons. The FISC decision is binding in all courts. New subsections allow for dismissal of challenges to surveillance programs. Requirements for approval of electronic surveillance programs are outlined in new sections. Factors for FISC consideration in approving programs are specified. The FISC must approve electronic surveillance programs, ensuring they comply with the U.S. Constitution. New FISA subsections outline factors for assessing constitutionality and contents of approval orders. Congressional oversight is addressed in new FISA sections, requiring the Attorney General to report to intelligence committees every 180 days. Committees retain authority to obtain necessary information. Sec. 8 of S. 3931 and Sec. 208 of S. 3929 amend FISA by repealing sections that allow the President to authorize surveillance without a court order. Current laws prohibit interception of communications, with exceptions for certain circumstances. Current 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(e) and (2)(f) provide exceptions for electronic surveillance by officers, employees, or agents of the United States in the normal course of their official duties. Section 2511(2)(e) allows surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, while section 2511(2)(f) ensures that acquiring foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications is not affected by other laws. The current provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(f) states that the United States Government can acquire foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications using means other than electronic surveillance as defined in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. This provision ensures that electronic surveillance can only be conducted under the provisions of FISA, chapter 119, or chapter 121 of the U.S. Code. Electronic surveillance is prohibited except under FISA, chapter 119, or chapter 121 of the U.S. Code. Amendments to FISA address criminal sanctions for unauthorized electronic surveillance. The amendments to FISA address criminal liability for unauthorized electronic surveillance, including penalties of up to $100,000 fine and imprisonment for up to 15 years for intentional engagement, disclosure, or use of information obtained under color of law through electronic surveillance not authorized by statute. The penalties under FISA would be increased to a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years for unauthorized electronic surveillance. Amendments to FISA also expand the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to include individuals expected to possess foreign intelligence information in the U.S. The new definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA would involve the intentional acquisition of information from a known person in the U.S. with a reasonable expectation of privacy, or the intentional acquisition of communication contents from individuals in the U.S. who have a reasonable expectation of privacy. This definition is more expansive than the current law. The new definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA involves acquiring information from a known person in the U.S. with a reasonable expectation of privacy or communication contents from individuals in the U.S. who have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Minimization procedures under FISA are designed to limit the acquisition and retention of non-publicly available information regarding unconsenting U.S. persons during electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. The new definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA involves acquiring information from a known person in the U.S. with a reasonable expectation of privacy or communication contents from individuals in the U.S. who have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Minimization procedures under FISA are designed to limit the acquisition and retention of non-publicly available information regarding unconsenting U.S. persons during electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. Current Sec. 101(h)(4) of FISA includes minimization procedures applicable to electronic surveillance without a court order to acquire foreign intelligence information. Subsection 104(h)(4) of FISA would be replaced with new language under which minimization procedures would include restrictions on disclosing, disseminating, or using communication contents involving a United States person. The current law under FISA includes minimization procedures for electronic surveillance without a court order, limiting the disclosure of communication contents involving a United States person. Proposed changes in S. 3931 and S. 3929 would further restrict the retention of such information unless authorized by a court order or the Attorney General deems it necessary for preventing harm. The proposed changes in S. 3931 and S. 3929 would amend the definition of \"contents\" in FISA to include information about the substance of communication. It would also expand the application for electronic surveillance to include acquisition of communication contents of foreign powers. The application under subsection 102(a)(1)(A)(i) of FISA would be expanded to include electronic surveillance directed at the contents of communications of foreign powers or agents of foreign powers. The amendment deletes a requirement for the Attorney General to certify no substantial likelihood of acquiring U.S. person communications. Surveillance must comply with the Attorney General's certification and minimization procedures. The Attorney General must assess compliance with minimization procedures for electronic surveillance under FISA and report to congressional intelligence committees. If surveillance targets an agent of a foreign power, the report must justify the belief. The Attorney General must transmit certification to the FISC under seal, and can direct common carriers to assist with surveillance. The current Sec.102(a)(4), 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a)(4), allows the Attorney General to direct common carriers to provide assistance for electronic surveillance while maintaining secrecy and minimizing interference with their services. The proposed subsection 102(a) of FISA does not include this provision, but the proposed subsection 102(b)(1) grants the President authority to authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year. The Attorney General can authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year from individuals outside the United States, with certain conditions and minimization procedures in place. Compliance with the certification and procedures is required. The Attorney General can authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year from individuals outside the United States, with certain conditions and minimization procedures in place. Compliance with the Attorney General's certification and minimization procedures is required, and reports on compliance must be provided to congressional intelligence committees. The Attorney General can direct a specified person to provide necessary information, facilities, and assistance while maintaining secrecy and minimizing interference with their services to the target. Any records kept by the assisting person must be under security procedures. The new subsection 102(d) of FISA requires the government to compensate individuals providing aid at the prevailing rate. Failure to comply with the Attorney General's directive could result in recourse to the FISC. A person receiving a directive can challenge its legality by filing a petition with the FISC review pool. The FISC review pool allows individuals to challenge the legality of a directive by filing a petition. The assigned judge must review the petition within 24 hours and make a determination within 72 hours. If the directive is found to be unlawful, it may be modified or set aside. If not, compliance is required. If the judge does not modify or set aside the directive, he must immediately affirm it and order compliance. A petition to the FIS Court of Review must be made within seven days for review of the decision. The FIS Court of Review must provide written reasons for its decision, and further review can be sought from the U.S. Supreme Court. Judicial proceedings under Section 102 of FISA must be conducted expeditiously and maintained under security measures. Proposed subsections of FISA outline security measures for maintaining judicial proceedings, including filing petitions under seal and allowing ex parte review of classified information. It also precludes any legal action against providers for assisting the Government and permits the use of information acquired under Attorney General authorization, subject to minimization procedures. Information acquired under Section 102 of FISA can be used or disclosed by federal officers and employees in accordance with minimization procedures. Disclosure for law enforcement purposes requires advance authorization from the Attorney General, and privileged communications obtained under this section retain their privileged status. Procedures for using or disclosing this information in federal or state proceedings are outlined in proposed subsections of FISA. Proposed subsections 102(m) and (n) of FISA outline procedures for using or disclosing information acquired under Section 102 in federal or state proceedings. The government must notify the aggrieved person and the court before introducing the information as evidence. Similarly, a state or political subdivision must follow similar procedures for using or disclosing information obtained through a Section 102 acquisition. Proposed subsection 102(n) of FISA requires a state or political subdivision to notify the aggrieved person, court, and U.S. Attorney General before using or disclosing information obtained through a Section 102 acquisition in any legal proceeding. The aggrieved person can move to suppress the evidence if it was unlawfully acquired or not in conformity with an authorization order. The evidence acquired through a Section 102 acquisition can be challenged on the grounds of unlawful acquisition or non-conformity with authorization. A motion to suppress must be made before the trial, hearing, or proceeding, unless there is no opportunity or awareness of the grounds. If the Attorney General affirms that disclosure would harm national security, a motion to suppress can be filed when seeking to discover or suppress evidence related to a Section 102 acquisition. The U.S. district court can review materials related to a Section 102 acquisition to determine its lawfulness. If the acquisition was not lawfully authorized or conducted, the evidence obtained from it would be suppressed. Proposed subsection 102(q) of FISA states that evidence unlawfully obtained from an acquisition authorized under Section 102 would be suppressed if found not lawfully conducted. Subsection 102(r) allows federal officers to consult with law enforcement personnel to investigate or protect against potential attacks. Officers under FISA can consult with law enforcement to coordinate efforts in investigating foreign threats. Directives and orders under FISA must be retained for 10 years. Amendments authorize the Chief Justice to designate FISC judges. The Chief Justice of the United States is authorized to designate 11 district court judges as FISC judges, with specific residency requirements. The President can authorize the Attorney General to approve FISC order applications under Title I of FISA. FISC judges can grant orders for electronic surveillance of foreign powers. Amendments are made to FISA Section 104, including new certification requirements for electronic surveillance court orders. Amendments to FISA Section 104 include replacing subsections 104(a)(6) through (11) with new subsections 104(a)(6) through (10). Certification for electronic surveillance court orders will now be made by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or an authorized executive branch official. Subsection 104(b) deals with excluding certain information from FISC order applications for surveillance of foreign powers. The application for a FISC order authorizing electronic surveillance on a foreign power must exclude certain information and include details on surveillance techniques and potential information on U.S. persons. Proposed amendments would strike current Sec. 104(b) of FISA and redesignate subsections 104(c)-(e) as 104(b)-(d) of FISA. The Attorney General must review applications for electronic surveillance for specified targets under FISA upon request from certain government officials. Proposed amendments would expand the list of officials to include the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Additionally, amendments would modify the process for FISC judges to approve electronic surveillance applications under FISA. Proposed amendments to FISA would involve redesignating subsections and replacing current specifications for electronic surveillance orders. This includes specifying coverage and minimization procedures for multiple surveillance devices. The proposed amendments to FISA involve redesignating subsections and replacing current specifications for electronic surveillance orders, including specifying coverage and minimization procedures for surveillance devices. The amendments would require each order to specify the type of electronic surveillance involved, including whether physical entry is required. Extensions of an order may be granted on the same basis as an original order, with new findings made in the same manner as required for an original order. The amendments to FISA involve redesignating subsections and replacing specifications for electronic surveillance orders. Extensions of an order may be granted on the same basis as an original order, with new findings made in the same manner as required for an original order. Section 105(e)(2) outlines exceptions for extensions of surveillance targeted against foreign powers or agents of foreign powers who are not United States persons. The amendments to FISA allow for extensions of surveillance orders on the same basis as the original order, with new findings required. Emergency authorization for electronic surveillance without a court order is permitted for up to 72 hours in cases of emergency. The amendments to FISA allow for extensions of surveillance orders on the same basis as the original order, with new findings required. Emergency authorization for electronic surveillance without a court order is permitted for up to 72 hours in cases of emergency. The Attorney General or his designee must notify an FISC judge of the emergency surveillance, and a court order must be sought within the 72-hour window. The new language would grant authority to an executive branch officer for emergency electronic surveillance without a court order. The new language grants authority for emergency electronic surveillance without a court order to an executive branch officer appointed by the President with Senate approval. The Attorney General must be informed of the emergency surveillance, and a FISC judge must be notified as soon as possible after authorization. An application for a FISC order must be made within 72 hours of the emergency surveillance authorization. The new provision allows emergency electronic surveillance without a court order by an executive branch officer appointed by the President with Senate approval. A FISC judge must be notified within seven days of authorization, replacing the previous 72-hour limit. Surveillance ends when information is obtained, the order is denied, or after seven days of approval by the authorized officer. The branch officer appointed by the President with Senate approval can conduct emergency electronic surveillance without a court order. The restrictions on disclosure and use of information obtained from such surveillance parallel existing law. The revised language requires minimization procedures to be followed. Additionally, modifications to limitations of liability for providers of information, facilities, or technical assistance in FISA electronic surveillance are proposed. The revised FISA law limits liability for providers assisting with electronic surveillance or physical search. No cause of action can be taken against those who comply with court orders or requests for assistance. Section 106 restricts the use of information on unconsenting U.S. persons acquired through FISA surveillance, with notification requirements and the opportunity to suppress unlawfully acquired information. The revised FISA law limits liability for providers assisting with electronic surveillance or physical search, with notification requirements and the opportunity to suppress unlawfully acquired information. Sec. 106 of FISA restricts the use of information on unconsenting U.S. persons acquired through surveillance, including destruction of unintentionally acquired information under certain circumstances. The Attorney General determines a threat of death or serious bodily harm in communications. A proposed amendment to FISA is unclear in its language regarding significant foreign intelligence information. The proposed amendment to FISA involves the destruction of unintentionally acquired communication contents, with exceptions for significant foreign intelligence information or threats of harm. There is ambiguity in the language regarding the inclusion of \"contain foreign intelligence information or.\" Sec. 9(g)(2) of S. 3930 and Sec. 209(g)(2) of S. 3929 amend subsection 106(k) by replacing \"104(a)(7)\" with \"104(a)(6)\" in FISA. Sec. 9(h) of S. 3931 and Sec. 209(h) of S. 3929 amend congressional oversight provisions to require a feasibility study for a secure document management system for FISC orders. The proposed amendments to Title I of FISA include adding a new category of \"agent of a foreign power\" for individuals involved in weapons of mass destruction activities. This would require prompt submission of applications and rulings to the FISC. The proposed amendments to Title I of FISA include adding a new category of \"agent of a foreign power\" for individuals involved in weapons of mass destruction activities, including sabotage, international terrorism, and proliferation activities. This expands the definition of who can be considered an \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA. The proposed amendments to FISA would add a new category of \"agent of a foreign power\" for individuals involved in weapons of mass destruction activities. This includes sabotage, international terrorism, and proliferation activities. The new subsection defines \"weapon of mass destruction\" to include destructive devices, weapons involving biological agents or toxins, and weapons designed to release radiation. Amendments to FISA sections would encompass these activities. The proposed amendments to FISA would expand the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to include individuals involved in weapons of mass destruction activities, such as sabotage, international terrorism, and proliferation. The amendments would also address the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including those involving radioactivity. Amendments to FISA sections would cover these activities and extend the duration of surveillance and physical searches for international targets. The court grants the motion to add a new subsection to FISA, allowing orders to remain in force during authorized physical searches even if the target is outside the US. Amendments to FISA would replace current sections, repeal wartime authorities, and create a new Title VII."
