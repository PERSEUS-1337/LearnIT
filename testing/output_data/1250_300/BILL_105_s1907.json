    "content": "REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR WETLAND RESTORATION AND CONSERVATION EXPENSES: Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section on wetland restoration and conservation expenses. The tax code allows eligible taxpayers to claim a credit for wetland restoration, conservation, and easement expenses. The wetland restoration credit is based on expenditures for restoring farmed or converted wetlands to their natural state, approved by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The tax code allows eligible taxpayers to claim a wetland conservation credit for expenses related to restoring farmed or converted wetlands. The credit includes the applicable percentage of the Conservation Reserve Program rental rate and certification fees for compliance. The tax code allows eligible taxpayers to claim a wetland conservation credit for expenses related to restoring farmed or converted wetlands. The credit includes applicable percentages based on the term of the conservation agreement, with a denial of credit if a wetland easement credit is elected. The tax code allows eligible taxpayers to claim a wetland conservation credit for expenses related to restoring farmed or converted wetlands. The wetland easement credit allows taxpayers to receive an amount equal to the fair market value of qualified wetlands subject to a conservation easement. An election under this subsection applies to the taxable year for which it is made. Definitions for eligible taxpayer and qualified wetland are provided for the purpose of claiming wetland conservation credits. Eligible taxpayers must own wetlands and surrounding farmland and have a conservation agreement or easement in place. Qualified wetlands are those being restored to fully functioning wetland condition. The term \"qualified wetland\" refers to a prior converted wetland being restored to functioning wetland condition, along with surrounding nonwetland areas for water quality or wildlife habitat buffering. Excluded are lands receiving payments from certain conservation programs. The taxpayer receives contract or easement payments in the taxable year from the Conservation Reserve Program or the Wetlands Reserve Program under the Food Security Act of 1985. The terms 'wetland', 'farmed wetland', and 'prior converted wetland' are defined by the Act. A 'qualified conservation agreement' is an agreement with a governmental unit for 10-30 years, where the taxpayer agrees to comply with conservation requirements for the qualified wetland. A qualified conservation agreement requires the taxpayer to comply with conservation requirements for the wetland, including not using it for agricultural production and avoiding any activities that could harm its natural state. Compliance must be certified every 5 years. The term 'qualified conservation easement' refers to an easement granted in perpetuity by the taxpayer to restrict the use of a wetland for conservation purposes. No double benefit is allowed for expenses that are eligible for deduction or credit under other tax provisions. No credit is allowed for expenses eligible for deduction or credit under other tax provisions. Married couples must file joint returns for this section to apply. Conforming amendments are made to related sections of the Internal Revenue Code. The table of sections for subpart C of part IV of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking the last item and inserting a new item from section 35 of the Code. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1998."
