    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995\". Congress recognizes the fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children, as established in Supreme Court cases. The role of parents in raising their children is highly valued and should be protected by all levels of government. Some courts have not treated parental rights as fundamental, leading to inadequate judicial review of government actions affecting these rights. Parents are facing increasing intrusions into their responsibilities. The Act aims to protect parents' fundamental right to direct their children's upbringing and safeguard children from abuse and neglect. It emphasizes that government interference in parental decisions should only occur with compelling justification. The traditional 4-step process used by courts appropriately balances the interests of parents, children, and government. The Act emphasizes the fundamental right of parents to raise their children and protect them from abuse and neglect. It also highlights the responsibility of parents to ensure their children are educated for literacy and self-sufficiency. Additionally, it upholds the common law tradition of allowing parental choices in healthcare decisions unless it poses a danger to the child's life or serious physical injury. The Act sets a standard of judicial review for parental rights, allowing courts to apply the rights based on the facts of each case. The Act establishes a 4-step process to evaluate cases regarding parental rights, shifting the burden of proof to the government to demonstrate interference is necessary for a compelling governmental interest. The Act requires the government to show that any interference with parental rights is essential for a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means to achieve that interest.
