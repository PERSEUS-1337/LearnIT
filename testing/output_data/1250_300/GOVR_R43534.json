    "content": "In 1978, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to address electronic surveillance abuses. FISA established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review government applications for surveillance. Recent concerns have led to proposals to amend FISA and the practices of the FISC, focusing on the selection process for FISA court judges. Federal judges in Article III courts have life tenure and preside over cases with dispositive judgments. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review government applications for surveillance. FISC is an Article III court with judges who have life tenure and preside over cases with dispositive judgments. The FISC can issue orders related to foreign intelligence investigations, including approving electronic surveillance, physical searches, pen register or trap and trace device use, and access to certain business records. The FISA Court of Review can review FISC denials, and the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court designates federal judges to serve on the FISC and FISA Court of Review. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review government applications for surveillance. FISA also created the FISA Court of Review, which can review FISC denials. The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court designates federal judges to serve on both courts. Some argue that the selection process for FISA judges should not solely rely on the Chief Justice, leading to proposed bills in Congress to alter the selection method. Several bills in the 113th Congress aim to change the process for selecting FISA judges, including proposals to give selection authority to chief judges of circuit courts or the President with Senate advice and consent. The issue of constitutionality arises with these proposals, as the judicial branch has expressed concern about shifting selection away from the Chief Justice. This report reviews the constitutional method for appointing Article III judges, the process of \"designation\" for temporary service on federal courts, and explores the implications of altering the selection process for FISA judges. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution outlines the process for appointing Article III judges, who are considered principal officers. Congress has the authority to designate current federal judges to serve temporarily on another federal court without a separate appointment. There are proposals to shift designation authority from the Chief Justice to other officials in different branches of government, raising questions about constitutionality. The Appointments Clause allows for the designation of current federal judges to serve on another federal court without a separate appointment, as long as the additional duties are related to their original government post. This principle of \"germaneness\" established in previous court cases allows for the expansion of power and duties without requiring a second appointment. The Appointments Clause permits the designation of current federal judges to serve on another federal court without a separate appointment, as long as the additional duties are related to their original government post. Congress has a history of employing designations for Article III courts, with the Chief Justice having the authority to temporarily assign federal judges to serve on other federal courts, including specialized tribunals like the now-defunct Commerce Court. The Commerce Court's Chief Justice-based designation process, a model for future specialized courts, allowed judges to be appointed by the President with Senate consent or designated by the Chief Justice. Lower federal court judges also have designation authority. The Supreme Court has upheld designations, stating it's a matter of statutory construction, not a constitutional issue. The designation process for federal court judges, including FISA judges, has been upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court. The Court has ruled that the Chief Justice's authority to designate judges does not violate the Appointments Clause. This process is seen as a matter of statutory construction, not a constitutional issue. The Ninth Circuit upheld the temporary assignment of district court judges by the Chief Justice, citing precedent for such assignments. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act proposes dispersing the selection process for the FISC among the 13 chief judges of the circuit courts and the Chief Justice. The central issue is whether designation by certain individuals within different branches of government would be constitutionally permissible. The Judge Selection Reform Act (S. 1460) proposes dispersing the selection process for the FISC among the 13 chief judges of the circuit courts and the Chief Justice. The number of FISC judges would increase from 11 to 13, with one designated from each judicial circuit. The Chief Justice would have the final authority in designating a judge to the FISA courts. While the Chief Justice would have the final authority in designating a judge to the FISA courts under the Judge Selection Reform Act, the proposal suggests involving the 13 chief judges of the circuit courts in the selection process. Judicial precedent indicates that Congress has the power to authorize others within the judicial branch to designate FISA judges, as seen in the McDowell case where it was stated that Congress can determine how and where a judge may exercise jurisdiction. This suggests that Congress could potentially grant chief judges the authority to designate judges from within their circuits to serve on the FISA courts. Based on judicial precedent, Congress may have the authority to grant chief judges the power to designate judges from within their circuits to serve on the FISA courts. However, proposals such as the Presidential Appointment of FISA Court Judges Act suggest shifting this authority to the President, potentially constituting a second constitutional appointment. The proposal to allow chief judges to designate judges for the FISA courts could be seen as a second constitutional appointment, raising questions about the courts' Article III status. While FISA judges serve for seven-year terms, it may be argued that life tenure protects a judge's overall position in the federal judiciary. Previous precedent suggests that judges appointed to special panels for a fixed term do not lose their Article III status. A federal judge appointed to the FISA courts for a fixed term retains their Article III status and protections. However, giving the President sole authority to select judges for the FISA courts may raise separation-of-powers concerns. The Mistretta v. United States case established that the President can appoint judges to the U.S. Sentencing Commission without undermining judicial independence. The President cannot affect the tenure or compensation of Article III judges or coerce them in their judicial duties. The President does not have the power to affect the tenure or compensation of Article III judges, nor can he coerce them in their judicial duties. FISA judges, unlike those in Mistretta, exercise judicial powers on an Article III court, raising separation-of-powers concerns if the President's power to remove them could compromise their impartiality. Proposals suggest vesting designation authority with congressional leadership, as seen in the FISA Court Accountability Act (H.R. 2586). Proposals to vest designation authority with congressional leadership, such as the FISA Court Accountability Act (H.R. 2586), may raise concerns under the Appointments Clause and separation-of-powers principles. Congressional designations to the judiciary could potentially conflict with the bicameralism and presentment requirements of the Constitution. Legislative acts altering legal rights must meet bicameralism and presentment requirements. Congressional designations to judiciary without approval may violate principles in Chadha."
