    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" and its purpose and findings are outlined in Section 2. The \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" aims to establish a standard for labeling foods produced using genetic engineering, including fish, to inform consumers about the production process. Congress recognizes the material changes in genetically engineered food, the right of individuals to know how their food is produced, and the existing labeling requirements in other countries. Several countries, including Japan, Brazil, Australia, India, and China, have laws requiring disclosure of genetically engineered food on labels. The Codex Alimentarius, a United Nations food standards organization, allows governments to decide on labeling for genetically engineered foods. Mandatory labeling can help preserve the economic value of exports and sensitive domestic markets. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear disclosure of genetically engineered ingredients in food, with exceptions for certain types of food like those served in restaurants or medical foods. The term 'genetic engineering' is defined as a process involving nucleic acid techniques. The term 'genetic engineering' involves in vitro nucleic acid techniques, fusion of cells beyond taxonomic family, and overcoming natural barriers for food production intended for human consumption. The curr_chunk defines genetically engineered organisms and ingredients in food, while also amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding penalties. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to state that no person shall face penalties for misbranded food if they provide a guaranty that the food is not genetically engineered. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to state that no person shall face penalties for misbranded food if they provide a guaranty that the food is not genetically engineered. This exclusion applies regardless of how the recipient uses the food, such as processing, using as an ingredient, repacking, or producing the food. No person can avoid responsibility for misbranded food by transferring liability to another through a contract, except for requiring a guaranty.

No person can avoid responsibility for misbranded food by transferring liability to another through a contract, except for requiring a guaranty. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to exempt agricultural producers from penalties for misbranded food if their non-genetically engineered products are contaminated unintentionally with genetically engineered material. The Secretary must establish labeling regulations within a year of the Act's enactment. The Secretary must establish labeling regulations within a year of the Act's enactment to address the unintentional contamination of non-genetically engineered products with genetically engineered material."
