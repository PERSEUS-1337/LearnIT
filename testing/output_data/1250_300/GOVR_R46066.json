Some analysts question the effectiveness and sustainability of NATO's deterrence efforts. The RAND Corporation report from February 2016 highlights NATO's inability to defend its exposed members. Some allies push for more forces in the region for deterrence, while others advocate for dialogue with Russia alongside deterrence. Concerns about violating the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act limit permanent troop deployments in newer NATO countries. In London, allies focused on cyber and hybrid threats, declaring space as a new operational domain for NATO.

NATO members agreed in 2006 to allocate 2% of GDP to defense annually, with a 20% focus on procurement and research. The targets were formalized in 2014, with allies pledging to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade. European allies and Canada have added $130 billion in defense spending since 2014, showing growth for five consecutive years. Critics worry that Trump's criticism of insufficient defense spending could harm NATO cohesion and credibility. U.S. and NATO officials are encouraged by the growth in defense spending by European allies and Canada, with $130 billion added since 2014. By 2024, this figure is expected to rise to $400 billion. While some allies have met the 2% guideline, others like Germany are criticized for falling short. Germany plans to reach 1.5% of GDP by 2024. Many allies argue that contributions to NATO missions and military capabilities should be considered alongside spending levels. Allied contributions to NATO missions and military capabilities are deemed as important as defense spending levels. The focus should be on defense outputs rather than just budget size, with an emphasis on modernization and effectiveness. Secretary General Stoltenberg advocates for a broad approach to measuring contributions, including cash, capabilities, and contributions beyond the 2% GDP defense spending target. In London, allied leaders approved a U.S. proposal to adjust contributions to NATO's common funds, with the U.S. and Germany each contributing about 16%.

Chinese investment in critical infrastructure and telecommunications systems, like 5G networks, is a concern for U.S. officials. NATO allies are updating requirements for civilian telecommunications to address risks associated with cyber threats and foreign ownership. The EU is working on guidelines for 5G networks, but individual national governments will make the final decisions. U.S. officials have warned that using Huawei or other Chinese equipment could hinder intelligence sharing due to security fears. The UK and Germany allow Chinese companies to bid on 5G contracts but have strict national security requirements. The UK announced that \"high-risk vendors\" like Huawei will be excluded from sensitive parts of 5G networks. Other countries, such as Poland and Czech Republic, are considering excluding Huawei due to national security concerns. Despite US worries, officials are optimistic about US-Europe cooperation. Huawei is labeled a national security risk by Czech Republic intelligence officials. US and Europe aim to address security and economic issues posed by China together.

NATO deployed air defense systems along the Turkish-Syrian border in response to Turkish requests after incidents in 2012. Italy withdrew its system in 2019, while Spain still has a Patriot missile battery there.

The North Atlantic Treaty lacks provisions for action against a member without consent, but measures could be taken by the US and other members.
