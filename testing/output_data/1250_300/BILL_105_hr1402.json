    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commission on Probabilistic Methods Act\". The Congress recognizes the wide applicability of probabilistic methods in improving efficiency and reducing overdesign in government programs. Integrating these methods into business practices has saved billions of dollars for companies. Federal use of probabilistic methods lags behind industry, but they hold promise for better understanding safety and environmental risks. Implementing probabilistic methods in federally funded design efforts could lead to cost reductions and better product specifications. The Department of Transportation could benefit from using probabilistic methods to quantify uncertainties and improve reliability. The Department of Transportation could benefit from using probabilistic methods to quantify uncertainties and improve reliability in transportation systems, which could also benefit other Federal agencies. The Administrator of the Research and Special Programs Administration of the Department of Transportation will establish the Commission on Probabilistic Methods to improve reliability in transportation systems. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will identify, assess, evaluate, establish models, recommend guidelines, and set reliability levels to improve reliability in transportation systems and increase public safety. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend guidelines for safety tests, database creation, technology transfer, legal barriers, program use, institutionalization of values, and pilot projects for the Department of Transportation.
