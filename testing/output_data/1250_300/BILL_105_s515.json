    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Liability Reform for Volunteer Services Act\". The increasingly litigious nature of the legal profession in the United States has created barriers for individuals to help others through volunteerism. Lawsuits, excessive damage awards, and unfair liability allocations hinder volunteerism and charitable service. Arbitrary damage awards contribute to high liability insurance costs for volunteers and organizations, making it challenging to provide services without economic benefits. Volunteer service organizations in the United States are being adversely affected by fears of frivolous lawsuits, leading to a decline in essential services such as crisis counseling, volunteer rescue services, and support for the elderly. Federal legislation is needed to clarify and limit the personal liability risks for volunteers, due to the national scope of the problem created by these fears. Federal legislation is necessary to address the national scope of problems caused by fears of frivolous lawsuits against volunteer service organizations. The citizens of the United States rely on these organizations for various social programs, and the Federal Government lacks the capacity to provide all the services they offer. Liability reform for volunteer service organizations will promote the free flow of goods and services, lessen burdens on interstate commerce, and uphold constitutionally protected due process rights. The Act aims to protect volunteers and volunteer organizations from personal financial liability by limiting punitive damages, ensuring fair allocation of liability, and promoting fairness in civil actions. It is based on the powers granted in the United States Constitution and the fourteenth amendment.

BIFURCATION AT REQUEST OF ANY PARTY. The trier of fact must consider punitive damages separately from compensatory damages upon request.

In actions against multiple defendants, liability for compensatory damages is determined based on each defendant's percentage of responsibility for the harm. The court will allocate compensatory damages accordingly. When determining compensatory damages for a defendant in a lawsuit, the trier of fact must assess the percentage of responsibility of each person involved in causing harm to the claimant, regardless of whether they are part of the lawsuit."
