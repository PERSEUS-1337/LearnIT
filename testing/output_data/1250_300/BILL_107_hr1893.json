    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"General Equivalency Diploma Reform and Improvement Act of 2001\". Since the mid-1970s, the Federal Government and many State and local agencies have promoted the General Equivalency Diploma (GED) over a traditional high school degree. However, with the current economy requiring higher skilled workers, the GED is no longer seen as a sufficient alternative. Economists have found that individuals with exam-certified high school equivalents have similar outcomes in the labor market as high school dropouts, including poor wages, earnings, and job experiences. Individuals with General Equivalency Diplomas have lower employment rates, poor wages, and inferior labor market status compared to those with traditional high school degrees. Employers and the military tend to undervalue the GED, and there is no substitute for traditional classroom education programs. (4) Despite a decrease in teenage pregnancy rates, there were still 3,941,553 adolescent girls giving birth in 1999. The importance of providing educational opportunities for pregnant teenagers and young parents is emphasized. (5) It is crucial to prevent unintended pregnancies while also ensuring that pregnant teenagers and young parents receive quality education to become productive citizens. (6) All Americans, including pregnant teenagers and young parents, deserve access to a high-quality education. SEC. 3. STUDY AND REVIEW OF POLICIES. The Secretary of Education will conduct a study on the value of a GED compared to a high school diploma and review policies to improve educational opportunities for all, including pregnant teenagers and young mothers. This includes cooperating with federal agencies, working with states and local agencies, encouraging dropouts to return for training, and supporting individuals currently employed. The Secretary of Education will conduct a study on the value of a GED compared to a high school diploma, review policies to improve educational opportunities, and make recommendations for reform within 2 years of the enactment of the Act. Authorization of $2,000,000 for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to carry out the Act."
