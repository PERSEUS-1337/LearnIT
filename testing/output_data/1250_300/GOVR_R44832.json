    "content": "Prescription drug affordability has become a major concern due to the rise in retail drug spending, driven by new drug introductions and price increases. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services predict a 6.3% annual growth in drug spending from 2017 to 2026, outpacing other medical spending areas. This report will address government and private-sector policies affecting drug prices and availability, including research funding, advertising regulation, reimportation restrictions, and federal price negotiation. The report discusses government and private-sector policies impacting drug prices and availability, including research funding, advertising regulation, reimportation restrictions, and federal price negotiation. It references data from the National Health Expenditures (NHE) accounts, showing that the U.S. spent $328.6 billion on prescription drugs in 2016 and is forecasted to spend $338.1 billion in 2017, representing 10% of predicted national healthcare spending. The United States spent $328.6 billion on prescription drugs in 2016, forecasted to rise to $338.1 billion in 2017, representing 10% of national healthcare spending. Retail drug spending has ranged from 5% to 10% of total healthcare expenditures since 1960. Various sources provide estimates of U.S. prescription drug spending, including retail and institutional use. The pace of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has varied over the years, with growth rates fluctuating. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, spending grew rapidly, but slowed down from 2003 to 2013 due to various factors such as the economic recession and increased use of generic drugs. However, in 2014, spending for retail prescription drugs accelerated. Retail drug spending in the U.S. experienced fluctuations due to factors like the economic recession and increased use of generic drugs. However, in 2014, spending surged by 12.4%, marking the largest annual increase in over a decade. Projections indicate a continued growth in retail drug spending, driven by faster drug price growth, especially for specialty drugs. This growth rate is expected to outpace other areas of health care spending. Congressional hearings have been conducted to address the rising spending and sharp increases. Retail drug spending in the U.S. has been fluctuating, but saw a significant surge in 2014 due to new high-cost drugs and price increases. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also contributed to the increase in drug demand. Congressional hearings have been held to address the rising spending and sharp increases in drug prices. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) helped drive drug demand, with prescription drug spending slowing in 2016 despite increased utilization. Factors included fewer new drug approvals, less use of high-cost hepatitis C drugs, and reduced spending on diabetes treatments. New drugs are often more expensive than older ones, but generic options can lower costs. The FDA approved many new drugs, including specialty drugs for hepatitis C, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. In 2016, over half of the growth in drug spending was from drugs available for less than two years, with new hepatitis C drugs playing a significant role in increased spending in 2014 and 2015. The introduction of new hepatitis C drugs significantly increased U.S. prescription drug spending in 2014 and 2015, with these drugs accounting for a large portion of the growth. However, the impact of these expensive drugs is decreasing as fewer new patients are treated and prices drop. Generic substitution has played a smaller role in reducing drug spending since 2009, when patents for many brand-name drugs expired. Changes in drug mix will continue to affect spending in the future. Since the patent cliff, spending on brand-name drugs facing generic competition has decreased by $32.6 billion. However, savings from drugs losing patent protection have been lower. The drug mix changes will impact future spending, with many biologics in the pipeline having high prices and limited cheaper alternatives. Despite FDA approval of biosimilar substitutes for some biologics, their prices are not significantly lower. Prescription drug prices have risen faster than overall inflation since 2014, but the gap narrowed in 2017. U.S. retail drug inflation, measured by CPI-U, was 6.4% in 2014, compared to general consumer inflation of 0.8%. Drug prices rose 6.2% in 2016 and 2.8% in 2017. Price increases for brand-name and new innovator drugs, along with some generic drugs, have driven inflation. ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage has boosted demand. Brand-name drug prices rose 10.7% from 2015 to 2016, while generic drug prices declined by 8.7%. Biologics and specialty drugs have contributed to price inflation. The ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage has boosted demand for drugs, with a 15% annual increase in drug spending for insured consumers from 2014 to 2015. The aging population, especially those aged 50 and older, has also contributed to increased demand for prescription drugs. Medicaid coverage expansion under the ACA led to an 8% jump in Medicaid prescription drug claims in 2014. The aging population, particularly those aged 50 and older, has driven an increase in demand for prescription drugs. Out-of-pocket spending for prescriptions has decreased over the years, with commercial payers and taxpayer-financed health programs covering a larger share of drug costs. Consumer cost sharing still varies depending on factors such as insurance coverage and drug type. Despite a decrease in out-of-pocket spending for prescriptions, consumers can still face high costs depending on factors like insurance coverage, drug type, and health plan policies. Health plans have been increasing cost sharing for prescription drugs, with a rise in drug deductibles and the use of formulary tiered pricing. This has led to a greater financial burden on consumers, especially for expensive specialty drugs. The differential between health plan price tiers has been widening, imposing a greater financial burden on consumers who use higher-priced drugs. In 2017, enrollees in employer-sponsored health plans with multiple drug tiers had higher co-payments for expensive drugs compared to generic ones. Cost-sharing increases have been partially offset by the ACA and pharmaceutical manufacturers offering patient assistance programs. Generic drug use rates have continued to rise, keeping cost sharing low for consumers. Out-of-pocket spending for retail drugs has declined in recent years, but the number of consumers with high costs has increased, especially for those with serious conditions or prescribed specialty drugs. A 2016 study found that while average out-of-pocket spending decreased, nearly 3% of enrollees had costs exceeding $1,000 in 2014. The share of people with high drug costs has tripled since 2004, with median out-of-pocket spending for outpatient specialty drugs rising by 46% from 2003 to 2014. Out-of-pocket spending for outpatient specialty drugs rose from $24 to $35 per month from 2003 to 2014, while spending for nonspecialty drugs declined from $14 to $6 per month. Per person out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs decreased from $146 in 2010 to $140 in 2016, with a forecast to increase to $207 by 2026. Government share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending rose from 25% in 2005 to 44.1% in 2017 due to expanded subsidized drug coverage. The government's share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending rose from 25% in 2005 to an estimated 44.1% in 2017, and is forecasted to increase to 47% by 2026. Unlike other countries, the U.S. does not have a centralized system for government-sponsored drug benefits or setting drug prices. Various federal health programs operate different drug discount and contracting systems, with FDA regulating drug safety and effectiveness but not setting prices. Federal agencies can secure significant discounts for prescription drugs under this decentralized system. The government's share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has increased significantly. Congress has not given FDA authority to set drug prices. Federal agencies can secure discounts for prescription drugs, but discounts vary among programs. Legislation has been introduced to give the HHS Secretary more power to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. A table outlines prescription purchasing systems for federal health care programs. Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, Medicaid, and the Veterans Health Administration health system are among the largest federal health programs. Medicare Part D is a market-oriented program where commercial health payers compete for enrollees based on drug coverage and pricing. The program includes drug rebates, discounts, and negotiations with manufacturers and pharmacies. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 prohibits the HHS Secretary from interfering in negotiations. Congress has debated the effectiveness of the market-based model in controlling drug prices and costs for enrollees. In the years since Medicare Part D was enacted, Congress has debated the effectiveness of the market-based model in controlling drug prices and enrollee costs. Some lawmakers propose giving the Secretary authority to negotiate drug prices, citing studies that show Medicaid secures lower drug prices than Part D. Some lawmakers propose giving the Secretary authority to negotiate drug prices for Medicare Part D, leveraging the combined purchasing power of beneficiaries to secure larger discounts. Previous attempts in 2007 were unsuccessful, with concerns about potential reductions in drug coverage. Patient and consumer groups oppose giving the Secretary more control of the Part D formulary, fearing reductions in drug coverage. Lawmakers have introduced bills to modify the noninterference provision, with proposals to negotiate prices for high-cost drugs. The Trump Administration suggests requiring Part D plans to pass on more drug rebates to enrollees and moving some Part B-covered drugs to Part D for lower prices. Legislation has been proposed to apply Medicaid's rebates to Part D drugs for low-income enrollees, potentially lowering costs in the first decade but facing potential price increases over time. State governments play a significant role in regulating prescription drug use and pricing, administering and funding Medicaid, and offering health insurance plans to state employees. Some states have patient assistance programs providing free prescription drugs to low-income residents. Various approaches are being used to address prescription drug spending and access, including limiting spending on high-priced drugs and requiring transparency in drug prices. Laws in California, Delaware, and Vermont aim to control drug costs and ensure manufacturer disclosure. Several states have passed laws to control prescription drug costs and ensure transparency in pricing. For example, California, Delaware, and Vermont have implemented measures such as capping cost sharing for drugs, requiring manufacturer disclosure for price increases, and prohibiting gag clauses in pharmacy contracts. Maine also allowed citizens to import prescription drugs from certain countries, although a federal court later ruled this unconstitutional. These efforts aim to hold drug companies accountable for their pricing practices. In 2013, the United States enacted a law allowing citizens to import prescription drugs from select countries. However, a federal court ruled the law unconstitutional in 2015. The U.S. spends more on prescription drugs compared to other industrialized nations, with projections showing an increase in global drug spending share. Studies show significant differences in drug prices between the U.S. and other countries. Studies have found large differences in drug prices between the United States and other countries, with the U.S. price for cancer drugs being at least double that in the European Union. Reasons for higher U.S. spending and prices include faster adoption of new drugs, patent protections, and government-run health care systems in other countries setting price limits. EU nations use external reference pricing to derive benchmark prices for medicines. Reference pricing involves using the price of a medicine in one country to set prices in another. National health programs may use value-based pricing, which ties payment to a drug's effectiveness. Different countries and organizations are experimenting with alternative pricing models, such as discounts based on health outcomes. The U.S. government is encouraging value-based purchasing in Medicaid programs. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) is conducting research on drug pricing. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) is producing public reports on the comparative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and potential budget impact of newly approved drugs. This has raised concerns in the pharmaceutical industry, with some saying the research is designed to limit reimbursement and patient access to treatments. ICER has refined its methodology for valuing prescription drugs and has engaged with various segments of the healthcare industry. The pharmaceutical industry focuses more on clinical trials than discovery research. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements is challenging, with studies showing a small percentage of new drugs originating from non-industry sources. Research on new molecular entities (NMEs) highlights the importance of innovative drugs. The origin of innovative new drugs, known as new molecular entities (NMEs), is a key focus. Studies show that a significant percentage of NMEs originate from publicly funded research. For example, a study found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from work in publicly funded labs. Additionally, 19% of drug applications that received priority review were based on publicly funded research. This highlights the substantial contribution of publicly funded research to the discovery of new drugs. The authors found that 46.2% of new-drug applications from public-sector research institutions received priority reviews, compared to 20.0% from private-sector research. This suggests that public-sector research institutions tend to discover drugs with significant clinical impact. The methodology used in the study excluded the role of public-sector research institutions in developing platform technologies for new drug classes. The Stevens study excluded the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies for new drug classes, which were crucial for many FDA-approved products. These technologies, developed with public funds, included recombinant DNA technology, bacterial production methods, antibody production methods, glycosylated protein production methods, and gene silencing techniques. Without these technologies, the pharmaceutical industry's economic outlook would have been significantly different. The use of small interfering RNAs led to the development of new drugs, impacting the pharmaceutical industry's economic outlook. A 2018 study revealed that NIH funding played a significant role in every new drug approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2016, with up to 20% of the NIH budget contributing to research associated with new drug approvals. This suggests a greater NIH contribution to new drug research than previously recognized. The NIH funding significantly contributed to new drug approvals from 2010-2016, with up to 20% of the NIH budget involved. Academic studies estimate the average cost of developing a new FDA-approved drug to be $2.6 billion, including clinical spending and time costs. Publicly traded pharmaceutical companies disclose aggregate research spending, but detailed drug development costs are not typically available. The cost of developing a new FDA-approved drug is estimated to be between $1.2 billion to $2.6 billion, with factors such as development time, cost of capital, and inclusion of orphan drugs affecting the final figure. Academic and government research have challenged the assumptions made in these cost estimates, including the rate of return needed to attract capital and the impact of federal tax breaks on research and development spending. Price transparency legislation is being debated in Congress and state legislatures to compel drugmakers to disclose data on research, marketing, and other costs for high-priced drugs. Research costs are assumed to be a main factor in drug pricing, but studies show that this may not always be the case. For example, a Senate investigation found that Gilead's pricing of hepatitis C drugs was not primarily based on research and development costs. Gilead's pricing strategy for Sovaldi and Harvoni focused on maximizing revenue rather than research and development costs. Pfizer's pricing of Ibrance was influenced by existing drug prices, reimbursement, and prescriber feedback. The United States allows direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs, with the FDA regulating to ensure accuracy and balance in ads. Pharmaceutical companies can currently deduct advertising expenses from federal taxes. Pharmaceutical advertising, including direct-to-consumer ads, must be accurate and balanced, with FDA oversight. Businesses can deduct advertising expenses from federal taxes. Pharmaceutical firms also market to healthcare providers through various channels. FDA has regulated drug advertising since 1962, evolving to address consumer advertising in the 1980s and issuing guidance on broadcast ads in 1999. Pharmaceutical firms began advertising to consumers in the 1980s, with FDA addressing this in a 1985 notice. DTC prescription drug advertising reached over $5 billion in 2006, dipped during the 2007 recession, and rebounded around 2014. Recent data shows a rapid increase in DTC advertising in recent years, with pharmaceutical advertising rising to over $6 billion from 2012 to 2015. Television and newspaper ads dominate spending, but internet-based drug ads are the fastest-growing area of DTC promotion. Pharmaceutical DTC advertising has seen a rapid increase in recent years, with internet-based drug ads being the fastest-growing area. Federal regulations require drug companies to submit prescription drug ads to the FDA for assessment. Supporters believe that advertising leads to more informed consumers, while critics argue that it may encourage inappropriate prescribing. Critics argue that drug advertising may lead to inappropriate prescribing and higher drug spending. Studies suggest a link between drug advertising and increased use of prescription drugs, with a 10% rise in advertising views leading to a 5.4% increase in filled prescriptions. Additionally, there are concerns that new brand-name drugs with higher prices may not offer enough additional benefits compared to existing treatments to justify their cost. A 2006 Government Accountability Office report found that drug advertising may lead to increased use of advertised drugs, even if alternatives may be more appropriate. A recent government survey showed that the public feels DTC advertisements lack sufficient information about the benefits and risks of drugs. The debate on restricting DTC drug advertising aims to protect public health and finances. The American Medical Association and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists have recommended a ban on DTC drug ads. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed a moratorium on advertising for new drugs, raising constitutional issues regarding commercial speech protection. In the past, courts have ruled that product advertisements are protected by the First Amendment as \"commercial speech.\" Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to impose a moratorium on advertising for new drugs. Concerns persist about the promotion of new drugs to consumers without long-term evidence of safety and effectiveness. The Institute of Medicine recommended in 2006 that the FDA restrict direct-to-consumer advertising of new drugs for two years after introduction. Congress has debated but not approved a moratorium on advertising for new drugs. Additionally, lawmakers introduced legislation to disallow federal tax deductions for pharmaceutical DTC advertising to reduce drug spending. FDA regulates the sale of pharmaceuticals in the US under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA regulates the sale of pharmaceuticals in the United States through approved marketing applications, which include clinical data, manufacturing procedures, and labeling requirements. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act clarifies that only the manufacturer of an FDA-approved drug can legally bring it back into the US. The Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act (MEDS Act) of 2000 allowed pharmacists and wholesalers to import FDA-approved prescription drugs, but in practice, this provision has not been implemented due to the HHS Secretary not certifying its safety and cost-effectiveness. The importation provision was included in the Medicare Modernization and Prescription Drug Act of 2003, but it has never been put into effect. The MEDS Act provision in the Medicare Modernization and Prescription Drug Act of 2003 has never been implemented, preventing importation of prescription drugs from abroad. Lawmakers have attempted to bypass administrative obstacles through the agriculture appropriations bill. The House has passed versions of the agriculture spending bill to allow importation of prescription drugs that comply with FDA requirements. FDA has been lenient in enforcing personal importation restrictions, allowing individuals to bring in a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use. The intent of the policy is to save FDA resources and permit medical treatments not otherwise available in the US. The FDA's personal use importation guidance aims to save resources by allowing individuals to import medical treatments not available in the US. It does not cover foreign-made versions of drugs available in the US. Some states have tried to pass laws allowing drug importation. The Senate has held hearings on various topics related to the pharmaceutical industry, including the FDA's role in the generic drug marketplace, Valeant Pharmaceuticals' business model, sudden price spikes in decades-old and off-patent drugs, and the proposed Medicare Part B drug demonstration. The Senate has conducted hearings on the pharmaceutical industry, focusing on topics such as sudden price spikes in off-patent drugs, the proposed Medicare Part B drug demonstration, and the cost of prescription drugs. The Senate has conducted hearings on the pharmaceutical industry, focusing on topics such as sudden price spikes in off-patent drugs, the proposed Medicare Part B drug demonstration, and the cost of prescription drugs. The hearings have covered issues related to the cost of prescription drugs, regulatory barriers inhibiting pharmaceutical competition, accelerating patient access to generic drugs, and progress reports on biosimilar implementation by the FDA. The FDA's progress report on biosimilar implementation was discussed in hearings by the Senate and House Energy and Commerce Committee on various pharmaceutical industry topics. The House Energy and Commerce Committee held hearings on various pharmaceutical industry topics, including modernizing FDA regulations, prescription drug user fee programs, generic drug and biosimilar user fee programs, Medicare drug experiments, antitrust concerns, and competition in pharmacy benefit manager and pharmacy marketplaces. The House Energy and Commerce Committee held hearings on various pharmaceutical industry topics, including antitrust concerns, competition in pharmacy benefit manager and pharmacy marketplaces, federally funded cancer research coordination and innovation, impact of voluntary restricted distribution systems in the pharmaceutical supply chain, rising price of EpiPens, and developments in the prescription drug market oversight.
