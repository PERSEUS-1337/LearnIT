The Act establishes the District of Columbia Natural Disaster Protection Funds, amending the Internal Revenue Code to allow qualified contributions to a natural disaster protection fund and providing a special rule for assets held in the fund. The Act establishes the District of Columbia Natural Disaster Protection Funds, allowing qualified contributions to a fund. Distributions from the fund are subject to specific rules, including the exclusion of certain distributions from gross income. Definitions and rules related to natural disaster protection funds are also provided in the Code. The Code defines a natural disaster protection fund as money, securities, or property held by a qualified insurance company in a segregated account. The fund must be designated as such and held in a licensed bank in the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Commissioner of Insurance, Securities, and Banking oversees a fund where assets must be invested according to investment laws, excess balance drawdowns must be distributed to qualified insurance companies, and no assets can be paid out except for qualified distributions. A qualified insurance company is defined as an insurer or reinsurer meeting certain criteria. The fund overseen by the District of Columbia Commissioner of Insurance, Securities, and Banking can only be distributed to qualified insurance companies meeting specific criteria, including being incorporated in the District of Columbia, subject to supervision, maintaining an office with a minimum number of employees, and paying required taxes and fees. The District of Columbia imposes an additional tax on premiums for natural catastrophic risk coverage written through the fund, at a rate not exceeding the Federal excise tax on reinsurance contracts. A qualified contribution is defined as a contribution by a qualified insurance company of net premiums received for coverage of qualified losses during a taxable year. A qualified contribution is a contribution by a qualified insurance company of net premiums received for coverage of qualified losses during a taxable year. A qualified distribution includes payments for qualified losses, reinsurance, and excess balance drawdown amounts. The term 'qualified loss' refers to an insured loss on a United States risk caused by events like wind, earthquake, flood, tsunami, or tidal wave. Qualified losses can be covered by payments for reinsurance, excess balance drawdown amounts, administrative expenses, and claims investigation. The term 'qualified loss' refers to insured losses caused by various catastrophic events such as earthquake, flood, tsunami, volcanic eruption, fire, hail, snow, ice, pandemic, or other public health catastrophes. An insured loss satisfies the criteria if total losses exceed $1,000,000,000 on an industry-wide basis or if the President of the United States designates it as a catastrophe. The term 'excess balance drawdown amount' refers to the surplus fund balance at the end of the taxable year. It is triggered when catastrophic events lead to insured losses exceeding $1,000,000,000 industry-wide, or when declared as a disaster by the President or a state governor. The term 'excess balance drawdown amount' is defined as the surplus fund balance at the end of the taxable year, exceeding the total exposure to qualified losses under insurance contracts. 'United States risk' refers to hazards or liabilities in the US or its territories. Premiums and losses from Puerto Rican risks covered by a catastrophe reserve are excluded from calculations. The subsection excludes premiums and losses from Puerto Rican risks covered by a catastrophe reserve in determining qualified contributions. Contributions in kind to a fund are treated as a sale or exchange at fair market value. Distributions of property from a fund to a qualified insurance company are treated as a sale or exchange, with any gain or loss excluded from gross income. The Secretary will prescribe regulations.

The bill defines nonqualified distributions as any distribution from a natural disaster protection fund that is not a qualified distribution. The amendments made by this bill will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2011."
