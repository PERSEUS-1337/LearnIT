The Small Business Review Panel Technical Amendments Act of 1999 aims to enhance small businesses' participation in the federal regulatory process by clarifying and strengthening the Small Business Advocacy Review Panel process and expanding the number of federal agencies required to convene such panels. SEC. 3. ENSURING FULL ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON SMALL ENTITIES OF RULES PROPOSED BY CERTAIN AGENCIES. Section 609(b) of title 5, United States Code, is amended to require covered agencies to notify the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration before publishing an initial regulatory flexibility analysis. This notification includes providing information on the potential impacts of the proposed rule on small entities and identifying affected small entity representatives for advice and recommendations. The covered agency must convene a review panel for the draft proposed rule, consisting of federal employees, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, and the Chief Counsel. The panel will review agency materials, collect advice from small entity representatives, and address specific issues outlined in the regulatory flexibility analysis. The review panel convened by the covered agency must report to the agency head within 60 days, including comments from small entity representatives and findings on specific issues. The agency head must publish the panel's report in the Federal Register within 120 days or as part of the proposed rulemaking publication. The agency should make modifications to the draft rule as necessary. The covered agency must modify the draft proposed rule, initial regulatory flexibility analysis, or decision on whether an analysis is required within 120 days of receiving the report or as part of the proposed rulemaking. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. Amends Section 609(d) of title 5, United States Code to define 'covered agency' as EPA, OSHA, and IRS, and 'small entity representative' as an entity or individual representing a small entity. SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE. The Act will take effect 90 days after enactment."
