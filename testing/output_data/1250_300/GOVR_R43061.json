Congress funds programs to improve STEM skills, encourage students to pursue science and engineering degrees, and provide research experiences. The 115th Congress is considering legislation to promote STEM education and potential changes to immigration policies related to visas and green cards for the S&E workforce. Congress is considering legislation to promote STEM education and potential changes to immigration policies related to visas and green cards for the science and engineering workforce. Labor economists examine factors like employment growth, wage growth, and unemployment rates to determine evidence of labor shortages in the S&E workforce. The report provides employment, wage, and unemployment data for various S&E occupations in 2016. The section on \"Unemployment\" in the report provides statistical data on occupational employment, wages, and unemployment for the science and engineering (S&E) workforce in 2016. It also includes information on recent trends in employment, wages, and projections for 2016-2026. Stakeholder perspectives are offered in the concluding observations for Congress to consider in ensuring an adequate S&E workforce for the future. The definition of the science and engineering (S&E) workforce can vary depending on which occupations are included. The size of the S&E workforce ranges from 6 million to over 21 million, with estimates varying based on the definition used. The policy debate on the adequacy of the U.S. S&E workforce has focused on the computer industry.

Detailed occupations are provided in Appendix A and educational composition figures in Appendix B. The report relies on federal government data sources such as the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey for employment and wage data from 2012-2016. The survey covers part-time and full-time workers but excludes self-employed individuals and household workers. The wage statistic used is the occupational \"mean wage,\" calculated by averaging the wages of all employees in a given occupation. The report utilizes the occupational \"mean wage\" statistic, derived from the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) survey, which calculates the average wage by summing all employees' wages in a specific occupation. The Current Population Survey (CPS) is the source of unemployment data, while BLS's Employment Projections offer occupational and industry employment projections for 10-year periods. The OES survey provides data on occupational staffing patterns for most industries, while Current Employment Statistics (CES) data offer information on total wage and salary employment in nonfarm industries. The Employment Statistics data includes wage and salary employment in nonfarm industries, agricultural industry employment, and self-employed individuals. The Recent Trends section covers changes in employment, wages, and unemployment from 2012 to 2016. The Employment Projections section relies on the Bureau of Labor Statistics projections for 2016-2026. Various factors can impact the U.S. S&E workforce, such as economic conditions, technology development, funding for research, and workforce skills. The report discusses factors influencing the U.S. S&E workforce, including new technologies, funding for research, workforce skills, and changes in business practices. Challenges in using OES data for time series comparisons are also highlighted, such as changes in classification systems and data collection methods.

Challenges in using OES data for time series comparisons are highlighted, such as changes in classification systems and data collection methods. The OES survey used consistent occupational categories based on the 2010 Standard Occupational Classification from 2012-2016. The Bureau of Labor Statistics makes estimates for employment projections based on various factors like population size, labor force participation rates, economic growth, and technological innovation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) analyzes labor force participation rates of various demographic groups and factors like economic growth, technological innovation, and changes in business practices. BLS updated its methodology for estimating occupational separations in 2016-2026 projections due to issues with the previous method. Other factors affecting occupational projections include immigration laws, trade laws, regulatory regimes, and social patterns. The BLS evaluates the accuracy of its projections regularly and publishes these evaluations in its Monthly Labor Review.

Congress has been concerned about the adequacy of the science and engineering workforce for over 60 years and has implemented programs to support education and development in STEM fields. Congress has enacted programs to support scientists and engineers for over 60 years, focusing on improving STEM skills and increasing the number of students pursuing S&E degrees. There are diverse views on the adequacy of the S&E workforce, with debates on whether there is a shortage and if policy interventions are needed. There are differing views on the existence of a shortage of scientists and engineers in the workforce. Some argue that there is a shortage, which could lead to negative impacts on various sectors. Others believe that there is not a shortage based on data such as employment and wage growth. Regardless, there is a consensus that more scientists and engineers are needed, and federal policies have historically played a role in developing the workforce. Increasing the number of U.S. scientists and engineers is crucial for innovation, economic performance, and job creation. Even without a shortage, jobs in many fields require STEM knowledge. Government interventions to address shortages may lead to inefficiencies in the S&E labor market. Government efforts to increase the number of scientists and engineers through incentives or immigration quotas may lead to inefficiencies in the S&E labor market. Long-term projections for S&E occupations are unreliable due to various factors such as technological changes, labor market demographics, and government policies, resulting in potential shortages in certain industries or fields. Shortages in certain industries or fields, especially in new and emerging S&E fields, may exist due to factors like retirement behavior, availability of foreign labor, and government policies. Government interventions may be necessary to prevent adverse consequences such as loss of technological leadership and lower economic performance. Shortages in certain industries, especially in new and emerging S&E fields, may require government interventions to prevent adverse consequences like loss of technological leadership and lower economic performance. Industry assertions of shortages are driven by a desire to reduce costs and increase current knowledge, primarily through a skills mismatch rather than a shortage of people. Expanding immigration can help address the shortage by increasing the number of foreign scientists and engineers in the United States. Expanding immigration to increase foreign scientists and engineers in the United States can help address shortages in certain industries, but it may also depress wages, increase unemployment, and discourage American students from pursuing STEM careers. Federal efforts are needed to improve STEM education in the United States as American students lag behind their foreign counterparts in STEM knowledge. This disparity may lead to a shortage of talented scientists and engineers, lower economic growth, and reduced competitiveness. Standardized tests used to compare STEM knowledge do not accurately reflect the capabilities of U.S. students, highlighting the need for federal policies to strengthen K-12 STEM education. The federal government plays a role in fostering the development of the S&E workforce by considering various perspectives on increasing students pursuing S&E degrees, admitting foreign scientists and engineers, promoting diversity in science and engineering, improving K-12 STEM education, and enhancing career counseling for high school students. BLS provides data on the educational composition of S&E occupations to support U.S. competitiveness and leadership in science, engineering, technology, and industry. BLS publishes data on the educational composition of S&E occupations using ACS data. The charts illustrate the occupational composition based on educational levels, including a category for \"Less than an Associate's degree.\""
