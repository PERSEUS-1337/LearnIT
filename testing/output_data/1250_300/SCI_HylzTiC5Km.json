It addresses challenges in encoding vast context and preserving global coherence and detail exactness. SPN generates images as a sequence of slices, capturing spatial dependencies efficiently. Multidimensional upscaling is used to grow images in size and depth. SPNs achieve state-of-the-art likelihood results in generating CelebAHQ and ImageNet images. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) is used for unconditional generation of high-quality images like CelebAHQ and ImageNet. It achieves state-of-the-art likelihood results and sets new benchmarks in various settings. Autoregressive models have excelled in producing high-fidelity samples across different domains like text, audio, images, and videos. However, in large-scale image generation, AR models struggle to exhibit long-range structure and semantic coherence. The relationship between maximum likelihood estimation scores and sample fidelity poses challenges in achieving high-quality image generation. The MLE scores achieved by a model are related to the model's sample fidelity. MLE forces the model to support the entire empirical distribution, which can lead to irrelevant parts of the distribution being prioritized. Large images pose challenges due to high dimensionality, requiring significant memory and computation. Multidimensional upscaling techniques are used to map subimages to full-size images. Upscaling techniques are used to map subimages to full-size images, aiming for high fidelity in 8-bit RGB images up to 256 \u00d7 256 size. The model focuses on visually salient subsets of the distribution, using Multidimensional Upscaling to transition between different subsets by upscaling images in size or depth. The Multidimensional Upscaling technique is used to map visually salient subsets of the distribution in 8-bit RGB images. This involves upscaling images in size or depth, with three networks trained to generate different image resolutions. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) architecture is developed to address training difficulties in upscaling decoders. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) architecture divides an image into sub-images to address training difficulties in upscaling decoders. It consists of a conditioning network and a decoder that predicts target slices based on context embedding. SPN acts as an independent image decoder with an implicit size upscaling mechanism and can also be used for explicit size upscaling. The performance of SPN is extensively evaluated on image generation benchmarks. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) architecture is evaluated for performance on image generation benchmarks, including CelebAHQ-256 and ImageNet. Results show state-of-the-art MLE scores on CelebAHQ-256 and ImageNet-64, as well as successful samples on unconditional ImageNet-128. The SPN and multidimensional upscaling methods demonstrate strong benefits in sample fidelity compared to other methods like GANs. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) architecture shows impressive results on image generation benchmarks like CelebAHQ-256 and ImageNet. Successful samples on unconditional ImageNet-128 highlight the impact of SPN and multidimensional upscaling on sample quality, setting a fidelity baseline for future methods. The architecture uses an alternative ordering to encode long-range dependencies and induce spatial structure in large images. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) architecture enables compact encoding of long-range dependencies in large images, inducing spatial structure and implicit upscaling effects. It allows for consistent application of the same decoder to all slices and facilitates the use of self-attention. The subscale ordering defines interleaved slices in the original image based on a scaling factor, with each slice specified by its row and column offset. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) architecture enables compact encoding of long-range dependencies in large images by defining interleaved slices based on a scaling factor. These slices are specified by row and column offsets, referred to as \"meta-positions.\" The SPN allows for consistent application of the same decoder to all slices and can be used for implicit upscaling effects. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) architecture enables compact encoding of long-range dependencies in large images by defining interleaved slices based on a scaling factor. The SPN can act as an image model and size upscaling model simultaneously. Multidimensional upscaling includes upscaling in height, width, and channel depth in stages. The depth upscaling process involves generating bits of an image in sequential stages based on the conventional ordering. Depth upscaling involves generating bits of an image in sequential stages based on conventional ordering. Weight sharing is not done among networks at different stages. The goal is to focus on visually salient bits of an image, unaffected by less salient and predictable bits. Depth upscaling is related to the method underlying Grayscale PixelCNN for modeling 4-bit greyscale images. Existing AR approaches require superlinear computation and memory, with self-attention's quadratic memory requirements becoming limiting for images larger than 32 \u00d7 32. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) addresses challenges in AR by reducing memory and computational requirements for encoding dependencies in large images. It introduces a scaling factor to obtain slices of the original image, preserving global context while mitigating the limitations of existing approaches. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) reduces memory and computational requirements by using a scaling factor to obtain slices of the original image. The SPN architecture consists of an embedding part for slices at preceding metapositions that conditions the decoder for the current slice being generated. The slices are ordered along the channel dimension when concatenated using empty padding slices to preserve relative meta-positions. The slices in the embedding architecture are ordered along the depth dimension using empty padding slices to maintain meta-positions. The embedding part receives input of meta-position and pixel intensity values, passing through self-attention layers. The decoder processes the encoded slice tensor in a position-preserving manner, incorporating information from preceding slices. The decoder in the embedding architecture processes the encoded slice tensor in a position-preserving manner, using a hybrid architecture of masked convolution and self-attention. Initial 1D self-attention network gathers context in the slice, followed by masked 1D self-attention layers. The output is reshaped and concatenated with the slice embedding network for conditioning input to a Gated PixelCNN, reducing memory requirements significantly. The Gated PixelCNN network models the target slice with full masking over pixels and channel dimensions, significantly reducing memory requirements. The log-likelihood is decomposed as a sum over slices, with maximum likelihood learning done through stochastic gradient descent. The SPN serves as a size-upscaling network and is initialized with externally generated subimages. The SPN serves as a size-upscaling network by upscaling the depth of image channels.
