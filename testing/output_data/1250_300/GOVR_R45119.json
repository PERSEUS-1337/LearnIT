    "content": "In October 2017, the U.S. EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan (CPP), a rule finalized in 2015 to limit CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants. The CPP has faced legal challenges and has not been implemented. Stakeholders have debated the rule's legal basis, design, and cost-benefit analysis. The CPP set national CO2 emission rates for power plants and allowed states to choose compliance through rate-based or mass-based approaches. States could comply with the Clean Power Plan (CPP) through rate-based or mass-based approaches, providing flexibility to achieve emissions goals. EPA projected a 32% reduction in power sector CO2 emissions by 2030. The proposed repeal of the CPP signifies a shift in the agency's interpretation of its authority under the Clean Air Act. The EPA's proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) represents a significant departure from the previous Administration's stance on environmental policy. The repeal is based on the agency's revised interpretation of its authority under the Clean Air Act, specifically Section 111(d). The current Administration believes that the CPP exceeds legal authority by setting CO2 emission goals that can only be achieved using measures outside the scope of power plants. The benefit-cost analysis of the repeal is considered economically significant, revealing methodological changes from the 2015 analysis. The benefit-cost analysis of the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan by the EPA reveals methodological changes from the 2015 analysis. Members of Congress are interested in understanding these changes, as they may influence how EPA estimates benefits and costs of other regulations. A group of Senators has requested more information about the analysis, which could set a precedent for how federal agencies account for climate and human health benefits in future regulations. The EPA conducted an analysis of the Clean Power Plan's impacts for its proposed repeal, comparing the economic analysis of the 2017 repeal with the 2015 final rule. The report highlights changes in the 2017 analysis, including climate benefits estimation, human health co-benefits consideration, and energy savings impact accounting. For more details on the rationale and legal aspects of the proposed repeal, refer to CRS reports. EPA prepares benefit-cost analyses for significant regulatory actions, such as the Clean Power Plan, in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and OMB Circular A-4. E.O. 12866 directs federal agencies to examine the benefits and costs of significant regulatory actions to ensure that the benefits justify the costs. Regulatory actions meeting specific conditions require a detailed economic analysis. OMB Circular A-4 outlines the principles for a good regulatory analysis, including stating the need for the action, analyzing alternatives, and assessing benefits and costs. This aims to standardize the measurement and reporting of economically significant regulatory actions. The OMB Circular A-4 outlines principles for regulatory analysis, including the need for action, analyzing alternatives, and assessing benefits and costs. It aims to standardize measurement and reporting of economically significant regulatory actions, emphasizing that benefits should justify costs, even if not monetarily. EPA determined the CPP in 2015 was economically significant. When the EPA promulgated the CPP in 2015, it prepared a regulatory analysis in accordance with E.O. 12866, OMB Circular A-4, and the agency's Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analyses. The EPA calculated state-specific emission rate goals for the rate-based scenario and state-specific emission goals for the mass-based scenario, emphasizing that states could implement the CPP in various ways. The analysis represented EPA's best assessment of likely impacts under different state approaches, estimating emission reductions and compliance costs using the Integrated Planning Model (IPM). EPA estimated emission reductions and compliance costs under the CPP using the Integrated Planning Model (IPM). Compliance costs included capital investment changes, operating pollution controls, fuel shifts, and monitoring expenses. The CPP was expected to reduce CO2 and non-GHG emissions, with the social cost of carbon used to estimate climate benefits. The EPA used the IPM model to estimate reductions in CO2 emissions under the CPP and applied the social cost of carbon to determine the economic value of climate benefits. They also calculated human health benefits from reductions in non-GHG emissions like SO2 and NOx, monetizing the benefits of reduced exposure to PM and ozone. The EPA calculated the average dollar value of human health benefits associated with reducing pollutants like PM and ozone in different regions. Most of the health co-benefits estimates came from reductions in premature deaths related to PM exposure, with SO2 emission reductions contributing significantly. Ozone health effects accounted for a smaller share of the health co-benefits. Health co-benefits from reducing SO2, a precursor to PM, made up 80-85% of estimated dollar value in 2030 scenarios. Ozone health effects accounted for 6-12% of health co-benefits. EPA, under the Trump Administration, proposed to repeal the CPP two years after its finalization under Obama. Clean Air Act Section 307(d) mandates EPA to follow the same rulemaking process for promulgating, revising, or repealing rules. The proposed repeal was based on a legal interpretation change of Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, leading EPA to revisit the 2015 CPP regulatory analysis. The EPA revisited the 2015 CPP regulatory analysis to prepare for the proposed repeal, which was considered an economically significant regulatory action. The benefits of repealing a rule are the avoided compliance costs, while the costs are the forgone reductions in emissions and associated climate and health co-benefits. EPA did not conduct new power sector modeling for the 2017 analysis but used existing projections to estimate the impacts of the repeal. The EPA used existing power sector projections to estimate the benefits and costs of repealing the CPP. They plan to conduct updated modeling using IPM for public comment before finalizing the repeal. The estimates were based on 2015 power sector modeling and more recent projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook 2017. The EPA used recent power sector projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook 2017 to estimate compliance costs and emissions reductions under the CPP. They changed the accounting treatment of energy efficiency savings, counting them as a positive benefit in the 2017 analysis. The 2017 analysis showed less favorable benefit-cost comparisons of the CPP compared to the 2015 analysis. The 2017 analysis of the CPP showed varying benefit-cost comparisons compared to the 2015 analysis. Net impact estimates ranged from costs outweighing benefits to benefits outweighing costs, with estimates for 2030 ranging from $28.3 billion in net costs to $14 billion in net benefits of the proposed repeal. The agency did not explicitly state whether the benefits of the repeal are likely to outweigh the costs. Table 1 presents the highest and lowest net impacts reported for each analysis year in the 2015 and 2017 analyses. The benefit-cost estimates for the proposed repeal of the CPP in 2017 showed a range of net costs and net benefits under different assumptions. Half of the comparisons showed net benefits, while the other half showed net costs. The estimates for 2030 ranged from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits. The impact of updated power sector projections on the benefit-cost estimates is uncertain, as changes in the power sector have not been fully reflected in the modeling. The EPA noted that benefit-cost estimates for the proposed repeal of the CPP in 2017 did not reflect recent changes in the power sector, such as shifts to lower-emitting sources. The AEO 2017 projections suggested potentially lower CO2 emission reductions and compliance costs under the CPP compared to 2015 estimates. EPA plans to update its power sector modeling before finalizing the repeal, with AEO 2017 scenarios showing greater SO2 reductions and higher human health co-benefits. The AEO 2017 projections showed higher human health co-benefits and greater reduction in coal emissions under the CPP compared to EPA's 2015 estimates. EPA revised its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs by changing estimates of the SCC, excluding international impacts, discounting future CO2 reduction benefits, and counting energy efficiency savings as benefits. The EPA revised its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs by changing estimates of the SCC, discounting future CO2 reduction benefits, and counting energy efficiency savings as benefits. This accounted for differences in conclusions between the 2015 and 2017 analyses. EPA and federal agencies use the SCC to value climate benefits of CO2 reductions, translating changes in emissions into economic impacts. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) values are used to estimate the monetary value of climate benefits associated with CO2 emissions reductions. In 2015, the EPA used SCC values developed by an interagency working group, ranging from $17 to $160 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030. However, in 2017, the Trump Administration withdrew these estimates and disbanded the working group as part of an executive order directing federal agencies to review energy development requirements. In 2017, the Trump Administration withdrew the IWG's SCC estimates and disbanded the IWG as part of E.O. 13783, directing agencies to use discount rates of 3% and 7%. EPA developed new SCC values based on this directive, using the same models as the IWG but focusing on domestic benefits and costs. EPA calculated domestic SCC using two of the three models. The EPA developed new domestic SCC estimates using models similar to the IWG, adjusting global values to domestic values based on a peer-reviewed paper. The interim domestic SCC estimates are $7 and $1 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 at discount rates of 3% and 7%. The United States emits CO2 and other GHGs globally, impacting climate and economies. Stakeholders have debated the use of global versus domestic SCC estimates by federal agencies. The EPA developed new domestic SCC estimates based on global values, recommending their use due to the interconnected global economy and potential spillover effects on national security, trade, and public health. Stakeholders have debated whether federal agencies should use domestic or global SCC values, with some arguing that a domestic SCC would understate benefits to the United States. Some stakeholders recommend using global social cost of carbon (SCC) values over domestic ones, arguing that climate impacts extend beyond U.S. borders and have global implications. However, others advocate for using domestic SCC estimates, citing OMB Circular A-4 guidance to focus on domestic benefits and costs. Critics argue that using global SCC values may overstate the benefits of country-specific regulations by comparing global benefits to domestic costs. Stakeholders criticized the comparison of impacts measured on different scales, stating that using a global SCC overstates the benefits of a country-specific rulemaking. EPA focused on domestic SCC estimates in the 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal, but did present global estimates in a sensitivity analysis. Experts acknowledge challenges in developing accurate estimates of the domestic SCC. Experts and the National Academies of Sciences acknowledge challenges in accurately estimating the social cost of carbon (SCC), particularly in capturing relevant regional interactions. OMB Circular A-4 discusses discount rate selection for benefit-cost analysis based on scenarios affecting consumer spending or private capital. The social cost of carbon (SCC) calculation involves discounting future impacts to the year of CO2 emission using a 3% consumption rate and a 7% opportunity cost of capital rate. This allows for economic impact comparisons over different time periods and is standard practice in benefit-cost analysis. Discounting future impacts to the year of CO2 emission is crucial for economic impact comparisons over different time periods. The selection of a discount rate for the social cost of carbon (SCC) calculation is challenging due to the intergenerational aspect of climate change. Higher discount rates result in lower present values, while lower discount rates result in higher present values, and SCC estimates are highly sensitive to discount rate selection. In an intergenerational context, higher discount rates lead to lower present values, while lower discount rates result in higher present values. SCC estimates are highly sensitive to discount rate selection. OMB Circular A-4 recommends considering sensitivity analysis with lower discount rates, suggesting rates of 1% to 3% in the 1990s. The Council of Economic Advisers under the Obama Administration proposed reducing the 3% rate to at most 2% and lowering the 7% rate. Stakeholders have differing views on discount rate selection for the SCC, with environmental and public interest groups emphasizing intergenerational considerations. Stakeholders have divergent views on discount rate selection for the SCC. Environmental and public interest groups recommend lower rates, while industry groups prefer higher rates like 7%. The majority of climate change impact studies use rates of no more than 5%. The IWG concluded that the SCC discount rate should reflect the consumption rate, not the opportunity cost of capital, and discounted at rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 5%. EPA agreed with these rates in the 2015 CPP analysis. The IWG discounted the SCC at rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 5%, which EPA agreed with in the 2015 analysis. Academics recommend different ways to calculate discount rates, with the NAS suggesting a new approach to better capture uncertainty over long periods of time. EPA estimated lower climate benefits of the proposed repeal using interim SCC estimates, valuing the same CO2 emissions tonnage in both 2015 and 2017 analyses. EPA estimated lower climate benefits of the proposed repeal using interim SCC estimates, valuing the same CO2 emissions tonnage in both 2015 and 2017 analyses. The domestic perspective and use of a 7% rate lowered the SCC estimates, reducing the estimates of climate benefits under the CPP. EPA acknowledged limitations of the interim SCC estimates and conducted a sensitivity analysis with global values and an alternative discount rate. EPA's 2017 analysis also excluded forgone human health co-benefits from some calculations. The EPA's 2017 analysis diverged from the 2015 analysis by excluding forgone human health co-benefits from some benefit-cost comparisons. Different comparisons either counted all estimated health co-benefits, excluded them entirely, or used a threshold to reduce them. This approach was seen as inconsistent with OMB's Circular A-4 guidance. EPA focused on benefits from reductions in the target pollutant, CO2, to assess cost-effectiveness of regulatory designs. EPA's 2017 analysis excluded human health co-benefits from some benefit-cost comparisons, focusing on benefits from reductions in the target pollutant, CO2, to assess cost-effectiveness of regulatory designs. Stakeholders raised concerns about the inclusion of co-benefits in previous analyses, questioning potential double counting of benefits. EPA requested public comment on the reliance on benefits relative to costs in decision-making processes. Some stakeholders questioned if EPA double counted PM benefits in the CPP analysis. OMB Circular A-4 and EPA guidelines recommend considering co-benefits in benefit-cost analysis. OMB reports note that EPA often monetizes co-benefits in Clean Air Act analyses. The OMB's recent reports to Congress on federal regulations highlighted that EPA's Clean Air Act analyses monetize co-benefits, mainly from reducing public exposure to fine particulate matter. EPA applied a threshold to forgone health co-benefits in benefit-cost comparisons, counting only those exceeding a defined threshold for ambient PM levels. This approach diverged from past practices by using a threshold to calculate PM mortality impacts. The EPA used thresholds to calculate PM mortality impacts in benefit-cost comparisons, based on federal air quality standards and the \"lowest measured level\" from long-term studies. The thresholds affected co-benefit estimates and the benefit-cost comparisons of the proposed repeal. The EPA used PM air quality standard and LML thresholds to assess mortality impacts in benefit-cost comparisons for the proposed repeal. The thresholds influenced co-benefit estimates and the overall favorability of the repeal based on different discount rates. EPA aimed to enhance transparency and address uncertainty in estimating PM-related health risks below the federal standard. EPA acknowledged uncertainty in PM-related mortality benefits, citing studies that support a no-threshold model for PM-mortality concentration-response relationship. The agency's 2015 analysis recognized lower confidence in benefits at lower PM concentrations but did not apply a threshold, stating that federal air quality standards are not risk-free. EPA's 2017 analysis focused on estimating and reporting PM impacts, intending to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the benefit-per-ton approach. They plan to conduct detailed air quality modeling to better understand the health impacts of changes in pollutants like PM. Additionally, EPA changed the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings in their 2017 analysis. EPA changed the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings in their 2017 analysis, moving the energy savings from the cost side to the benefits side. This resulted in increased estimated costs and benefits by the same amount, without changing the overall difference between benefits and costs. In the analysis of the proposed repeal, EPA removed energy savings from the total cost estimate and added them to the estimated benefits, resulting in larger cost and benefits estimates. In the 2017 analysis, EPA changed the accounting treatment by moving energy savings from costs to benefits, increasing both estimates without altering the overall difference. This change became significant in the cost analysis conducted under E.O. 13771, where EPA reported cost savings but omitted forgone benefits. EPA calculated the present value of avoided compliance costs for 2020-2033. The EPA's analysis under E.O. 13771 reported cost savings of a proposed repeal but omitted the forgone benefits. The agency calculated the present value of avoided compliance costs for 2020-2033, excluding demand-side energy efficiency savings. Benefit-cost analysis is crucial for informing policy decisions by evaluating the potential effects of regulatory options. Monetized benefits exceeding costs do not solely determine regulatory decisions, as qualitative impacts also play a role in justifying costs. The EPA's benefit-cost comparisons do not solely determine regulatory decisions. Qualitative impacts, legal considerations, technical feasibility, and ethical factors also play a role in decision-making. Quantifying and monetizing the benefits and costs of regulations can be complex, drawing upon scientific data and involving policy-based decisions. Changes in policy priorities and technical information can influence regulatory proposals. EPA's analyses of the 2015 CPP and the 2017 proposed repeal show how changes in policy priorities and technical information can impact benefit-cost estimates. The 2017 analysis reached different conclusions due to new SCC estimates and thresholds affecting climate and human health benefits. Congress has varying views on EPA regulatory policy, especially regarding GHG-related regulations. Regulatory decisions like the CPP repeal can have significant effects on industries and the health of U.S. citizens. The report discusses how changes in policy priorities between the Trump and Obama Administrations influenced EPA's assessment of the benefits and costs of the CPP. The use of interim SCC estimates in the 2017 analysis, which differed from the IWG SCC estimates, led to a reduction in estimated CPP climate benefits. Congress may need to consider the implications of withdrawing the IWG SCC estimates on regulatory analysis of GHG impacts. Congress may also consider the implications of withdrawing the IWG SCC estimates on regulatory analysis of GHG impacts, including potential differences across federal agencies in their decisions on GHG-related regulations. EPA's 2017 analysis provided limited details on next steps for the SCC and did not specify a timeline for updates. It remains unclear if other agencies will use the same interim estimates in their regulatory analyses. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has followed a similar approach as the EPA, while the Department of Energy used IWG SCC estimates in a rulemaking after they were withdrawn. Congress may consider EPA's changes to health co-benefits analysis as a precedent for future air pollution rulemakings. The 2017 EPA analysis on human health co-benefits reflected different policy determinations compared to the 2015 analysis, with a focus on PM mortality impacts. The 2017 analysis on PM mortality impacts departed from the 2015 analysis by using a threshold to calculate concentrations and excluding health co-benefits from benefit-cost comparisons."
