TERRITORIAL AND FREELY ASSOCIATED STATE INFRASTRUCTURE ASSISTANCE.\" \"Amendment to Public Law 94-241 limits payments to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to amounts specified in a 1992 agreement, subject to all its requirements. Additional amounts can be used by the Secretary for specific obligations.\" The Agreement limits payments to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands as specified in a 1992 agreement. Additional amounts are allocated for capital infrastructure projects in various territories, with specific allocations for different fiscal years. In subsequent years, up to $3 million can be allocated for immigration, labor, and law enforcement issues in the Northern Mariana Islands. Projects will be outlined in a five-year infrastructure plan developed by the Secretary of the Interior in consultation with the island governments and submitted to Congress annually. The plan will prioritize projects, consider master plans, and review recommendations from the Corps of Engineers. The highest priority projects will be identified based on various factors such as master plans, Corps of Engineers' recommendations, maintenance set-asides, local cost-share requirements, and the possibility of an emergency fund of up to $2 million per year for disaster assistance. Additionally, within the infrastructure allocation, additional contributions can be made as outlined in the plan. Within the infrastructure allocation, additional contributions may be made to assist in the resettlement of Rongelap Atoll, not exceeding $32 million from any Federal source after January 1, 1995. Funds must be used solely for resettlement activities and properly audited. Federal agencies in the Republic of the Marshall Islands can provide funds through the Secretary of the Interior for this purpose. The Marshall Islands can provide funds for resettlement of Rongelap through the Secretary of the Interior, not limiting ex gratia assistance. Assistance for individuals not resettling at Rongelap can only be provided after full resettlement funds are secured. SEC. 2. FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE. Effective thirty days after enactment, the minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act will apply to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, starting at $2.75 per hour and increasing annually. The minimum wage rate in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands will be the lesser of $2.75 per hour or the rate set in section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Once the minimum wage equals the rate in section 6(a)(1), that rate will apply thereafter. The report is required as per Section 3. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with other government officials, must report to Congress by March 15 each fiscal year on funds allocated for immigration, labor, and law enforcement activities. The report includes immigration data, treatment of non-US citizen workers, and the impact of CNMI laws on Federal interests. The Secretary of the Interior must report to Congress on various issues including foreign government interference with workers' rights, the impact of CNMI laws on Federal interests, detention facility adequacy, alien identification system reliability, and reasons for ineffective enforcement of Federal laws in the Northern Mariana Islands. SEC. 4. IMMIGRATION COOPERATION. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the Immigration and Naturalization Service will work together to identify and potentially exclude or deport individuals posing security or law enforcement risks to the Commonwealth or the United States. SEC. 5. CLARIFICATION OF LOCAL EMPLOYMENT IN THE MARIANAS. Section 8103(i) of title 46 of the United States Code is amended to allow aliens in the CNMI to work as unlicensed seamen on fishing vessels within US waters. The amendment also updates references to subsection paragraphs. SEC. 6 amends Public Law 93-435 to clarify ownership of submerged lands in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. References to the date of enactment in the law now refer to the date of enactment of this section. SEC. 7 requires an annual State of the Islands report. The Secretary of the Interior must provide an annual \"State of the Islands\" report to Congress on various territories, including economic development, federal assistance, local finances, infrastructure, and administrative capabilities. Additionally, a technical correction was made to amend a section of Public Law 95-134 regarding Pacific Islands territories. The Secretary of the Interior must provide an annual \"State of the Islands\" report to Congress on various territories, including economic development, federal assistance, local finances, infrastructure, and administrative capabilities.
