    "content": "The Department of Defense (DOD) fuel consumption fluctuates annually based on mission needs. DOD may use up to 1% of US refined petroleum products, with foreign purchases potentially doubling consumption. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) procures fuel for all DOD services and agencies, both in the US and overseas. DESC's origins trace back to World War II, evolving into the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and later the Defense Energy Support Center in 1998 with an expanded energy management mission. In 1964, the Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) was established to manage DOD's petroleum products and coal purchases. In 1998, DESC's mission expanded to include managing a variety of energy products. DESC awards fuel contracts based on cost and manages bulk petroleum products, bunker fuel, refueling at airports, and post-camp-and-station fuel. DOD primarily consumes JP-8, JP-5, and diesel fuel. This report analyzes DOD's fuel purchases from FY2000 to FY2008, comparing spending to overall DOD expenses, fuel prices to commercial rates, and quantities purchased to U.S. refined petroleum production. The report compares DOD's fuel purchases to U.S. refined petroleum production, discusses refining and refineries supplying DOD's jet fuel, and recent legislation promoting alternative fuels. Legislation now focuses on not exacerbating global warming with new fuel sources. Legislation now prohibits federal agencies from funding new fuel sources that worsen global warming. Proposed rules on greenhouse gas reporting may have minimal impact on refineries. New legislation to cap greenhouse gas emissions could affect refinery operations and responsiveness to DOD's fuel needs. DESC's bulk fuel purchases mainly consist of JP-8 jet fuel, with the Air Force and Army as primary consumers. DESC's total fuel purchases peaked in FY2003 during the Iraq invasion, with JP-8 purchases peaking in FY2004 and declining since then. DESC's fuel purchases peaked at 145.1 million barrels in FY2003 during the Iraq invasion. JP-8 purchases peaked in FY2004 and have been declining since. Overall DESC fuel expenditures grew from $3.6 billion in FY2000 to nearly $18 billion in FY2008, a 500% increase. Actual volumes purchased only increased by 30% over the same time period. Fuel costs and average prices continued to rise due to increasing crude oil prices and refining margins. The cost of petroleum products purchased rose significantly from FY2000 to FY2008, driven by increasing crude oil prices and refining margins. Jet fuel prices reversed their price advantage over commercial aviation fuel, leading to increased purchases of alternate jet fuels. The margin between refiners' crude oil cost and refined product prices also increased during this period. From FY2000 to FY2008, defense outlays increased by 200%, with Operation and Maintenance spending rising by 231%. Fuel costs surged by 497%, reaching 3% of DOD's spending by FY2008. The U.S. saw a shift in jet fuel prices, leading to increased purchases of alternate jet fuels and diesel fuel. Fuel costs increased by 497% from FY2000 to FY2008, reaching 3% of DOD's spending. The U.S. relies on various countries for crude oil supply, with a shift towards heavier sour crudes due to diminishing sweet crude supply. Refineries produce gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel fuel from crude oil in atmospheric distillation towers. Refineries process crude oil into gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel fuel in atmospheric distillation towers. The term \"straight-run\" refers to the initial refining process, with residuum processed further using heat, pressure, hydrogen, and catalysts. Refineries may produce different grades of fuel depending on the crude oil used, with light sweet crude being preferred for gasoline refining. Topping refineries separate crude oil into petroleum products through distillation. Specifications for jet fuel are more stringent, especially for military grade. Hydrocarbons make refining easier, with heavier crude oils requiring more complex processing. Refineries can be set up as topping, hydroskimming, cracking, or coking refineries based on the type of crude oil processed. The atmospheric distillation capacity of a refinery determines its crude oil processing limit, with secondary processing units like catalytic cracking and coking increasing output volume. The Nelson Complexity Index rates the proportion of secondary processes to primary distillation capacity in refineries. Refineries may upgrade processes to handle heavier crude oils, while the EPA works to reduce sulfur emissions. Gulf Coast refineries with higher complexity can yield significant amounts of jet fuel and diesel. The EPA is reducing sulfur content in diesel fuel to 15 ppm by 2010, creating \"ultra-low sulfur diesel.\" Refineries must adjust processes to handle heavier crude oils and limit sulfur picked up during pipeline transit. DOD aims for a \"single battlefield fuel\" concept for aircraft and ground equipment. The DOD has adopted the \"single battlefield fuel\" concept, using JP-8 for land-based equipment to minimize the fuel supply chain length. The Army relies on regionally supplied diesel fuel or JP-8, which may have elevated sulfur levels. The ASTM standard for JP-8 limits sulfur content to 3,000 ppm, with most kerosene at 400 ppm. EPA guidelines recognize the need for tactical vehicles to operate on fuel with higher sulfur levels. The EPA guidelines acknowledge the use of JP-8 or JP-5 fuel for tactical vehicles in the US. The EPA has not indicated plans to reduce the sulfur content of jet fuel. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA can regulate CO2 emissions from vehicles. The EPA proposed a rule for mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from petroleum refineries. The EPA proposed a Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) rule for petroleum refineries to report emissions, representing 3% of U.S. GHG emissions. Compliance costs could be minimal, but the rule sets the stage for future regulations capping emissions. Legislation like H.R. 2454 aims to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce emissions, including from refineries. H.R. 2454 aims to reduce emissions by reducing the cap on emissions permits over time. Currently, there are 142 refineries in the United States, with top suppliers including Shell, Valero, ExxonMobil, and BP. These companies operate 31 refineries with a total crude capacity of nearly 6 million barrels per day. Between 2000 and 2009, the number of refineries in the United States decreased from 155 to 141, but the crude oil distillation capacity increased to 18.6 million barrels per day. The majority of refineries have the capacity to refine medium sour crude, with Gulf Coast refineries producing up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel fuel. U.S. refineries produce ten times more commercial jet fuel than military specification jet fuel annually. Between 2000 and 2009, the number of U.S. refineries decreased, but crude oil distillation capacity increased. Gulf Coast refineries produce 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel. U.S. refineries make ten times more commercial jet fuel than military specification jet fuel annually. DESC's jet fuel purchases exceed U.S. refining industry output. U.S. refineries do not meet all DOD's demand for military jet fuel, leading DESC to buy commercial jet fuel and upgrade it. This strategy has reduced DESC's fuel spending. Lack of U.S. refining capacity does not compromise DOD's fuel supply. DESC purchases commercial jet fuel and upgrades it to military specification, reducing spending on fuel. The lack of U.S. refining capacity does not compromise DOD's fuel supply, as closer refineries supply the fuel. DESC also makes purchases through contracts with foreign refineries to support U.S. forces outside the continental United States. Originally granted to the Navy, DOD's authority to procure fuel allows for the purchase of fuel best suited for its purpose. DESC relies on the general procurement authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304 to purchase fuel in a one-step process under the Defense Working Capital Fund. This allows for price breaks for large quantity purchases and provides stabilized prices for DOD customers. The term \"acquisition\" refers to acquiring property or services that support agency missions, while \"procurement\" encompasses all purchasing activities. The term \"acquisition\" under Title 41 U.S.C. Section 403 refers to acquiring property or services with appropriated funds to support agency missions. Procurement includes all stages of acquiring property or services, governed by Title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 137. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in Title 48 CFR outlines federal agency acquisition regulations, while the Defense Acquisition Regulation System (DFARS) in 48 CFR Parts 201-299 is used by DOD. DESC typically awards one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct delivery fuel contracts using fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustments. DESC has awarded one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct delivery fuel contracts using fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustments. They use economic price adjustment provisions in contracts for refined petroleum products when future costs are unpredictable. DESC has adopted contracting instructions for multi-year contracts for bulk petroleum, ships' bunker, into-plane, and post-camp-and-station services. DOD and military departments are authorized to enter initial five-year contracts for storage, handling, or distribution of liquid fuels or natural gas under 10 U.S.C \u00a72922. The DOD and military departments are authorized to enter initial five-year contracts for storage, handling, or distribution of liquid fuels or natural gas under 10 U.S.C \u00a72922. These contracts may contain options for up to three five-year renewals, but not for more than a total of twenty years. Multiyear contracts buy more than one year's requirement without establishing an option for each program year after the first, while multiple year contracts have a term of more than one year regardless of fiscal year funding. Multiyear contracts for supplies in the DOD can be entered into to meet more than one year's requirement without needing an option for each program year after the first. These contracts aim to promote national security and result in cost savings. If Congress does not allocate funds for succeeding years, the contract must be canceled. Multiyear contracting is encouraged to take advantage of lower costs and other objectives. Multiyear contracts for supplies in the DOD can be entered into to meet more than one year's requirement without needing an option for each program year after the first. These contracts aim to promote national security and result in cost savings. The contract cannot exceed $500 million until the Secretary of Defense identifies it in a report to Congress. DOD is authorized to procure fuel derived from coal, oil shale, and tar sands under certain conditions, including multi-year contracts. The Secretary of Defense has waiver authority over acquisition of alternative fuels based on market conditions. The Secretary of Defense has broad waiver authority over the acquisition of alternative fuels, including petroleum, natural gas, coal, and coke. This authority allows for the waiver of contract formation, terms, and conditions, as well as performance regulations. The waiver can also extend to the five-year limit on multi-year contracts, although it is unclear if this authority will be exercised due to potential disagreement from DOD or Congress. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) bases contract delivery prices on the \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government. DESC bases contract delivery prices on the \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government, including a surcharge for operating costs. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 now requires analyses to consider fuel logistics in acquisition processes, factoring in hidden costs like air-to-air refueling or ground transport. This ensures new military capabilities account for the fully burdened cost of fuel. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 requires fuel logistics to be considered in acquisition processes for new military capabilities, taking into account the fully burdened cost of fuel. The Act also appoints a director responsible for overseeing energy requirements for military operations. DOD experienced a 500% increase in fuel costs over the past decade, impacting funding for training and operations. Fuel costs have represented a significant portion of DOD's spending, with concerns over declining worldwide crude oil production contributing to rising costs. In the past decade, fuel costs have represented a significant portion of DOD's spending, impacting funding for training and operations. Unlike the airline industry, DOD's only recourse for increased costs has been to request supplemental appropriations. DOD has explored options like fuel hedging, multi-year contracting, and using alternate fuels to limit vulnerability to price swings and supply shortages. Increasing purchases of commercial Jet A fuel have reduced costs and expanded supplies. DESC's business model provides flexibility to meet changing operational requirements. DESC's business model includes fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment clauses to take advantage of fuel price swings. They use hedging strategies to minimize the risk of future jet fuel price increases. Southwest Airlines used futures contracts to lock in prices when crude oil prices peaked in 2008. Southwest Airlines utilized hedging strategies by buying futures contracts to lock in fuel prices during the peak of crude oil prices in 2008. The Defense Business Board also explored fuel hedging options to reduce DOD's exposure to price volatility, suggesting the use of \"no-market\" hedging through the Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Service. This approach involved using lease revenues from additional Interior Department oil to offset increasing DOD fuel costs, with the possibility of transferring funds between Interior and Defense based on price changes. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is seeking legislative authority to transfer funds between the Interior and Defense departments based on unanticipated price changes. The Interior Department generates revenue from Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases, with royalties-in-kind paid by OCS lessees in the form of oil delivered to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The SPR was created in response to the 1970s Arab oil embargo to prevent supply disruptions, holding roughly 70 days of imported supply when filled to capacity. Drawdowns from the SPR can involve sales to the highest bidder or exchanges. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush's drawdown authorization during the Persian Gulf War led to a rapid decline in crude oil prices. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in 2006 that 40% of crude oil refined in U.S. refineries was used. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in 2006 that 40% of crude oil refined in U.S. refineries was heavier than that stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Refineries processing heavy oil cannot operate at normal capacity with lighter oils, affecting 36 vulnerable refineries. If these refineries had to use SPR oil, U.S. refining throughput could decrease by 735,000 barrels per day. The SPR's effectiveness during an oil disruption, especially with heavy oil, would be significantly reduced. The SPR does not have a defined role in mitigating a Department of Defense (DOD) fuel supply disruption. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies from procuring alternative fuels without ensuring they have lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional petroleum sources. This provision was a response to proposals for coal-to-liquid fuels, which the Air Force has since abandoned. The Air Force has abandoned plans for a coal-to-liquid fuel plant at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) is interested in a pilot program for synthetic fuels in Alaska to meet DOD JP-8 fuel requirements. Despite declining crude oil prices, future supply shortages and price spikes are possible. The Department of Defense (DOD) is focusing on efficiency due to policy and economic constraints on fossil-based alternatives. DOD may need to report fully burdened fuel costs to Congress. Refinery operators may prioritize commercial demands over DOD procurement during high petroleum prices. Refinery operators may prioritize commercial demands over DOD procurement during high petroleum prices. Concerns arise about potential refinery shutdowns impacting defense fuel suppliers. Background information on alternative fuel sources and greenhouse gas legislation is available in CRS reports. Avgas is used in light aircraft, while Crude Oil Classification DFM is used in shipboard propulsion plants. Jet A-1 (JA1) is a civilian-aviation kerosene-based turbine fuel adopted by international commercial aviation. Its ASTM specification is D16555 (Jet A-1), and identified by NATO as a high octane fuel used in light aircraft powered by reciprocating spark-ignition engines. DF2 (No. 2 diesel fuel) is the primary fuel for ground mobility vehicles, while FOB (free on board) is a trade term requiring the seller to deliver goods on board a vessel designated by the buyer. Jet A-1 (JA1) is a civilian-aviation kerosene-based turbine fuel used in international commercial aviation, with ASTM specification D16555 and NATO designation as F-35. Jet A is a similar type of jet fuel with a higher freeze point, while Jet B is a distillate with significant demand in cold climates. JP-4 is the military equivalent of Jet B with additional additives. JP-4 is the military equivalent of Jet B with corrosion inhibitor and anti-icing additives, meeting U.S. Military Specification MIL-DTL-5624U Grade JP-4 and British Specification DEF STAN 91-88 AVTAG/FSII. JP-5 is a kerosene-based fuel with a higher flash-point developed for military aircraft on aircraft carriers. JP-8, the military equivalent of Jet A-1, is less flammable and hazardous, adopted by the Air Force in 1996 for safety and combat survivability concerns. JP-8 is the military equivalent of Jet A-1 with corrosion and icing inhibitors, adopted by the Air Force in 1996 for safety reasons. It is less flammable and hazardous than JP-4, containing less benzene and n-hexane. JP-8+100 includes an additive for increased thermal stability and is used in diesel-powered tactical ground vehicles. The primary fuel for non-tactical ground vehicles is mogas (motor gasoline). Multiyear contracting is a special method to acquire known requirements over up to five years. Naphtha is a petroleum distillate used as a feedstock in gasoline production."
