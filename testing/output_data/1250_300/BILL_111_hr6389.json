    "content": "The Act is known as the \"Prostate Research, Outreach, Screening, Testing, Access, and Treatment Effectiveness Act of 2010\" or the \"PROSTATE Act\". Congress finds that prostate cancer is a significant health concern, being the second leading cause of cancer death among men. In 2009, over 190,000 new cases were diagnosed, resulting in more than 27,000 deaths. Approximately 2,000,000 Americans are living with prostate cancer. The disease can affect younger men and has racial disparities, with African-Americans having higher mortality rates. Rural populations also face challenges in accessing quality care, highlighting the need for innovative solutions like telehealth. Urologists play a key role in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer, but there are still unanswered questions about the disease. Disparities in mortality rates may be linked to factors like disease etiology, access to care, and community education. Differentiating between aggressive and indolent forms of the disease early on remains a challenge, leading to overtreatment. Once prostate cancer metastasizes, there are no curative treatments available. Prostate cancer presents a challenge in distinguishing between aggressive and indolent forms, leading to significant overtreatment. Improved tests can reduce physical, psychological, and financial trauma for patients. Coordination in research and healthcare programs is needed to translate findings into practice effectively. Prostate cancer research and health care programs should be coordinated across Federal agencies to improve accountability and encourage the translation of research into practice. This will help identify and implement best practices for effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. Prostate cancer coordination and education are emphasized in this section. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in collaboration with the Secretaries of Defense and Health and Human Services, must establish an Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force within 180 days. The Task Force is responsible for summarizing advances in prostate cancer research, compiling best practices for adoption in health care programs, considering guidance for screening men over 74, and coordinating information on Federal research and health care activities. The Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force will consider quality of life, family history, gaps in research, opportunities for collaboration, and developing a comprehensive strategy to improve research and health care programs for those susceptible to or diagnosed with prostate cancer. The Prostate Cancer Task Force aims to develop a comprehensive strategy for collaborative research programs, coordinate messaging on screening and treatment, and provide recommendations to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs within two years of its establishment. The Prostate Cancer Task Force will submit recommendations to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs within two years of its establishment, including changes to research and health care programs to avoid duplication and promote public participation in decisions. The Prostate Cancer Task Force will provide recommendations to avoid duplication in research and health care programs, increase public participation, disseminate information effectively, expand partnerships between public and private entities, and assess cost savings and efficiencies. The Prostate Cancer Task Force will assess cost savings and efficiencies, recommend priority action items, and determine funding needs for implementing recommendations. Task Force members include representatives from relevant Federal agencies. The Prostate Cancer Task Force will appoint expert advisory panels from relevant Federal agencies and medical communities to coordinate a uniform message on prostate cancer screening and treatment. Meetings will be convened to assess cost savings, recommend action items, and determine funding needs for implementing recommendations. The Prostate Cancer Task Force will include experts in urology, primary care, and outreach to underserved populations. Meetings will be held at least twice a year, with recommendations submitted to Congress. The Federal Advisory Committee Act applies to the Task Force, with an exception for termination of the committee. The Prostate Cancer Task Force, consisting of experts in urology and primary care, will meet regularly to provide recommendations to Congress. The Task Force is subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, with an exception for committee termination. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, along with the Secretaries of Defense and Health and Human Services, will establish a program to coordinate prostate cancer research. This program aims to develop better diagnostic methods, understand the causes of the disease, and expand basic research into prostate cancer. The Prostate Cancer Scientific Advisory Board is established to accelerate research data sharing and the movement of new medicines to patients. A grant program will be implemented to support research efforts outlined in the previous section. The Underserved Minority Grant Program aims to address disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates among minorities and men with a family history of the disease. It includes grants for research, integration of existing knowledge, addressing barriers to care and clinical trial participation, outreach efforts, and access to imaging modalities. SEC. 5. TELEHEALTH AND RURAL ACCESS PILOT PROJECT. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish telehealth pilot projects to analyze clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness in underserved areas, prioritizing African-Americans, Latin-Americans, American Indians, and rural populations. Eligible entities will be selected to participate in these projects. The Secretary will prioritize entities in medically underserved areas, including African-Americans, Latin-Americans, Indian Health Service facilities, and rural areas. The evaluation of pilot projects will focus on the effective delivery of care for prostate cancer using telehealth services in underserved and tribal areas, improving the capacity of nonmedical providers, and collaboration between medical specialists for better care coordination. The Secretary will prioritize entities in medically underserved areas, including African-Americans, Latin-Americans, Indian Health Service facilities, and rural areas. The evaluation of pilot projects will focus on the effective delivery of care for prostate cancer using telehealth services in underserved and tribal areas, improving the capacity of nonmedical providers, and collaboration between medical specialists for better care coordination. Innovative medical home models with collaboration between urologists, oncologists, radiologists, and primary care teams, and the use of telehealth services for prostate cancer treatment in underserved areas will be evaluated in pilot projects. A report on the outcomes, cost savings, efficiencies, and recommendations for expanding telehealth services will be submitted to Congress within 12 months after the completion of the pilot projects. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will develop a national education campaign for prostate cancer, focusing on encouraging men to seek screening. The campaign will target communities with racial disparities in cancer rates and men with a family history of prostate cancer. Grants will be awarded to nonprofit entities for testing outreach and education strategies. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations is granted for fiscal years 2011 through 2015 to carry out the Act."
