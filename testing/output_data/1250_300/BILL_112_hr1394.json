    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011\". It includes findings related to lung cancer. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 highlights the significant impact of lung cancer, stating that it is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women. The National Cancer Institute estimates a high number of new diagnoses and deaths attributed to lung cancer. The Act also projects a substantial increase in the incidence of lung cancer, particularly among minority communities. Additionally, lung cancer causes more deaths annually than the next 4 leading causes of cancer deaths combined, with a low 5-year survival rate of only 15 percent. The 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is only 15 percent, while breast cancer has a 5-year survival rate of 89 percent, prostate cancer 99 percent, and colon cancer 65 percent. Lung cancer research funding is significantly lower compared to other major cancers, despite its high mortality rate. Smoking is the primary risk factor for lung cancer, but radon and other environmental contaminants are also strongly associated with the disease. The President's National Cancer Advisory Board Report of 2010 identified radon as the second leading cause of lung cancer and listed 15 other environmental contaminants associated with lung cancer. Lung cancer is stigmatized and often blamed on patients, even if they never smoked. Nearly 20 percent of lung cancer patients have never smoked, and 60 percent are former smokers who quit decades ago. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the overall population and in every major ethnic group. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in all major ethnic groups, with a higher impact on African-American males. Military personnel exposed to carcinogens have an increased risk. Only 16% of cases are diagnosed early, and early detection could save over 70,000 lives annually in the US. An actuarial analysis by Milliman Inc. in 2009 showed early lung cancer detection could save 70,000+ lives annually in the US. A National Cancer Institute study projected a $433 billion loss to lung cancer by 2020, but a 4% decline in mortality could cut that in half. The 2010 National Lung Screening Trial found 20% fewer lung cancer deaths with low-dose CT scans compared to standard x-rays. The Congress emphasizes the need for a national public health priority to reduce lung cancer mortality. A comprehensive program coordinated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services is necessary to address all aspects of lung cancer and reduce mortality among smokers and non-smokers. Additionally, a new Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program is proposed under the Public Health Service Act. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates a program to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020. The program includes strategic research grant prioritization by the National Cancer Institute. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates a program to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020. This includes strategic research grant prioritization by the National Cancer Institute, funding for research programs on predispositions to lung cancer, interrelationships with other diseases, and development of screening and treatment innovations. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 aims to reduce lung cancer mortality through various initiatives, including funding for research programs on predispositions to lung cancer, development of screening and treatment innovations, and collaboration with minority health organizations. Funding is also provided for the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to implement research programs on lung cancer incidence. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 aims to reduce lung cancer mortality by providing funds for the establishment of quality standards for computed tomography screening, expedited revision of standards, and an annual compliance review. Additionally, funds are allocated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to establish a Lung Cancer Early Detection Program for low-income, uninsured, and underserved populations. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 aims to reduce lung cancer mortality by providing funds for early detection services for high-risk populations, research on workplace contaminants linked to lung cancer, and inclusion of lung cancer mortality reduction measures in state cancer control plans. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 includes measures for early detection, treatment protocols, and coordination of programs to address the burden of lung cancer on women, minorities, and underserved populations. Coordination of tobacco control programs is also emphasized to achieve the program's goals. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates coordination between the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Health and Human Services for programs addressing lung cancer in military personnel and veterans. This includes a screening demonstration project and coordinated care programs for those diagnosed with lung cancer. The Congress supports a national lung cancer screening project to assess public health needs and develop an effective process. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a demonstration project within a year, in collaboration with various agencies, to focus on computed tomography screening and treatment for lung cancer. The Lung Cancer Computed Tomography Screening and Treatment Demonstration Project aims to identify optimal risk populations, develop effective screening processes, ensure quality control, and integrate health information technology. Selected sites include National Cancer Institute Centers, Department of Defense Medical Treatment Centers, Veterans Affairs Healthcare Network sites, International Early Lung Cancer Action Program sites, and community health centers for minority populations. The Secretary will establish quality standards and guidelines for licensing facilities conducting computed tomography screening for lung cancer, ensuring reliability, clarity, and accuracy of equipment and interpretation. The demonstration project will be conducted for a 5-year period. The Secretary will set standards for equipment and interpretation in CT lung cancer screening facilities to control radiation dose levels. The demonstration project will run for 5 years, with reports to Congress on costs and progress. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Lung Cancer Advisory Board to monitor programs under the Act and provide annual reports to Congress. The Board will consist of various government officials and representatives from different fields related to lung cancer. Authorization of appropriations is granted for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 to carry out the Act and its amendments."
