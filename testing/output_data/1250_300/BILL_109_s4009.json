    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmental Justice Enforcement Act of 2006\". The Act is necessary due to a Supreme Court decision that weakens protections against discrimination established by Congress over decades. The decision undermines victims' rights to seek redress in Federal court for discrimination and questions the validity of regulations. Congress enacted title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prevent federal funding of discriminatory programs based on race, color, or national origin. Congress adopted title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prevent federal funding of discriminatory programs based on race, color, or national origin. The regulatory process was established to ensure broad protections for beneficiaries of the law, with the Department of Justice issuing regulations that prohibited discrimination and retaliation. These regulations, drafted by executive branch officials, have remained valid since 1966. The regulations drafted by executive branch officials for title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 have never been invalidated, as Congress rejected a proposal to do so in 1966. The regulations reflect congressional intent and were designed to benefit those discriminated against, relying on private attorneys general for enforcement. The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of these regulations in ensuring compliance. The Supreme Court has affirmed the private right of action for individuals facing discrimination under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, even though it was not explicitly stated in the statute. Congress and the Courts have recognized an implied right of action, with Congress providing means for enforcing the statutes, including establishing a right to attorney's fees in 1972. In 1972, Congress established a right to attorney's fees in private actions brought under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court had no basis for denying a right of action under regulations promulgated pursuant to title VI while permitting it under the statute. Regulations prohibiting discriminatory practices are consistent with the antidiscrimination provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 emphasized the need for regulations to be approved by the President. Regulations prohibiting discriminatory practices align with the antidiscrimination provisions of the Act, as recognized by the Supreme Court in various decisions. These decisions include the disparate impact standard in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., the analysis of unlawful discrimination in Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., and the inference of invidious purpose in Washington v. Davis. The interpretation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits practices with disparate impact, reinforced by the use of such a standard in enforcing title VII. An invidious purpose can be inferred from relevant facts, and the disparate impact method is crucial in uncovering stereotypes underlying intentional discrimination. Congress reinstated the disparate impact standard in the Civil Rights Act of 1991 to enforce Title VII. Reinstating a private right of action under Title VI ensures entities are not unfairly accused of discrimination. Without this action, equality of opportunity may solely rely on Federal agencies, which could be hindered by administrative burdens. Congressional action is necessary to guarantee a private right of action. Action by Congress is necessary to specify a private right of action under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ensure individuals have a remedy for discrimination in various programs and services. The Supreme Court's decision in Sandoval has led to the dismissal of claims challenging discriminatory actions. Maintaining a private right of action will require a waiver of sovereign immunity. The private right of action under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires a waiver of sovereign immunity to be effectuated. SEC. 3. PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION. Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to address discrimination based on disparate impact, requiring a covered entity to show that their policy causing disparate impact is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals. The amended Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires a covered entity to demonstrate that a specific policy causing disparate impact is necessary for achieving nondiscriminatory goals. The aggrieved person must show that each challenged policy or practice causes a disparate impact, unless the decision-making process cannot be separated for analysis. If a less discriminatory alternative policy exists and the covered entity refuses to adopt it, the aggrieved person can make a case similar to demonstrating an alternative employment practice under Title VII. The amended Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires a covered entity to demonstrate that a specific policy causing disparate impact is necessary for achieving nondiscriminatory goals. The covered entity is not required to show that the policy is necessary if it can prove it does not cause disparate impact. Demonstrating necessity of a policy cannot be used as a defense against intentional discrimination claims. No person in the United States shall face discrimination or retaliation for opposing prohibited policies or practices under this title. SEC. 4. RIGHTS OF ACTION. Amends Section 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to allow any person aggrieved by a covered entity's failure to comply with the title to bring a civil action in Federal or State court. \n\nSEC. 5. RIGHT OF RECOVERY. Adds a new section 602A to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, allowing aggrieved persons to bring actions against covered entities. SEC. 5. RIGHT OF RECOVERY. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to allow aggrieved persons to seek legal and equitable relief for intentional discrimination or discrimination based on disparate impact. Punitive damages are not available against government entities. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendments are retroactive to April 24, 2001, and apply to all actions pending on or after that date, except for actions against a State under the disparate impact standard, which have the effective date of the Act's enactment."
