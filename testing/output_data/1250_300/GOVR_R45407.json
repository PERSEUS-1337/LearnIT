    "content": "The quality of instruction is crucial for student learning, with federal policy emphasizing the importance of good pre-service teacher preparation. Title II, Part A of the Higher Education Act of 1965 focuses on improving teacher preparation programs through financial support and accountability measures. The 115th Congress is considering a reauthorization of the HEA, with H.R. 4508 being one proposed bill. The 115th Congress is considering a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA). H.R. 4508 and H.R. 6543 are comprehensive reauthorization bills that would amend or repeal provisions in Title II. The authorization of appropriations for Title II-A expired in FY2011 but has been funded through various legislation. Congressional action on the HEA reauthorization is ongoing, with key issues being debated. The report discusses the history of teacher preparation in the U.S., focusing on traditional programs at institutions of higher education. It also addresses the challenges posed by alternative teacher preparation approaches and the need for accountability in program quality. Elementary and secondary schools historically received teacher training from normal schools, which later evolved into schools and colleges of education at institutions of higher education. The emphasis shifted from subject-area knowledge to pedagogy in teacher preparation programs. Alternative routes to teacher certification now focus on candidates' prior subject knowledge. The rise of alternative routes to teacher certification has widened the practice of teaching and subject-matter expertise acquisition. These approaches rely on candidates' prior subject knowledge and focus on classroom instruction and management. The Secretary's Tenth Annual Report provides data on teacher preparation programs in the United States, with 2,106 providers offering 26,459 programs in the 2015-2016 academic year, enrolling 441,439 teaching candidates and producing 159,598 program completers. In the 2012-2013 academic year, there were 2,171 teacher preparation providers offering 26,589 programs across the US, enrolling 499,800 teaching candidates and producing 192,459 program completers. Among these providers, 69% were traditional, 22% were alternative route providers at IHEs, and 9% were alternative route providers not based at IHEs. Additionally, 70% of the programs were traditional, 20% were alternative route programs at IHEs, and 10% were alternative route programs not based at IHEs. In the 2012-2013 academic year, there were 2,171 teacher preparation providers offering 26,589 programs across the US, enrolling 499,800 teaching candidates and producing 192,459 program completers. Among these providers, 69% were traditional, 22% were alternative route providers at IHEs, and 9% were alternative route providers not based at IHEs. Five states prepared 35% of the 192,849 teacher preparation program completers, with Texas leading in alternative route completers. The Secretary's Tenth Annual report highlights key aspects of teacher preparation in the US. Traditional programs require 100 hours of clinical experience and 600 hours of student teaching, while alternative routes do not. The two largest traditional programs are online: Grand Canyon University and University of Phoenix. Most enrollees in teacher preparation programs are white, non-Hispanic. Texas leads in alternative route completers. The majority of teacher preparation program enrollees are white, non-Hispanic. African-American enrollees make up a smaller percentage. The most common subject areas for program completion are elementary education, special education, early childhood education, English/language arts, and mathematics. The national average scaled score is significantly higher than the average cut score. Over 95% of candidates pass state assessments. Title II-A of the HEA includes a competitive grant program and reporting/accountability provisions for teacher preparation programs. Title II-A of the HEA authorizes the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program, which aims to improve the quality of prospective and new teachers through grants to eligible partnerships. The program supports traditional teacher preparation programs and teacher residency programs, with annual appropriations of about $42 million. About 30% of projects are pre-baccalaureate/fifth year programs, and 48% are residency programs. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program receives annual appropriations of about $42 million, supporting grants to partnerships for teacher preparation programs. Eligibility for a TQP award requires a partnership with a high-need local educational agency, a partner institution of higher education, and coordination with other federally funded programs. TQP grantees must match 100% of their award amount with non-federal funds. The Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) program requires grantees to match 100% of their award with non-federal funds and coordinate activities with other federally funded programs. Grants support a variety of reforms in teacher preparation programs, including curriculum changes, research-based instructional practices, clinical education programs, mentoring, induction programs, compensation initiatives, and professional development for teachers in high-need LEAs. The Teacher Quality Partnership program supports initiatives to increase compensation for early childhood educators, provide professional development for teachers in high-need areas, recruit qualified individuals into teaching, and strengthen literacy instruction skills. Grants fund teacher residency programs that offer rigorous graduate-level coursework, teaching apprenticeships, mentorship, and placement in targeted schools for collaboration. The Teacher Quality Partnership program supports initiatives to increase compensation for early childhood educators, provide professional development for teachers in high-need areas, recruit qualified individuals into teaching, and strengthen literacy instruction skills. Grants fund teacher residency programs that offer rigorous graduate-level coursework, teaching apprenticeships, mentorship, and placement in targeted schools for collaboration. Programs must place graduates in targeted schools as a cohort in order to facilitate professional collaboration and provide a living stipend or salary. Grants are also provided to develop effective school leadership programs to prepare individuals for careers as superintendents, principals, early childhood education program directors, or other school leaders. Such programs promote strong leadership skills, understanding of teaching and assessment skills, data-driven evaluation, resource management, parent and community engagement, and knowledge of student learning and development. The Teacher Quality Partnership program aims to support successful classroom instruction by using data to evaluate teacher instruction, managing resources and time to improve academic achievement, engaging parents and community stakeholders, and understanding student learning. Grant funds are also used to develop clinical education programs, mentoring and induction programs, and recruit qualified individuals to become school leaders. Title II of the HEA holds teacher preparation programs accountable by requiring states and IHEs to report program performance, with IHEs issuing report cards to the state and the public, and states reporting to the Department of Education. The Higher Education Act (HEA) requires states and institutions of higher education (IHEs) to issue report cards on teacher preparation programs. States must report to the Department of Education (ED) and the public, while ED uses state-reported information to issue an annual report on teacher qualifications. States are also required to evaluate teacher preparation programs based on criteria such as teaching skill indicators and pass rates on credentialing assessments. Less commonly used criteria include improving student achievement, raising entry standards, and increasing professional development opportunities. In 2014, states evaluated teacher preparation programs based on various criteria, including teaching skill indicators and pass rates on credentialing assessments. Some states also focused on improving student academic achievement, raising entry standards, and increasing professional development opportunities. 12 states and Puerto Rico identified low-performing or at-risk programs, representing less than 3% of total programs. H.R. 4508, a bill to amend the Higher Education Act, was approved by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce approved the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform Act (H.R. 4508) on a party-line vote. This bill would amend the Higher Education Act by repealing current provisions in Title II. Additionally, the ranking member introduced the Aim Higher Act (H.R. 6543), a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill that includes amendments to the TQP program, accountability provisions for institutions and states, and expansion of accountability requirements. During the 115th Congress, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has held hearings on HEA reauthorization but has not introduced a bill amending Title II. The President signed a resolution nullifying regulations that would have added clearer guidance on program accountability and penalties for poor performance. Congress may consider legislation reauthorizing the HEA, including provisions in Title II, addressing the federal government's role in accountability for states. During the reauthorization process of the Higher Education Act (HEA), Congress is considering the federal government's role in supporting teacher preparation programs. Some argue for an expanded federal role to ensure quality programs, while others believe teacher training should remain a state and local responsibility without federal involvement in setting standards. Some argue for an expanded federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs, while others believe it should remain a state and local responsibility. There is debate over the optimal mix of activities supported under the TQP program, with differing views on traditional and alternative routes to teaching. Expansion of federal policy on program quality is also advocated for, citing the need for better reporting and accountability measures. Some argue for an expanded federal role in supporting teacher preparation programs, advocating for better reporting and accountability measures. Critics argue that current accountability provisions are insufficient, with less than 3% of programs identified as low-performing. There is a debate over whether program evaluations should be tied to student performance outcomes, with concerns about the burden of current reporting requirements on state and local administrators."
