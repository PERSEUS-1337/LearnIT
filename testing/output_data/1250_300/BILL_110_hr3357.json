The Congress acknowledges the ongoing crisis in writing skills in schools and workplaces, with nearly 1/3 of high school graduates unprepared for college-level English composition. Deficiencies in writing skills result in significant private-sector costs for training. The National Writing Project has been the primary national program addressing this issue since 1973, showing improvements in student writing performance and classroom practices. The National Writing Project has shown significant gains in student writing performance and effective classroom practices. It serves as a model for programs in various fields and benefits over 135,000 teachers annually in multiple locations across the United States and its territories. The National Writing Project, under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, aims to expand its network of sites nationwide, ensure high-quality programs, disseminate effective teaching practices, and coordinate activities with the Act. The Secretary is authorized to award a grant to the National Writing Project, a nonprofit organization focused on improving student writing and learning. The grant requires the organization to partner with educational providers to establish teacher training programs for effective writing instruction. The grant awarded to the National Writing Project will be used to fund teacher training programs for grades kindergarten through college. These programs will be conducted year-round and aim to establish a network of teachers conducting writing workshops. Teachers from all disciplines are encouraged to participate. The Federal share for teacher training programs authorized by the National Writing Project is 50% of the costs to the contractor, with a maximum limit of $150,000 for any one contractor or $300,000 for a statewide program. The Secretary can waive this requirement based on financial need as determined by the National Advisory Board. The National Writing Project sets a limit of $150,000 for one contractor or $300,000 for a statewide program.

Up to $150,000 will be reserved annually for this evaluation. The National Writing Project will establish a Review Board to review applications for funding and recommend them for assistance. $30,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2008 with additional funding for the following 5 years.
