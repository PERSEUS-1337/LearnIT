    "content": "The federal government has been involved in collecting educational statistics for over 150 years. The National Institute of Education (NIE) and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) were established in the 1970s to centralize research efforts. The Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) replaced NIE in 1985, and later the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) took over in 2002 under the Education Sciences Reform Act. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) as an independent research institute within the Department of Education. ESRA also created the National Board of Educational Sciences (NBES) to advise the Director of IES and established three National Education Centers: the National Center for Education Research (NCER), the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and the National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE). P.L. 108-446 later added a fourth center, the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER), to operate within IES. P.L. 108-446 amended ESRA by adding the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) within IES. Along with ESRA, P.L. 107-279 enacted the Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (NAEPAA). ETAA provides grants for technical assistance activities, while NAEPAA authorizes national and state assessments in reading and mathematics. ESRA also led to the creation of an independent research institute and set standards for research. The ESRA led to the creation of an independent research institute with scientifically-based standards for research, providing more freedom and oversight compared to the previous OERI. It emphasizes methodological rigor and specifies standards for educational research supported under the act. The ESRA established an independent research institute with scientifically-based standards for educational research. Funding for ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA programs has continued through annual appropriations legislation. The House and Senate passed bills for reauthorization of these programs, amending provisions related to IES independence, research standards, technical assistance, evaluation, privacy protection, student assessment oversight, and IES accountability. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established IES as a research institute within ED to provide national leadership in education research. IES aims to provide information on education progress, practices that improve academic achievement, and the effectiveness of federal education programs through statistics, research, and evaluations. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) to provide national leadership in education research. IES aims to improve academic achievement through research, evaluations, and statistics. The IES Director is appointed by the President with Senate approval and is responsible for proposing research priorities, ensuring objectivity, and consulting with the National Board for Education Sciences (NBES) on IES policies. The National Board for Education Sciences (NBES) advises the Director on IES policies, research priorities, and funding decisions. ESRA outlines requirements for NBES members and the composition of IES, which includes four research centers. Three centers are led by Commissioners appointed by the Director for up to six years. The National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE) and the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) are two of the four research centers under the Institute of Education Sciences (IES). The other two centers, NCER and NCES, are also part of IES. Each center is headed by a Commissioner appointed for a term of up to six years. NCER's mission is to sponsor research that improves student academic achievement, closes the achievement gap, and promotes access to postsecondary education. The National Center for Education Research (NCER) is responsible for supporting research in various areas related to education, including postsecondary education. NCER's duties include maintaining peer-review processes, proposing research plans, ensuring research relevance to education practice and policy, and supporting national research and development centers on topics such as adult literacy, teacher quality, and reading. The National Center for Education Research (NCER) focuses on early childhood development, improving low-achieving schools, innovation in education reform, state and local policy, postsecondary education, rural education, teacher quality, and reading and literacy. Research centers address national needs with competitive grants for up to five years. The Commissioner of NCER oversees basic and applied research, field-initiated research, and ongoing initiatives. ESRA Part C authorizes NCES to collect and analyze education information with high methodological standards. NCES's primary duty is to compile and disseminate statistics on education conditions. The National Center for Education Research (NCER) focuses on various education areas with competitive grants for up to five years. NCES, authorized by ESRA Part C, collects and analyzes education information with high methodological standards. NCES's primary duty is to compile and disseminate statistics on education conditions, ensuring objectivity and relevance. Other duties include publishing reports, setting standards for state educational agencies, and comparing student achievement internationally. The Commissioner of NCES carries out these duties through grants, contracts, and agreements. The Commissioner of NCES is authorized to award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements for collecting data on various education topics such as student achievement, school completions, teaching practices, violence in schools, education financing, and technology use. ESRA specifies the data that must be collected to compare student achievement in the United States with other nations. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) mandates the collection of data on various education topics, including student achievement, technology use, early childhood programs, and school libraries. Data must be disaggregated by various demographics to facilitate educational and policy decision making. ESRA authorizes the National Center for Education Evaluation (NCEE) to support evaluation, technical assistance, and dissemination activities to determine the impact of federal education programs on student academic achievement. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) authorizes the National Center for Education Evaluation (NCEE) to evaluate federal education programs, especially in reading, mathematics, and science, to support dissemination of results, encourage valid research, and provide technical assistance. NCEE must adhere to high standards for evaluation methodology and peer review, focusing on Title I programs under ESEA and supplementing other federal education program evaluations. The National Center for Education Evaluation (NCEE) is required to evaluate programs under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and supplement other federal education program evaluations. This is primarily done through the Regional Educational Laboratories (REL) program, which provides technical assistance to SEAs, LEAs, school boards, and state boards of education. The RELs conduct applied research, development, dissemination, and training activities to meet the needs of the regions they serve. The Regional Educational Laboratories (RELs) provide technical assistance to education agencies and conduct research to meet regional needs. The Commissioner of NCEE evaluates the RELs independently and reports the results to Congress. NCSER sponsors research to improve services for infants, toddlers, and children with disabilities. NCSER, under ESRA Part E, sponsors research to enhance services for infants, toddlers, and children with disabilities, improve outcomes under IDEA, and evaluate IDEA implementation. NCSER's duties include improving services, identifying effective practices, interventions, and personnel preparation, addressing overidentification and underidentification of children with disabilities, and examining the special needs of limited English proficient children with disabilities. The National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) focuses on improving services for children with disabilities, addressing overidentification and underidentification issues, and examining the special needs of limited English proficient children. NCSER conducts research activities and disseminates findings in accordance with established standards. ESRA Part F outlines provisions on confidentiality, data availability, performance management, staffing considerations, and authorizations of appropriations. $400 million in appropriations were authorized for FY2003, with additional funding for the following fiscal years. Title II of P.L. 107-279, known as the Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA), authorizes grants for technical assistance and evaluation. The Secretary can award grants to local entities and states for data systems. Comprehensive centers are required to work with SEAs, LEAs, and schools in their region, providing training and other authorized activities. Funding for these activities has continued through annual appropriations legislation. The Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA) authorizes grants for technical assistance and evaluation. Comprehensive centers must work with SEAs, LEAs, and schools in their region, providing training and other authorized activities. Each center must coordinate with local entities and report annually to the Secretary. The Secretary conducts independent evaluations and makes competitive grants to SEAs for data systems. The Secretary conducts ongoing independent evaluations of comprehensive centers and reports to congressional committees and the Director of IES. Competitive grants are awarded to SEAs for statewide longitudinal data systems to manage student data efficiently. Funding for these activities was authorized in FY2003 and continued through annual appropriations legislation. Title III of P.L. 107-279 establishes the National Assessment Governing Board and the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (NAEPAA) establishes the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) and charges the Commissioner of Education Statistics with conducting the NAEP assessments in reading and mathematics every two years for grades 4 and 8. States can choose to participate in the state assessment program by administering NAEP to a sample size for state-level results. Participation in the NAEP assessment is voluntary for students, schools, and local educational agencies. The Assessment Board formulates policy guidelines for NAEP with input from various stakeholders. NAEPAA Section 303(d) states that participation in the NAEP assessment is voluntary for students, schools, and local educational agencies. The Assessment Board, composed of various stakeholders, is responsible for selecting subject areas to be assessed, developing achievement levels, objectives, and test specifications, and ensuring the assessment's validity and reliability. The Director of IES is a nonvoting member of the Assessment Board. The National Assessment Governing Board develops guidelines for the assessment process, ensures validity and reliability of assessment items, measures student achievement in grades 4, 8, and 12, and plans the release of reports. Funding for these activities was authorized until FY2008. During the 113th and 114th Congress, bills were passed to reauthorize ESRA, ETAA, and NAEPAA, amending provisions related to IES independence, research standards, technical assistance, evaluation, privacy protection, student assessment oversight, and IES accountability. Both bills would have given the Director of IES authority to accept additional responsibilities from the Secretary. Both H.R. 4366 and S. 227 proposed changes to the authority and appointment processes within the Institute of Education Sciences (IES). They aimed to make the National Board for Education Sciences (NBES) independent of the Director and other offices, require practitioner board members, extend the Director's term under certain conditions, and involve the Director in procurement and performance management processes. Both H.R. 4366 and S. 227 proposed changes to the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), including extending the Director's term, involving the Director in procurement processes, establishing a peer review system for grants, and amending research standards. The proposed bills aimed to amend the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) by establishing competitive grant awards through peer review, renaming \"scientifically based research standards\" to \"principles of scientific research,\" and requiring research designs that eliminate competing explanations. The bills also adjusted research priorities to focus on educational issues and improving quality from early childhood to postsecondary education. The proposed bills aimed to amend laws such as ESEA, IDEA, and HEA, by focusing on improving education quality from early childhood to postsecondary levels. Both bills would have made changes to the National Center for Education Research (NCER) and Regional Educational Laboratories (RELs), including eliminating specific research priorities, limiting the number of RELs to 10, and emphasizing applied research activities. Both bills aimed to restructure the Regional Educational Laboratories (RELs) and Comprehensive Centers, limiting the number of RELs to 10 and Comprehensive Center awards to 17. The Evaluation and Regional Assistance Commissioner would have the authority to determine the appropriate number of RELs and reorganize them based on performance indicators. The responsibility for technical assistance would be solely assigned to the Comprehensive Centers, not NCEE or RELs. The bill aimed to limit the number of Comprehensive Center awards to 17, giving the Secretary authority to determine the appropriate number based on performance indicators. The Secretary could also reorganize centers by content areas. Both bills designated IES as the primary entity for research on federal education programs and authorized funds for program evaluations under ESEA. The Secretary, in consultation with the Director of IES, can reserve up to 0.5% of funds for each ESEA program and 0.25% for Part A of Title I for evaluations. The bills allow consolidation of reserved funds for evaluations and require a biennial ESEA evaluation plan. Changes include clarifying the Commissioner of Education Statistics' privacy duties, amending the role of the National Assessment Governing Board, and mandating triennial evaluations of National Education Centers. The proposed bills, H.R. 4366 and S. 227, aimed to require triennial or five-year evaluations of National Education Centers by an independent entity. They also sought to implement an expanded performance management system with measurable indicators to assess the effectiveness of IES activities and renew support based on progress. Renewal authority for NCER national research and development centers would be granted for up to two years under both bills. Both H.R. 4366 and S. 227 propose renewing support for NCER national research and development centers for up to two years without competition. They also include renewal authority for the Statistics Commissioner and other commissioners, requiring recipients to show progress in meeting performance management system requirements. Additionally, both bills mandate public reporting of grant information within 120 days and codify data access regulations for federal agencies.
