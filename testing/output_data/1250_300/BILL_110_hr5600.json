    "content": "The Act is titled the \"District of Columbia Court, Offender Supervision, Parole, and Public Defender Employees Equity Act of 2008.\" It allows retirement credit for employees transferred from District of Columbia service to federal service. The \"District of Columbia Court, Offender Supervision, Parole, and Public Defender Employees Equity Act of 2008\" allows individuals who served in qualifying District of Columbia service to include that service in calculating their creditable service for specific provisions of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. This service is not included in computing the amount of any annuity. The Act defines \"qualifying District of Columbia service\" as service performed by individuals in specific roles within the District of Columbia government, allowing them to include this service in calculating their creditable service for retirement benefits. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the District of Columbia Public Defender Service allow individuals to include specific service in calculating retirement benefits if certain conditions are met. The individual may receive credit for service performed under the priority consideration program established by the Bureau of Prisons if certain conditions are met, including service performed as an employee of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections. The Office of Personnel Management will accept certification from the District of Columbia government regarding an individual's qualifying service and its duration."
