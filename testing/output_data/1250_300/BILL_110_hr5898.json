It also seeks to promote best practices for Silver Alert systems and increase awareness for coordinated efforts between families, caregivers, communities, and law enforcement to locate missing individuals quickly and safely reunite them with their families. The Congress finds that as many as 5,000,000 people in the United States may suffer from Alzheimer's disease, with the risk increasing with age. Data shows that 1 in 8 people over 65 have Alzheimer's, and every 71 seconds someone new develops the disease. The aging baby boomer generation will further increase the number of those affected. The Alzheimer's Association estimates that over 60% of patients will wander away from their homes or care facilities. The Alzheimer's Association estimates that over 60% of patients with Alzheimer's disease will wander away from their homes or care facilities. Some states have established notification systems to disseminate information about missing seniors with dementia to increase the chances of locating them. The timely notification and dissemination of information about missing individuals increases the chances of locating them. Some states have faced challenges in implementing such systems due to budget constraints. Congress believes that Silver Alert systems should have clear criteria, not be based solely on age, and only be used for individuals incapable of making personal decisions. Silver Alerts should be initiated by someone who has recent contact with the missing individual and is a legal guardian, family member, household resident, or caregiver. The alerts should prioritize privacy, dignity, independence, and autonomy. Training for law enforcement on locating individuals with dementia-related illnesses is encouraged. The Federal Government can help prevent injuries and loss of life among individuals with Alzheimer's disease and dementia by assisting states in establishing and improving Silver Alert systems. Coordination between state and local entities is encouraged to locate missing individuals and communicate effectively with them. The Silver Alert System Grant Program is established to assist states in improving systems to locate missing individuals with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The Attorney General can award grants to States to establish or improve Silver Alert systems. Grants are for one-year periods and must be at least $100,000. Regulations will be prescribed for eligibility and selection criteria. Authorization of Appropriations: $5,600,000 is authorized to be appropriated annually from 2009 to 2013 for the implementation of the Silver Alert systems in States. Annual report required for Silver Alert systems. The Attorney General must provide an annual report to Congress on Silver Alert systems, including a list of states with the system, number of alerts issued, successful locates, time taken to locate individuals, issuing agency, costs, criteria for alerts, and success rates in finding missing individuals. The annual report to Congress on Silver Alert systems includes information on the cost of establishing and operating the system, criteria for issuing alerts, individuals crossing state lines, privacy protection, communication improvement, and any other relevant details determined by the Attorney General. The Silver Alert system is a State-administered notification system to locate missing individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related illnesses.
