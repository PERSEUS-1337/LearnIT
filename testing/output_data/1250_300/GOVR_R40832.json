    "content": "This report summarizes the USDA's efforts to establish a national animal traceability system for rapid disease outbreak response. Despite economic benefits, federal proposals face opposition in the U.S. cattle industry. The report discusses background on animal ID and traceability, unresolved issues, and international standards. The USDA announced a new approach to animal disease traceability in 2010, replacing the National Animal Identification System. The new Animal Disease Traceability framework allows states to choose their own level of animal ID and traceability. However, all animals moving in interstate commerce must have traceable ID back to their originating state. Under the new Animal Disease Traceability framework, USDA will require all animals in interstate commerce to have traceable ID back to their originating state. A Traceability Regulation Working Group was established to gather feedback and make recommendations for a proposed rule. Public meetings were held to present the framework and gather feedback from animal health officials and producers. USDA's new framework for animal disease traceability involves public meetings to gather feedback from animal health officials and producers. The framework emphasizes that managing traceability is the responsibility of states and tribal nations, allowing states to choose their approach to animal ID and traceability. The revised framework for animal disease traceability allows states to choose their approach, including no mandatory animal ID, existing ID systems, or a detailed birth-to-market ID system. Within-state programs will be implemented by states and tribal nations, not the federal government. Federal rules will apply to livestock in interstate commerce, requiring official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. Exemptions will be defined, and acceptable official identification types will be outlined in federal regulations. Performance standards for animal disease traceability will be evaluated through rulemaking. The animal disease traceability capacity of each state and tribal nation will be evaluated according to performance standards defined through rulemaking. Each state and tribal nation will have detailed traceability cooperative agreements with APHIS, with federal funding provided through annual cooperative agreements. No funding is designated for animal traceability in the agriculture appropriations bill for FY2011, but funding could be considered after needs are identified under USDA's new initiative. The USDA's new initiative will implement a program for animal disease traceability through federal regulations. A proposed rule could be published in April 2011, with a final rule expected 12 to 15 months later. Major outbreaks of diseases like avian influenza and foot and mouth disease have caused significant economic damages. The economic impact of animal disease outbreaks can be significant, causing billions of dollars in damages and disrupting domestic and international markets. The United States has been fortunate in avoiding catastrophic outbreaks like foot and mouth disease (FMD), but the potential economic consequences could be staggering. The development of animal identification and traceability systems was motivated by past outbreaks in the 1990s and early 2000s. The economic impact of major animal disease outbreaks in the 1990s and early 2000s led to the development of animal identification and traceability systems in many countries. These programs vary from voluntary to mandatory, focusing on animal health and food safety. Countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea have mandatory programs, while major importers like Japan and South Korea are considering traceability requirements for imported meat products. Any changes in domestic or international markets regarding animal health, food safety, and import standards can have significant economic implications for the U.S. livestock industries, as the U.S. is a major producer and exporter of livestock and animal products. The United States is a major producer and exporter of livestock and animal products, leading in beef and poultry production. It is also a top exporter of pork and beef, while being the leading importer of beef. Animal identification is crucial for tracking animals from birth to market, originally for ownership and now expanded to include origin information. U.S. exports of animal products account for a significant portion of domestic production. Animal identification has evolved to include information on the animal's origins and traceability, allowing for quick response to disease outbreaks or tainted food. A national database combined with traceability is seen as the ideal system to protect human and animal health and minimize commercial damage. Different countries have varying versions of animal ID systems, collecting information on birthplace, owner details, and movements. The focus of animal identification and traceability systems is primarily on collecting information such as birthplace, owner details, movements, and product details. This information is crucial for rapid response to health and safety concerns, as well as verifying premium production processes. In the United States, the current focus is on animal health traceability from birth to slaughter, while other countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea focus on both animal health and product traceability. The focus of animal ID in the United States is on animal health traceability from birth to slaughter. In contrast, countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea have more comprehensive traceability systems that extend to the retail consumer. International buyers are demanding more information on the products' history, leading to the evolution of a national animal ID and traceability system in the US. Proponents highlight the benefits of such a system, while critics raise concerns. Proponents of a national animal ID and traceability system in the United States argue that it enhances animal health surveillance, minimizes the economic impact of disease outbreaks, and reduces producers' disease testing costs. Regionalization or compartmentalization is a disease management tool that contains a disease outbreak to a specific zone, limiting the spread of harmful diseases and minimizing economic damage. It also helps in re-establishing international market access. Farmers can increase domestic marketing opportunities by tracking individual animals and exploiting desirable production characteristics for price premiums. Universal bar codes on processed food are used to manage inventories and monitor consumer buying. The use of universal bar codes on processed food, including meats, helps manage inventories and monitor consumer buying. Traceability is important for verifying production methods for organic, humane treatment, and environmental standards in the meat, eggs, and milk industry. Government-coordinated programs, like USDA's Process Verified program, allow producers to confirm their manufacturing processes through third-party audits. This program enables suppliers to make marketing claims such as breeds and feeding practices. A traceability program allows producers to confirm production methods and make marketing claims. It provides valuable management tools for producers, addresses food safety and national security concerns, and increases transparency in the supply chain. An animal ID and traceability program can help livestock producers reduce liability claims and maintain records on animal movements, health, and marketing activities. It also addresses food safety and national security concerns by collaborating with federal and state agencies to protect the food supply from threats like tuberculosis and foodborne illnesses. Some believe a more rigorous traceback and animal ID system could facilitate food recalls and contain the spread of illnesses, while others argue it would be costly and unworkable. Enhancing foreign marketing opportunities for animal products through traceability systems is crucial in reassuring buyers about the health of U.S. animals and meeting foreign veterinary and food safety requirements. This also helps in certifying production processes for niche markets, such as export programs for hormone- or antibiotic-free production. USDA's AMS developed an export verification program after BSE appeared in North America in 2003 to meet beef import specifications of countries like Japan. USDA's AMS developed an export verification program for U.S. plants to meet beef import specifications of countries like Japan. The program establishes standards for suppliers to follow and is a prerequisite for access to foreign markets. Establishing traceability enhances U.S. export competitiveness and could improve domestic price structures. Implementing an animal ID and traceability system could enhance the United States' international competitiveness and support domestic price structures. It could also improve animal welfare during natural disasters. However, opponents argue that it invades privacy and increases costs and technical complexity. Critics argue that implementing a national animal ID program could lead to increased costs and technical complexity, with the majority of expenses falling on the cattle sector. They also claim that the program would favor vertical integration over family farms. Critics argue that implementing a national animal ID program could disadvantage cattle producers due to the added cost of tagging individual animals, potentially eroding profit margins for small operators. Additionally, concerns have been raised about large retailers shifting compliance costs back to farms, making it harder for smaller, independent producers to stay in business. Certain religious groups also object to the program on apocalyptic grounds. Some producers are concerned that increased transparency from a national animal ID program may lead to higher tax liabilities. The program has evolved from disease eradication efforts, with animals being tagged for tracking purposes. The animal disease eradication program successfully used uniquely numbered brucellosis ID tags for tracking vaccinated or tested animals. Official identification requirements exist for certain livestock classes before interstate commerce, such as for pseudorabies in swine and scrapie in sheep. State laws and breed association rules also mandate animal identification for participation in shows or races. However, U.S. animal ID programs lack national scope and consistency, as seen after the BSE outbreak. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) program was proposed in 2002 to address U.S. animal ID limitations highlighted after the BSE outbreak in 2003. It aimed to improve animal identification, record keeping, and data management through a state-federal-industry partnership. Certain states have mandated components of animal identification, such as premises registration, to safeguard animal health. The NAIS program, a voluntary national animal health safeguarding effort, was replaced by a more flexible, state-based program in response to criticism from the U.S. cattle sector. NAIS aimed to cover all major commercial livestock and poultry species in the U.S., including beef and dairy cattle, hogs, sheep, goats, chickens, turkeys, and horses. The NAIS program aimed to cover all major commercial livestock and poultry species in the U.S., including beef and dairy cattle, hogs, sheep, goats, chickens, turkeys, and horses. It excluded household pets and focused on animals entering commerce or commingling at other premises. USDA's involvement was to popularize the program, provide information, and address implementation issues. The USDA's NAIS program aimed to cover major commercial livestock and poultry species in the U.S., prioritizing implementation by species/sectors and harmonizing animal ID programs. Reports were published to provide guidance, technical standards, and implementation strategies for participants and stakeholders. A Business Plan detailed strategies to advance animal disease traceability. A Business Plan to Advance Animal Disease Traceability recommended strategies to enhance animal disease traceability by harmonizing existing animal health programs and identification techniques. The NAIS User Guide provided guidance on participating in NAIS and the Program Standards document established data standards for NAIS. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to protect U.S. agriculture from animal disease outbreaks by utilizing standardized identification devices and technology. The goals included enhancing disease response capabilities, limiting disease spread, minimizing economic impact, and maintaining market access. USDA's long-term goal was to identify and trace animals within 48 hours of a disease problem. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to protect U.S. agriculture by quickly identifying and tracing animals in case of disease outbreaks. NAIS consisted of three components: premises registration, animal identification, and animal tracking. This system aimed to provide rapid access to data on animal ID and movement history to contain outbreaks and limit economic damage. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to quickly identify and trace animals in case of disease outbreaks. The first phase involved premises registration, collecting information like premises identification number (PIN), contact details, and location data. PINs were unique seven-digit numbers permanently assigned to locations, regardless of ownership changes. Premises registration under the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) involved obtaining a unique premises identification number (PIN) from state or tribal animal health authorities. The USDA maintained this information in a National Premises Information Repository to quickly notify producers of disease outbreaks. By September 2009, only 37% of premises were registered out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal locations. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to register all premises by 2009, but only 37% were registered by September 2009. Higher participation levels were needed for successful implementation. The second phase involved assigning unique numbers to individual animals or groups. Animal ID was achieved through a 15-digit number system, with the first three digits being the country code (840 for the U.S.). Tags and devices complying with this system were known as 840 devices. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) aimed to register all premises by 2009, with unique 15-digit numbers assigned to individual animals or groups. Tags and devices complying with the system were known as 840 devices, including RFID tags and injectable transponders for easier access to ID information. These devices eliminate the need to approach or restrain animals, reducing stress and improving data quality. The USDA encouraged all animal owners to register their premises under the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) regardless of the number of animals present. RFID and electronic transponder devices allow for faster access to ID information and reduce stress on animals. Animals that pose a low risk of disease spread or exposure may not need to be identified, but it is recommended to attach an ID before moving them from their current premises. The USDA recommends attaching an ID to animals before they are moved from their current premises. Producers have the option to tag animals at auction markets or other locations offering tagging services. Animals brought into operations should maintain their official identification, and group/lot identification numbers can be used for animals moving through the production chain. The USDA recommends attaching an ID to animals before they are moved from their current premises. Group/lot identification numbers can be used for animals moving through the production chain, with a 15-character GIN consisting of a PIN, date of assembly, and count of groups. The GIN is self-generated by the producer and links each producer's livestock or poultry flock to the animal's birthplace or premises of origin. The NAIS involves a uniform numbering system to link producers' livestock to their birthplace. The protocol is tailored to different species groups and aims to quickly locate at-risk animals during disease outbreaks. Producers can report animal movements to NAIS-compliant databases, with minimum tracing information required for participation. This includes the national premises identification number, animal ID number, date of event, and event type. The NAIS requires minimum traceback information such as the national premises identification number, animal ID number, date of event, and event type. The voluntary animal tracing component is a public/private partnership with industry and states operating and maintaining animal tracking databases for disease control. The federal government would not maintain the Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs); states and private entities would. USDA's plan includes using the Animal Trace Processing System (ATPS) for animal health officials to request information during disease outbreaks. ATDs provide timely reports on potentially exposed animals, with optimal data retrieval within 48 hours for disease containment. State and federal officials use the system for foreign animal disease cases, emergencies, or disease investigations. The Animal Tracking Databases are used in specific situations such as confirmed positive tests for animal diseases, emergencies, or traceback/traceforward needs. Participation levels in premises registration vary across species and states, with poultry and sheep having the highest registration rates. As of September 2009, 36.9% of livestock and poultry farms in the US were registered in the databases. Participation is crucial for an effective response to disease outbreaks. In the United States, there are 1.4 million livestock and poultry farms with animal product sales of at least $1,000. The USDA emphasizes the need for a high level of participation in the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) to achieve a 48-hour traceback goal. Dr. John Clifford suggests a participation rate of 70-90% for effective traceability, but critics feel progress is slow. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report in July 2007 raised concerns about the lack of a clear path towards universal animal ID. The USDA's National Animal Identification System (NAIS) requires a high participation rate, ideally 70-90%, for effective traceability. Critics have raised concerns about slow progress and lack of clarity in achieving universal animal ID. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report highlighted issues hindering implementation, such as prioritization among animal species, integration with existing requirements, and data provision. USDA's NAIS Business Plan aimed to address GAO criticisms, but low participation rates have been a concern for achieving the 48-hour traceback goal. USDA officials and various organizations are calling for mandatory participation in the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) due to low participation rates. The American Veterinary Medical Association, state animal health officials, consumer advocacy groups, and livestock industry groups support the idea of mandatory animal ID for effective traceability. Several livestock industry groups, including NPPC, NMPF, and AMI, support mandatory animal identification through NAIS to prevent losses from diseases. However, cattle industry groups like R-CALF and NCBA oppose mandatory NAIS due to concerns about costs, industry concentration, and data confidentiality. The high costs of equipment for the NAIS system may lead to industry concentration, disadvantaging small producers. Concerns have been raised about the confidentiality of information. USDA announced NAIS as voluntary, but there are debates over making it mandatory. Proponents argue for mandatory participation, citing the potential costs of tags and data systems for traceability. The NAIS system may become mandatory for the U.S. livestock industry, raising concerns about the costs of tags and data systems for traceability. There are debates over who should bear these expenses, with arguments for shared costs between industry and government. Larger operations are seen as better equipped to handle the financial burden, potentially leading to industry concentration and disadvantaging small producers. Larger, vertically integrated meat plants are more likely to survive due to resources and scale economies. Smaller plants with slower fabrication speeds may benefit from traceability costs, leading to niche market opportunities. APHIS released a study on the economic benefits and costs of adopting USDA's NAIS, with key assumptions on individual versus group ID tagging for cattle, swine, and poultry. The cost of implementing NAIS for livestock industries is estimated to be around $228 million annually for full pre-harvest traceability with 100% participation. This cost increases to $304.2 million when horses are included. Over 90% of the costs are associated with the cattle sector, mainly due to individual animal ID requirements. Cattle tagging accounts for 75% of the annual adoption costs in the cattle sector. The cost of implementing NAIS for livestock industries is estimated to be around $228 million annually for full pre-harvest traceability with 100% participation. Cattle tagging accounts for 75% of the annual adoption costs in the cattle sector, with costs varying from $3.30 to $5.22 per animal. Other livestock sectors have lower average costs per animal. The economic benefits of NAIS with full participation include government savings, market access, and avoidance of significant losses. The implementation of NAIS for livestock industries can lead to benefits such as re-establishing markets after disease outbreaks, expanded market access, and increased consumer confidence in food products. Producers may face concerns about liability for contamination, but documentation of management practices can help protect against this. There are also questions about public scrutiny of producers' records under the Freedom of Information Act. The federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) allows public access to records held by federal agencies, raising concerns among producers about potential misuse of information by animal rights extremists. Some exemptions exist for certain types of business information to protect trade secrets and proprietary data. In the 110th Congress, a provision addressing the protection of trade secrets in an animal ID system was removed from the omnibus 2008 farm bill. South Korea plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010, similar to the EU's individual identification standards. South Korea plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010, following the EU's individual identification standards. Japan does not currently require traceability for imported beef, but the opposition party aims to pass laws to subject imported beef to the same requirements as domestic beef. The DPJ in Japan is unlikely to address the issue of traceability requirements on imported meat as a top priority. The implementation of traceability measures for imports must be scientifically justified and equivalent to domestic standards, as per WTO rules. Measures applied to imports must meet two requirements: traceability must be scientifically justified based on risk assessment, and standards must be equivalent to domestic industry. Despite a $142 million investment in NAIS development, participation remained low at 40% of livestock producers by 2009. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack held listening sessions in 2009 to address concerns and gather feedback on NAIS implementation. Secretary Vilsack held listening sessions from April 15 to June 30, 2009, to gather feedback on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The sessions and written comments led to the decision to abandon NAIS in favor of a state-based system in 2010. Congress had expressed frustration with the slow implementation of NAIS despite a $142 million investment from FY2004 to FY2009. In FY2009, USDA directed APHIS to implement the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) and meet specific objectives. The Administration proposed increasing funding for NAIS to $14.6 million in FY2010, but the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee voted to eliminate funding. Subcommittee members expressed frustration with the slow progress of NAIS implementation despite previous funding. APHIS has not yet implemented an effective system for animal health and livestock market benefits. Continued investments in the current NAIS are unwarranted until USDA provides details on how it will implement an effective ID system. The Senate version of H.R. 2997 initially proposed $14.6 million for NAIS, but funding was reduced to $7.3 million through an amendment. The final FY2010 funding level for NAIS was set at $5.3 million, and the Agriculture appropriations bill was signed into law as P.L. 111-80 by President Obama on October 21, 2009. The final FY2010 funding level for NAIS was set at $5.3 million in the Agriculture appropriations bill signed into law as P.L. 111-80 by President Obama on October 21, 2009. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed at clarifying USDA's authority for an animal ID program, including H.R. 1018, H.R. 2301, and S. 1292. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 3485 proposed comprehensive traceability systems for USDA-regulated meat and poultry and other FDA-regulated foods. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 3485 proposed new traceability systems for USDA-regulated meat, poultry, and FDA-regulated foods. The bill required FSIS to establish a system to trace animals and products from slaughter to the consumer, with provisions for record maintenance and access. This legislation was part of broader food safety bills in both the House and Senate, focusing on FDA-regulated foods. The 111th Congress held hearings on the national animal ID system (NAIS) for FDA-regulated foods. Animal ID in the U.S. dates back to the 1800s with hot iron brands used for identification. In the 1940s, USDA initiated a program to identify cattle vaccinated for brucellosis. In the 1800s, hot iron brands were used in the U.S. West for identification. In the 1940s, USDA started a program to identify cattle vaccinated for brucellosis. By the 1950s-1980s, plans for a national animal identification system were being developed. In 1986-1988, Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was first identified in the UK. In the 1980s, Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was identified in the UK's cattle population, leading to the slaughter of 3.7 million cattle. Subsequent outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Taiwan and Classical Swine Fever in the Netherlands resulted in significant economic losses and mass culling of pigs and hogs. In 2001, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK led to the slaughter of over 10 million sheep and cattle, costing an estimated $7.9 billion. In 2002, efforts were made to draft an animal ID plan with the involvement of various organizations. In 2003, the U.S. Animal Health Association and other organizations collaborated to draft the U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP), which called for recording animal movements in a central database. APHIS was tasked with designing an ID numbering system and coordinating data collection. The plan aimed for all states to have an animal premises ID system by July 2004 and for major species to be identified by July 2006. The draft was published in December 2003, coinciding with the first case of mad cow disease in the U.S. USDA announced initiatives to bolster confidence in the beef supply. In December 2003, the first case of mad cow disease was detected in the United States, prompting USDA to announce initiatives to boost confidence in the beef supply. Secretary Ann Veneman transferred funds for a national animal ID system, leading to the framework for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) in April 2004. The program's timeline was periodically revised, with a Draft Strategic Plan in May 2005 and Draft Program Standards in August 2005. A new plan, \"Implementation Strategies,\" set a timeline for full implementation by 2009, stating the program was voluntary with a contingency for USDA intervention. In August 2006, the NAIS program was initially designed as voluntary but with a vision of transitioning to mandatory. However, in November 2006, USDA announced that NAIS would remain entirely voluntary at the federal level. The program's three-step approach included premises registration, animal ID, and traceability for implementing a national animal ID program. The user guide outlines the three-step approach for implementing a national animal ID program, emphasizing voluntary participation and confidentiality. In December 2007, USDA released the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) User Guide, followed by a Business Plan in April 2008 to advance animal disease traceability. The Business Plan aimed to clarify implementation strategies and set benchmarks for achieving 48-hour traceback of affected animals during disease outbreaks. The USDA released the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) User Guide in December 2007, followed by a Business Plan in April 2008 to advance animal disease traceability. One key strategy is to prioritize species, with primary commercial food animals in \"Tier 1\" and all other livestock in Tier 2. The goal is to bring 70% of the cattle breeding herd into NAIS by the end of 2009. In January 2009, a proposed rule for an Official Animal Identification Numbering System was published for comment. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack held public listening sessions from April to June 2009 to gather feedback on the future direction of animal identification and traceability in the United States. Additionally, a comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of NAIS was released in April 2009. In April 2009, USDA released a comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of the NAIS. In February 2010, Secretary Vilsack announced a new approach for animal disease traceability, allowing states to choose their own level of within-state animal ID. By March 2010, USDA required all animals moving interstate to have traceable ID. Public meetings were held from March to August 2010 to discuss the Animal Disease Traceability framework. The USDA released documents in August 13 regarding a proposed rule on animal disease traceability. The United States participates in international organizations like CODEX, OIE, and WTO for animal health and trade. Export certification standards are imposed by importing countries on U.S. livestock products. The United States, as a member of the WTO, agrees to abide by international trade rules to harmonize participation in commerce. The CODEX alimentarius and OIE recommend food safety and animal health standards, not international laws. WTO's Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures restricts traceability measures on imports to scientifically justified requirements equivalent to domestic standards. The Codex Alimentarius Commission and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) are international organizations that develop food and animal health standards. The Codex aims to protect consumer health and promote fair trade practices, while the OIE focuses on improving animal health globally. Both organizations work to ensure that standards are based on risk assessments and are equivalent to domestic industry standards. The OIE is an organization that improves animal health worldwide by setting international standards for animal identification and traceability. They help member countries implement these systems to enhance disease prevention, control, food safety, and export certification. The OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Standards Commission established guidelines on identification and traceability, which were adopted as official standards in 2007. The Director General called for the progressive implementation of these systems globally. The OIE Director General urged the global implementation of animal identification and traceability systems to facilitate trade and disease control. Export certification ensures compliance with importing countries' standards, with the USDA's FSIS handling certification in the United States. The OIE promotes international certification standards for beef imports, ensuring compliance with veterinary and sanitary requirements. Many countries have adopted animal identification systems for traceability, including Canada with its Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA). Canada's national animal identification system, managed by the Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA), was initially voluntary in 2001 but became mandatory in 2002. The CCIA, led by industry representatives with government involvement, transitioned to RFID tags for cattle identification in 2003. The Canadian cattle industry transitioned to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags in 2003. Since September 1, 2006, all cattle leaving their farm of origin must be tagged with a CCIA-approved RFID tag. Benefits of RFID tags include exceptional tag retention, increased data integrity, and the ability to read at a distance without line of sight. The nationwide compliance rate for Canadian cattle ID was estimated to be between 99-100% in March 2009. Personal information associated with ear tag numbers is securely maintained within the national database and accessed only by authorized personnel in the event of an animal health issue. The Canadian Livestock Traceability System (CLTS) houses the national ID and traceback systems for various industry and species groups. The Canadian Livestock Traceability System (CLTS) is the repository for national ID and traceback systems for various industry and species groups. Mandatory sheep and hog identification programs were established in 2004 and 2008. Australia's National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) allows for electronic identification and tracking of livestock from birth to slaughter. Mandatory cattle identification has been in place since 2005, with tracing systems for sheep and goats operational since 2009. Australia's animal identification system began in the 1960s to eradicate bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, with a mandatory property identification system for cattle introduced in 1967. Australia's National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) was introduced in 1999 to trace cattle back to their last property of residence using an electronic identification system. In 2004, an audit showed that all animals identified with NLIS were traced within 24 hours, compared to only 41% of cattle without NLIS tags. The NLIS was introduced in 1999 for cattle traceability. By 2005, it became mandatory for all cattle leaving their birth property to be identified. Each animal is assigned a unique ID number at slaughter, linking information to live animals, carcasses, and byproducts. The system is a joint effort between the Australian Government and industry, ensuring policy coordination. The NLIS in Australia is a joint effort between the government and industry for cattle traceability. The Federal government provides funding and policy coordination, while state governments manage livestock movement and health. State governments work with industry to develop legislation and education programs. Meat and Livestock Australia administers the NLIS database. The NLIS in Australia is managed by Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) to ensure cattle traceability. The European Union also has mandatory animal identification programs for food safety and disease control. EU species-specific ID systems have evolved in response to disease outbreaks like classical swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease. In response to disease outbreaks like classical swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease, the European Union implemented a mandatory system of permanent identification for bovine animals in 1997. This system includes double ear tags for individual identification, cattle passports for recording movements, and a national database for tracking information. Additionally, regulations require labeling of meat products with a reference number linking them to the animal. The EU has a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system in place, tracking animals from birth to harvest. Regulations require labeling meat products with a reference number linking them to the animal, identification of the member state, and facility approval numbers. Mandatory food traceability has been in place since 2005. Equidae, porcine, ovine, and caprine animals also have mandatory ID systems. Japan has a similar system for domestic animals since 2004. Japan implemented a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system in 2004, tracking domestic animals from birth to purchase by consumers. Imported beef currently does not have the same traceability requirements as domestically produced beef, but there is growing political pressure for this to change. This system was put in place in response to food safety crises, including BSE in domestic cattle and labeling scandals, with regulations enacted in phases starting in 2002. In response to food safety crises, Japan implemented a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system in 2004, tracking domestic animals from birth to purchase by consumers. The system includes traceability requirements for domestically produced beef, with retailers and restaurants displaying animal identification numbers for consumer reference. Additionally, Japan established the Food Safety Commission and enacted the Beef Traceability Law to extend traceability to processors, distributors, and retailers. South Korea also has a mandatory Beef Traceability System. South Korea has a mandatory Beef Traceability System (BTS) that tracks individual animals from birth to consumer, providing detailed information such as location of birth, feed administered, medications given, and date of slaughter. In contrast, New Zealand lacks a fully functioning national animal ID system. The South Korean government plans to implement traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010. New Zealand lacks a comprehensive national animal ID system, with efforts to improve traceability through the NAIT project still in development as of early 2009. The focus is on enhancing traceability for cattle and deer populations, but there are gaps in coverage at the national level. New Zealand's current animal ID systems focus on traceability for cattle and deer populations, with gaps in coverage at the national level. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) emphasizes the need to establish traceability for these species before considering adding others to the NAIT system. Existing systems like MINDA and NBTIP provide partial bovine animal ID, with MINDA being a voluntary herd management system and NBTIP being mandatory for cattle and deer movement. Other traceability databases are available for producers on a voluntary basis. A new mandatory animal identification system for cattle and possibly deer is proposed to be in place by June 2011 in New Zealand. Brazil implemented the Brazilian Bovine and Buffalo Identification and Certification System (SISBOV) as a farm-level identification system for cattle in 2001, which was later extended to the entire beef chain. SISBOV remains a voluntary program primarily focused on providing animals to slaughterhouses for foreign markets that require origination information. SISBOV, a voluntary program in Brazil, focuses on providing animals to slaughterhouses for foreign markets like the EU. However, audits by the EU have found severe shortcomings in Brazil's animal identification and traceability system, leading to a near-total ban on beef imports from Brazil in 2008. The EU remains concerned about the lack of robust information and the potential risk of foot-and-mouth disease entering the EU. The EU/FVO report released on August 4, 2009, highlighted concerns about the situation in Brazil and Argentina regarding animal identification and traceability systems. Argentina has implemented a limited mandatory system, including farm-of-origin information and cattle movement permits. However, like Brazil, Argentina primarily focuses on identifying cattle for export markets. While official ID tagging for calves has been required since 2007, the entire Argentine beef herd is not expected to be tagged until 2017. Argentina's history of disease outbreaks, particularly foot and mouth disease, remains a concern. The compulsory cattle identification program in Argentina aims to track cattle from birth to slaughter, with the entire beef herd expected to be tagged by 2017. This initiative is driven by the need to improve disease control, especially for foot and mouth disease, to expand beef exports. In Uruguay, a significant portion of beef production is sold in foreign markets, leading to the implementation of a mandatory animal identification system in 2006. Uruguay implemented a mandatory animal identification system in 2006 called the National Livestock Information System (SNIG). All cattle must be tagged before six months of age or before being transported. The government aims to have all herds registered and cattle tagged by 2010, with traceability extended to all cuts of beef back to specific animals at their farm of origin. SNIG builds on Uruguay's national premises identification system (DICOSE) established in 1973. Uruguay's National Livestock Information System (SNIG) was implemented in 2006, building on the premises identification system established in 1973. SNIG includes premises and animal identification, movements, and termination data. The system does not currently require traceability to consumers, but this is being considered. Some countries like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia do not have animal ID programs due to technological limitations and reliance on local production and marketing processes. Many countries with large agrarian populations lack national distribution chains for animal products, relying on local production and marketing. Lower-income consumers in poorer countries may not be willing to pay extra for traceable food."
