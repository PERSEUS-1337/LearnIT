    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Citizens' Self-Defense Act of 2011\". The Congress finds that police are not legally liable for failing to protect individual citizens, as courts have ruled that their duty is to the public at large. Examples include a case where police only responded to a fraction of calls for help and a Department of Justice report on violent crimes in 1989. In 1989, the United States Department of Justice reported 168,881 unresponded violent crimes within an hour. Each year, over 2.4 million Americans use firearms for self-defense, with 92% using them to scare off attackers. In self-defense situations, 92% of citizens use their guns to scare off attackers, with less than 8% resulting in injury or death to the attacker. Despite this, law-abiding citizens are sometimes prosecuted for using firearms in self-defense, as seen in a case where two brothers defended their business with shotguns against burglars in Reisterstown, Maryland. In Reisterstown, Maryland, two brothers defended their concrete business with shotguns against burglars. They shot and killed one burglar, injuring two others. The injured men were charged with burglary, along with two others connected to previous break-ins. In a separate incident in 2008 in Waukegan, Illinois, a store clerk shot and injured a robber, potentially facing criminal charges for not having a firearm owner's identification card. In Waukegan, Illinois, a store clerk shot and injured a robber, facing potential criminal charges for not having a firearm owner's identification card. The clerk would be charged with a State firearms violation as Illinois law prohibits employees from carrying guns in a place of business unless they are the owner or have proprietary interest. In Wilmette, Illinois, a homeowner was charged with misdemeanors for owning handguns and violating the village handgun ban ordinance after shooting a home intruder. The resident had a loaded firearm as a backup plan and confronted the intruder who entered the house twice. An intruder entered a house twice, once through a dog door and the second time with a stolen key. The homeowner confronted and shot the intruder, who then stole the family's car to go to the hospital. The intruder was charged with burglary and possession of a stolen vehicle. Police officers using firearms in duty have immunity, and citizens using firearms to protect themselves should not face lawsuits from violent felons. The right to obtain firearms for security and use them in defense of self, family, or home is protected by law. The right to obtain firearms for security and use them in defense of self, family, or home is reaffirmed for individuals not prohibited from owning firearms. This includes using firearms in self-defense against imminent threats or violent felonies. The term \"firearm\" includes shotguns, rifles, and handguns. Individuals whose rights are violated can take legal action. The right to obtain firearms for self-defense is reaffirmed for individuals not prohibited from owning firearms. This includes using shotguns, rifles, and handguns. Violations of this right can be legally challenged in court for damages, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees within a 5-year statute of limitations."
