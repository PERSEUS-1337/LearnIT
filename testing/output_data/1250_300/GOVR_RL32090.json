    "content": "On October 29, House and Senate appropriators announced a conference agreement on a bill providing supplemental appropriations for military operations and reconstruction assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill was approved by the House and Senate and signed into law by the President on November 6. The conference agreement rejected a Senate proposal for Iraq reconstruction assistance to be provided as loans. On September 21, the Defense Department provided backup material to congressional committees regarding funds for Iraq. On September 23, the Coalition Provisional Authority detailed its request for reconstruction aid. Congressional consideration was completed on November 3, with the Senate approving a $87.5 billion supplemental appropriation for FY2004. Various legislative proposals were debated, including reports on Iraq policy, tax rate reductions, allied contributions, and control of Iraq reconstruction. The Administration proposed a policy to establish security and restore basic services in Iraq, offsetting costs by rolling back tax rate reductions. Congress debated providing Iraq reconstruction funds as grants or loans. The $87 billion requested included $65.6 billion for defense and $21.4 billion for foreign policy programs, with $51.5 billion for ongoing military operations in Iraq. The Administration requested $87 billion for defense and foreign policy programs, with $65.6 billion for defense and $21.4 billion for foreign policy initiatives. This included $51.5 billion for ongoing military operations in Iraq and $20.3 billion for security and reconstruction in Iraq. The request for $87 billion included $61 million for U.S. diplomatic facilities and security, $50 million for multinational division peacekeeping costs, and $20 billion for reconstruction and security in Iraq. The request was designed to cover pressing requirements through FY2004 and December 2004, with no provision for ongoing military costs after FY2004. The $20 billion requested for reconstruction and security in Iraq is only a portion of the estimated $50-75 billion needed in the long run. The World Bank and UNDP estimate reconstruction costs at $36 billion over four years, with an additional $19.4 billion for security and critical sectors. Total projected reconstruction costs through 2007 amount to $55 billion, with Iraqi oil revenues and international support expected to help meet remaining needs. Iraqi oil revenues are projected to be around $12 billion in the next year, leaving no funds for reconstruction efforts in the near term. Iraqi oil revenues are expected to total about $12 billion in the next year, with government operations costing the same amount, leaving no funds for reconstruction efforts. The request for $87 billion for defense and reconstruction assistance comes on top of over $110 billion provided since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Congress has allocated about $12 billion for Iraqi and Afghan reconstruction. Congress has allocated about $12 billion for Iraqi and Afghan reconstruction, with $1.4 billion provided for Afghanistan and $1.6 billion for Iraq. The debate in Congress focused on cost issues and the impact of new funding on the federal budget. The debate in Congress about the Administration's $87 billion request for USAID budget focused on cost issues, including the impact on the federal budget, accuracy of cost projections, and future deficits. The OMB estimated a deficit of $455 billion in FY2003 and $475 billion in FY2004, while the CBO projected deficits of $401 billion in FY2003 and $480 billion in FY2004. The requested additional appropriations would push the deficit to about $525 billion for FY2004. The CBO updated budget baseline projected deficits of $401 billion in FY2003 and $480 billion in FY2004, including additional supplemental appropriations for military activities. Administration officials argued that the economy can absorb the federal borrowing entailed by the requested supplemental, while critics raised concerns about funding for domestic programs being constrained. In FY2004, the government borrowing totaled 4.4% of GDP, less than in the mid-1980s. Critics argued that borrowing 20%-25% of the federal budget is fiscally irresponsible and could endanger the economy in the long term. Some suggested financing Iraq's reconstruction costs as loans to generate future revenue for the United States. Administration officials were hesitant to provide long-term cost estimates for the war with Iraq. In a Senate hearing, Senator Levin recalled conflicting cost estimates for a conflict with Iraq, ranging from $50 billion to $200 billion. Some legislators accused the Administration of withholding cost projections to avoid weakening support for tax cut legislation. Independent estimates were prepared for war costs and post-war expenses before the conflict began. Before the war began, independent estimates projected higher war costs, including post-war expenses like peacekeeping and reconstruction. Estimates varied significantly from the Administration's figures, with concerns raised about long-term reconstruction costs in Iraq. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz mentioned the potential for Iraq's oil revenues to cover between 50 and 100 billion in costs. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz stated that Iraq's oil revenues could cover between 50 and 100 billion dollars for reconstruction. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld admitted underestimating Iraq's reconstruction costs, attributing the damage to Saddam Hussein's regime rather than the war. The devastation caused by Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq has led to significant challenges in infrastructure, such as the fragile electric system and poorly managed water resources. Questions remain about the accuracy of military and reconstruction cost projections, with the assumption that current force levels and operations will be maintained for the next year. The need for additional U.S. troops in Iraq is not expected due to progress in organizing Iraqi security forces and expected contributions from other nations. The Defense Department's supplemental funding request is under scrutiny for specific projects, including military construction, R&D, and base camp housing. Questions arise about whether the request accurately reflects costs and if it adequately addresses reconstituting Army forces. Army estimates suggest billions will be needed for restocking supplies. The Defense Department's supplemental funding request is being questioned for not allocating enough money for reconstituting Army forces, which could lead to difficulties in maintaining current force levels. Some members of Congress suggest increasing the Army's size, but this would take time and cost billions annually. Additionally, officials underestimated Iraq's infrastructure weakness and overestimated oil revenues, leading to varying projections of reconstruction costs. Officials initially underestimated Iraq's infrastructure weakness and overestimated oil revenues, leading to varying projections of reconstruction costs. The current reconstruction financing gap is estimated to be $50 to $75 billion, with uncertainties about how much multilateral donors will contribute. The upcoming Madrid donor conference is expected to pledge about $2 billion for Iraq in 2004, with the World Bank planning to recommend $1 billion in loans through June 30, 2005. U.N. officials estimate that about $2 billion will be pledged for Iraq in 2004, with the World Bank planning to recommend $1 billion in loans through June 30, 2005. The uncertainty lies in how long the U.S. military presence will be maintained in Iraq, with estimates ranging from a few years to five years or more. The House Budget Committee Democratic Staff projects the long-term cost of the war and reconstruction effort to exceed $178 billion under plausible assumptions. The House Budget Committee Democratic Staff projects the long-term cost of the war in Iraq and post-war reconstruction effort to exceed $178 billion, potentially reaching over $400 billion. Legislative measures proposed include oversight, tax measures, funding for programs, health insurance for military reservists, competitive contracting, and proposals for loans instead of grants for Iraq reconstruction. Congress debated how to oversee U.S. policy in Iraq. Several proposals were introduced in Congress regarding oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq, including a bill requiring a detailed report on the economic and security situation in Iraq. The Senate adopted amendments imposing reporting requirements on the Administration, echoing similar proposals in the House. In Congress, there were debates on various proposals regarding oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq. The Senate and House adopted amendments to impose reporting requirements on the Administration. Senator Biden proposed offsetting costs of the supplemental by delaying tax cuts for the top 1% of taxpayers. The Administration opposed any reduction in tax cuts. Senator Biden and other Senators proposed an amendment to limit the reduction in the top marginal income tax rate to increase revenues, but the Senate rejected it. In Congress, debates continued on funding for domestic programs and Iraq reconstruction. Senator Stabenow's amendment to reduce Iraq reconstruction funding by $5 billion and transfer it to domestic priorities was rejected. Various measures for funding domestic and international programs were still under debate. Several measures were debated in Congress to provide funds for domestic and international programs. Senator Mikulski proposed adding $100 million for AmeriCorps, while Senator Durbin's amendment for $880 million for international HIV/AIDS was tabled. The House added $345 million for Liberia peacekeeping and reconstruction, and the Senate included $200 million for Liberia. The key issue was whether to add $1.4 billion for veterans' health benefits. The enacted bill provides $200 million, plus $245 million for a contribution to U.N. peacekeeping operations in Liberia. The Senate approved an amendment to offer health insurance to non-active duty reservists and their families through the DOD TRICARE program, with estimated costs of $500 million in FY2004 and over $2 billion a year by FY2008. The Administration threatened to veto the authorization if it included this provision, but the Senate approved an amendment to provide health insurance to non-activated reservists who are unemployed or ineligible for employer-provided insurance. The Senate approved an amendment to provide health insurance to non-activated reservists who are unemployed or ineligible for employer-provided insurance. Legislators discussed measures to address excessive profits earned by companies like Halliburton in Iraq, including introducing bills to address the issue and stiffen penalties for fraud and profiteering on contracts. Amendments were adopted to limit non-competitive procedures for reconstruction contracts and tighten reporting requirements for such contracts. Members of the House adopted amendments tightening reporting requirements for non-competitive reconstruction contracts. A proposal to convert $10 billion of Iraq reconstruction funding to loans was approved by the Senate, with the condition that the U.S. would treat these loans as grants if foreign creditors cancel 90% of Iraq's debt.

The request also utilizes the \"Contingency Operations Support Tool\" model for estimating costs of military operations. The request for FY2004 Supplemental Appropriations for the Department of Defense is based on maintaining current force levels and pace of operations in Southwest Asia and nearby areas in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. The \"Contingency Operations Support Tool\" model is used to estimate costs of military operations, providing detailed breakdowns of projected costs in advance. These estimates are the most reliable available projections, although actual expenses may differ as operations unfold. The Defense Department is using COST model data for estimating war costs, which are considered reliable projections. The new cost estimates are higher per troop compared to Congressional Budget Office estimates. An ongoing issue is the flexibility of reallocating funds after appropriation. The Defense Department requested flexibility to reallocate funds through the Iraq Freedom Fund, a contingency fund for potential deployments. They also sought authority to transfer $5 billion between accounts with prompt notification to Congress.

Congress also increased Imminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Allowance in the April 2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental. In April 2003, Congress increased Imminent Danger Pay and Family Separation Allowance in the Emergency Wartime Supplemental. The benefits were extended through October 31, 2003, and the Defense Department requested further extensions. They proposed providing additional Hardship Duty Pay to personnel in combat zones after December 31, 2003, to equalize pay between troops with and without dependents.

The Bush Administration's key policy objectives in Iraq included restoring basic services and economic and political reconstruction, overseen by the Coalition Provisional Authority led by Ambassador L. Paul Bremer. The Coalition Provisional Authority, under Ambassador L. Paul Bremer, has initiated efforts for Iraqi self-rule by appointing a Governing Council, reconstituting civil and economic institutions, and implementing programs to improve infrastructure, security, and the economy. Despite progress since the U.S. occupation began, some view the occupation authority critically. Since the U.S. occupation began, efforts have been made to improve infrastructure, security, and the economy in Iraq. However, the occupation authority has faced criticism for failing to reestablish order, security, and introduce political and economic reform in a timely manner. The $20.3 billion supplemental request aimed to address infrastructure and security needs crucial for other U.S. objectives in Iraq. The Administration initially believed reconstruction costs could be covered by Iraqi and U.S. resources, but a national budget announced by the CPA estimated expenditures of $6.1 billion for the rest of the year. The cost of reconstruction in Iraq through the end of 2003 was estimated at $8.2 billion, with $3.9 billion to be covered by new oil revenue, taxes, and profits. The remaining deficit of $4.3 billion would be covered by frozen assets, the Development Fund for Iraq, and U.S. assistance. The Administration requested additional funding due to greater reconstruction needs and uncertainty about future revenue sources. The supplemental reconstruction request for Iraq in 2004 was larger than anticipated due to lower revenue projections. The World Bank and U.N. Development Program estimated reconstruction needs for 14 sectors at $36 billion over four years, excluding $19.4 billion for security and critical sectors. The Bank/UNDP assessments estimate reconstruction costs for 14 sectors in Iraq at $36 billion over four years, with an additional $19.4 billion needed for security and critical sectors. The total projected reconstruction costs through 2007 amount to $55 billion, with $17.5 billion needed in 2004 alone. The United States may face increased financial demands if Iraqi oil revenues and international donor contributions are insufficient. Iraq's ability to absorb infrastructure program commitments is limited to $6 billion in 2004 due to security concerns and contract implementation time. The Administration's request for infrastructure funding was $12.4 billion, intended to cover 18 months. The Administration requested $12.4 billion for infrastructure reconstruction, covering 18 months. The request includes categories like electric power and water, meeting needs beyond 18 months. Iraqi oil revenues were expected to fund reconstruction, but challenges in production and sabotage have affected expectations. Production is nearing 2 million barrels a day, with a target of 2.8 million barrels. Iraqi oil production is nearing 2 million barrels a day, with a target of 2.8 million barrels. Current rates may generate between $18.5 billion and $23 billion annually. The budget assumes an average production of 2 million barrels per day, generating about $12 billion in revenues. $503 million has been allocated for oil facility repairs, with a request for $2.1 billion in FY2004 for further restoration. Additional funds for Iraqi security forces aim to defend against sabotage. The Administration requested $2.1 billion in FY2004 for the repair of oil facilities and restoration of production and distribution systems. There was a debate on whether assistance to Iraq should be in the form of loans or grants, with some arguing that Iraq's future oil revenues could be used to repay loans for reconstruction. The Administration opposed adding to Iraq's existing debt obligations and proposed offering the $20.3 billion supplemental as grants. Witnesses mentioned Iraq's pre-war debt of roughly $200 billion. The Administration proposed offering the $20.3 billion supplemental as grants to Iraq to avoid adding to its substantial debt obligations. Witnesses mentioned Iraq's pre-war debt of roughly $200 billion and G7 leaders agreed to suspend the requirement for Iraq to service any existing debt through 2004. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1483 stated that Iraqi oil exports or proceeds could not be attached by creditors through 2007 without authorization. The question of who could assume responsibility for new sovereign debt remains unresolved. The Iraq reconstruction trust fund would receive contributions from international donors for project lending, requiring a sovereign Iraq authority to assume debt obligations. Legal scholars debate whether an occupying power can incur new debts on behalf of the displaced sovereign. Congressional appropriation would be necessary for loan reconstruction assistance, based on factors including subsidy value. Congress must provide a subsidy appropriation in advance for U.S. government loans or guarantees under the 1990 Credit Reform Act. The subsidy amount is determined by factors like loan terms and repayment likelihood. Lawmakers considered converting $10 billion of reconstruction grants to loans, but the proposal was rejected. Senator Dorgan also suggested using Iraqi oil to secure financing and converting grants to loans, which was not approved. The Senate rejected amendments to use Iraqi oil for reconstruction financing and convert grants to loans. A proposal to direct $10 billion to a World Bank Trust Fund for loans was not debated. In the House, an amendment to withhold half of Iraq funds until a new leader was elected was withdrawn. Another amendment to transfer $7 billion to a World Bank loan facility was defeated. The impact of the Supplemental on other donors was also discussed. The House rejected an amendment to transfer $7 billion of reconstruction funds to a World Bank loan facility. The impact of the Supplemental on other donors was debated, with concerns that a shift to loans could influence international donors negatively. Other donors have been hesitant to support Iraq reconstruction due to concerns about being seen as supporting a unilateral U.S. policy. To address this, a proposal was discussed to create Iraq reconstruction trust funds managed by the U.N. or World Bank, with control over funds by a multilateral management board. The Madrid donors' conference established two trust funds, one managed by the World Bank and the other by UNDP. The management of Iraq reconstruction funds was a significant issue during congressional debate on the appropriation in P.L. 108-11. The White House wanted to maintain flexibility over the distribution of resources, including the possibility of transferring funding to the Defense Department. This proposal sparked controversy, with critics arguing that aid programs should remain under the policy direction of the State Department. The White House proposal to allocate reconstruction funds to the Department of Defense sparked controversy among critics, including Members of Congress. Ultimately, Congress agreed to allow the White House to distribute the resources among five agencies, including DOD. The Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, managed by L. Paul Bremer under DOD guidance, was established with $20.3 billion. The White House later announced the formation of the \"Iraq Stabilization Group\" led by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice. The White House established the \"Iraq Stabilization Group\" led by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice to expedite reconstruction efforts and resolve decision-making disputes. The State Department's role in reconstruction policy is expected to increase, with State Department staff under the CPA in Iraq growing from 55 to about 110. Despite this, Ambassador Bremer will still report to the Secretary of Defense. The Senate rejected an amendment that would have placed the CPA under the direct authority of the Secretary of State, while the House added a provision to prevent coordination of defense or reconstruction activities in Iraq or Afghanistan by a U.S. government officer not confirmed by the Senate. The House bill added a provision to prevent coordination of defense or reconstruction activities in Iraq or Afghanistan by a U.S. government officer not confirmed by the Senate. The White House argued that the Iraq Stabilization Group does not affect control of reconstruction efforts, which remain under the Defense Department. Conferees decided to delete this provision from the enacted legislation. The Administration stated that the FY2004 request for Iraq only included the most urgent needs, such as re-engineering postal service practices and constructing residential communities. The FY2004 request for Iraq included urgent needs like re-engineering postal service practices and constructing residential communities. Congress questioned the costs of reconstruction requests, with some suggesting intentional inflation to avoid asking for more funds in 2004. The House and Senate proposed cuts in Iraq reconstruction funding, with the Senate reducing it by $1.855 billion, including a $200 million cut for oil infrastructure rehabilitation. The Senate, along with the House, reduced Iraq reconstruction funding by $1.855 billion, including a $200 million cut for oil infrastructure rehabilitation. The enacted legislation allocated $18.649 billion for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, transferring $210 million to assistance for Jordan, Liberia, and Sudan. This reduced the President's proposed $20.3 billion for Iraq to $18.439 billion. Additionally, the Administration requested a $1.2 billion supplemental aid for Afghanistan, which would double current U.S. assistance for FY2003. The request for Afghanistan aid included $799 million in new appropriations and $390 million from previously allocated funds, doubling U.S. assistance for FY2003. Key features of the new appropriations included funding for security, government support, infrastructure projects, and social programs. The request for Afghanistan aid included $799 million in new appropriations and $390 million from previously allocated funds, doubling U.S. assistance for FY2003. Key features of the new appropriations included funding for security, government support, infrastructure projects, and social programs, such as education, health, and local projects. The White House also requested an increase in the military drawdown limit from $300 million to $600 million. The enacted legislation increased overall reconstruction funding by $365 million with significant changes in allocations for infrastructure, governance, and social services in Afghanistan. The conference agreement includes an earmark of $60 million for women's programs and amends authorization levels in the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002. Since late 2001, U.S. assistance in Afghanistan has focused on post-conflict aid. The agreement amends authorization levels in the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 to align with funding levels in FY04 Supplemental and H.R. 2800. U.S. assistance in Afghanistan focuses on security, governance, and reconstruction, including efforts to establish security institutions, train the Afghan National Army, demobilize militias, and form Provincial Reconstruction Teams. Despite defeats, Taliban groups operate in the southeast, targeting U.S. and Afghan forces, leading to temporary suspensions of international operations. In mid-December 2002, the Defense Department announced the formation of eight \"Provincial Reconstruction Teams\" (PRTs) to create secure conditions for aid workers in Afghanistan. These teams, consisting of U.S. forces, Defense Department civil affairs officers, and allied personnel, aim to provide safe havens for international aid workers, assist with reconstruction, and extend the Kabul government's authority. PRTs have been established in Gardez, Bamiyan, Konduz, and Mazar-e-Sharif, with plans to potentially expand to 16 enclaves led by countries like Germany. The United States is considering increasing the number of Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Afghanistan to 16, with countries like Germany taking a leadership role. The effectiveness of PRTs in improving security is debated. Hamid Karzai was selected as chairman of the interim administration in 2001, and a constitutional loya jirga was expected to establish a permanent governing structure in 2003. The constitutional loya jirga in Afghanistan, expected to create a new governing structure, has been delayed until December 2003. The draft constitution was made public in November 2003, with concerns about the 2004 elections being behind schedule. Efforts to register voters have begun, but there are worries about the power of regional leaders and the effectiveness of the Kabul government. Reconstruction efforts involve various international organizations and donors. The international recovery and reconstruction effort in Afghanistan involves various organizations and donors, aiming for political stability, security, basic services, economic growth, and independence from foreign aid. Quick impact programs have transitioned to long-term projects in education, health, and infrastructure development. According to observers, Afghans are frustrated with the slow progress of reconstruction due to factors like lack of security, capacity, and funding. Enhanced security and progress in reconstruction are essential to sustain donor involvement, attract private investment, and maintain hope for improvement in Afghanistan. Effective reconstruction assistance could help reduce the war and drug economies. To sustain international donor involvement in Afghan reconstruction and encourage private investment, effective reconstruction assistance is crucial. This includes government capacity building, employment generation, and agricultural rehabilitation. Other initiatives involve road construction, urban reconstruction, infrastructure repair, energy development, and programs for women, education, health, and the media. The strength of the central government is seen as vital for success. Efforts are being made to accelerate reconstruction before the 2004 elections to support moderates. Additional funding could also influence decisions by international donors. If progress is made on security, road construction, and reconstruction efforts before the 2004 elections, it could increase the success of moderates. Additional funding may impact decisions by international donors and help expand the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). However, concerns exist about increased corruption, absorption capacity, and effectiveness of allocating additional funds. Failure to achieve progress may render the increase symbolic and ineffective, with the risk of the US being perceived as overly supportive of the Karzai government. The international community continues to provide aid for the reconstruction effort in Afghanistan, with various countries contributing to different aspects such as judicial reform and establishing a national police force. A long-term commitment is seen as necessary for a stable, democratic Afghanistan. The estimated reconstruction costs are over $15 billion for the next decade, with willingness from the international community to assist in the restoration of Afghanistan. The needs assessment in January 2002 estimated reconstruction costs for Afghanistan to be over $15 billion over the next decade. United Nations and Afghan government officials have stated that $15 billion will be needed over 5 years. Concerns have been raised about international donors shifting focus to Iraq reconstruction, potentially impacting Afghan reconstruction efforts. Additionally, a supplemental proposal included funding for various foreign policy initiatives related to the Global War on Terrorism. Congress has considered requests for a foreign policy contingency fund twice this year, but has been reluctant to support it. The FY2003 supplemental bill allocated resources for specific needs in Iraq and coalition partners, rather than creating a Complex Foreign Crises Fund as requested. The FY2004 Foreign Operations appropriation bills do not include funding for a Complex Foreign Crises Fund as requested by the Administration. Instead, the supplemental legislation provides relief aid for Liberia and Sudan. It also extends aid waivers for Pakistan and allocates funds for economic aid to cover debt cancellation. The supplemental legislation includes aid waivers for Pakistan and $200 million in economic aid for debt reduction. Additionally, $100 million in economic aid for Jordan is provided. The bill also addresses emergency supplemental appropriations for Iraq and Afghanistan security and reconstruction. The Senate and House passed emergency supplemental appropriations for Iraq and Afghanistan security and reconstruction for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004. The Senate passed the bill with amendments, which was then incorporated into H.R. 3289. The House also passed the bill with amendments, and the Senate requested a conference to reconcile differences. The House and Senate passed emergency supplemental appropriations for Iraq and Afghanistan security and reconstruction for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2004. The Senate struck all after the enacting clause and substituted the language of S. 1689, passed by unanimous consent. A conference was requested, and conferees were appointed. The conference report was agreed to in both chambers and signed into law by the President on November 6, 2003.

The cost of military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq was assessed by various government agencies and organizations in reports released in 2002 and 2003. These reports analyzed the potential costs of war, reconstruction, and post-war occupation in Iraq. Various reports from government agencies and organizations in 2002 and 2003 analyzed the potential costs of war, reconstruction, and post-war occupation in Iraq. Sources include the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the U.S. Central Command's Operation Iraqi Freedom website. The costs of major U.S. wars and reconstruction efforts are detailed in tables with amounts in millions and billions of dollars. Sources include the Department of Defense Annual Report to Congress and the U.S. Central Command's Operation Iraqi Freedom website. The Department of Defense Annual Report to Congress in January 1993 detailed the costs of major reconstruction efforts, totaling $4.7 billion in current year dollars, or 7.7% of the total cost. Sources included U.S. Agency for International Development, Department of State, and House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Deflators were from the Office of Management and Budget in February 2003. The United States provided economic assistance to Bosnia and Kosovo during the post-conflict \"reconstruction\" phase."
