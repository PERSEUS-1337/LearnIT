    "content": "The 9/11 Commission found that al Qaeda terrorists exploited weaknesses in aviation security, including lax screening, lack of in-flight security measures, and a failure of imagination among policymakers. The 9/11 Commission identified a failure of imagination among senior policymakers and agencies responsible for intelligence, national defense, and aviation security. There was a lack of specific actions taken to defend against possible threats like suicide hijackings before September 11, 2001. Congressional oversight of aviation security was also found to be lacking, with a focus on passenger service rather than terrorism. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress swiftly passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) to address aviation security vulnerabilities. ATSA established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to oversee security in all transportation modes, including measures like federal security screeners at airports, explosive detection screening for checked bags, air marshals on high-risk flights, and reinforced cockpit doors. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) established the TSA to oversee security in all transportation modes, focusing on aviation security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 placed the TSA within the Department of Homeland Security and authorized arming airline pilots. The Vision 100 Act included additional aviation security measures such as an aviation security capital fund for explosive detection systems and arming pilots of all-cargo aircraft. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act established the TSA to oversee aviation security, including arming pilots and implementing explosive detection systems. Despite improvements, vulnerabilities in air cargo operations, general aviation, access controls, screener performance, and potential terrorist attacks using shoulder-fired missiles persist. The 9/11 Commission identified these vulnerabilities and made recommendations for enhancing airport security. The 9/11 Commission made recommendations for airport security improvements, focusing on passenger and baggage screening, and air cargo security. They did not address risks related to inadequate access controls or shoulder-fired missile attacks. The Commission emphasized the need for a multi-layered security system that coordinates different security measures to effectively counter various terrorist tactics. The 9/11 Commission recommended enhancing passenger pre-screening, improving explosives detection on passengers, addressing human factors at screening checkpoints, deploying baggage screening systems, intensifying efforts to screen dangerous cargo, and using hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft to improve aviation security. These recommendations aim to address vulnerabilities in commercial aviation and create redundancies in security measures. The 9/11 Commission recommended enhancing passenger pre-screening by implementing the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) and security-related questions. Over half of the hijackers were identified through these measures, but there were little consequences at the time. The Commission also advised setting transportation security priorities based on risk and implementing cost-effective deterrents. The CAPPS system was initially used for screening individuals who might attempt to bomb a passenger jet. It has since been expanded to screen for possible hijackers as well. CAPPS II, the follow-on system, has faced controversy over data protection and civil liberties concerns. It would authenticate passenger identities using commercial databases and check names against terrorist watch lists for potential boarding denials or secondary screenings. The 9/11 Commission recommended not delaying improvements to passenger pre-screening capabilities. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving passenger pre-screening capabilities by utilizing federal government watchlists. Implementation of CAPPS II was limited to system testing until concerns were addressed, with airlines reluctant to provide data for testing due to liability concerns. The TSA only addressed one of eight concerns regarding CAPPS II implementation according to the GAO in February 2004. Airlines were recommended to be required to supply information for testing and implementing passenger pre-screening. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving passenger pre-screening by utilizing federal watchlists. Airlines' reluctance to provide data for testing CAPPS II has hindered progress. Recent reports suggest CAPPS II has been scrapped over privacy concerns, but a new program may replace it. Congress may intensify oversight of the Secure Flight program and debate the best way to proceed. H.R. 10 proposes TSA take over prescreening from airlines within 180 days and begin testing by November 1, 2004. The 9/11 Commission highlighted al Qaeda's interest in bombing airliners, referencing past incidents like the Philippines Airlines bombing and Richard Reid's attempted shoe bombing. Concerns over improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were raised, including Nathaniel Heatwole sneaking banned items aboard passenger jets. These incidents underscore the need for improved security measures like the Secure Flight program. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving detection of explosives on passengers, including screening all individuals selected for secondary screening. Current screening technologies have limited capabilities, with new technology offering the ability to detect bomb-making chemicals on individuals. Operational tests are ongoing at various transportation settings, including five airport sites. New technology is being tested to detect bomb-making chemicals on individuals in transportation settings, including airports. Methods include body scan imaging and bomb-sniffing dogs. Congress may debate funding for passenger screening initiatives following 9/11 Commission recommendations. The 9/11 Commission recommended implementing and funding passenger screening initiatives, including a human factors study to improve screener performance. The TSA has launched initiatives such as threat image projection (TIP) to assess screener performance and is working on improving recurrent training for screeners. Key human factors issues include screener selection, training, fitness for duty, and human interaction with screening. The TSA is examining ways to improve recurrent training for screeners and address key human factors issues in aviation security. However, research and funding for human factors in aviation security are lacking compared to other sectors. Congress may need to conduct oversight to ensure TSA's research efforts adequately address concerns over passenger and baggage screening performance. Consideration may also be given to tasking independent bodies like the National Academy of Sciences to examine human factors needs in aviation security. Research efforts may not adequately address concerns over passenger and baggage screening performance. Congress may consider tasking the National Academy of Sciences to examine human factors needs in aviation security. H.R. 10 includes a provision for TSA to conduct human factors studies to improve screener performance. The 9/11 Commission recommended expediting installation of baggage screening systems, raising questions about current funding levels. Vision 100 authorizes up to $500 million annually for aviation security, but only $250 million was appropriated in FY2004 and requested in FY2005. The TSA's funding for integrating EDS equipment at airports is limited, with only $250 million appropriated in FY2004 and requested in FY2005 out of a total estimated cost exceeding $4 billion. The use of Letters of Intent (LOIs) to stretch funding over several years has been implemented by reimbursing airports for expenses as they are incurred, potentially slowing down the integration process. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the aviation industry should contribute to the costs of deploying in-line EDS systems, but defining a fair share has been a point of contention. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the aviation industry should pay a fair share of the costs for deploying in-line EDS systems, but defining what constitutes a fair share has been a point of contention. Currently, airlines indirectly contribute to the federal share of EDS integration through security fees, with airports also contributing a smaller portion. The TSA has proposed increasing the local share of costs, which airports oppose. Congress may continue to debate the equity of cost-sharing for EDS. The 9/11 Commission recommended a more equitable contribution from the aviation industry for EDS integration costs. Congress debated the equity of cost-sharing, with proposed legislation seeking to increase aviation security fees and TSA flexibility for screening requirements. The TSA can enter into multi-year contracts with airports or vendors for EDS imaging capabilities. The 9/11 Commission recommended intensifying efforts to identify suspicious cargo and screen dangerous cargo in aviation and maritime operations. The TSA unveiled a strategic plan for cargo security in 2003, focusing on enhancing supply chain security, pre-screening elevated risk cargo, using technology for targeted inspections, and securing all-cargo aircraft. The plan aims to pre-screen all cargo shipments to determine relative risk levels. The TSA's strategic plan for cargo security in 2003 focuses on pre-screening all cargo shipments to determine relative risk levels, using technology for targeted inspections, and securing all-cargo aircraft. The plan aims to work with industry and federal partners to ensure that 100% of elevated risk items are inspected and to deploy new information and technology solutions. The 9/11 Commission recommends accelerating progress towards these objectives and Congress may further scrutinize TSA's efforts on cargo security. Congress may further scrutinize TSA's efforts on cargo security and debate approaches to air cargo security. Recent debate has focused on the level of physical screening needed for cargo on passenger aircraft. While proposals suggest 100% screening, Congress supports a risk-based approach using the known-shipper program. H.R. 10 and S. 2845 aim to improve cargo screening and tracking, with S. 2845 requiring TSA to double air cargo screening within a year. The 9/11 Commission recommended deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft carrying suspicious cargo. The National Research Council estimated that acquiring hardened cargo containers for passenger aircraft would cost $125 million. The industry-wide cost of lost revenue and increased fuel burn would total $11 million annually. Proponents argue that hardened cargo containers provide a redundant layer of defense, similar to hardened cockpit doors, in establishing a multi-layered security system. Opponents may argue that improved cargo identification, tracking, and screening negate the need for hardened containers. The TSA requires all cargo from unvetted shippers to be carried on all-cargo planes, not passenger planes. There are concerns about detecting high-risk cargo and allowing suspect cargo in hardened containers on passenger planes. Congress may debate the deployment of hardened cargo. The debate in Congress revolves around the use of hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft to protect against potential cargo bombings. H.R. 10 proposes a pilot program for blast-resistant containers, while S. 2845 focuses on evaluating blast-resistant cargo container technology. The 9/11 Commission recommends establishing risk-based priorities for protecting all transportation assets. The 9/11 Commission recommended establishing risk-based priorities for protecting all transportation assets, including blast-resistant cargo container technology. A unified strategic plan for aviation security is needed to allocate limited resources effectively. TSA should develop a plan, budget, and funding to implement defenses for transportation assets, assigning roles to federal, state, local authorities, and private stakeholders. The TSA should focus on developing a formal strategy for national aviation security policy, with a risk-based multi-layered approach likely forming the core. Congress may need to task the TSA with creating a national strategy that addresses funding, roles of authorities, and industry stakeholders. A formal strategic planning document for aviation security needs to be developed to address challenges in defining roles and allocating resources for state and local participation and industry involvement. Local jurisdictions are responsible for the physical security of airport sites, while TSA oversees security enforcement and passenger screening. State authorities and local governments play a role in law enforcement support for airport security and presence at screening checkpoints. Passenger air carriers also contribute to security through procedures and training for controlling access to aircraft and airport secured areas. Aviation security involves law enforcement support at airports and screening checkpoints. Passenger air carriers participate in security through procedures and training. In air cargo and general aviation, security relies on aircraft owners and operators. There is a need for a unified plan to assign roles and missions for stakeholders and improve strategic planning and resource allocation for aviation security. In response to the 9/11 Commission recommendation, Congress and the TSA are considering ways to enhance strategic planning, resource allocation, and integration of resources for aviation security. H.R. 10 mandates the Department of Homeland Security to develop and update transportation security plans, including a specific plan for aviation, to prioritize risks, implement cost-effective security measures, and assign responsibilities to various authorities and stakeholders. Congress has been focusing on implementing the recommendations from the 9/11 Commission report, with the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation holding hearings on the matter. The 9/11 Commission report prompted Congress to focus on aviation security recommendations. The 108th Congress passed legislation addressing aviation security, including the Vision 100 Act and the National Intelligence Reform Act. Vision 100 included provisions for a redress process for aviation professionals. Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (P.L. 108-176) enacted on December 12, 2003, established a redress process for aviation professionals facing certification issues. It also required justification for Air Defense Identification Zones, modified security training for airline crews, and mandated a study on aviation security effectiveness by the Department of Homeland Security. Vision 100 mandated a study on aviation security effectiveness by the Department of Homeland Security, including recommendations for improving aviation security and creating the Aviation Security Capital Fund with annual appropriations of up to $500 million. It also granted the Undersecretary for Border and Transportation Security the authority to issue grants for aviation security-related capital improvement projects at airports. Vision 100 mandated the installation of explosive detection systems in airport baggage areas, set federal cost-sharing guidelines, required security programs for air charter operators, and mandated a review of the CAPPS II passenger prescreening system. The TSA has since replaced CAPPS II with the \"Secure Flight\" program. Vision 100 addressed various issues including civil liberties, privacy, data protection, system security, and oversight. The CAPPS II program was replaced by \"Secure Flight.\" The act expanded the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program to include other flight crew members and required security regulations for foreign and domestic aircraft repair stations. Background check requirements for foreign pilots were also modified, transferring the responsibility to the DHS. Flight schools or instructors must provide notification for foreign pilots seeking training in the US. The National Intelligence Reform Act (P.L. 108-458) transferred background check duties for foreign pilots to the DHS and requires notification and identification information for training in smaller aircraft. The legislation also mandates background checks before training in larger aircraft and authorizes fee collections to cover costs. Additionally, the act requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop a National Strategy for Transportation Security and modal-specific security plans, including one for aviation security. The National Intelligence Reform Act transferred background check duties for foreign pilots to DHS and requires notification and identification information for training in smaller aircraft. It also mandates background checks before training in larger aircraft and authorizes fee collections to cover costs. The act requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop a National Strategy for Transportation Security and modal-specific security plans, including one for aviation security. The act also mandates the TSA to issue guidance for biometrics in airport access control systems, establish biometric credential procedures for law enforcement officers carrying firearms on passenger aircraft, and allocate funds for research and development of biometric technologies for aviation security. Additionally, the TSA is required to begin system testing of an advanced passenger prescreening system by January 1, 2005. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates the TSA to begin system testing of an advanced passenger prescreening system by January 1, 2005. It requires the TSA to assume the role of passenger prescreening and checking passenger names against watch lists within 180 days after completing testing. The act also establishes redress procedures for passengers falsely identified, oversight boards, safeguards for system integrity, and prescreening of international flights. Additionally, it requires individuals seeking FAA certificates and unescorted access to airport secure areas to undergo background checks. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates the TSA to conduct prescreening of international flights before departure and screen individuals against terrorist watch lists. It also requires reporting on privacy impacts and criteria for watch list placement, as well as prioritizing airport checkpoint screening technology development. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates the TSA to conduct prescreening of international flights and prioritize airport checkpoint screening technology development. It also requires reporting on watch list criteria, human factors study for screener performance, and training for law enforcement officers on passenger aircraft. The Aviation Security Improvement Act mandates training for law enforcement officers on inflight counterterrorism procedures, fraudulent document identification, and encourages international agreements for air marshal deployment. It also authorizes expedited installation of baggage screening equipment at airports and increases funding for aviation security capital.

It also authorizes expedited installation of baggage screening equipment at airports and increases funding for aviation security capital. Additionally, the act directs the TSA to study wireless communication technologies for cabin crew notifications, requires tamper-resistant pilot licenses with unique identifiers, and mandates TSA to develop staffing standards for airport security. The Aviation Security Improvement Act mandates training for law enforcement officers on in-flight counterterrorism procedures, fraudulent document identification, and encourages international agreements for air marshal deployment. It also authorizes expedited installation of baggage screening equipment at airports and increases funding for aviation security capital. Additionally, the act directs the TSA to study wireless communication technologies for cabin crew notifications, requires tamper-resistant pilot licenses with unique identifiers, and mandates TSA to develop staffing standards for airport security. The DHS is to study the feasibility of integrating operations of the screening workforce and other aviation security-related DHS functions to coordinate activities and increase efficiency. The act authorizes the expenditure of $100 million for research and development of improved explosive detection systems and directs the TSA to develop a plan for implementing these systems. It also prohibits airline passengers from carrying butane lighters and other inappropriate carry-on items. The President is directed to pursue international treaties to limit the availability, transfer, and proliferation of Man-portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADSs) worldwide and to continue pursuing international arrangements for the destruction of excess, obsolete, and illicit MANPADS stockpiles.

The President is directed to pursue international treaties to limit the availability, transfer, and proliferation of Man-portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADSs) worldwide and to continue pursuing international arrangements for the destruction of excess, obsolete, and illicit MANPADS stockpiles. The act further requires the President to report on diplomatic efforts to address MANPADS non-proliferation, requires the Secretary of State to provide annual briefings on these efforts, and mandates the FAA to establish a process for expedited certification of airworthiness and safety for missile defense systems on commercial aircraft. The DHS is also required to provide a report assessing aircraft vulnerability to MANPADS attacks and plans for securing airports and aircraft from this threat, as well as establishing a pilot program to evaluate blast-resistant cargo containers. Additionally, the act authorizes funding for improved air cargo and airport security, as well as research, development, and deployment of technologies for better cargo identification, tracking, and screening. The National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 and the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2005 focus on improving air cargo and airport security. They allocate funds for research, development, and deployment of technologies for better cargo identification, tracking, and screening. The acts establish grant programs to encourage advanced air cargo security technology and require the TSA to issue final rules for cargo security regulations. Additionally, the DHS is directed to report on threats posed by international cargo shipments and assess the potential for establishing secure facilities along international aviation routes. The 108th Congress addressed aviation security concerns through legislation, including air-cargo security provisions and directives to triple cargo inspections on passenger aircraft. However, policy concerns regarding general aviation security and air cargo oversight were not fully addressed. The 9/11 Commission briefly mentioned concerns about general aviation security but did not make formal recommendations. Legislation during the 108th Congress focused on airport security for general aviation operations. During the 108th Congress, legislation on general aviation security focused on airport and airspace restrictions, with some concerns over unnecessary constraints. The legislation was not as comprehensive as other aviation security measures, leading to renewed concerns over the risk posed by corporate jets, private planes, and helicopters. During the 108th Congress, legislation on general aviation security was viewed as less cohesive and comprehensive compared to other aviation security measures. Concerns were raised over the risk posed by corporate jets, private planes, and helicopters, following a joint assessment by the FBI and DHS. Some argue that air cargo security operations and oversight were not adequately addressed, with specific measures from S. 165 (108th Congress) being removed from the final version of the National Intelligence Reform Bill of 2004. The TSA was directed to address these issues through regulatory proposals, but Congress did not formally enact several provisions, leading to potential oversight by the 109th Congress. The 109th Congress may focus on overseeing the TSA's implementation of air cargo security rules and strategic plan to ensure they align with desired objectives."
