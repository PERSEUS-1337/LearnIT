    "content": "Rising Navy ship procurement costs are a concern for Navy officials and Congress. The Congressional Budget Office estimates higher funding levels are needed for the Navy's shipbuilding plan. Congress must decide how to address these rising costs, which could impact Navy capabilities and the shipbuilding industry. Options include increasing funding and changing budgeting methods. Options for addressing rising Navy ship procurement costs include increasing funding, changing budgeting methods, utilizing multiyear procurement, altering acquisition strategies, reducing shipyard fixed overhead costs, improving yard efficiency, building ships without certain equipment, and considering foreign shipyards for construction. Another option is to shift to designs with lower unit procurement costs if other measures are insufficient. The report focuses on reducing Navy ship procurement costs by shifting to designs with lower unit procurement costs. It discusses background information on lower-cost options for attack submarines, aircraft carriers, and surface combatants, as well as potential advantages and disadvantages of this shift. Recent legislative activity related to rising Navy ship procurement costs is also reviewed. Lower-cost ship designs have been proposed in reports by the CBO, DOD's Office of Force Transformation, and the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. Options for lower-cost Navy ship designs can include reducing ship size, shifting from nuclear to conventional propulsion, and using hulls built to commercial-ship survivability standards. These changes can help reduce procurement costs significantly. Shifting from nuclear to conventional propulsion and using commercial-ship survivability standards for hulls can significantly reduce Navy ship procurement costs. Additionally, using a common hull design for multiple ship classes can further decrease costs by avoiding the need to design new hulls for each class. The Navy plans to use a common hull design for its DDG-1000 destroyer and CG(X) cruiser, as well as for other large surface ships. Lower-cost ship options using this approach will be less capable than current designs but can reduce procurement costs significantly. The potential advantages and disadvantages of shifting to lower-cost designs are discussed in the final section of the report. The Navy is currently procuring one Virginia (SSN-774) class nuclear-powered attack submarine per year at a cost of $2.6 billion each. They plan to maintain a fleet of 313 ships, including 48 SSNs. Procuring 35 boats during the period FY2007-FY2022 could support the planned force of 48 boats, while continuing at the current rate could reduce the SSN force to fewer than 30 boats by 2030. The Navy plans to maintain a fleet of 48 SSNs, with the current procurement rate of one Virginia-class submarine per year. Procuring 35 boats from FY2007-FY2022 could support this force, while continuing at the same rate could reduce the SSN force to fewer than 30 boats by 2030. Options for lower-cost attack submarines include non-nuclear-powered submarines with air-independent propulsion systems or reduced-cost SSNs using new technologies. The Navy's future fleet may include AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines. The Navy's future fleet may include air-independent propulsion (AIP)-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines, which could be procured alongside Virginia-class boats. The OFT report suggested substituting four AIP submarines for one Virginia-class submarine in each carrier strike group, potentially costing $600 million to $750 million each. These AIP submarines are being acquired by foreign navies and could offer extended submerged endurance. The U.S. Navy is considering the procurement of AIP submarines alongside Virginia-class boats, with an estimated cost of $600 million to $750 million each. New technologies may allow for the design of a less expensive SSN equivalent to the Virginia class. The Navy and DARPA are working on developing these technologies under the Tango Bravo program. Under the Tango Bravo program, the Navy and DARPA are developing technologies to enable design options for a reduced-size submarine with equivalent capability as the Virginia Class. The focus is on reducing platform infrastructure and costs, with key objectives including shaftless propulsion, external weapons, conformal alternatives to existing arrays, simplified submarine systems, and automation to reduce crew workload. If successful, these technologies could lead to the design of a new, less expensive SSN. The Navy and industry officials are considering the development of a new submarine, referred to as \"Tango Bravo,\" with capabilities similar to the Virginia class but at a lower procurement cost. This alternative option involves starting design work on the Tango Bravo submarine now, with the possibility of ending Virginia-class procurement once the new submarine is ready for procurement. The goal is to design a submarine that can be procured at a rate of two per year within available resources. The Navy is considering developing a new submarine called \"Tango Bravo\" to replace the Virginia class. Design work on the Tango Bravo submarine could lead to procurement in a few years. The Navy currently builds large nuclear-powered aircraft carriers with a full load displacement of about 100,000 tons. The George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) was procured in FY2001 at a cost of $4.975 billion, which has since risen to about $6.1 billion. The George H.W. Bush (CVN-77) was procured in FY2001 at a cost of $4.975 billion, which has since risen to about $6.1 billion. The next aircraft carrier, CVN-78, is planned for procurement in FY2008 at an estimated cost of $10.5 billion. CVN-78 is the lead ship of the new CVN-21 class and is scheduled to enter service in 2015. CVN-79 is planned for procurement in FY2012 and CVN-80 in FY2016. The Navy plans to procure a medium-sized, conventionally powered aircraft carrier based on the LHA(R) design or a commercial-like hull design. Another option is a small, high-speed aircraft carrier on a surface effect ship hull design. The CSBA report recommends maintaining a force of 10 large carriers and procuring four medium-sized carriers based on the LHA(R) design. These carriers could cost around $3 billion each and carry a VSTOL version of the F-35 JSF. The Navy plans to procure a medium-sized, conventionally powered aircraft carrier based on the LHA(R) design or a commercial-like hull design. The ship might displace about 40,000 tons and embark an air wing of two dozen VSTOL F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. The unit procurement cost could be roughly $3 billion. Another recommendation is a larger carrier with a full load displacement of 57,000 tons, carrying 30 JSFs, 6 MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, and 15 UAVs. This carrier would be larger than the LHA(R)-based carrier and similar in size to the UK's new aircraft carrier design. The OFT report suggests substituting two of these carriers for each of the Navy's current large carriers to maintain the same number of manned aircraft at sea. The OFT report recommended substituting two 57,000-ton carriers for each of the Navy's current large carriers to maintain the same number of manned aircraft at sea. An alternative suggestion was a smaller, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons with a surface effect ship (SES)/catamaran hull, capable of carrying 10 manned aircraft, 8 UAVs, and with a maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots. This proposed carrier would be larger than Thailand's 11,500-ton carrier but smaller than Spain's 17,000-ton carrier or the UK's existing 20,600-ton carriers. The OFT report recommended a smaller, high-speed carrier displacing 13,500 tons with a surface effect ship (SES)/catamaran hull, capable of carrying 10 manned aircraft, 8 UAVs, and with a maximum speed of 50 to 60 knots. This proposed carrier would be larger than Thailand's 11,500-ton carrier but smaller than Spain's 17,000-ton carrier or the UK's existing 20,600-ton carriers. Studies have discussed other potential designs including a large conventionally powered carrier displacing about 100,000 tons and a medium-sized nuclear-powered carrier. A medium-sized nuclear-powered carrier based on the LHA(R) hull design might cost more than $3 billion and displace about 40,000 tons. It could embark two dozen VSTOL JSFs and use a half-sized version of the CVN-78 nuclear propulsion plant. This carrier would be similar to France's Charles de Gaulle, which displaces 42,000 tons and carries an air wing of 34 CTOL airplanes and two helicopters. Additionally, a conceptual design for a very small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of about 4,000 tons and a maximum speed of 60 knots was developed by the Naval War College in 2000. The Naval War College developed a conceptual design for a very small, high-speed VSTOL carrier with a displacement of about 4,000 tons, a maximum speed of 60 knots, and an embarked air wing of seven VSTOL JSFs and two helicopters. Different ship sizes and propulsion types create a matrix of aircraft carrier options, including large nuclear-powered carriers and potential alternatives. Small carriers would likely be limited to VSTOL aircraft, while medium-sized carriers could operate either VSTOL or CTOL aircraft. Small nuclear-powered carriers and conventionally powered carriers with commercial-like hulls are also possible. The Navy has procured nine nuclear-powered cruisers between FY1957 and FY1975. Current design plans include the 14,500-ton DDG-1000 destroyer/CG(X) cruiser, with potential lower-cost options such as an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer (SCD) and a 6,000-ton frigate (FFG(X)). The Navy also plans to procure DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers starting in FY2011. The Navy plans to procure DDG-1000 destroyers and CG(X) cruisers, with the DDG-1000 being larger and more expensive. The first two DDG-1000s will be funded in FY2007, with a full-load displacement of 14,500 tons. The estimated cost for the first two ships is $3.3 billion each, with potential higher costs according to the Congressional Budget Office and CAIG. Originally, the Navy planned to procure 16 to 24 DDG-1000s. The Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Cost Analysis Improvement Group believe that DDG-1000 procurement costs may be higher than Navy estimates. The Navy plans to procure a total of 7 DDG-1000s as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet, which also includes 19 CG(X)s. Options for a reduced-cost surface combatant include an 11,000-ton cruiser-destroyer, a 6,000-ton frigate, and a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship hull design. Another option is a new-design ship of about 11,000 tons, which would be 25% smaller than the current DDG-1000 design. A new-design ship of about 11,000 tons, known as the smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD), could be a lower-cost surface combatant intended to replace the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs. It would incorporate advanced technologies, have a reduced crew size for lower operation costs, and carry a payload smaller than the DDG-1000 or CG(X) but larger than current Aegis cruisers or destroyers. A smaller cruiser-destroyer (SCD) ship, around 11,000 tons, is proposed as a cost-effective replacement for the DDG-1000 and CG(X) programs. It would have advanced technologies, reduced crew size, and a payload size between current Aegis cruisers/destroyers and the DDG-1000. Another option is a smaller, less expensive frigate known as the FFG(X), estimated to displace 6,000 tons with a unit cost of $800 million. This frigate may not be equipped with the Advanced Gun Systems (AGS) like the DDG-1000 but could perform non-gunfire missions. A 6,000-ton FFG(X) could serve as a replacement for the Navy's FFG-7 class frigates and DD-963 class destroyers, offering a middle ground in size. It may not have the AGS capability of the DDG-1000 but could handle non-gunfire missions. Another option is a lower-cost gunfire support ship based on the LPD-17 amphibious ship, potentially equipped with one or two AGSs on a modified hull design. The CBO estimates that an initial AGS-armed LPD-17 might cost about $1.9 billion, with subsequent ships costing about $1.5 billion each. The Navy plans to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) as part of its proposed 313-ship fleet, with each LCS sea frame costing no more than $220 million. The Navy plans to procure 55 Littoral Combat Ships (LCSs) with a procurement cost of $220 million each. The total acquisition cost for 55 ships is estimated to be about $22.1 billion. An alternative proposal suggests procuring a 1,000-ton surface combatant with similar capabilities to the LCS. Another option is a 100-ton surface combatant with a higher speed and modular mission packages. The OFT report recommended procuring a 100-ton surface combatant with a maximum speed of 60 knots and standard interfaces for accepting various modular mission packages. These ships would be transported to the theater by a \"mother ship\" based on the same 57,000-ton commercial-like hull used for OFT's proposed medium-sized aircraft carrier. The potential lower-cost ship designs outlined above can be assessed in terms of cost, capability, technical risk, homeporting arrangements, and potential impact on the shipbuilding industrial base. Assessment of cost implications for different ship design options includes development, design, procurement, life-cycle operation, and disposal costs. Developing a large Navy ship can cost billions, so switching to a lower-cost design may save money in the long run if procured in large numbers. Stopping an existing ship program early could lead to cost savings if a lower-cost alternative reaches the break-even point sooner. Utilizing similar technologies can also reduce costs. If a lower-cost ship design can utilize existing technologies or technologies from other ships, development costs could be significantly reduced. As shipyard workers become more familiar with a design, the labor hours required to build a ship decrease through the learning curve process. Building more ships to a design can lower production costs. The break-even point for a lower-cost design may be further into the production run if the currently planned design has already entered production. Additionally, procuring the lower-cost design at a higher annual rate can lead to cost savings. The lower-cost ship design can benefit from greater spreading of annual fixed overhead costs and move down the learning curve more quickly, resulting in cost-reducing benefits. Navy ships have high operating and support costs, with life-cycle O&S costs sometimes exceeding procurement costs. Reducing O&S costs may involve design features that increase procurement costs. Reducing a ship's life-cycle O&S costs can involve design features that increase procurement costs. Personnel costs and maintenance costs are major components of ship O&S costs. Reducing crew size may require adding technology for automation, while reducing maintenance costs may involve using more durable materials or increasing the size of certain spaces on the ship. Alternative ship designs may have lower procurement costs due to these considerations. Alternative ship designs may have lower procurement costs by incorporating features that increase life-cycle O&S costs. For nuclear-powered ships, the procurement cost includes the cost of the fuel core, which can be significant. In 2004, the fuel core for a nuclear-powered attack submarine cost about $158 million and is designed to last for the ship's entire 33-year expected life. Similarly, for a nuclear-powered carrier, the core cost about $300 million and is designed to last for half of its 50-year expected life. The cost of a nuclear-powered submarine or carrier is higher during procurement compared to conventionally powered ones. However, the nuclear-powered vessels do not incur fuel-related costs over their lifetime, unlike conventionally powered ones. This difference in accounting for fuel costs results in a smaller overall cost difference between nuclear-powered and conventionally powered vessels when considering procurement and life-cycle O&S costs. The cost-effectiveness of nuclear power for ships is influenced by the price of oil. Higher oil costs make nuclear power more competitive due to lower fuel expenses over the ship's lifetime. However, nuclear-powered ships have higher end-of-life disposal costs compared to conventionally powered ships. The cost of defueling and transporting nuclear-powered ships to storage can range from $30 million to $570 million. Lower-cost ship designs may have reduced capabilities, except for the Tango Bravo SSN which could match the Virginia-class design. Ship size affects payload, detectability, survivability, mobility, and operational value. As Navy combat ships decrease in size, their total payload also decreases, impacting their capabilities. Factors like ship design and propulsion play a role in this decrease, making smaller ships proportionately less capable than larger ones. For example, a smaller aircraft carrier can carry significantly fewer aircraft compared to a larger carrier of double the size. A smaller carrier may have a reduced air wing capacity compared to a larger carrier, impacting its ability to generate as many sorties per day. Additionally, decreasing ship size can limit the equipment and systems that can be installed, such as CTOL aircraft or large radars. The total cost of putting combat-related equipment to sea can increase as ship size decreases, as payload decreases more rapidly than ship size. This can lead to higher total procurement costs for a fleet design with smaller ships. However, new technologies may allow for greater payload fractions on smaller surface combatants. Additionally, advancements in precision-guidance technology are reducing weapon size. Advancements in technology allow for greater payload fractions on smaller surface combatants. Improvements in precision-guidance technology are reducing weapon size, enabling smaller warheads to do the same damage as larger ones. Supporters of larger ships argue that careful design can make them no more detectable than smaller ships, and they are better equipped to withstand hits from weapons. Supporters of larger ships argue that they are better equipped to withstand hits from weapons due to their size and military survivability standards. On the other hand, supporters of smaller ships believe that larger ships are more costly to make less detectable and that a fleet of small ships can overwhelm the enemy with a large number of targets. They also argue that even large ships can be sunk or put out of operation, concentrating too much capability in each individual platform. Supporters of smaller ships argue that fleet survivability is more important than individual-ship survivability, and a larger number of smaller ships can provide superior overall fleet survivability. They also suggest that using expensive, highly capable Navy ships in high-threat situations may be avoided to prevent heavy damage or sinking, reducing their effectiveness. Additionally, equipping a submarine with a nuclear propulsion plant changes its mobility and operational capabilities significantly. Equipping a submarine with a nuclear propulsion plant fundamentally changes its mobility and operational capabilities, creating a true submarine. A non-nuclear-powered submarine can extend its stationary or low-speed submerged endurance with an AIP system, but it does not significantly increase high-speed submerged endurance. An AIP system does not significantly increase the high-speed submerged endurance of a non-nuclear-powered submarine. Non-nuclear-powered submarines, even with AIP systems, have limited submerged endurance due to battery capacity, unlike nuclear-powered submarines that can stay submerged for weeks or months. Non-nuclear-powered submarines are not well-suited for long, stealthy transits or extended submerged periods at high speeds. The OFT report suggests transporting AIP submarines to the theater of operations on a transport ship, potentially revealing their presence. In contrast, an SSN in a carrier strike group can be detached and redirected to another theater without alerting others, allowing for military effects in multiple theaters simultaneously. The effectiveness of an AIP submarine in a carrier strike group would depend on its daily operations and ability to perform in conflict situations. Nuclear-powered carriers have the advantage of high-speed transits without the need for refueling, allowing for immediate combat operations upon arrival. Advocates of higher-speed ships argue that their increased capability allows for rapid location shifts and makes them harder to track. However, skeptics question the benefits of speeds exceeding 30 knots. Advocates of a larger fleet argue that more ships would enable better global presence or operational flexibility. Advocates argue that a larger fleet with more ships would enhance global presence, operational flexibility, and overall capability through network-centric warfare principles. This approach could allow for a more cost-effective response to various situations by deploying the appropriate naval force without incurring high daily operating costs. Increasing the number of ship nodes will increase the total capability of the force. Advocates argue for a shift to less concentrated and more distributed force designs, while defenders of a smaller fleet of more expensive ships emphasize the importance of ship capability over quantity. They highlight the Navy's efforts to increase deployed fleet fractions and argue that current ship designs offer flexibility for various situations. Advocates argue for creating naval formations with appropriate capability for various situations, even with a smaller number of more-expensive ships. Lower-cost options with technical risks for the Navy include AIP-equipped non-nuclear-powered submarines, Tango Bravo nuclear-powered submarines, 13,500-ton high-speed carriers, and smaller surface combatants. Smaller ships offer more homeporting possibilities due to size constraints in certain ports. Homeporting nuclear-powered ships can be more complex due to unique requirements, such as access to a nuclear-certified maintenance shop. Forward-homeporting in foreign countries can be politically challenging, especially if there are anti-nuclear sentiments. Lower-cost ship designs could impact the shipbuilding industrial base by changing the total volume of Navy shipbuilding work. The impact of shifting to lower-cost ship designs on Navy shipbuilding work depends on the total funding available for Navy ship procurement. Three scenarios are possible: no change in funding leads to no substantial change in shipbuilding work, reducing costs for the same number of ships reduces the volume of work, and increased cost-effectiveness could increase funding and work volume. The lower-cost ship designs in the report could impact the distribution of shipbuilding work among various shipyards, including General Dynamics' Electric Boat and Northrop Grumman Newport News. This could lead to a different division of work compared to current projects like the Virginia-class submarines. Additionally, non-nuclear powered submarines could be built by either of these shipyards or by non-nuclear shipyards like Ingalls shipyard at Pascagoula, MS. Non-nuclear powered submarines could be designed and built by GD/EB or NGNN, or by non-nuclear shipyards like Ingalls at Pascagoula, MS. AIP submarines could reduce work for U.S. naval nuclear propulsion manufacturers. NGNN is the only U.S. yard for large nuclear-powered carriers. Medium-sized conventionally powered carriers could be built by NGNN, Ingalls, or other shipyards with relevant experience. A medium-sized, conventionally powered carrier based on a merchant-like hull could be built by NGNN, Ingalls, or other shipyards with experience in building such hulls. A small, high-speed carrier using an SES/catamaran hull design might be constructed at yards familiar with building SES/catamaran hulls. The procurement of conventionally powered carriers instead of nuclear-powered ones could impact the workload of U.S. naval nuclear propulsion component manufacturers. DDG-1000 destroyers are to be built at NGSS and General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works. A carrier nuclear propulsion plant is equivalent to five submarine nuclear propulsion plants. DDG-1000 destroyers to be built at NGSS and General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works. SCD and FFG(X) likely built at the same yards or other yards. LCS versions to be built at different shipyards. Sections 122, 123, and 124 of H.R. 5122 would limit procurement costs of certain class ships. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 5122 highlights concerns about rising costs and production schedules of major defense acquisition programs, leading to fewer platforms being fielded. This could result in an over-reliance on expensive \"mega\" systems, creating a \"high demand, low density\" situation. The committee suggests focusing on developing smaller, more capable systems to address these challenges. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 5122 raises concerns about rising costs and development time leading to fewer platforms being purchased, creating a \"high demand, low density\" situation. The report applauds the Navy's shipbuilding plan but expresses concerns about unrealistic assumptions and affordability of the plan. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 5122 raises concerns about the affordability of the Navy's ship construction plan, which requires a significant increase in shipbuilding funds. The committee is worried about the unrealistic assumptions and cost growth in ship acquisition programs, creating uncertainty about the future of naval shipbuilding. The House Armed Services Committee report on H.R. 5122 expresses concerns about the Navy's ship construction plan's affordability and cost estimates. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to report on managing the shipbuilding/ship repair industrial base capacity to make Navy shipbuilding more affordable. The report highlights issues with the process used for establishing the Navy's ship cost estimates, noting inaccuracies and exclusions of certain known shipbuilding costs. The committee recommends revising the process for deriving ship cost estimates to ensure all major known elements are included. Sections 122, 123, and 124 of the bill impose cost limitations on three current ship classes based on the Navy's latest cost estimates. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to revalidate cost estimates for CVN-21, LHA Replacement program ships, and San Antonio class amphibious ships. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to revalidate cost estimates for CVN-21, LHA Replacement program ships, and San Antonio class amphibious ships. The report also states concerns about the affordability of the DDG-1000 program due to budget constraints and reduced ship numbers. The Navy reduced the number of next-generation destroyers from 32 to 7 due to budget constraints. The committee doubts that the original requirements for the destroyer can be met and suggests procuring a smaller, more affordable version in greater numbers. They support building up to two DD(X) ships to showcase future technologies. The report also addresses concerns about the affordability of various Navy shipbuilding programs. The committee supports reducing costs in naval ship construction through the maritime technology program. They encourage expanding efforts to all ship procurements and creating a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program. Incentive clauses have been successful in lowering construction costs in specific programs like the Virginia class submarine and CVN-21. The committee supports reducing costs in naval ship construction through the maritime technology program and encourages expanding efforts to all ship procurements. They have created a shipbuilding industrial base improvement program to award grants and loan guarantees to qualified shipyards for productivity and cost effectiveness improvements. This will help lower the cost of Navy ship procurement and improve competitiveness of U.S. shipyards. The committee recommends funding for the shipbuilding industrial base improvement program and enhancing the U.S. shipbuilding and ship repair industrial base. They also recommend $120.0 million for the maritime technology program. The committee recommends $20.0 million in PE 78730N for the national shipbuilding research program to enhance the efficiency of the U.S. shipbuilding industry. They also emphasize the importance of sustaining viable shipbuilding and ship repair industries in the United States. The committee recommends $50.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement grants to support U.S. shipyards in developing innovative technologies and infrastructure for naval vessel construction. They also recommend providing loan guarantees to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the shipbuilding and ship repair industries. The committee recommends $50.0 million in PE 78730N for shipbuilding industrial base improvement loan guarantees in the United States, to enhance efficiency and competitiveness. Section 121 of S. 2766 authorizes incremental funding for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers, while Section 123 increases the cost limit on CVN-77. The Senate Armed Services Committee emphasizes the need for stable ship requirements and increased funding to address the low rate of shipbuilding driving higher costs. The committee recommends increased funding and stable ship requirements to address the low rate of shipbuilding driving higher costs. Concerns were raised about cost growth on the CVN-77 program, with recommendations for improving affordability and achieving savings through a stable procurement plan. An increase of $50.0 million in SCN for CVN-21 class advance procurement is recommended, along with a review of economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for the CVN-21 class. The committee recommends an increase of $50.0 million in SCN for CVN-21 class advance procurement, directing the Secretary of the Navy to review economic order quantity and long lead time material procurement for the CVN-21 class. A report is to be submitted outlining advance procurement requirements for potential savings and escalation avoidance. None of the funds for CVN-79 and CVN-80 advance procurement are available for obligation prior to 30 days following receipt of the report. The procurement cost for CVN-77 has increased to $6.057 billion due to escalation impacts, increased labor hours, overhead rates, and schedule delays. The committee is concerned about the cost growth of CVN-77, which is projected to exceed the contract ceiling by over 30%. Despite management actions taken by the Navy to contain costs, including deferral of upgrades and implementation of cost-saving programs, the cost is still expected to increase due to various factors such as escalation impacts, increased labor hours, and schedule delays. The Navy's long-range plan for ship construction aims to improve performance through similar management actions. The Secretary's report to Congress on the long-range plan for construction of naval vessels establishes cost estimates for future ship construction, targeting improved performance through management actions similar to those for controlling CVN-77 costs. Improved visibility into completion cost performance is necessary to assess the effectiveness of these actions and determine further steps to enhance affordability. The Secretary of the Navy is directed to provide quarterly reports to congressional defense committees starting December 1, 2006, detailing information on the CVN-77 ship construction contract. Additionally, the construction of lead LCS vessels at two shipyards inherently adds cost. The report highlights cost risks in the construction of lead LCS vessels at two shipyards until completion in 2007 and 2008. Emphasis on cost control suggests pursuing competition and commonality in procurement. The committee supports the Navy's approach to rapidly field LCS for the global war on terror but expresses concerns about affordability due to apparent cost growth and rapid procurement ramp-up. The committee is concerned about the affordability appeal of the LCS program being overshadowed by cost growth and rapid procurement. They request a report from the Secretary of the Navy outlining the acquisition strategy, competition plan, and cost containment strategy for the program by December 1, 2006. The committee requests a report from the Secretary of the Navy outlining the acquisition strategy, competition plan, and cost containment strategy for the LCS program. The report highlights the importance of the National Shipbuilding Research Program-Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise in reducing shipyard costs and improving affordability in naval warship construction. The committee recommends an increase of $10.0 million for the program. The committee supports the NSRP-ASE for improving naval warship construction affordability and recommends a $10.0 million increase in funding. This includes developing a skilled workforce, creating a national supply chain, exploring new markets for shipbuilders, and enhancing computer interoperability. Additionally, H.R. 5122 authorizes incremental funding for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers and establishes unit procurement cost caps. Section 121 of H.R. 5122 authorizes incremental funding for CVN-21 class aircraft carriers CVN-78, CVN-79, and CVN-80. Section 122 establishes unit procurement cost caps for CVN-21 class carriers, with adjustments allowed for inflation. Section 123 increases a procurement cost cap for CVN-77. Section 125 sets a cost cap for LHA(R) amphibious assault ships, while Section 126 does the same for LPD-17 class amphibious ships. Additionally, Section 215 allocates $4 million for Navy shipbuilding technology proposals. Section 1016 mandates an assessment of naval vessel construction efficiencies and contractor incentives. The report addresses the amendment for Section 122, stating that the Secretary cannot adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions impacting the shipbuilding program. However, the Secretary must assess any negative impact of such actions on program costs in the annual notice to congressional defense committees. The amendment allows for adjustments to cost limitations for non-recurring design and engineering to reduce risks in completing the CVN-21 class aircraft carriers. The amendment allows for adjustments to cost limitations for non-recurring design and engineering in order to reduce risks in completing the CVN-21 class aircraft carriers. The Navy is expected to manage program execution within budget estimates, with potential trade-offs that could impact system performance, safety, crew quality of life, and other important factors. The Secretary must notify congressional committees before implementing any cost-driven reductions that could impact safety or program requirements. The Secretary must notify congressional committees before implementing any cost-driven reductions that could impact safety, crew quality of life, or program requirements. The amendment does not allow the Secretary to adjust limitation amounts for cost increases due to congressional actions affecting the shipbuilding program. The Navy's budget for the LHA-6 represents a risk-balanced assessment for completing the future LHA Replacement ship. The conferees recognize uncertainties in completing LHA-6 design and construction, allowing adjustments to cost limitations for non-recurring design and engineering to reduce risks. Compliance may require trade-offs in procurement costs impacting system performance, crew quality of life, and other factors in the LHA Replacement ship's design and construction. The conferees acknowledge uncertainties in completing LHA-6 design and construction, allowing adjustments to cost limitations for non-recurring design and engineering to reduce risks. Trade-offs in procurement costs may impact system performance, crew quality of life, and other factors in the LHA Replacement ship's design and construction. The Secretary must notify Congress before implementing any cost-driven reduction that could affect safety or crew quality of life. The House Appropriations Committee emphasizes the importance of cost control in Navy shipbuilding plans. The Committee emphasizes the importance of cost control in Navy shipbuilding plans and recommends setting firm cost targets, developing initiatives for cost control, and signing contracts to reduce cost growth. The report also recommends reducing Navy's procurement funding by $141.4 million to cover cost growth on ships procured in prior years. The Committee remains concerned about the lack of cost control in Navy shipbuilding programs and urges the Navy to address cost growth issues. The Committee is concerned about rising cost growth in Navy shipbuilding programs, particularly in ongoing ship construction contracts. The Navy's plan to address these issues was submitted late and mainly highlighted cost overruns over the past two decades. Despite public statements about the need for cost controls, programs like the CVN-77 aircraft carrier and Virginia class attack submarines continue to exceed cost estimates. The Navy estimates an $867.9 million overrun in the CVN-77 production effort over the next 3 years, requiring Congressional legislation to raise the cost cap. Additionally, the fiscal year 2007 budget requests $136 million for cost growth in the U.S.S. Texas (SSN-775), while cost performance on the U.S.S. North Carolina (SSN-777) is below Navy expectations. The Committee is concerned about rising cost growth in Navy shipbuilding programs, particularly in ongoing ship construction contracts. The fiscal year 2007 budget requests $136 million for cost growth in the U.S.S. Texas (SSN-775), and cost performance on the U.S.S. North Carolina (SSN-777) is below Navy expectations. The Committee recommendation provides $436,449,000 for Completion of Prior Year Shipbuilding Programs, with reductions allocated to various programs. One option for addressing rising Navy ship procurement costs could involve reducing planned ship procurement rates or shifting to lower-cost ship designs. The Navy is facing rising cost growth in shipbuilding programs, with the U.S.S. Texas (SSN-775) and U.S.S. North Carolina (SSN-777) experiencing cost overruns. One option to address this is to increase annual ship-procurement funding, but this may require reducing funding for other priorities. Another option is to modify the way new Navy ships are funded in the budget. The Navy is facing rising cost growth in shipbuilding programs, with cost overruns on the U.S.S. Texas and U.S.S. North Carolina. One option is to increase annual ship-procurement funding, but this may require reducing funding for other priorities. Another option is to modify the funding of new Navy ships by using incremental funding, advance appropriations, or multiyear procurement methods. These changes could potentially increase the number of ships procured but may also pose challenges related to Congress's oversight and flexibility in adjusting procurement plans. The Navy is considering changing the acquisition strategy for building certain ships to reduce costs, such as having all DDG-1000 destroyers built by a single yard. However, this could limit competition and innovation in design, quality, and cost control. The Navy is considering changing the acquisition strategy for building certain ships to reduce costs, potentially by having all DDG-1000 destroyers built by a single yard. This could limit competition and innovation in design, quality, and cost control. Another potential change could involve making greater use of competition in Navy ship acquisition, similar to practices in the 1980s. This would involve using competition between shipyards in awarding contracts for building follow-on ships in each class.

Options to reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs include eliminating excess capacity or increasing other types of work to absorb overhead costs. The Navy is exploring ways to reduce shipyard fixed overhead costs, such as building ships for other government agencies or commercial purposes, improving operating efficiency, and considering building Navy ships without some planned equipment to cut costs. The National Shipbuilding Research Program (NSRP) Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (ASE) aims to enhance design and production processes. Building Navy ships without some planned equipment could reduce capabilities, with the option to add equipment later at a higher cost. Another option is to build ships in foreign shipyards to lower construction costs. The option to build Navy ships in foreign shipyards may be considered to lower construction costs, but 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7309 prohibits the construction of vessels for the armed forces in foreign shipyards, except for certain exceptions authorized by the President in the national security interest. The RAND Corporation report discusses the increased cost of Navy ships today compared to decades ago and suggests ways to reduce these costs. The report also highlights the restrictions on using funds for Navy shipbuilding in foreign facilities and shipyards."
