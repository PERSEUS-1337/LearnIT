    "content": "The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" may be cited as the short title. It includes a requirement for cellulosic biofuel. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the provision of estimates for cellulosic biofuel production volumes. The Administrator of the Energy Information Administration is responsible for determining these estimates for the following calendar year. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates estimates for cellulosic biofuel production volumes by the Energy Information Administration Administrator for the upcoming calendar year. For each cellulosic biofuel production facility producing during January 1 to October 31 of the current calendar year, specific requirements apply. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" requires the Energy Information Administration Administrator to determine the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by each facility based on actual production during a specific period. The \"Phantom Fuel Reform Act\" mandates the Energy Information Administration Administrator to determine the estimated annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for each facility based on actual production, and for facilities starting production after January 1 of the current year. The Energy Information Administration Administrator determines the average monthly volume of cellulosic biofuel produced by a facility based on actual production from initial production to October 31 of the current year. The Energy Information Administration Administrator determines the estimated annualized volume of cellulosic biofuel production for a facility based on the average monthly production from initial production to October 31 of the current year. The Energy Information Administration Administrator determines the estimated annual volume of cellulosic biofuel production for a facility based on monthly production up to October 31 of the current year. This estimation is used to calculate the total production of cellulosic biofuel for all facilities in the following calendar year. Amendments to the Clean Air Act specify the exact method for determining applicable volume reductions. Amendments to the Clean Air Act define cellulosic biofuel and exclude certain types of fuels like compressed natural gas and electricity from biogas produced from specific sources. The Clean Air Act amendments define cellulosic biofuel and exclude certain fuels from biogas produced from specific sources like landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, agricultural digesters, and municipal solid waste digesters. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency's final rule on fuel pathways is affected by these amendments. The Clean Air Act amendments impact the renewable fuel standard under section 211(o) and require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to reissue a rule to conform to the amendments. Additionally, the cellulosic biofuel mandate is revised to remove the applicable volume of cellulosic biofuel for calendar year 2014."
