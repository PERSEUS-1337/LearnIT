The temporary credit for home purchases allows individuals to claim a credit for a qualified principal residence purchase. The credit is 10% of the purchase price or $7,500 ($9,000 in high-cost areas) divided over two taxable years. Limitations apply to purchases made after the enactment date but before 12 months after. The tax credit for home purchases is limited based on the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income.

This limitation applies to taxable years where section 26(a)(2) does not apply. The tax credit for home purchases is limited based on the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income. If a credit is allowed for the purchase of a qualified principal residence, no credit shall be allowed for the purchase of any other qualified principal residence in the same taxable year. Additionally, if a qualified principal residence is purchased jointly, no credit shall be allowed if any individual has already claimed the credit in a previous taxable year. No credit is allowed under this section if it has been claimed for the purchase of another qualified principal residence in the same taxable year or if a credit has been claimed in a previous year by any individual involved in a joint purchase. The term 'qualified principal residence' refers to a residence purchased to be the purchaser's main residence, with no double benefit allowed for purchases eligible for credit under another section. If the qualified principal residence is disposed of or not occupied as the principal residence, recapture of the credit may be required. If a taxpayer disposes of or fails to occupy their qualified principal residence within 24 months of purchase, the remaining portion of the credit allowed will be disallowed. Special rules apply for joint purchases, with adjustments for married individuals filing separately and unmarried individuals. The tax credit for purchasing a qualified principal residence can be allocated among unmarried individuals, not exceeding $7,000 in total. Rules similar to those for purchase and reporting requirements apply, and the basis of the residence is adjusted if the credit is allowed. The basis of a residence is reduced by the amount of the credit allowed under this section.
