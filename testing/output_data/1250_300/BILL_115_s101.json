The Act defines key terms such as \"Federal land\" as the 206 acres within the Refuge, \"non-Federal land\" as the State-owned 43,093 acres, \"Refuge\" as Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, \"road corridor\" as designated under section 4(b)(1), \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, \"State\" as the State of Alaska, and \"Wilderness\" as the Izembek Wilderness designated by section 702(6) of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. The Act requires a land exchange. The Act mandates a land exchange where the State conveys non-Federal land to the Secretary in exchange for Federal land. The Federal land will be used for a road corridor and construction of a gravel road, with valuation and appraisals ensuring equal exchange. The Act mandates a land exchange where the State conveys non-Federal land to the Secretary in exchange for Federal land. Appraisals of the land will be conducted according to national standards, and if the value of the Federal land exceeds the non-Federal land, equalization will be required. In a land exchange, if the appraised value of non-Federal land exceeds that of Federal land, equalization can be achieved by conveying additional non-Federal land, making a cash payment, or a combination of both methods. If there is a surplus of non-Federal land, the State can adjust the acreage to be conveyed. The State can adjust the acreage of non-Federal land to equalize its value with Federal land in a land exchange. The Secretary may accept a payment exceeding 25% of the Federal land value. After the exchange, the Wilderness boundary will be modified to exclude Federal land and the non-Federal land will be added to the Wilderness and administered according to relevant laws. The land exchange must be completed within 180 days of enactment. The road corridor will follow the southern road alignment described in the final environmental impact statement. Requirements for the road, including usage, barrier cables, and dimensions, will apply. The land exchange and road construction under this Act will not be considered a major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act."
