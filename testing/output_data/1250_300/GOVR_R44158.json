    "content": "Irrigation has been crucial for the development and economy of the United States, especially in the settlement of the West and agricultural recovery after the Dust Bowl. Technological advancements have revolutionized modern irrigated agriculture, but come with costs such as infrastructure, federal programs, and potential impacts on water users and the environment. Irrigation water use is measured through withdrawals and consumption, with withdrawals indicating water applied to lands and consumption referring to water taken in by plants or evaporated without returning to water sources. Irrigation withdrawals in the United States have decreased by 23% since 1980, with a 9% drop from 2005 to 2010. However, it is uncertain if this decline in withdrawals has led to a decrease in water consumption. Changes in irrigated land vary by region, with only four western states seeing an increase since 2003, while several eastern states have significantly increased irrigated acres. Since the 1980s, there has been a shift in irrigation methods from gravity to pressurized sprinklers and microirrigation, especially in 17 western states. Irrigated land in the West increased by 1.7 million acres, while applied irrigation water declined by over 1.37 million acre-feet. There has been a decline in water application since 1998, with groundwater withdrawals increasing by over 740,000 AF despite overall irrigation withdrawals decreasing. Groundwater withdrawals for irrigation in the West have increased by over 740,000 AF despite a decrease in overall irrigation withdrawals. Irrigated land in eastern states has grown by over 8.7 million acres since 1984, with groundwater being the primary source for irrigation. This trend has been attributed to factors such as increased commodity prices, drought episodes, and low-cost access to groundwater, leading to concerns about declining aquifer levels and environmental impacts. The expanded use of groundwater for irrigation has led to a decline in aquifer levels and raised environmental concerns. Irrigation efficiency refers to the beneficial use of applied water, influenced by factors like system performance, water application uniformity, and crop response. Evapotranspiration rates, influenced by climate conditions, determine crop water requirements. Inefficient conveyance systems can lead to significant water losses. Efficient irrigation systems maintain crop production levels while conserving water for further use. Efficient irrigation systems aim to maintain crop production levels while conserving water for further use downstream. However, studies have shown that in some cases, efficient irrigation systems may actually lead to increased water consumption. Microirrigation is considered more efficient than gravity irrigation, but the latter typically consumes less water due to water returning to surface or groundwater sources through runoff and deep percolation. The impact of water conservation subsidies on irrigation practices nationwide remains unclear. Efficient irrigation systems may not always result in less water consumed overall, as water not taken in by plants could be put to subsequent beneficial use. Different irrigation systems, such as pressure and gravity systems, deliver water to crops in various ways. Precision technologies are also being used to increase irrigation efficiency and reduce costs. Precision technologies are increasingly common in modern irrigation systems, complementing basic irrigation methods. Best management practices for irrigation focus on water management on farms, including conveyance, scheduling, and application methods. These practices are based on select practices identified by USDA's NRCS and can apply to both pressure and gravity irrigation systems. Success depends on various factors and may require multiple practices. Pressure systems pump water through tubing or pipes for application to crops through sprinklers or perforated pipes. Pressure irrigation systems, including sprinkler and microirrigation systems, are commonly used in the United States, making up roughly 58-65% of irrigation systems. These systems are more efficient than gravity systems and can be used to grow most crops. While operational labor requirements may be low, the initial investment costs can be high. An irrigation water management plan is essential for these systems and requires intentional preparation. Pressure irrigation systems, such as sprinkler and microirrigation systems, are more efficient than gravity systems and can be used for most crops. An irrigation water management plan is necessary to control water timing and application, reduce soil erosion, and maximize plant growth. This plan may include various irrigation BMPs like microirrigation, sprinkler irrigation, ditch lining, and land leveling. Sprinkler systems like center pivot, side roll, and linear move tower irrigation spray water over crops for soil moisture. Microirrigation includes low-pressure systems like surface drip, micro sprinkler, and sub-surface drip irrigation. Microirrigation systems, including surface drip, micro sprinkler, and sub-surface drip irrigation, are highly efficient for delivering water directly to crop root zones. These systems enhance standard center pivot irrigation to low-energy precision application (LEPA) systems. In contrast, gravity irrigation systems divert water through land-forming measures like canals, ditches, basins, and furrows, with controlled flooding methods increasing efficiency. Uncontrolled flooding, the simplest form of irrigation, lacks efficiency. Irrigation efficiency can be improved through controlled flooding methods like basin, border, and furrow irrigation, which use land-forming measures. Gravity systems are generally less efficient than pressure systems and are suitable for close-growing crops like rice. Land leveling reshapes fields to ensure uniform water application, reducing erosion and water logging. Irrigation ditch lining limits water loss due to seepage during transit to the crop area. Canal lining is a method to limit water loss in irrigation channels, while tailwater recovery systems reuse excess water. Irrigation reservoirs store water for crop irrigation, with various construction methods available. Irrigation reservoirs are built to store water for crop irrigation, with the size depending on water availability and crop needs. Precision technologies like satellite data and drones have improved irrigation efficiency, reducing costs and increasing crop yield. Technology companies are increasingly involved in the agricultural sector, offering services to help farmers maximize profits. NASA and USDA collaborated on the SMAP satellite mission to gather soil moisture data globally. The SMAP satellite mission gathers soil moisture data globally using radar and a functioning radiometer. Data collected can inform decisions on irrigation water application, with drones used for aerial imagery and sensor networks monitoring plant water status. Real-time data analytics can improve irrigation system automation based on environmental conditions and energy consumption. The information gathered from sensor networks can be used for irrigation system automation, adjusting water application based on data. Regional weather networks track crop evapotranspiration, combined with precipitation and soil moisture data for an accurate irrigation schedule. Remote monitoring systems transfer real-time information to optimize irrigation operations. Poly-pipe in furrow irrigation, with computer software optimizing hole sizes to decrease water usage. Implementing irrigation BMPs increases efficiency, reducing production costs and ensuring even watering across fields. The implementation of irrigation BMPs can increase irrigation efficiency, reduce production costs, and ensure even watering across fields. Irrigated yields are typically double that of non-irrigated crops, allowing for the growth of higher value crops and extending growing seasons. Irrigation BMPs also enhance production of specialty crops by delivering water only when needed, reducing costs, and preventing issues from overwatering. Additionally, irrigation systems can be used for the precise application of nutrients and pesticides, further reducing costs and improving efficiency. Some irrigation BMPs allow mixing synthetic nutrients and pesticides with water for more precise application, reducing costs. Implementation choices vary in the US due to factors like cost, crop type, and water availability. Adoption of efficient irrigation systems is driven by economic gains rather than water conservation. High-value crop growers are more likely to invest in costly systems like drip irrigation, while low-value crop growers may struggle to finance improvements. According to USDA's 2013 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey (FRIS), low-value crop growers face challenges in financing costly irrigation system improvements. High-efficiency systems like micro sprinklers and sub-surface drip can be more expensive than gravity systems. The cost of developing a water supply, such as drilling wells or building storage facilities, also impacts producers' decisions. High-efficiency pressure systems are more common in areas reliant on groundwater, while areas with sufficient surface water may be less likely to adopt efficient irrigation systems. High-efficiency pressure systems are more common in areas reliant on groundwater, while areas with sufficient surface water may be less likely to adopt efficient irrigation systems. Growers in drought-prone areas relying on surface water are more likely to adopt efficient systems based on crop type and field conditions. Many farmers in the United States face challenges in utilizing more efficient irrigation systems due to crop type, physical field conditions, and concerns about reduced crop yields or poorer quality. Many US farmers face challenges adopting efficient irrigation systems due to crop type, field conditions, and climate factors. Soil type also influences the choice of irrigation method, with sandy soils requiring sprinklers or microirrigation, while clay soils are best suited for gravity irrigation. Climate conditions impact evapotranspiration rates and the effectiveness of different irrigation systems. Soil type influences the choice of irrigation method, with sandy soils requiring sprinklers or microirrigation, while clay soils are best suited for gravity irrigation. Irrigation water management planning utilizes soil surveys to design and implement irrigation systems. The labor-technology trade-off between pressure and gravity systems is a factor to consider when selecting an irrigation system. Water quality can dictate the type of irrigation system that can be used, with sediment-heavy water best suited for gravity irrigation. Water quality and quantity are important factors in determining the type of irrigation system to use. Sediment-heavy water is best for gravity irrigation, while salinity and selenium concerns can be managed with sprinkler or drip irrigation. The Clean Water Act addresses water quality concerns, benefiting agriculture indirectly. State water rights laws determine the legal water availability for farmers. Political, legal, and societal factors related to water rights are not discussed in detail here. Federal assistance is provided to agricultural producers for various purposes. The federal government provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers through various USDA agencies. Conservation programs like EQIP, CSP, and AMA offer funding for irrigation BMPs adoption. Between 2009 and 2014, $1.2 billion in funding went towards implementing sprinkler and microirrigation systems. Between 2009 and 2014, $564 million of the $1.2 billion in farm bill funding for BMPs went towards sprinkler and microirrigation systems. States in the West, like California and Texas, received the most funding, while some southeastern states also ranked in the top 10. Concerns exist about the impact of irrigation efficiency on groundwater depletion, with certain aquifers being depleted at unsustainable rates. The effectiveness of irrigation BMP funding in addressing this issue remains unclear. The effectiveness of irrigation BMP funding in addressing groundwater depletion remains unclear. Programs like EQIP, CSP, and AMA provide financial assistance for various irrigation BMPs, including conservation practices and precision technologies. The USDA provides technical and financial assistance for irrigation technologies through programs like AMA and Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA). CTA helps irrigators adopt conservation plans with technical assistance but no financial aid. The USDA offers technical assistance through Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) to help irrigators adopt conservation plans. CTA does not provide financial assistance but can help qualify for financial aid programs. CTA is available to farmers and supporting groups, funded over $5.7 billion in technical assistance between 2003 and 2013. Additionally, the USDA provides information resources to irrigators through the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the Economic Research Service (ERS), focusing on irrigation research and economic studies related to agriculture. The USDA conducts economic and policy studies on agricultural issues, including irrigation water use and conservation. Recent studies have looked at characteristics of irrigated farms in western states and water conservation trends in irrigated agriculture across the United States. NIFA administers federal funding for agriculture-related science and research, including grant programs like the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Water for Agriculture Challenge Area. National Agricultural Statistics Service and U.S. Geological Survey provide national data on irrigation water use, but comparisons are challenging due to differing methodologies. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) provide national data on irrigation water use through surveys and assessments every five years. NASS conducts the Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey, while USGS evaluates water use trends, including irrigation. Additionally, Appendix A and B provide information on irrigation technologies and practice codes. Sprinkler systems, such as center pivot and side roll, qualify for funding from the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). The Irrigation BMPs Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) offers funding for various irrigation practices. These include sprinkler systems (Code 442) like center pivot, side roll, and linear move tower irrigation, microirrigation systems (Code 441), irrigation pipelines (Code 430), pumping plants (Code 533), and irrigation land leveling (Code 464) to improve efficiency and prevent water loss. The curr_chunk discusses different irrigation practices such as irrigation land leveling, water wells, structures for water control, irrigation reservoirs, and irrigation water management. These practices aim to increase irrigation efficiency, prevent water loss, and manage soil moisture for plant growth. Irrigation reservoirs are built to provide a reliable water supply for irrigation. They can be constructed using various methods such as dams, embankments, pits, or tanks. Irrigation water management involves planning the volume, frequency, and application rate of irrigation to manage soil moisture and promote plant growth. Different irrigation systems like surface and subsurface systems, irrigation ditch lining, and tailwater recovery facilities are used to convey water efficiently, reduce water loss, prevent erosion, and maintain water quality. Additionally, diversion dams are constructed to divert surface water from one watercourse to another, such as an irrigation canal. Irrigation runoff can be reused to conserve water and improve water quality. A diversion dam diverts surface water to an irrigation canal. An irrigation field ditch conveys water to irrigation areas. An irrigation canal delivers water efficiently and must be lined in permeable soil. An irrigation water management plan aims to optimize crop yield and reduce water contamination.
