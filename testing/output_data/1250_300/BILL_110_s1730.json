The recipient is deemed to be engaged in work for a month in a fiscal year if the State determines substantial compliance with activities and hourly participation requirements in a modified employability plan. The State must also comply with reporting requirements for that fiscal year. The State must submit an annual report on TANF recipients participating in work activities under modified employability plans due to disability by March 31 of the following fiscal year. The report should include the aggregate number of recipients with modified plans. The annual report on TANF recipients with modified employability plans due to disability must include the aggregate number of recipients, the percentage of compliance with plan activities, and information on prevalent types of impairments.
