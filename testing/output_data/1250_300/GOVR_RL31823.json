    "content": "In January 2004, federal white-collar employees received a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment under Executive Order 13322. A larger pay adjustment of 4.1% for 2004 was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. President Bush signed the law on January 23, 2004, providing an additional 2.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees. The law P.L. 108-199, signed on January 23, 2004, provided a 2.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees. Executive Order 13332 issued on March 3, 2004, allocated an average 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality pay adjustment. OPM published revised salary tables on March 4, 2004. Federal white-collar employees receive annual pay adjustments and locality-based comparability payments under FEPCA. The adjustments are not based on cost-of-living measures. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) has not been fully implemented as originally enacted. Annual pay adjustments were not made in certain years, and reduced amounts of the adjustments were provided in others. In 2003 and 2004, federal white-collar employees received a combined annual and locality pay adjustment of 4.1%. If the adjustments specified by FEPCA had been granted, the nationwide average net pay increase would have been higher. This report specifically discusses the January 2004 annual adjustment and locality payments for federal employees under various schedules. In 2004, federal employees under various schedules received an annual pay adjustment based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI), which showed a 2.7% increase in January 2004. The adjustment is determined by private sector wages and salaries changes. The Employment Cost Index (ECI) determines the annual pay adjustment for federal employees, with a 2.7% increase in January 2004. The President can issue an alternative plan in case of national emergency or economic conditions, as seen in President Bush's 1.5% adjustment in 2004. Executive Order 13322 implemented this alternative plan for GS employees. In 2004, GS employees received locality-based comparability payments, with adjustments also extended to certain non-General Schedule employees. Blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System had their pay adjustments capped at the average percentage increase for white-collar employees, with exceptions for specific locations. Special rate employees received special adjustments. Federal employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and non-foreign areas receive pay adjustments based on GS employees in the RUS pay area. Special rate employees get the higher of special rate or locality payment. Law enforcement officers under Section 403 of FEPCA receive both special rates and locality pay. Employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and outside the continental US receive a COLA allowance instead of locality pay. FEPCA established locality-based comparability payments to address pay disparities greater than 5% within each locality. The President has authority to adjust payments in case of national emergency or economic conditions. FEPCA allows for locality-based comparability payments to address pay disparities, with the President having the authority to adjust payments in case of national emergency or economic conditions. President Bush issued an alternative plan for a 0.5% locality pay adjustment in January 2004, implemented through Executive Order 13322. Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys to document non-federal rates of pay in each pay area. The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys to document non-federal rates of pay in 32 pay areas nationwide. The surveys were previously conducted under the Occupational Compensation Survey Program until October 1996, and then under the National Compensation Survey program. Survey results are submitted to OPM to compare non-federal and GS salaries, with the goal of reducing the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries to 5% each year. The overall average percentage pay gap for each pay area is adjusted to 5% each year by OPM, as mandated by law. FEPCA requires a certain percentage of the gap between GS and non-federal salaries to be closed annually, starting with 20% in 1994. However, the actual closure of the gap has been lower each year, with percentages ranging from 23.5% in 1995 to 44% in 2003. The pay gap between GS and non-federal salaries is adjusted to 5% annually by OPM as mandated by FEPCA. The closure of the gap has varied each year, ranging from 23.5% in 1995 to 44% in 2003. Locality payments are based on pay gaps that are 22 months old by the adjustment date, using OCSP and NCS survey data. The NCS surveys for January 2004 locality payments used data ranging from December 2000 to November 1996. The Federal Salary Council explained how pay gaps were determined by aging BLS survey data to a common reference date in March 2002 before comparing it to GS pay data. The Federal Salary Council reported that as of March 2002, the pay gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries was 32.02%. To reduce this disparity to 5%, recommended locality pay raises ranged from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas. The comparison of 2003 locality payments with those recommended for 2004 resulted in recommended increases ranging from 11.90% to 25.23% in different pay areas. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises ranging from 11.90% to 25.23% in different pay areas for 2004. The council also recommended including areas with low publishability and pay gaps below RUS in the survey locations for 2004. The Federal Salary Council recommended locality pay raises for 2004, including areas with low publishability and pay gaps below RUS in the survey locations. The council plans to review commuting patterns and population data before making any changes to locality pay area definitions. The Federal Salary Council recommended no changes in locality pay area definitions for 2004, except for Barnstable County, MA, which was seeking inclusion in the Boston pay area due to unique circumstances. The council voted to make an exception for Barnstable County despite not meeting the criteria of having 2,000 GS employees. The Federal Salary Council recommended no changes in locality pay area definitions for 2004, except for Barnstable County, MA, which was seeking inclusion in the Boston pay area. The Council voted to recommend including Barnstable County in the Boston locality pay area in 2004 to address what they considered an egregious situation. St. Mary's County, MD, was recommended to be included in the Washington, DC-Baltimore, MD, pay area, while Santa Barbara County, CA, and New London, CT, were recommended to remain in their respective pay areas despite falling below the employee threshold. The Federal Salary Council recommended no changes in locality pay area definitions for 2004, except for Barnstable County, MA, which was seeking inclusion in the Boston pay area. New London and Santa Barbara were recommended to remain in their respective pay areas despite falling below the employee threshold. Monterey County, CA, and the State of Rhode Island were also recommended for inclusion in their respective pay areas in 2004. The council plans to conduct a major review of the locality pay program in 2003 with new census data affecting future definitions. The State of Rhode Island was recommended for continued inclusion in the Boston pay area in 2004, despite not meeting the county size requirement. Rhode Island is considered as a single county due to its small size, and the criteria for an installation in a pay area were also discussed. The council recommended including Edwards Air Force Base in the Los Angeles pay area in 2004, despite not meeting employment criteria. The council also suggested improvements to the BLS National Compensation Survey program, such as using three factors to assign federal grade levels to non-federal jobs. The improvements and progress to date include using three factors to assign federal grade levels to non-federal jobs, developing a four-factor evaluation system, implementing an econometric model to estimate missing data, improving the matching of federal survey jobs with non-federal survey jobs, and providing subcategories for occupations. OPM has formed an interagency working group to develop a crosswalk between Federal job classifications and the new Standard Occupational Classification System, while BLS has used the new crosswalk and March 2001 GS employment weights for data delivery. Additional improvements are anticipated in the crosswalk, with OPM providing updated GS employment information to BLS each year. The BLS and Pay Agent staff have designed a new approach for grading supervisory occupations based on the highest level of work supervised. They plan to conduct final tests of this approach in the fall and hope to implement it in surveys by December 2003. BLS has also developed methods to identify and exclude non-Federal jobs classified above GS-15. The council's report on 2004 locality payments recommended the phase-in of NCS data for locality payments but expressed ongoing concerns. The council recommended the phase-in of NCS data for 2004 locality payments but expressed concerns about the reliability of the data. They suggested that further implementation of NCS data should be conditioned on BLS implementing improvements and increasing sample sizes in areas with significant pay gaps. Definition of Metropolitan Areas is based on OMB definitions, with changes automatically reflecting OMB revisions. The OPM modified the GS locality pay regulations to align with former OMB statistical area definitions, allowing for review before making recommendations in 2003. The Federal Salary Council and the President's Pay Agent considered changes to the locality pay areas based on new statistical area definitions. The Federal Salary Council and the President's Pay Agent reviewed new statistical area definitions in 2003, including changes like the introduction of 'Micropolitan Statistical Areas' and 'Combined Statistical Areas'. Population density is no longer a criterion for evaluating outlying counties, and commuting threshold levels have been adjusted. A working group recommended the Council consider using the new definitions. The working group recommended using the new MSA definitions for locality pay areas, with additional study needed before any decisions are made. If adopted, 83 counties would be added to existing metropolitan locality pay areas, while 10 counties would be excluded. The group suggested that the Council adopt the new MSA definitions for locality pay areas at a second meeting. The working group recommended adopting new MSA definitions for locality pay areas, including using Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs) for pay adjustments in January 2005. The council's recommendations were tentatively approved for the pay adjustments, with plans to publish proposed changes in the Federal Register for public comment in 2004. In January 2005, OPM will propose changes to locality pay in the Federal Register for public comments. Representative Sam Farr's amendment in H.R. 2989 prevents funds from disestablishing any pay locality. Farr raised concerns about pay reductions for federal employees in Monterey County, California. Senator Jack Reed also proposed a similar amendment. Senator Jack Reed offered an amendment (S.Amdt. 1944) during a meeting on September 3, 2003, to prevent pay reductions for federal employees in Monterey County, California. The amendment, agreed to by the Senate, stated that no funds could be used to remove any area from coverage under a locality pay area. This was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The Pay Agent's report recommended adjustments for locality payments in FY2004, but due to economic concerns, they advised against implementing the proposed increases. They suggested exploring alternative compensation approaches for federal employees. The Pay Agent recommended adjustments for locality payments in FY2004 but advised against implementing the proposed increases due to economic concerns. They expressed serious concerns about the current process of a single percentage adjustment for all white-collar civilian Federal employees without considering differing labor markets or individual performance. The cost of the January 2004 locality-based comparability payments would be $8.830 billion to reduce the pay disparity to 5%. The Pay Agent did not adopt the council's recommendation to include Barnstable County, Massachusetts, in the Boston locality pay area. The Pay Agent recommended adjustments for locality payments in FY2004 but advised against implementing proposed increases due to economic concerns. They did not adopt the council's recommendation to include Barnstable County, Massachusetts, in the Boston locality pay area. The Pay Agent stated that improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program have been implemented, with further enhancements to be introduced in December 2003. They look forward to reviewing the results of NCS data next year and encouraged expedited completion of remaining tasks. The Pay Agent recommended adjustments for locality payments in FY2004 but advised against implementing proposed increases due to economic concerns. They look forward to reviewing the results of NCS data next year and encouraged expedited completion of remaining tasks. President George W. Bush issued his administration's FY2004 budget on February 3, 2003, proposing a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment. The statutory annual pay adjustment required in January 2004 is 2.7%. If the President wants to change the required rate of the annual adjustment, he has to submit an alternative plan. The President issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, to change the annual adjustment and locality-based comparability payments for FY2004. The plan called for a 2.0% pay adjustment, with 1.5% allocated for annual and 0.5% for locality pay, costing about $2 billion. Executive Order 13322, issued on December 30, 2003, implemented this plan. The alternative plan, implemented by Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003, included a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund to reward high-performing employees. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $2.5 million for the fund in H.R. 2989, passed by the House on September 9, 2003. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $2.5 million for a Human Capital Performance Fund in the Transportation and Treasury Appropriations Bill, 2004. The Senate Committee did not recommend funding for the fund, stating that such initiatives should be managed within individual agencies. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $2.5 million for a Human Capital Performance Fund in the Transportation and Treasury Appropriations Bill, 2004. The Senate did not provide funding for the fund, believing such initiatives should be managed within individual agencies. H.R. 2989 was later incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004, with a $1 million appropriation for the fund. Funding transfer to agencies required OPM approval of performance pay plans. This provision was enacted in P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004. The President's alternative plan proposed a 2% pay raise, warning that any higher raise would likely be unfunded, leading to hiring freezes in agencies. Federal employee union representatives expressed disappointment with the 2.0% pay adjustment. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule classification system due to the resources needed to maintain it and the constant tinkering required for equal pay. They suggested a broad-band system as an alternative. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule classification system and implementing a broad-band system with wide salary ranges. Pay banding systems are being adopted by various agencies, and new HRM systems for civilian employees of the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense are authorized by recent legislation. New HRM systems for civilian employees of the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense were authorized by recent legislation, including changes to pay setting systems with broad pay bands. Congress annually considers federal white-collar pay adjustments, setting amounts independently from the President's recommendations. There have been calls for parity in pay adjustments between uniformed military and federal civilian employees. The resolutions (S.Con.Res. 1 and H.Con.Res. 19) expressed Congress's support for pay parity between military and civilian employees. Members of Congress urged equal pay raises for both groups. The FY2004 budget proposed a 4.1% increase for the military and 2.0% for civilians. The House passed the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2004 (H.Con.Res. 95) by a narrow margin on March 21, 2003. The Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2004 proposes a 4.1% pay increase for the military and 2.0% for civilian employees. The House of Representatives passed the resolution by a 215 to 212 vote on March 21, 2003. The Senate version included the same language regarding compensation adjustments for civilian employees. The resolution serves as a framework for Congress to consider spending legislation. Congress typically includes recommendations for civilian federal pay adjustments in the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill. The Departments of Transportation and Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill for 2004 proposed a 4.1% pay increase for federal civilian employees, without specifying how the increase should be divided between annual and locality pay adjustments. The bill was approved by the House Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies and later by the House Committee on Appropriations. The House Committee on Appropriations approved H.R. 2989 with a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. The bill passed the House on September 9, 2003, despite opposition from the Bush Administration, which proposed a lower 2.0% pay raise. The Administration opposes the 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees in H.R. 2989, proposing a lower 2.0% pay raise instead. They are concerned about unfunded civilian pay increases costing DOD and the government billions. The FY2004 Departments of Transportation and Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill does not fund the President's $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. The 4.1% pay adjustment in the bill exceeds inflation and private-sector pay increases. Federal employee turnover is low, with a 1.7% quit rate per year. Providing a 4.1% pay adjustment for civilian employees in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security could limit agency flexibility in designing new personnel and pay systems. The Senate version of the Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill, S. 1589, includes a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, which was approved by the full committee on September 4, 2003. Senator Richard Shelby and Senator Patty Murray offered an amendment for the pay adjustment, which was agreed to by voice vote. Senator Patty Murray offered an amendment to the House appropriations bill, H.R. 2989, for a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in Defense and Homeland Security. The Senate passed the amended bill on October 23, 2003. The Federal Salary Council recommended a 2.7% annual pay adjustment and a 1.4% locality pay adjustment. The pay adjustment was later incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 incorporated a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in Defense and Homeland Security. The adjustment took effect on the first day of the first pay period after January 1, 2004, and was funded within appropriated levels. President Bush signed the bill into law on January 23, 2004. President Bush signed H.R. 2673 on January 23, 2004, which included a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. The additional amount was allocated as 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality in an Executive Order issued on March 3, 2004. The cost of the pay adjustment is approximately $4.1 billion. OPM issued revised salary tables for 2004 the next day, showing recommended locality payments and net annual pay increases. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent recommendations for January 2005 pay adjustments are discussed in a CRS report. Congress could consider amending FEPCA in relation to the federal white-collar pay-setting system. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent report that the pay disparity between non-federal and federal salaries is 25.73% for 2004, instead of the intended 5% under FEPCA. The methodology for setting federal pay adjustments has been questioned since FEPCA's enactment. The Pay Agent report highlighted a significant pay disparity of 25.73% between non-federal and federal salaries in 2004. Concerns have been raised about the flawed methodology for setting federal pay adjustments since the enactment of FEPCA. Despite previous criticisms, no changes were proposed to FEPCA. The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys were not approved for use in determining locality payments for several years, leading to the aging of previous survey data for payment purposes. Congress directed the President's Pay Agent to prepare a report on this issue in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001. The Pay Agent report in 2001 highlighted concerns with the methodology for setting federal pay adjustments. Improvements to the survey methodology were discussed, and a white paper on compensation was issued in 2002. A 2002 study by the Congressional Budget Office found that federal employees in certain occupations were paid less than their private sector counterparts. The Congressional Budget Office found that federal employees in selected professional and administrative occupations tended to earn less than their private sector counterparts, with about 85% lagging behind by more than 20%. In contrast, around 30% of federal employees in technical and clerical occupations had salaries higher than those in the private sector. The study highlighted the lack of variation in pay raises by occupation in the federal pay system. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the federal pay system lacks variation in pay raises by occupation, leading to disparities in salaries between federal and private sector employees. This results in some occupational groups receiving above-market salaries while others receive below-market salaries. The increasing number of federal employees in professional and administrative occupations further exacerbates this issue. The cost of fully implementing the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) is also a concern. The cost of fully implementing FEPCA is a concern, with estimates of $8.830 billion for locality-based comparability payments in January 2004. Unions advocate for pay parity between federal civilian employees and the military, criticizing the President's proposal as inadequate. AFGE highlights issues with the Department of Labor's methodology in determining federal pay comparability with the private sector. The Department of Labor's methodology in determining federal pay comparability with the private sector is criticized for lacking details on methodological problems. The issues have expanded to the Employment Cost Index component, affecting the recommended locality payments for January 2004. The Pay Agent recommended adjustments for January 2004, but due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, locality pay increases were not implemented. President Bush issued Executive Orders for a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment, followed by an additional 2.1% pay adjustment in March 2004. The actual pay rates are calculated by increasing the basic General Schedule (GS) by the annual adjustment percentage. The 2004 pay rates were adjusted with a 1.2% annual increase and 0.9% locality-based payment. The new GS schedule was calculated by increasing the basic GS rates and then adding the locality payment. The resulting pay rates were compared to 2003 rates to determine the net increase in pay. Salary tables for 2004 can be found online. MSA and CMSA refer to specific metropolitan areas."
