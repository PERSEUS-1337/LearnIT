    "content": "The House and Senate approved various defense bills in FY1999, including authorization and appropriations bills, with additional funding for defense-related activities such as Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, and antiterrorism activities. The President signed these bills into law, providing a total of $8.3 billion in funding. The annual defense appropriations bill, signed into law as P.L. 105-277, allocated funds for various defense-related activities including damage repairs, purchasing fissile materials from Russia, antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug activities. The bill primarily funds military activities of the Department of Defense, weapons procurement, research and development, and other purposes. Additionally, small amounts were allocated for the Central Intelligence Agency retirement fund, intelligence community management, and national foreign intelligence activities. The Administration's FY1999 budget included $270.6 billion for national defense. The Administration's FY1999 budget included $270.6 billion for national defense activities, with $250.8 billion requested in the defense appropriations bill. Congress also acts on a national defense authorization bill annually, which addresses defense programs in detail. Congressional debate on defense policy and funding mainly occurs during action on the authorization bill. Congress completed action on the annual defense authorization and appropriations bills on October 1. The final status of action on the annual defense authorization and appropriations bills is as follows: House and Senate 302(b) allocations were approved in May, determining funding for defense and other programs. The final Senate allocations for defense are slightly below the Administration's request, while the final House allocations provide slightly more funding for national security. The House and Senate approved 302(b) allocations in May for defense funding. The final House allocations provide slightly more funding for national security, with $250.499 billion in budget authority and $244.965 billion in outlays. The House and Senate passed their respective FY1999 defense authorization bills in May and June, with a conference agreement reached in September. The Senate passed bill S. 2057 on June 25, and it was signed into law as P.L. 105-261 on October 17. The House approved the conference report for the FY1999 defense authorization bill on September 24. The House passed bill H.R. 4103 on June 24 for the FY1999 defense appropriations. The Senate passed bill H.R. 4103 on July 30 after substituting its text into the Senate defense appropriations bill S. 2132. Conferees reached agreement on the FY1999 defense appropriations bill. The Senate passed bill S. 2132 on June 4, which was later substituted into H.R. 4103 and passed on July 30. The FY1999 defense appropriations bill was signed into law as P.L. 105-262 on October 17. Additionally, supplemental defense appropriations for FY1998 were approved on April 30 and signed into law as P.L. 105-174 on May 1. The bill H.R. 3579 provides $2.7 billion in supplemental funding for military operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, domestic and defense disaster relief. The President signed it into law as P.L. 105-174 on May 1. The bill includes $481 million for Bosnia, $1.3 billion for Southwest Asia, $393 million for disaster relief, and $513 million for other defense programs. Additionally, an omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999 (H.R. 4328) provides $8.3 billion in defense-related funding, including allocations for Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, and year 2000 fixes in the Defense Department. The omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999 (H.R. 4328) provides $8.3 billion in defense-related funding, including allocations for Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, and year 2000 fixes in the Defense Department. Additionally, the bill includes funds for defense antiterrorism activities, defense counter-drug activities, and other emergency appropriations. The conference agreements on the defense authorization and appropriations bills resolved major issues, including relations with China. The conference agreements on the defense authorization and appropriations bills for FY1999 resolved major issues, including relations with China. The agreements included provisions related to technology exports to China, such as transferring review authority from Commerce to State Department, requiring congressional notification for satellite sales, and prohibiting missile equipment exports. The conference agreement on the defense appropriations bill for FY1999 includes provisions related to technology exports to China, such as transferring review authority from Commerce to State Department, requiring congressional notification for satellite sales, and prohibiting missile equipment exports. It also prohibits the transfer of port facilities near San Diego to COSCO, a Chinese shipping company, and includes a prohibition on DOD doing business with Chinese Army-owned companies. The conference agreement does not include measures for new military base closures, but prohibits DOD from doing business with Chinese Army-owned companies and requires a report on the security situation in the Taiwan Strait. Social issues include the House requiring separation of men and women in basic training, while the Senate prohibits new policies until a commission reports. The Senate rejected a proposal to separate men and women in basic training until a commission reports. The House-Senate conference adopted the Senate's language but included a statement urging separate training units. Both chambers also maintained the ban on abortions in military medical facilities. The House authorization bill included a measure on tritium production. The agreement includes a provision on tritium production, allowing the DOE to choose between buying tritium from commercial sources or building new facilities. The cost estimates for buying tritium are $3 billion from commercial sources and $10 billion from new facilities over the next forty years. The conference agreement also prohibits the implementation of any plan for a year to allow Congress to review the decision. Additionally, the House rejected an Administration request to eliminate floors on active duty end-strength levels. The House rejected an Administration request to eliminate floors on active duty end-strength levels. The Senate and both House and Senate versions of the appropriations bill agreed to the Administration's proposed reductions in end-strength. The authorization conference report agreed to the Administration request. The House provided a 3.6% pay raise for military personnel, while the Senate initially offered a 3.1% raise. An amendment was approved to increase the pay raise to 3.6%, offset by a reduction in R&D funds. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements provide a 3.6% raise. The Administration requested $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency funding. The Administration requested $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency funding, not subject to the defense spending cap. The Senate-passed defense appropriations bill included the funding, while the House bill did not. The SASC report approved the amount as emergency appropriations. The House-passed authorization bill included a provision to cap Bosnia spending at $1.9 billion, with the services allowed to spend $100 million more if needed. Both houses rejected measures to withdraw U.S. troops from Bosnia by a specific date. The authorization conference agreement authorizes $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, with the possibility of larger expenditures if certified by the President. The appropriations conference agreement did not include emergency funding for Bosnia initially but was later provided in a supplemental appropriations measure. Contentious weapons issues were minimal, with funds allocated for 7 C-130J aircraft, exceeding the Administration's request. The House and Senate authorization and appropriations bills allocated over $400 million for additional aircraft, exceeding the requested amount. Funding for the THAAD system was reduced significantly due to a recent test failure, with the authorization and appropriations conference agreements cutting $294 million and $376 million respectively. The Senate also reduced or eliminated funding for the MEADS system, a cooperative program with allies, with the authorization conference agreement cutting funding to $24 million and the appropriations conference agreement providing only $10 million. The authorization conference agreement cuts funding for the MEADS system from $44 million to $24 million and requires the Defense Department to make room for it in future budget plans. The appropriations conference agreement only provides $10 million. Funding for the Airborne Laser program was reduced while funding for Space-Based Laser R&D was increased. Both House and Senate appropriations bills decreased funding for new aircraft carrier development. The Navy will use some of the money for progressive changes in the current design. The authorization conference agreement allocates $110 million and the appropriations conference agreement provides $105 million out of the $190 million requested. The Senate included advance procurement funds for a new LHD-8 amphibious ship. The Senate authorization and appropriations bills included funds for a new LHD-8 amphibious ship, despite objections from some lawmakers. The authorization conference agreement provides $50 million and the appropriations agreement $45 million. The House and Senate agreed on funding for 30 F-18s and one F-16 aircraft. The authorization conference included restrictions on F-22 aircraft testing, which can be waived. The Administration objected to cuts in Department of Energy weapons programs, but the authorization conference agreement made smaller cuts in these areas. The authorization conference agreement made smaller cuts in Department of Energy weapons programs. Both House and Senate bills took steps to ensure military retirees have access to healthcare, with pilot projects testing alternative approaches and access to TRICARE pharmacy benefits. The authorization conference agreement includes pilot projects to test FEHBP for military retirees, use DOD TRICARE as a supplement for Medicare, and provide access to TRICARE pharmacy benefits. The defense debate agenda covers various issues such as military base closures, Bosnia funding, technology exports, military readiness, defense modernization funding, National Guard and Reserve funding, major weapons programs, social issues, and military health care policy. The defense debate in Congress for the FY1999 budget was constrained by budget agreements, leading to a \"zero-sum game\" where any additional funding for favored programs had to be offset by reductions in other areas. Congress ultimately provided an extra $8.3 billion for defense programs. The FY1999 defense budget debate in Congress saw a sharp break from previous years, with Congress adding $8.3 billion for defense programs. Potential conflicts over defense priorities were avoided as Congress and the Administration compromised on funding for various programs. Key priorities included national missile defense, National Guard and Reserve equipment, defense health programs, and the production of the next Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. In the FY1999 defense budget debate, Congress added $8.3 billion for defense programs, prioritizing national missile defense, National Guard and Reserve equipment, defense health programs, and advancing the production of the next Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. The debate was influenced by the Quadrennial Defense Review, Defense Reform Initiative report, and National Defense Panel report. Contentious debates over defense budget priorities were largely avoided in House and Senate actions. The QDR, Defense Reform Initiative, and National Defense Panel reports in 1997 emphasized the need for efficiency in defense policy, including a revised defense strategy, the ability to win two major wars simultaneously, and modernization efforts. They also supported military base closures to save money for weapons upgrades. The QDR, Defense Reform Initiative, and National Defense Panel reports in 1997 emphasized the need for efficiency in defense policy, including military base closures to save money for weapons upgrades. The reports also called for increased focus on homeland defense and preparing for future threats, advocating for more funding for experimental force exercises and new technology. The Defense Department proposed two more rounds of military base closures in its legislative plan. The Defense Department recommended two more rounds of military base closures to save money for future defense modernization programs. Secretary Cohen made congressional approval of these closures a top priority. The report reaffirmed earlier estimates of annual savings from previous closure rounds and projected $2.8 billion in savings from future closures. This funding is crucial for upcoming weapons programs. The Defense Department recommended two more rounds of military base closures to save money for future defense modernization programs. The plan, if fully implemented, will lead to annual savings of $2.8 billion. Resistance to more closures in Congress has been fueled by objections to the Administration's actions following the 1995 base closure round. The White House's plan to \"privatize in place\" at two sites has sparked controversy among Members of Congress. The Defense Department recommended two more rounds of military base closures to save money for future defense modernization programs, leading to annual savings of $2.8 billion. Congress has resisted additional closures due to objections to the Administration's \"privatize in place\" plan, which has sparked controversy. Secretary Cohen has suggested including a prohibition on privatization in future base closure legislation and urged Congress to approve more closures to prepare for the long-term defense plan. Congressional action has not agreed to additional military base closures. The Defense Department recommended two more rounds of military base closures to save money for future defense modernization programs, leading to annual savings of $2.8 billion. Congress has resisted additional closures due to objections to the Administration's \"privatize in place\" plan. Congressional action has not agreed to additional military base closures in the long-term defense plan. The Administration requested additional funding for military operations overseas, including $1.8 billion for Bosnia and $1.9 billion for extended missions in FY1998 and FY1999. Congress approved the FY1998 funding in H.R. 3579 and included the FY1999 funding in the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328). The Administration sought to designate the funding as \"emergency\" to avoid cuts in other defense programs. The Administration requested additional funding for military operations overseas, including $1.8 billion for Bosnia and $1.9 billion for extended missions in FY1998 and FY1999. Congress approved the funding in H.R. 3579 and H.R. 4328. The proposal to designate the Bosnia funding as \"emergency\" was contentious as it would raise caps on defense spending without offsetting cuts. The Senate approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency funding. In its version of the defense authorization bill, SASC approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency appropriations. HNSC set a cap of $1.9 billion for Bosnia with an additional $100 million available for emergencies. The House rejected a motion to cut off funds for Bosnia without prior congressional approval. The Senate approved an amendment urging a reduction in U.S. troop levels in Bosnia. The Senate approved an amendment urging a reduction in U.S. troop levels in Bosnia, but rejected an amendment to cut off funds without congressional approval. The Senate added an amendment to provide $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia. The House included a provision to prohibit expenditures on offensive military action without advance congressional approval, which the White House threatened to veto. The authorization conference agreement approved the $1.9 billion emergency funding for Bosnia, pending appropriation. The appropriations conference agreement dropped the Skaggs amendment and did not include emergency funding for Bosnia. The authorization conference agreement approved $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, pending appropriation. Congressional focus shifted to relations with China, technology exports, and trade sanctions legislation in light of allegations regarding Loral Space Corporation and nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. The LoralSpace Corporation assisted China in improving missile launch technology before the President's trip. Congressional action included amendments to restrict technology exports to China and other countries, with the White House strongly objecting. The House also prohibited the transfer of facilities at Long Beach naval shipyard to a Chinese shipping company. Senate proposed amendments related to technology exports to China, relations with China, and trade sanctions. The Senate rejected China-related amendments and postponed debate on China policy. Senator Hutchinson planned to offer his amendments on the defense appropriations bill, but Senator Stevens delayed floor action due to concerns about contentious amendments. Ultimately, a revised amendment requiring the State Department to deny visas to officials involved in human rights abuses passed unanimously. The authorization conference agreement included provisions on China-related issues. The authorization conference agreement included provisions to review technology exports to China, require advanced congressional notification of satellite sales, and prohibit export of missile equipment unless certified not to harm U.S. space launch industry. It also banned transferring port facilities to COSCO and recommended efficiency measures like base closures. The Defense Reform Initiative report recommended efficiency measures such as reducing staff in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and military service headquarters, cutting civilian and military support personnel, and pursuing public-private competitions for certain activities. Congress has debated whether these cuts are substantial, if deeper cuts are needed, and how to react to privatization at local facilities. Congress has debated whether personnel reductions are real or just on paper, if deeper cuts in overhead personnel are necessary, and how to react to privatization at local facilities. The House has pushed for deep cuts in acquisition personnel, while the Senate and Administration have tried to soften these measures. HNSC urged the Defense Department to not waive cuts in acquisition personnel mandated in the previous year's defense authorization act and imposed a $500 million across-the-board cut in funding for consultants. The White House objected to these cuts, saying they would restrict DOD's ability to pursue efficiencies. The House pushed for deep cuts in acquisition personnel, while the Senate and Administration tried to soften these measures. The authorization conference agreement includes withholding funds for the Office of the Secretary of Defense unless DOD meets requirements to cut headquarters staff and provide reports to Congress. Military readiness has been a focus in congressional hearings, with concerns about shortages in key areas and a decline in pilot retention rates. The House and Senate clashed over defense budget cuts, with concerns raised about military readiness, including shortages in key personnel and declining pilot retention rates. The Clinton Administration downplayed the issues, attributing them to inadequate funding and overseas missions. Administration officials insisted that overall readiness remains strong, with problems being addressed, such as shortages in Air Force engine spares and changes in planning models. The military is facing challenges with pilot retention and personnel recruitment, with efforts underway to address these issues. Concerns about readiness were raised by senior military officers, leading to calls for increased defense spending. The Joint Chiefs testified about the need for an additional $17 billion per year in defense spending, with potential shortfalls of up to $135 billion over five years. The Senate Armed Services Committee discussed military readiness and the need for additional defense spending. The HNSC restructured funding for maintenance and mandated changes in readiness reporting. The Senate approved amendments for reports on food stamp use by military families and acknowledged that readiness has been affected by budget cuts and expanded missions. The authorization conference agreement includes improved readiness reporting and increased benefits for recruiting and troop retention. The Congress addresses eroded military readiness due to budget cuts and expanded missions, including in Bosnia. The authorization conference agreement focuses on readiness reporting, troop benefits, flight duty pay, and quality of life measures. The FY1999 appropriations bill allocates $1.3 billion for enhanced readiness but does not address changes in military retirement benefits. Long-term funding for defense modernization remains a concern, with funding reallocated from weapons procurement to operation and maintenance accounts. The FY1999 budget does not fully resolve this issue. The Defense Department had to reallocate funds from weapons procurement to operation and maintenance accounts due to budget constraints. The FY1999 budget requested $48.7 billion for procurement, close to the previous year's level, with adjustments made following the Quadrennial Defense Review. The Administration aims to increase procurement funding to $60 billion by FY2001, relying on efficiency savings and base closures. However, achieving this goal without increasing overall defense spending is challenging, as historical trends suggest. The Administration aims to increase procurement funding to $60 billion by FY2001, relying on efficiency savings and base closures. However, achieving this goal without increasing overall defense spending is challenging, as historical trends suggest. Under Secretary of Defense Jacques Gansler stated that reaching the $60 billion procurement target is becoming harder. Congressional action does not include substantial increases in modernization funding, with only $1 billion allocated for BMD programs in the omnibus appropriations bill. The QDR mandates a reduction of 37,000 active duty personnel and 55,000 reserve positions by 2003, mainly from support activities. The QDR mandates a reduction of 37,000 active duty personnel and 55,000 reserve positions by 2003. Congress has set floors on active duty personnel levels for the past two years, but in order to carry out the reductions, they must agree to reduce or eliminate the statutory floors. There has been resistance in Congress to proposed personnel cuts, with concerns about strains on active duty forces due to contingency operations and forward presence abroad. The Army has shortages in certain skills, relying on reservists to fill units in the event of a major conflict, which exacerbates burdens on the force during smaller-scale operations. The Administration requested a reduction in active duty end-strength by over 35,000 from the authorized FY1998 level. Congress debated on repealing statutory floors on end-strength, with HNSC rejecting the repeal and reducing authorized end-strength by 11,000 fewer positions. SASC approved the end-strength reductions and repeal of statutory floors. The House and Senate versions of the defense appropriations bill assumed the cuts in end-strength in FY1999. The National Guard and reserve issues were also discussed, including a dispute between the active Army and the Army National Guard over the role of combat units. In FY1999, the Administration requested cuts in end-strength, which were agreed upon in the authorization conference report. A dispute between the active Army and the Army National Guard over the role of combat units emerged after the QDR. The Guard felt their combat units were not given appropriate roles in war plans, leading to Congress appointing special advisors and increased funding for Guard and reserve weapons procurement. The Army Chief of Staff has been working to resolve the ongoing dispute. Congress has consistently added funding for Guard and reserve weapons programs to protect Guard units. Congress has perennially added money for Guard and reserve weapons programs to the budget and has tried to protect Guard units. This year's disputes over major weapons programs include Missile defense, with the Administration increasing funding for NMD programs. Major policy disputes remain unresolved as the Administration pursues NMD technology development while deferring deployment decisions. The Administration is increasing funding for NMD programs, with major policy disputes remaining unresolved. Congress is divided on the deployment of a nationwide defense system and the relevance of the ABM Treaty. Disputes also continue over TMD systems like THAAD, Navy Theater-Wide, and MEADS. The Administration has delayed THAAD development due to test failures and wants to postpone Navy system procurement. MEADS is a cooperative program with European allies for improved air/missile defense for forward deployed troops. MEADS is a cooperative program with European allies to provide an improved air/missile defense system for forward deployed troops. Congressional Action: Provisions to require deployment of a nationwide defense have sometimes held up completion of defense authorization and appropriations bills. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported \"The American Missile Protection Act of 1998,\" calling for deployment of a nationwide defense. The House approved additional funding for selected TMD programs in FY1998. The House approved additional funding for selected TMD programs in FY1998, including $147 million for TMD programs in H.R. 2786 and $179 million in the FY1998 supplemental funding bill, H.R. 3579. The Senate approved an amendment to trim $253.9 million from the THAAD program due to test failures, delaying engineering development. The House also approved a committee amendment to restructure the THAAD program, requiring DOD to select a second contractor and shifting $142.7 million from engineering to technology development. The full House approved a committee amendment to restructure the THAAD program on May 21, requiring DOD to select a second contractor to compete with Lockheed-Martin and shifting $142.7 million from engineering development to technology development. SASC also cut MEADS funding and required DOD to study alternatives. The Senate appropriations bill followed suit by not adding money for NMD. SASC was critical of the Air Force Advanced Airborne Laser program and cut funding, while increasing funding for Space-Based Laser R&D. The Senate appropriations bill also cut funding for ABL and added money to the TMD budget for boost phase intercept technology. Congressional defense committees endorsed accelerated development of the Navy Theater Wide TMD system as an alternative to THAAD. The authorization conference cut funding for THAAD and MEADS and prohibited. Budget additions for missile defense systems range from $70 million to $150 million in different bills. The authorization conference cut funding for THAAD by $294 million and reduced MEADS funding. The appropriations conference agreement further cut THAAD by $376 million, reduced MEADS to $10 million, and cut the Airborne Laser program by $25 million. An additional $1 billion was allocated for missile defense in the FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill. The debate over procuring more B-2 bombers continues, with the House generally in support and the Senate opposed. In March, an independent commission mandated by Congress called for no more B-2 bombers to be produced due to cost. Congressional action: None of this year's defense bills add money for more B-2 bombers. Three new fighter aircraft programs are in development and production: Navy F/A-18E/F, Air Force F-22, and Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). DOD requested funding for F/A-18E/F, F-22, and JSF in FY1999. QDR studied the programs and decided to continue all, though all were reduced. Some Members of Congress believe DOD cannot afford all three and one should be canceled. The QDR studied three aircraft programs (Navy F/A-18E/F, Air Force F-22, and Joint Strike Fighter) and decided to continue all, despite reductions. Some Members of Congress believe DOD cannot afford all three. Congressional action included reducing F/A-18E/F procurement and imposing requirements on F-22 flight tests. The Administration objected to the Senate's requirements. The authorization and appropriations conferences approved funds for 30 F-18s and allowed a waiver for the F-22 flight test requirement. Congress has added funds to shipbuilding programs to avoid production gaps and ensure shipyards have enough work. The procurement of the CVN-77, the last Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, has been moved up to the FY2001 budget to avoid production gaps. Newport News Shipbuilding's \"Smart Buy\" proposal to accelerate funding was not chosen, but the new DOD plan will still save costs. The Navy's new DOD plan will save costs by avoiding a big bill in FY1999 and FY2000. Ingalls Shipbuilding Company and Bath Iron Works have teamed up to develop the next generation DD-21 destroyer. The Navy has also abandoned plans for a new-design aircraft carrier and will focus on incremental improvements to Nimitz-class carriers. Congressional action includes agreements with shipbuilders and combat system integrators for competition in combat systems and design. The Navy has abandoned plans for a new-design aircraft carrier, known as the \"CVX,\" and will focus on incremental improvements to Nimitz-class carriers. Congressional action includes approving funding for a New Attack Submarine and adding funds for a new LHD-7 class amphibious ship. The Navy has decided not to pursue a new-design aircraft carrier, the \"CVX,\" and will focus on upgrading Nimitz-class carriers instead. Congress approved funding for a New Attack Submarine and added funds for a new LHD-7 class amphibious ship. Funding allocation for carrier R&D, specifically for CVX and CVN upgrades, is a key issue with differing recommendations from the Senate Appropriations Committee and the House Appropriations bill. The CVX funding was approved by Congress, with $110 million allocated for R&D in the authorization conference agreement and $105 million in the appropriations conference agreement. Congress also addressed other weapons issues, such as procurement of F-16 aircraft and JSTARS aircraft. The House authorization added funds for F-16s and JSTARS aircraft, as well as for National Guard and Reserve equipment. The House and SASC provided funds for additional JSTARS aircraft, National Guard and Reserve equipment, and C-130 cargo aircraft. There were debates over funding for C-130J program and Rep. Obey proposed reallocating funds to restore F/A-18E/F procurement and upgrade existing C-130s. Rep. Obey proposed reallocating funds from 4 aircraft in the subcommittee bill to restore F/A-18E/F procurement and upgrade existing C-130s. The authorization conference agreement included funds for 7 C-130s, 1 F-16, and advance procurement funds for JSTARS. The appropriations conference agreement provided $36 million for JSTARS advance procurement and $140 million for Guard and Reserve procurement. The National Defense Panel criticized planned procurement of weapons that may not be effective against future threats, suggesting a reduction in \"legacy\" programs. The National Defense Panel recommended reducing or terminating \"legacy\" programs and pursuing leap-ahead technologies for land forces, fighter aircraft, and ships with lower radar visibility. Congressional action included requiring a Quadrennial Defense Review and criticizing the Army's Crusader artillery program. The National Defense Panel recommended reducing or terminating \"legacy\" programs and pursuing leap-ahead technologies for land forces, fighter aircraft, and ships with lower radar visibility. SASC criticized the Army's Crusader artillery program and ordered a review in light of the panel's argument. The authorization conference agreement requires a report on Crusader, sexual harassment, gender-integrated training, and other social issues. Last year, the Administration appointed a commission to review gender-integrated training, while Congress established a separate commission. The Administration-appointed commission made recommendations aimed at improving recruitment and training, including providing separate units and barracks for men and women during basic training. The Marine Corps provides separate units and barracks for men and women during basic training, a policy not followed by other services. The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services disagreed with the recommendation for greater gender separation. Secretary of Defense Cohen left it to each service to decide on changes, with no alterations made. The HNSC version of the authorization bill included a provision for separate units and barracks, while SASC prohibited any changes until the congressionally-mandated commission reports. Senator Brownback proposed an amendment to the bill. The HNSC and SASC were at odds over gender-integrated training in the military. The authorization bill allowed current unit training practices to continue but required separate sleeping quarters for men and women in basic training. Defense health care issues were also under discussion. Defense health care issues, including Tricare effectiveness and health care benefits for military retirees, have been under continued discussion. Congress established a demonstration program to test Medicare subvention for military retirees. HNSC and SASC took steps to ensure access to health care for retirees, including testing alternative means such as allowing enrollment in FEHBP. The authorization conference agreement includes three major demonstrations for providing continued health care to retirees. The authorization conference agreement includes three major demonstrations for providing continued health care to retirees, including allowing enrollment in FEHBP, provision of Tricare benefits as a supplement to Medicare, and providing Tricare pharmacy benefits. Defense appropriations bills have earmarked funds for various medical programs, including bone marrow transplants, breast cancer, and prostate cancer research. The Senate version of the defense appropriations bill set aside $250 million for medical R&D earmarks, while the House bill included separate amounts for different medical earmarks. The appropriations conference agreement provides separate earmarked funds for medical programs, including breast cancer and prostate cancer research. The Defense Department faces potential computer problems with the turn of the century, and the House Appropriations Committee added emergency funding to address the Y2K issue. The House Appropriations Committee added emergency funding for the Y2K issue, but the House Republican caucus later decided not to provide the money as emergency appropriations. The defense appropriations bill removed the $1.6 billion in emergency funding, leaving the issue to be addressed in a separate supplemental appropriations bill. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill allocated $1.1 billion for the Defense Department for Y2K conversion and $2.4 billion for other agencies. The defense authorization bill approved funding for Department of Energy weapons-related activities, while DOE funding was provided in the energy and water development appropriations bill. The key issue in the defense authorization bill concerned tritium production for Department of Energy nuclear activities. The defense appropriations bill does not fund DOE, with all funding provided in the energy and water development appropriations bill. A key issue is tritium production for DOE nuclear weapons programs. The House-passed bill prohibits DOE from buying tritium from commercial reactors, leading to potential new facility costs. The Senate bill allows DOE to choose its tritium source, with a one-year review period. Senator Kyl has objected to the authorization conference report. The authorization conference agreement allows DOE to choose its tritium source but prohibits immediate implementation, giving Congress a year to review. Senator Kyl has objected to this provision, feeling it is urgent for DOE to pursue a new tritium source. The House Budget Committee reported the congressional budget for fiscal years 1998-2003. The Senate passed emergency supplemental appropriations for natural disasters and peacekeeping efforts for fiscal year 1998. The House passed a bill for emergency supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 1998. The House and Senate passed emergency supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 1998, with the bill signed into law on May 1, 1998. Additionally, a bill authorizing appropriations for military activities in fiscal year 1999 was introduced and passed by the House and Senate. The bill S. 2057 (Thurmond) authorized appropriations for fiscal year 1999 for military activities of the Department of Defense. It was passed by the House and Senate, with a conference agreement reached and signed into law on October 17, 1998. The Senate approved bill S. 2132 (Stevens) for Department of Defense appropriations for fiscal year 1999, with amendments inserted into H.R. 4103, which passed in lieu of S. 2132. The House also approved H.R. 4103 with amendments on June 24, 1998. The bill H.R. 4328, making omnibus, consolidated appropriations and emergency appropriations for FY1999, went through various stages of approval in both the House and Senate before being signed into law as P.L. 105-262 on October 17, 1998. Another bill, S. 2132, was also passed by the Senate and inserted into H.R. 4103 for Department of Defense appropriations for fiscal year 1999. The Senate approved the conference agreement on October 21, 1998, and it was signed into law as P.L. 105-277 on the same day. The Defense Appropriations for FY1995 to FY1999 and Administration Defense Plan for February 1998 were detailed in billions of current year dollars. Ballistic Missile Defense Funding for FY1999 was also outlined in millions of dollars from various sources. The Congressional Record from May 1998 provides details on Congressional action on major weapons programs for FY1999, including authorization and appropriations amounts in millions of dollars. Notes indicate exclusions of initial spares and military construction costs for various programs.

Notes indicate exclusions of initial spares and military construction costs for various programs. Guard and Reserve Equipment amounts exclude items procured for Guard and Reserve forces in regular line items and do not include C-130 aircraft. Emergency funding provided in the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328) is not included. The FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act (H.R. 4328) details Congressional action on defense authorization and appropriations in billions of dollars. The data includes adjustments to align Senate amounts with House reporting. Differences in structure between authorization and appropriations bills are noted, particularly in Defense Health funding. Sources for the information include various Congressional reports and the Congressional Budget Office. The annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of the Department of Defense (DOD) and other national defense activities. Other appropriations bills also fund DOD activities, including military construction, energy and water development, VA-HUD-independent agencies, and Commerce-Justice-State activities. The defense appropriations bill funds military activities of the Department of Defense and other national defense activities. It is the largest of the defense-related appropriations measures and includes mandatory funding. The FY1999 funding breakdown by appropriations subcommittee is provided in Table B-1. The Administration's defense budget request for FY1999 and projected defense budgets through FY2002 reflect a budget agreement finalized in June 1997. National defense budget authority will grow slowly in nominal terms but remain essentially flat when adjusted for inflation. By FY2003, budget authority for national defense will be almost 38% below the level in FY1985. The defense budget cuts in recent years have mainly reduced military force size and weapons modernization pace. The FY1999 budget requests $48.7 billion for weapons procurement and $36.1 billion for research and development. The goal is to increase procurement funding by reducing defense civilian personnel levels. The Quadrennial Defense Review aims to increase procurement funding by reducing defense civilian personnel levels and transferring the savings to weapons acquisition. The Administration projects $61.3 billion for procurement by FY2001, contingent on achieving savings through defense business reforms and controlling operation and maintenance expenses. Congress has added substantial amounts to the defense budget request in recent years, but due to budget constraints, there is no room for additions in the FY1999 request. Table C2 displays congressional additions to the administration's national defense budget requests in recent years, with data sourced from various government departments and offices. Later adjustments include supplemental appropriations, rescissions, and technical adjustments, particularly in contract authority for Defense Working Capital Funds.
