    "content": "The Act titled \"Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2010\" is cited in Section 1. Congressional findings are outlined in Section 2. The Congress acknowledges that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises, were central to the 2008 financial crisis, leading to a severe economic downturn and job losses. In response, the government took control of the GSEs through conservatorship and provided financial support to stabilize them. In 2008, the Administration established a $200 billion facility to purchase senior preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 2009, the commitment was raised to $400 billion. By 2009, the Government removed limits on Federal funds to cover losses, resulting in over $110 billion in taxpayer funds spent. Taxpayers now own at least 80% of the GSEs, which are being used for Federal housing policy, making private ownership less likely. The Congressional Budget Office has determined that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are effectively government entities. The Congressional Budget Office has concluded that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have effectively become government entities, expected to be a long-term drain on taxpayers due to market conditions and political mandates. Despite this, in 2009, the Treasury Department approved excessive compensation packages for the CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Treasury Department and FHFA approved multi-million dollar compensation packages for top executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, payable in cash. FHFA determined no cash bonuses or long-term incentives for executives in 2008. FHFA's five-year Strategic Plan includes a commitment to safe and sound operations for the GSEs. The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act allows the Director of FHFA to withhold or place executive officer compensation in escrow during a review of its reasonableness and comparability. SEC. 3. REASONABLE COMPENSATION. The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency will suspend 2010 compensation packages for executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Instead, a new compensation system will be established based on government pay rates. Congress suggests that executive officers should return 2009 compensation to the Treasury. The Federal Housing Finance Agency Director will suspend 2010 compensation for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executive officers. A new compensation system based on government pay rates will be implemented. Congress recommends that executive officers return any 2009 excess compensation to the Treasury to reduce the national debt."
