    "content": "The \"Energy Efficient Government Technology Act\" is also known as the Energy Efficient and Energy-Saving Information and Communications Technologies Act. Section 543 of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include a Federal Implementation Strategy for Energy-Efficient and Energy-Saving Information and Communications Technologies. Each Federal agency must collaborate with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop a flexible and cost-effective implementation strategy tailored to their specific operating requirements and statutory mission. Each Federal agency must develop a flexible, cost-effective implementation strategy for energy-efficient information and communications technologies. This strategy should consider various ICT services and products, data center strategies, power management, building information modeling, and secure telework and travel. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, shall establish performance goals for evaluating Federal agencies' efforts in improving energy-efficient information and communications technology systems. This includes specifications and benchmarks for energy-efficient data centers. The Director will establish performance goals for energy-efficient data centers, including specifications, benchmarks, asset utilization, and best practices for achieving energy efficiency. Agencies are required to evaluate energy savings performance contracting and utility energy services contracting as preferred acquisition methods. The Director will establish performance goals for energy-efficient data centers, including measuring IT costs and cost savings over a 3 to 5-year period through energy-efficient solutions. Additionally, a Federal Data Centers Task Force will be maintained to oversee government-wide data center initiatives. The Director will establish performance goals for energy-efficient data centers, including measuring IT costs and cost savings over a 3 to 5-year period through energy-efficient solutions. A Federal Data Centers Task Force comprised of Federal data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers will be responsible for sharing progress towards agency goals and exchanging best practices for increased energy efficiency. Each Federal agency subject to the requirements shall include this information in their reports. Each Federal agency subject to the requirements of this subsection must include a description of their efforts and results in their agency report under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Director of OMB will also include a description of Federal agencies' efforts and results in the annual report and scorecard required under the same Act starting from October 1, 2013. SEC. 3. ENERGY EFFICIENT DATA CENTERS. Section 453 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to designate an information technology industry organization for coordinating energy-efficient government technology programs. The Secretary and Administrator are required to make this designation public. Additionally, a study is mandated to update the Report to Congress on Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency by December 31, 2013, including a comparison and gap analysis. The update to the Report to Congress on Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency includes a comparison of estimates from 2007 to 2012, analysis of technology impact, and updated projections for best practices. Collaboration with designated organizations is required for report preparation. The Data Center Energy Practitioner Program involves collaboration with designated organizations for energy-efficient government technology programs. The Secretary, in collaboration with designated organizations, maintains a data center energy practitioner program for evaluating energy usage in data centers. Federal agencies must have their data centers evaluated every 4 years by certified energy practitioners. Additionally, an open data initiative for Federal data center energy usage data will be established. The Secretary, in collaboration with designated organizations, will establish an open data initiative for Federal data center energy usage data to promote innovation while protecting national security interests. Additionally, efforts will be made to harmonize global specifications and metrics for data center energy efficiency, and an efficiency metric will be developed to measure the overall energy efficiency of data centers."
