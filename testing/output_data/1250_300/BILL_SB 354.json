    "title": "SB 354",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code is amended to apply to all state and local public retirement systems and participating employers, including various specific systems and individual retirement plans. Compliance with the Internal Revenue Code and California Constitution is required for administration. The article excludes certain entities and public employees from its application, protecting their existing retirement plans until specified conditions are met. The article excludes certain public employees from its application if the Secretary of Labor determines it precludes certification under Title 49. It also exempts public employers participating in a multiemployer plan regulated by ERISA before January 1, 2013. The benefit plan applies to new public employee members. The benefit plan under this article applies to new public employee members. Individuals who were employed by a public employer before January 1, 2013, and then became employed by a subsequent public employer on or after that date, will be subject to the retirement plan of the subsequent employer if certain conditions are met. An individual employed before January 1, 2013, who changes positions without a separation from employment and joins a different defined benefit plan in another public retirement system offered by the employer will be subject to that plan as if they were first employed before December 31, 2012. If a public employer offers a defined benefit pension plan with a lower cost formula before January 1, 2013, they can continue to use that formula. However, if they adopt a new formula after January 1, 2013, it must meet certain requirements or be approved by the Legislature. New members can only join the lower cost formula or an approved one. If a public employer offers a retirement benefit plan before January 1, 2013, consisting solely of a defined contribution plan, they can continue with that plan. However, if they adopt a new defined benefit pension plan or formula after January 1, 2013, it must meet certain requirements or be approved by the Legislature. New members can only participate in the existing defined contribution plan or a plan that complies with the requirements. If the Cities of Brea and Fullerton form a joint powers authority after January 1, 2013, they can offer employees the same defined benefit plan they had before. Other cities in Orange County can join this authority by January 1, 2017, with a limit of three cities. On or before January 1, 2017, a city in Orange County contiguous to Brea or Fullerton may join the joint powers authority, limited to three cities. New members must adhere to defined benefit plan requirements. Judges' Retirement Systems are exempt from certain benefit and compensation limitations. Public retirement systems must modify plans to comply with the article's requirements from January 1, 2013 onwards."
