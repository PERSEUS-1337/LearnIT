The increase in student enrollment in elementary and secondary schools will require hiring 150,000 additional teachers over the next decade. Research shows that students in smaller classes learn more in the early grades and continue to outperform their peers even after returning to normal-sized classrooms. It is crucial to adequately educate America's children for the future and improve the learning environment without adding to the Federal bureaucracy or deficit. Congress needs to fund positions for teachers to improve the learning environment without increasing the Federal bureaucracy, deficit, or debt. Resources are needed to accommodate growing enrollment and potentially reduce classroom sizes. The grant program is established to fund positions for teachers and improve the learning environment without increasing bureaucracy, deficit, or debt. The Secretary of Education can award grants to Governors for hiring teachers to reduce overcrowded classes. Governors must apply to receive the grant, and local educational agencies must establish a trust fund to hire new teachers within 2 years of receiving funds. The agency receiving funds must use them to hire new teachers or qualified personnel within 2 years. They must follow accounting practices set by the Governor, allow access to records, ensure a net gain in teachers, review personnel performance annually, limit employment to one year, repay unspent funds after 24 months, and only use the funds to supplement existing resources. The agency must limit employment to one year, repay unspent funds after 24 months, use funds to supplement existing resources, and apply for funding annually. SEC. 4. DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS.
