    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Biodiesel Renewable Fuels Act\" and includes an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding a credit for biodiesel used as fuel. The \"Biodiesel Renewable Fuels Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a biodiesel fuels credit based on the biodiesel mixture rate for different blends of qualified biodiesel mixtures. The credit amount is determined by multiplying the biodiesel mixture rate by the number of gallons of the blend for the taxable year. The \"Biodiesel Renewable Fuels Act\" establishes credits for biodiesel blends, with specific rates for B-1, B-2, and B-20 blends. The applicable amount varies based on the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture. The \"Applicable amount\" for a B-1 blend is calculated as 1.5 cents multiplied by the percentage of biodiesel in the blend divided by 1 percent. A \"qualified biodiesel mixture\" is a blend of diesel and biodiesel sold or used by the taxpayer for fuel purposes in their trade or business. The credit for biodiesel production is only eligible for businesses, not casual off-farm production. The credit amount may be reduced to account for other tax benefits related to biodiesel. Biodiesel is defined as a blend of diesel and biodiesel used for fuel purposes in a trade or business. The term 'biodiesel' is defined as monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils for use in diesel engines. It includes esters from various vegetable oils and must meet registration requirements set by the EPA. The Clean Air Act imposes a tax on individuals who separate biodiesel from a qualified biodiesel mixture or use the mixture for purposes other than fuel. This tax is based on the biodiesel mixture rate and the number of gallons in the mixture. All relevant laws and penalties apply to this tax. The tax on biodiesel mixtures is subject to applicable laws and penalties, similar rules apply for estates and trusts, and taxpayers can elect to not apply for the biodiesel fuels credit for a taxable year. The biodiesel fuels credit can be elected for a taxable year by the last filing date without extensions, as prescribed by the Secretary. This credit is treated as part of the general business credit under section 38(b), and no carryback of the biodiesel fuels credit is allowed before January 1, 2003. The biodiesel fuels credit under section 40A can be carried back to a taxable year before January 1, 2003. Section 40A allows for the use of biodiesel as fuel, with amendments effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2001. Additionally, there is a reduction in motor fuel excise taxes on biodiesel mixtures outlined in Section 3. Section 4081 is amended to include regulations for biodiesel mixtures, allowing for a reduced tax rate on qualified biodiesel mixtures. Diesel fuel used in producing biodiesel mixtures also qualifies for a tax reduction. Section 4081 is amended to include regulations for biodiesel mixtures, allowing for a reduced tax rate on qualified biodiesel mixtures. The amount determined for the biodiesel mixture rate is divided by a percentage based on the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture. Definitions from section 40A apply, and certain rules from subsection (c) also apply. Conforming amendments in section 4041 address the sale or use of qualified biodiesel mixtures. Section 4081 is amended to include regulations for biodiesel mixtures, allowing for a reduced tax rate on qualified biodiesel mixtures. The amendments also include provisions for the Secretary to pay an amount equal to the applicable biodiesel mixture rate to persons using diesel fuel in producing qualified biodiesel mixtures. These amendments will take effect on January 1, 2002. The Highway Trust Fund will be protected from reductions in receipts by transferring funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation based on estimates made by the Secretary of the Treasury. Adjustments will be made for any errors in the estimates."
