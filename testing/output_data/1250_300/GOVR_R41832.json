    "content": "Pakistan is crucial to U.S. interests due to its role in combating religious militancy and addressing various policy concerns such as terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and regional tensions with India. Despite some cooperation in counterterrorism efforts, doubts about Pakistan's commitment to U.S. interests have deepened in recent years. The country's economic challenges, political instability, and security risks further complicate the situation. Pakistan's mixed record in battling Islamist extremism includes tolerance of Afghan insurgents and anti-India militants. The country's troubled economy, political instability, and security challenges pose serious obstacles for U.S. decision makers. Pakistani civilians and security forces have suffered heavy casualties in the fight against extremism, with a high number of terrorist attacks reported. Islamabad's hosting of Osama bin Laden in 2011 raised concerns about its commitment to counterterrorism efforts. In 2011, Pakistan faced scrutiny for harboring Osama bin Laden, leading to strained relations with the US. Accusations of supporting Afghan insurgents further escalated tensions, culminating in a deadly NATO airstrike on Pakistani soldiers. The incident was attributed to poor coordination and communication, sparking anger in Pakistan. Following a deadly NATO airstrike on Pakistani soldiers at Salala, which resulted in 24 casualties, Pakistan expressed fury and suspicion of intentional targeting. This led to the scrapping and renegotiation of bilateral agreements with the US related to supply lines into Afghanistan and covert activities in Pakistani territory. Islamabad demanded a full apology from Washington for restored cooperation, particularly focusing on the closure of Pakistani ground lines of communication (GLOCs) for NATO supplies. Despite anticipation of a deal to reopen the GLOCs, they remain closed to date, overshadowing the May 2012 NATO summit in Chicago. The closure of Pakistani ground lines of communication (GLOCs) for NATO supplies remains unresolved, with negotiations stalled over a proposed fee increase. Additionally, a Pakistani doctor involved in a CIA operation received a 33-year prison sentence for treason, leading to backlash from the US government and Congress. The bilateral relations between the US and Pakistan have been strained, with frozen cooperative aspects. The strained bilateral relations between the US and Pakistan have led to frozen cooperative aspects. Anti-American sentiments and xenophobic conspiracy theories are prevalent among ordinary Pakistanis, with Americans having increasingly poor views of Pakistan. Islamist extremism and militancy in Pakistan remain a central US foreign policy concern. American civilians have been abducted in Pakistan, with one being executed. Islamist extremism and militancy in Pakistan are major concerns for US foreign policy. The presence of key anti-US terrorist leaders in Pakistan, such as Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri, Taliban chief Mullah Omar, and Haqqani Network leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, raises suspicions of government protection. There are growing doubts in Congress about the effectiveness of current US policy towards Pakistan and the wisdom of providing large-scale aid. Increasing numbers in Congress are questioning the effectiveness of current U.S. policy towards Pakistan and the wisdom of providing large-scale aid. Legislation is being considered to curtail U.S. foreign assistance to Pakistan, with concerns about restrictions on aid being counterproductive. The closure of Pakistani supply routes to Afghanistan has not had the expected negative impact, leading to doubts about the benefits of U.S. aid to Pakistan. Pakistan's closure of supply routes to Afghanistan has not been as catastrophic as anticipated. By bowing to domestic pressures, the country risks losing foreign assistance and influence in post-war Afghanistan. President Obama urges Pakistan to increase its efforts in securing the region and neutralizing terrorist safe havens. Defense Secretary Panetta acknowledges Pakistan's ties to terrorist groups but emphasizes the need for cooperation. The United States acknowledges Pakistan's ties to terrorist groups but insists on maintaining a relationship. The US has suspended security assistance to Pakistan and is evaluating their cooperation before releasing further aid. The US has suspended up to $800 million in security assistance to Pakistan and is rigorously evaluating their cooperation before releasing further aid. $1 billion in approved coalition support fund reimbursements also remains undisbursed due to disagreements. Analysts suggest full support for Pakistan's civilian authorities to reduce conflict. Analysts recommend strong U.S. support for Pakistan's civilian government to reduce conflict. However, Pakistan's civilian leaders have shown reluctance to address security policies and extremism, often blaming the United States. This perspective overlooks Pakistan's historical support for Islamist militancy in the region. The Pakistani public and officials feel anxious about the perceived pro-India tilt in US policies, especially regarding Kashmir and civil nuclear cooperation. Pakistan's support for Islamist militancy in the region is a concern, exacerbated by closer ties between Afghanistan and India. This has led to suspicions and threats perceived by Pakistani leaders and citizens towards US-India relations. The events of 2011, including the Salala incident and Pakistan's growing ties with India and the US, have raised concerns within Pakistan's security institutions about strategic encirclement. Analysts predict a shift towards more narrow, issue-based engagement in 2012 and beyond, moving away from the broad strategic partnership envisioned by Amb. Richard Holbrooke. Pakistan's military spokesman emphasized the need for a formal, business-like relationship with agreed-upon limits. In 2012, Pakistan's military spokesman emphasized the need for a formal, business-like relationship with agreed-upon limits, hinting at new restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance. Analysts suggest a \"transactional\" relationship as a realistic alternative to noncooperation. Ambassador Sherry Rehman outlined prerequisites for resetting the bilateral relationship, including apologizing for the Salala incident and halting drone strikes. Islamabad's prerequisites for \"resetting\" the bilateral relationship include apologizing for the Salala incident, releasing suspended CSF reimbursements, increasing counterterrorism intelligence sharing, halting drone strikes, and shifting to a policy of \"trade not aid\" by enhancing Pakistan's access to U.S. markets. Former U.S. diplomats suggest forging a more normal, constructive relationship by reducing mutual expectations, better targeting economic aid programs, fostering substantive business ties, and offering discreet U.S. support for initiatives promoting regional stability. Another expert sees optimism in the Pakistani military's more humble status and improvements in Pakistan-India relations, urging the Obama Administration to take these factors into account. Asia expert and former advisor to Amb. Holbrooke is optimistic about the Pakistani military's more humble domestic status and improvements in Pakistan-India relations. He warns against an overly security-oriented approach by the Obama Administration, which could fuel anti-American nationalism and bolster the military's credibility. Some U.S. analysts criticize Pakistan's intransigence on GLOCs and the Salala incident, calling it a missed opportunity for cooperation. Others believe Pakistan's stance is short-sighted and a strategic mistake. There are calls for a new U.S. policy to address the situation. Some analysts criticize Pakistan's unrelenting stance as a strategic mistake, calling for a more adversarial posture and focused hostility towards Pakistan. Suggestions include targeting individuals for sanctions, cutting military aid, and considering Pakistan an enemy in terms of Afghanistan policy. Threats to end all assistance and retaliate if Pakistan does not comply with U.S. demands are seen as necessary for genuine cooperation. Some analysts suggest a more adversarial approach towards Pakistan, including targeting individuals for sanctions and cutting military aid. Threats to end assistance and retaliate if Pakistan does not comply with U.S. demands are seen as necessary for genuine cooperation. Another viewpoint argues against a shift to a more adversarial approach, advocating for security assurances and targeted efforts to bolster Pakistan's civilian governance institutions instead. The Pakistani military's stance on relations with India is uncertain, with questions about whether it is a tactical move or a strategic shift. Despite potential benefits from a Pashtun-influenced government in Kabul, Pakistan's geostrategic position could suffer from international isolation. Analysts suggest a shift towards energy and trade cooperation with neighbors over conflict with India and strategic depth in Afghanistan. However, Pakistan's security services and public opinion hinder civilian leaders from pursuing such policies effectively. The assassination of liberal politician Salman Taseer and Minorities Minister Shabaz Bhatti in 2011 dealt a blow to liberal forces in Pakistan, with Taseer's killer being hailed as a hero by some sections of society. The incidents highlighted the challenges faced by civilian leaders in pursuing progressive policies due to the influence of security services and public opinion in the country. The assassination of Minorities Minister Shabaz Bhatti in 2011, condemned by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, was a major blow to liberal forces in Pakistan. Bhatti, a Christian member of the federal cabinet, was killed by gunmen who ambushed his car. His death, along with that of liberal politician Salman Taseer, who was killed earlier, highlighted the challenges faced by civilian leaders in pursuing progressive policies in Pakistan. President Zardari addressed the assassinations in an op-ed, expressing concern about the rise of Islamist radicalism in the country. The Taseer and Bhatti assassinations in 2011 highlighted the rise of Islamist radicalism in Pakistan. The case of Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor involved in a shooting incident in Lahore, strained US-Pakistan relations and raised concerns about reducing aid to Pakistan. Senator Kerry visited Islamabad to address the escalating tensions. In mid-February, Senator Kerry visited Islamabad to address escalating tensions over the Raymond Davis case. The CIA negotiated directly with the ISI for Davis's release, which occurred on March 16, 2011, after a pledge of $2.3 million in blood money. Top U.S. officials denied any quid pro quo arrangement. On May 2, 2011, Osama bin Laden was located and killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Osama bin Laden was found and killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, raising doubts about Pakistan's commitment to fighting extremism. Questions arose about Pakistani officials' complicity or incompetence in hiding him. President Obama's advisor suggested bin Laden had a support system in Pakistan. This event led to calls to reduce U.S. aid to Pakistan. After Osama bin Laden was found and killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, doubts were raised about Pakistani officials' complicity or incompetence in hiding him. Pakistan's credibility suffered as its military and intelligence services were criticized for failing to detect the presence of the world's most-wanted terrorist. This led to public demonstrations against the U.S. and threats to close vital supply lines for NATO troops in Afghanistan. Bilateral distrust and acrimony increased significantly. The aftermath of Osama bin Laden's death in Abbottabad, Pakistan led to doubts about Pakistani officials' involvement and raised questions about their competence. This resulted in public demonstrations against the U.S. and threats to close vital supply lines for NATO troops in Afghanistan. Bilateral distrust and acrimony escalated, with Congress questioning the wisdom of continued engagement with Pakistan. Despite calls for greater oversight and accountability, some senior Members advocated for more engagement with Pakistan. President Obama and other top U.S. officials maintained a positive posture towards Pakistan but acknowledged serious questions about the circumstances surrounding the Abbottabad raid. The aftermath of Osama bin Laden's death in Abbottabad raised doubts about Pakistani officials' involvement. President Obama and top U.S. officials maintained a positive posture towards Pakistan but acknowledged serious questions about the circumstances. In May 2011, heavily armed militants attacked Pakistan's naval base near Karachi, killing security personnel and destroying U.S.-supplied aircraft. The attack was claimed by the Pakistani Taliban as revenge for bin Laden's killing. The Pakistani Taliban attacked a naval base near Karachi, destroying U.S.-supplied aircraft in revenge for bin Laden's death. The breach raised concerns about the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Suspicions of inside help led to arrests and court-martials of navy officers. Several navy officers, including the base commander, are facing court-martial for negligence related to the attack on a naval base near Karachi. The ISI is accused of ordering the torture and murder of journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad, who had written about Al Qaeda cells in the Pakistan Navy. The ISI denied involvement, but U.S. officials claimed senior ISI officials directed the attack to silence critics. Admiral Mike Mullen stated that Shahzad's killing was sanctioned by the Pakistani government. The ISI was accused of ordering the murder of journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad to silence critics, with U.S. officials claiming senior ISI officials directed the attack. Admiral Mike Mullen stated that Shahzad's killing was sanctioned by the Pakistani government. In response, the Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million worth of scheduled counterinsurgency training and equipment for Pakistan due to reduced U.S. military presence and obstacles. The Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million worth of scheduled counterinsurgency training and equipment for Pakistan due to reduced U.S. military presence and obstacles. Islamabad's delays in processing U.S. visa requests also led to the suspension of $300 million in planned FY2011 Coalition Support Fund reimbursements. Pakistani military dismissed the impact on future combat operations and suggested reprogramming U.S. security assistance towards development projects. Observers believe the decision may lead to greater resentment rather than cooperation from Pakistani leaders. The Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million in military aid to Pakistan due to delays in visa processing and reduced U.S. military presence. This decision could lead to resentment from Pakistani leaders. In 2011, a scandal known as \"Memogate\" erupted when a memo allegedly requesting U.S. assistance to avert a military coup was linked to then-Pakistani Ambassador Husain Haqqani, leading to his dismissal and pressure on President Asif Zardari. The \"Memogate\" scandal in Pakistan involved an investigation into a memo allegedly requesting U.S. assistance to prevent a military coup, leading to Ambassador Haqqani's dismissal and pressure on President Zardari. Despite lack of evidence, rumors of a military coup persisted, with the army claiming the memo was genuine and a conspiracy against them. Prime Minister Gilani warned against conspiracies to overthrow the elected government and emphasized the military's accountability to parliament. The military in Pakistan responded to rumors of a coup by emphasizing its accountability to parliament and denying any plans for a takeover. Despite tensions with the civilian government, the likelihood of a military coup is considered low due to public aversion and a strong judiciary and media presence. Parliament reaffirmed its supremacy in January. In November 2011, U.S. ground forces near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border mistakenly engaged with Pakistani soldiers, resulting in the death of 24 soldiers. The incident occurred due to a lack of awareness of Pakistani outposts in the area. In November 2011, a tragic incident occurred near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border where 24 Pakistani soldiers were mistakenly killed by U.S. forces. This led to a strong reaction from Pakistan, with accusations of intentional killings and demands for a formal apology from the U.S. Pakistani anger resulted in the closure of NATO's ground logistics routes through Pakistan and the eviction of U.S. personnel from the Shamsi airfield. The supply routes have remained closed for over five months despite Islamabad's initial intention to reopen them. The Pakistani government demands a formal apology from the U.S. for the incident where 24 Pakistani soldiers were mistakenly killed by U.S. forces near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Despite U.S. expressions of regret, Pakistan rejected them and closed NATO's ground logistics routes. The Pentagon conducted an investigation, concluding that U.S. forces acted in self-defense, but Pakistan's military found the blame unjustified and released their perspective in January 2012. The Pakistani perspective on the incident near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border in which 24 soldiers were killed was released in January 2012. It criticized NATO investigators for claiming no Pakistani posts were in the area and blamed the US/ISAF for not sharing their operation with Pakistan. The Obama Administration considered issuing an apology, but some argued against it to maintain pressure on Pakistan for counterinsurgency efforts. Secretary Clinton was reportedly set to apologize in London, but the plan was canceled. In February 2012, U.S.-Pakistan relations were strained when the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee held a hearing on Baluchistan, a province in Pakistan with a separatist conflict. There were calls for the partition of Pakistan into substates, including Baluchistan. Subcommittee Chairman Dana Rohrabacher introduced a resolution expressing support for the self-determination of the people of Baluchistan. Rohrabacher introduced H.Con.Res. 104 supporting Baluchistan's self-determination, angering Islamabad. The resolution had minimal support and drew criticism from Pakistan. The Obama Administration distanced itself from the resolution. The Salala incident led to a freeze in US-Pakistan relations for a review by Pakistan's Parliament. Some saw the review as a sign of assertiveness by the civilian government. The review process of US-Pakistan relations was seen as a display of assertiveness by the civilian government, with demands including the cessation of drone attacks and an apology for the NATO/ISAF attack. The review of US-Pakistan relations demanded an apology for the NATO/ISAF attack, justice for those responsible, and an end to drone strikes and covert operations in Pakistan. It also called for no foreign bases on Pakistani territory and no private security contractors or intelligence operatives. The Obama Administration expressed respect for Pakistani sovereignty despite ongoing drone strikes. U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Marc Grossman, visited Islamabad in late April. Despite continued drone strikes at a reduced rate, U.S. Special Representative Marc Grossman visited Islamabad for high-level talks, including discussions on Pakistan's demands for a halt to drone strikes. However, no breakthrough was achieved, and the CIA's reluctance to give up drone strike capabilities, including \"signature strikes,\" remains a point of contention. Pakistani leaders may refuse to open NATO's ground supply lines to Afghanistan. The U.S. government is withholding $1 billion in military reimbursements and counterterrorism funding from Pakistan until an agreement is reached on key issues, including drone strikes and an apology for the deaths of Pakistani soldiers at Salala. Pakistan insists on abiding by Parliament's recommendations, while also boycotting NATO summits in protest. The NATO summit in Chicago focused on Afghanistan's future engagement. President Zardari attended after a personal invitation, but faced tensions with the U.S. over unresolved issues. President Obama's refusal to meet Zardari and lack of apology for the Salala incident caused embarrassment for Pakistan. Foreign Minister Khar remained optimistic despite the negative atmosphere. Some observers in Pakistan criticized President Zardari's participation in the NATO summit, while Foreign Minister Khar defended Pakistan's role. In a separate incident, a tribal court in Pakistan sentenced Shakil Afridi to 33 years in prison for treason, causing outrage in the United States. The sentence of Shakil Afridi to 33 years in prison for treason outside of Abbottabad jurisdiction sparked outrage in the United States. The Obama Administration and Senate officials condemned the sentence, stating Afridi should be praised, not punished. Islamabad defended the legal process, but concerns were raised about the lack of legal representation and unclear appeal rights. Pakistani commentators also questioned the conviction. The Obama Administration criticized the conviction of Shakil Afridi, sentenced to 33 years for treason without legal representation or clear appeal rights. The biannual assessment of Afghanistan and Pakistan policy in March 2011 noted limited progress in combating Al Qaeda and lack of effective counterinsurgency efforts in Pakistan. The March 2011 certification by Secretary Clinton under the Enhanced Partnership With Pakistan Act of 2009 stated that Pakistan was making efforts to combat terrorist groups and had made progress in ceasing support to extremists. However, this certification was met with skepticism due to concerns about Pakistan's actions against terrorist networks. The certification against the Haqqani Network in the FATA was met with skepticism for being politically driven. The Administration's assessment for FY2011 showed little progress in enhancing civilian control and COIN capabilities in Pakistan. The Pentagon's biannual report to Congress highlighted declining COIN capabilities in Pakistan due to decreased bilateral security cooperation. International efforts to stabilize Pakistan have seen limited progress, with the IMF Stand-By Arrangement on hold. The report also emphasized the ongoing threat posed by the Taliban insurgency and its affiliates operating from sanctuaries in Pakistan, which remain a critical challenge for security and stability in Afghanistan. The report highlights that affiliates operating from sanctuaries in Pakistan pose a critical threat to the U.S.-led effort in Afghanistan. The security situation in eastern Afghanistan is volatile, with Kabul facing persistent security threats planned and controlled from Pakistan. Pakistan's counterinsurgency operations, acceptance of insurgent safe havens, and unwillingness to interdict materials undermine security in Afghanistan. U.S.-Pakistan relations have been strained by issues such as freedom of travel for U.S. diplomats in Pakistan. U.S.-Pakistan relations have been strained by issues such as freedom of travel for U.S. diplomats in Pakistan and the revelation of U.S. citizens working for the ISI to influence U.S. Kashmir policy. President Obama has not visited Pakistan since taking office, and the Strategic Dialogue has not had a formal session since October 2010. High-level interactions continue, especially among military and intelligence officials, with a notable lapse in late 2011/early 2012. In October 2011, Secretary Clinton led a high-level delegation to Islamabad. In late 2011/early 2012, high-level U.S. officials, including Secretary Clinton, CIA Director Petraeus, and others, visited Islamabad to address the issue of militant safe havens in western Pakistan. The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue has been postponed indefinitely, but engagement continues at other levels, with Secretary Clinton meeting Foreign Minister Khar in London in February 2012.

Amb. Grossman also emphasized the desire for an honest and mutually beneficial relationship with Pakistan. President Obama reiterated the U.S. commitment to shared interests with Pakistan, including counterterrorism and stability in Afghanistan. In March and April 2012, there were various high-level meetings between U.S. and Pakistani officials to discuss counterterrorism, Afghanistan, and bilateral relations. Key discussions included border coordination issues, building upon previous conversations, and expressing optimism for a balanced approach that respects Pakistan's sovereignty. Additionally, there was a strong U.S. commitment to improving ties through civilian assistance and development support. Rajiv Shah visited Pakistan to strengthen ties through civilian assistance and development support. Amb. Grossman's visit focused on reopening GLOCs and avoiding drone strikes, but no breakthroughs were made. The U.S.-Pakistan-Afghanistan Tripartite Commission met for the 35th time in Rawalpindi to discuss Afghan stability and border security. Missile strikes by American UAVs in remote regions of Pakistan have been controversial but effective against militants. Missile strikes in Pakistan by American UAVs have been controversial but effective against militants. The CIA oversees the covert program, with President Obama personally approving the targeting \"kill list.\" The strikes have taken a toll on Al Qaeda and other militants but are criticized for civilian casualties and violating Pakistani sovereignty, fueling anti-American sentiment. The Pakistani public strongly condemns drone attacks as a violation of territorial integrity and international law. Despite official rejection, some analysts view drone strikes as necessary and effective against Al Qaeda. The strikes have been linked to diplomatic events, indicating a messaging strategy. The Administration's actions regarding U.S. military aid to Islamabad, drone strikes in Pakistan, and the debate within the government on the effectiveness and impact of UAV attacks. The White House review in mid-2011 reaffirmed support for the CIA drone campaign but implemented changes to involve the State Department more in strike decisions and provide advanced notice to Pakistani officials. The changes aimed to reduce the number of \"signature strikes\" against suspected militants. The White House review in mid-2011 implemented changes to involve the State Department more in strike decisions, provide advanced notice to Pakistani officials, and suspend strikes during their visits. President Obama defended the drone program, claiming minimal civilian casualties, but independent analysts dispute this, estimating hundreds of civilian deaths. Despite targeting militants, violence in western Pakistan has not subsided. With a NATO drawdown in Afghanistan, the U.S. government's drone program's future is uncertain. The U.S. government's drone program in western Pakistan continues despite ongoing violence and a NATO drawdown in Afghanistan. The program has close ties with Pakistan's ISI, which has a history of using militant proxies and engaging in extralegal activities. Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam replaced Lt. Gen. Pasha as the Director-General of ISI in March 2012. The ISI, under direct army control, is led by Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam, who replaced Lt. Gen. Pasha in 2012. He is seen as a potential candidate for the Chief of Army Staff position. U.S. officials accuse the ISI of supporting Afghan insurgents with money, supplies, and planning guidance, fostering ongoing insurgency in Afghanistan. Reports suggest increased ISI-Taliban contacts, with the ISI allegedly providing new explosives to the Taliban. The ISI, led by Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam, is accused of supporting Afghan insurgents with money, supplies, and planning guidance. Insurgent commanders claim ISI increased direct contacts with the Taliban, encouraging violence and supplying high-powered explosives. A leaked NATO report suggests ISI manipulation of Taliban leadership and links to anti-India terrorist groups. Secretary of State Clinton asserts ISI involvement with terrorist elements. Terrorist groups, including Lashkar-e-Taiba, responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attack. Pakistani government's ambivalence towards cracking down on terrorism highlighted by Secretary of State Clinton. Concerns raised about ISI's cooperation with militants and extremists. Pakistan's security services seen as increasingly infiltrated by Islamist extremists. Pakistan's national identity divided between nationalism and Islamism. Two groups within security services: one nationalist led by Gen. Kayani, the other leaderless and driven by extremism. Pakistan's security services are divided between nationalist and Islamist factions. Gen. Kayani leads the nationalist group seeking to maintain the status quo, while the leaderless Islamist faction is driven by extremist ideology. CIA-ISI relations were strained even before the Raymond Davis incident, with American officials frustrated by the lack of Pakistani military action against militants. The Davis affair heightened Pakistani hostility towards U.S. security presence, leading to a crackdown on CIA operatives in Pakistan. The killing of Osama bin Laden further exposed alleged ISI links to Islamist extremism, prompting Pakistan to target its citizens working with the CIA. Following the death of Osama bin Laden in May 2011, Pakistan allowed American investigators access to bin Laden's widows in Pakistani custody. The ISI leadership faced increased pressure from the U.S. regarding collusion with Afghan insurgents, including instances where the CIA informed Islamabad about bomb-making facilities in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Additionally, a Pakistani newspaper revealed the purported name of the CIA's Islamabad station chief, leading U.S. officials to believe these disclosures were deliberate actions by the ISI to demonstrate its leverage and express anger towards U.S. policies. The CIA alerted Islamabad about bomb-making facilities in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas, leading to accusations of collusion between Pakistani officials and Afghan insurgents. Despite Pakistani military denials, U.S. officials believed that militants were tipped off and able to escape raids. Joint intelligence work continued, with the arrest of a key Al Qaeda operative in Karachi shortly after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. A Yemeni national, described as a senior Al Qaeda operative, was arrested in Karachi with U.S.-provided intelligence. Mohammed Ali Qasim Yaqub, a key courier between Al Qaeda leaders, was captured, seen as a Pakistani effort to mend relations with the U.S. Pakistan also pledged to grant visas to CIA officers. Ilyas Kashmiri and Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, top Al Qaeda figures, were reported killed in drone strikes. Pakistan announced the arrest of three senior Al Qaeda operatives near Quetta with CIA assistance, showing continued intelligence cooperation despite worsening government relations. The CIA has allegedly been working with senior Al Qaeda operatives near Quetta, Pakistan, despite worsening government relations. There are reports of a multibillion dollar effort to establish a network of \"secret friends\" in Pakistan. Pakistani leaders have historically sought strategic depth through friendly relations with Afghanistan. The porous border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, known as the Durand Line, has been a point of contention. The Durand Line, a porous border dividing Pashtun tribes, has fueled acrimony between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Both countries are key U.S. allies in combating Islamic militancy, but their goals in Afghanistan differ. Pakistan aims for a dependent Kabul government, while the U.S. seeks an independent Afghanistan. The CIA's alleged collaboration with Al Qaeda near Quetta adds complexity to the already strained relations. The U.S. aims for an independent Afghanistan, while Pakistan seeks a dependent Kabul government. Washington seeks Islamabad's support for Afghan reconciliation talks, but tensions arise due to differing approaches. Pakistan is perceived to use proxies like the Quetta Shura and Haqqani Network in dealings with Kabul, increasing its leverage in the reconciliation process. Pakistani officials are confused by U.S. goals for Afghanistan and pressure to use force against militants in North Waziristan. Some believe the ISI has been supporting insurgent groups. U.S. officials stress the need for Pakistani cooperation for stability in Afghanistan despite troubled relations with Kabul. Afghan insurgents find safe havens in Pakistani cities, hindering pacification efforts in Afghanistan. Insurgents find safe havens in Pakistani cities like Quetta and Karachi, hindering pacification efforts in southern and eastern Afghanistan. Declassified U.S. documents show Taliban resurgence in mid-2000s linked to FATA sanctuaries. Afghan officials openly accuse Pakistan of aiding terrorism in Afghanistan, with historic wariness of Pakistani influence persisting. Analysts are cynical about Islamabad's use of \"Pashtun jihadi proxies\" and military dominance aims over Afghan neighbors. Concerns arise over potential U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and its impact on Pakistani interests. Many analysts are concerned about the U.S. military drawdown from Afghanistan signaling a lack of long-term commitment to the region. Pakistani leaders emphasize the importance of Afghan stability and have made efforts to upgrade the Afghanistan-Pakistan Joint Commission. Prime Minister Gilani's meetings in Kabul raised concerns among American observers as he criticized the U.S. and sought closer ties with China. Prime Minister Gilani aimed to shift Kabul's allegiance from the U.S. to Pakistan and China, advocating for Afghan and Pakistani ownership of the peace process. Despite initial commitments to improved ties, tensions arose in 2011 due to cross-border incidents, with accusations of attacks and counterattacks between the two countries.

Islamabad supports peace efforts with the Afghan Taliban, aiming to control negotiations and limit India's influence in post-conflict Afghanistan. Pakistani elements reportedly orchestrated the arrest of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar to facilitate talks with Taliban commanders for reconciliation negotiations. In mid-2010, Pakistan launched an effort to broker reconciliation between Kabul government and Haqqani Network, sparking concerns of Islamabad exploiting the political situation for maximal influence in post-conflict Kabul. NATO facilitated secret travel of QST figures and Haqqani Network representatives to Kabul for meetings with Afghan officials, indicating Islamabad's influence over Afghan insurgents. In 2011, reports suggested ISI officials were involved in Afghan insurgent activities. The U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan indicated Pakistan's reluctance to allow Taliban leaders to attend reconciliation talks in Kabul. Afghan President Karzai criticized insurgent leaders in Pakistan for not being independent enough to negotiate. By early 2012, Islamabad seemed to be cooperating with U.S.-Taliban negotiations. Despite initial skepticism, Prime Minister Gilani later urged Afghan Taliban leaders to engage in peace talks. Prime Minister Gilani issued an open appeal to Afghan Taliban leaders for national reconciliation and peace, despite Foreign Minister Khar dismissing the idea as unrealistic. There are concerns about Pakistan's ties with Afghan insurgent groups, particularly the Haqqani Network, seen as a strategic threat to Afghan stability and U.S. national security interests. The U.S. transition planning for Afghanistan is viewed by some as a cover for a hasty exit strategy. The Haqqani Network is considered a significant threat to Afghan stability and U.S. national security interests. They are Afghanistan's most capable insurgent group with ties to al-Qaeda. Calls for military offensives against them have been made, but Pakistan has been reluctant to act due to their historical relationship with the group. The Haqqanis have carried out high-profile attacks in Afghanistan, causing tensions with U.S. and Afghan officials. The Haqqani Network poses a significant threat to Afghan stability and U.S. national security. They have carried out high-profile attacks in Afghanistan, including assaults on Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel and the U.S. Embassy compound. These attacks have strained relations between the U.S. and Pakistan, with calls for military action against the Haqqanis. The Haqqani Network's raid in Kabul's secure area raised concerns about Afghanistan's security. Admiral Mullen urged Pakistani military action against Haqqani bases, escalating tensions. Secretary Panetta issued a warning to Pakistan to protect US forces from future attacks. Mullen accused ISI of supporting Haqqani network, leading to strained US-Pakistan relations. The Haqqani network, supported by Pakistan's ISI, was responsible for various attacks in Afghanistan. US officials called for pressure on Pakistan to address the issue, signaling a new stance on Pakistan's double-game. President Obama acknowledged the unclear intelligence on the ISI-Haqqani relationship but emphasized the need for Pakistan to address the problem. President Obama acknowledged the unclear intelligence on the ISI-Haqqani relationship but emphasized the need for Pakistan to address the problem. The Wardak truck bombing was a turning point in hardening Secretary Clinton's attitude toward the Haqqanis. Haqqani fighters have been implicated in numerous attacks on coalition targets in Afghanistan. Islamabad denies responsibility for the violence and rejects claims of supporting the Haqqanis. Pakistani officials warned the US of damaging the bilateral relationship with allegations. President Zardari criticized verbal assaults against Pakistan. Pakistani officials have sought to facilitate a rapprochement between the Haqqanis and Kabul. President Zardari criticized verbal assaults against Pakistan, warning that it could harm the bilateral relationship. Pakistani officials have been trying to facilitate peace talks between the Haqqanis and Kabul, but the Haqqanis' ties to Al Qaeda have been a major obstacle. Pakistan believes it can influence the Haqqanis to negotiate, but this could give Islamabad a central role in the process, which some in Washington may oppose. The Obama Administration is considering formally designating the Haqqani group. The Obama Administration is considering designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) under U.S. law, despite pressure from some senior Senators. Secretary Clinton has indicated the need to negotiate with the Haqqani leadership for sustainable peace in Afghanistan. The Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act of 2011 was passed by the Senate but has not been enacted. The Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act of 2011 (S. 1959) was passed by the Senate in December 2011 but has not progressed in the House committee. Congressional frustration with the Administration's delay in the formal review for FTO designation has increased in 2012. Ammonium nitrate (AN) is a widely used fertilizer and chemical explosives precursor in Afghanistan, with most IEDs using AN. Despite a ban on AN in Afghanistan, illicit shipments still come from Pakistan. The summer of 2011 saw a peak in IED events in Afghanistan, but improved detection and clearing capabilities have reduced the effective IED attack rate. The summer of 2011 saw historic peaks in total IED events in Afghanistan, but improved detection and clearing capabilities have led to a decline in the effective IED attack rate. The U.S. government is urging Islamabad to adjust Pakistani national laws to restrict access to ammonium nitrate in Afghanistan or enhance border security efforts. Washington's efforts include diplomatic, law enforcement, and science and technology initiatives involving JIEDDO, State Department's SRAP staff, and Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement office. Operation Global Shield is a multilateral law enforcement operation launched in late 2010 to combat the illicit trafficking of chemical explosives precursors. Adding urea fertilizer granules to ammonium nitrate can complicate processing for explosives, while other options include adding colored dyes or radio frequency identification tags for tracking shipments. Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan, is the country's largest fertilizer complex. Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan, is the country's largest fertilizer complex, producing over 300,000 metric tons of ammonium nitrate annually since 2004. Legislation in Islamabad aims to restrict AN and other precursors, but changes are unlikely in the near term. The United States relies on Pakistani authorities to combat illicit trafficking, while NATO uses logistics routes through Pakistan to supply forces in Afghanistan. NATO relies on ground and air lines of communication through Pakistan to supply forces in Afghanistan. These routes have been closed for six months due to Pakistan's anger over incidents. Insurgents have targeted supply lines, leading to destruction of trucks and deaths of drivers. Truck drivers often pay bribes to officials to reach the Afghan border from Karachi. The U.S. military began testing alternative routes to supply forces in Afghanistan, including the \"Northern Distribution Network\" (NDN) from Central Asia and Russia. Loss of Pakistani supply routes has not been as damaging as expected, with the NDN carrying over half of NATO's supplies. Despite the preference for Pakistan's faster and cheaper logistics route, the U.S. has expanded aerial and NDN routes, even though they are more costly and rely on authoritarian regimes in Central Asia. Reopening the Pakistani routes would be helpful but not essential for Afghan operations. In Central Asia, the loss of Pakistani supply routes has not been as damaging as expected for Afghan operations. The closure of the GLOCs has caused a backlog of equipment for Afghan security forces, with over 4,100 vehicles stranded in Pakistan. NATO will need to remove at least 100,000 shipping containers and 70,000 vehicles worth $30 billion from Afghanistan. U.S. commanders are insistent on reopening the Pakistani GLOCs as the spring \"fighting season\" approaches in 2012. NATO needs to remove 100,000 shipping containers and 70,000 vehicles worth $30 billion from Afghanistan. U.S. commanders are pushing for the reopening of Pakistani GLOCs as the spring \"fighting season\" approaches in 2012. Pakistani officials indicated that reopening was imminent, but negotiations stalled over a proposed fee increase to $5,000 per truck. The Pentagon is facing a drastic price hike of $5,000 per truck for the use of Pakistani GLOCs, which was previously considered \"free\" in exchange for CSF reimbursements. The Senate Armed Services Committee finds this fee unacceptable, with one member calling it \"extortion.\" Negotiations on the issue have not been resolved. Pakistan continues to struggle with Islamist extremism, militancy, separatist insurgency in Baluchistan, and politically motivated violence in Karachi. Despite a decline in terrorist incidents since 2009, Pakistan still ranks third globally in both measures according to the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center. Pakistan has seen a significant decline in terrorist incidents since 2009 but still ranks third globally in both measures. Suicide bombings have increased in recent years, with nearly half of all worldwide deaths from such attacks occurring in Pakistan. The drop in Islamist attacks in 2011 was attributed to military operations, drone strikes, and improved law enforcement. However, some observers believe the government is sometimes influenced by terrorists. Various Islamist militant groups operate in the country, often targeting military and intelligence institutions. The Islamabad government has shown some improvement in law enforcement, but is sometimes seen as being influenced by terrorists. Various Islamist militant groups in Pakistan have become more intermingled and mutually supportive since 2009. Al Qaeda terrorists still operate in Pakistani territory, although weakened in recent years. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) emerged as a coherent grouping in late 2007, with representatives from different tribal agencies. The Quetta Shura Taliban and Haqqani Network are also active in different regions of Pakistan. Islamist militant groups in Punjab province have regional and global jihadist aspirations, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba. The Haqqani Network of Afghan insurgents is based in North Waziristan and Kurram agencies of FATA. Punjab province in Pakistan is home to various Islamist militant groups, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which is seen as a growing threat to U.S. national security. The LeT is identified as the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia, with potential to become a global threat. Pakistan's Ambassador to the U.S. criticizes the country's focus on U.S. violations of sovereignty instead of combating jihadist ideology that has caused many Pakistani casualties. The Haqqani Network, based in North Waziristan and Kurram agencies of FATA, criticizes Pakistan's focus on U.S. violations of sovereignty instead of combating jihadist ideology that has caused many Pakistani casualties. The Pakistan army has deployed troops in response to militancy, with significant casualties in combat. U.S. government assessments paint a discouraging picture of recent efforts in conflict-affected regions. The Pakistani military has faced challenges in the \"holding\" and \"building\" phases of operations in conflict-affected regions like Swat Valley and South Waziristan. Despite some successes in dislodging militants, sustained progress in counterinsurgency has been elusive. The air force has conducted numerous combat sorties and bombings in the FATA, with ongoing sporadic offensives in Kurram and Khyber agencies. The Pakistani military has flown over 5,500 combat sorties in the FATA, dropping more than 10,000 bombs and destroying 4,600 targets. Bloody fighting continues in Kurram and Khyber agencies. The army has had some success in degrading LI's capabilities, but a simmering insurgency still affects most FATA agencies. North Waziristan is currently the most important haven for Al Qaeda and Taliban-allied groups. The North Waziristan agency is a key haven for Afghan- and Pakistan-oriented militants, including the Haqqani Network and TTP forces. Pakistani officials have been hesitant to move their military into this area, citing the need to consolidate control. Pakistan's military is inexperienced in counterinsurgency and lacks the necessary hardware for effective operations. The Pakistani Taliban was splintered in 2011 due to military operations, political strategies, drone strikes, and internal power struggles. Pakistan's military operations and political strategies, along with drone strikes and internal power struggles, effectively splintered the Pakistani Taliban in 2011. This led to a decrease in suicide bomb attacks in the country. The TTP leader Hakimullah Mehsud has faced opposition from other militant commanders, leading to internal conflicts within the group. Pakistani officials have shown openness to negotiations with TTP militants, especially as the United States began favoring talks with the Afghan Taliban. Pakistani civilian officials in late 2011 were open to negotiations with TTP militants, coinciding with US talks with the Afghan Taliban. Meetings with government reps were claimed by TTP deputy chief Maulvi Faqir Muhammad. Despite initial denials, negotiations seem to have occurred, possibly influenced by Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar. Al Qaeda and Haqqani group mediators reportedly facilitated a pact to unify militant factions under Omar's leadership in Waziristan. Pakistani militants are making peace with the Pakistani army under Mullah Omar's leadership in Waziristan. The Haqqanis and other commanders are forming a group to focus hostility on Afghanistan. The US offered a reward for information on Hafiz Saeed, causing tension in US-Pakistan relations. $10 million reward offered for information leading to the conviction of Hafiz Saeed, the Pakistani citizen and leader of the terrorist group responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attack. The announcement sparked tensions in US-Pakistan relations, with Prime Minister Gilani criticizing it as a negative move that would widen the trust deficit between the two countries. In April, militants attacked a prison in Bannu, freeing nearly 400 prisoners, including a terrorist sentenced to death for a 2003 plot against President-General Pervez Musharraf. An inquiry blamed local authorities and intelligence agencies for the security lapse, which bolstered Pakistani Taliban forces and raised concerns about the state's security apparatus. The Pakistani Taliban forces were bolstered by an attack on a prison in Bannu, which raised concerns about the state's security apparatus. Secretary of State Clinton urged Pakistan to take more action against terrorist sanctuaries and criticized the government for not doing enough against Hafiz Saeed. U.S. officials are worried about extremist groups in Pakistan posing threats to the United States and its allies. In 2010, concerns grew over American citizens involved in Islamist terrorism in Pakistan. Faisal Shahzad, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin, attempted a car bomb attack in Times Square, claiming training in western Pakistan. Other cases involved U.S. citizens in terrorist plots, including a Pakistani-born American in the 2008 Mumbai attack and David Coleman Headley, a Chicagoan convert to Islam, linked to the LeT terrorist group. Headley's case revealed a direct link to terrorism by a former Pakistani military officer. David Coleman Headley, a Chicagoan convert to Islam, traveled to Mumbai multiple times from 2006 to 2008 as a scout for the Pakistan-based LeT terrorist group. He pleaded guilty to charges and was linked to a retired Pakistani major suspected of being an LeT contact. Headley also interacted with Ilayas Kashmiri, a former Pakistani special forces commando with ties to Al Qaeda. Indian officials gained access to Headley in 2010, revealing an official Pakistani role in the Mumbai attack. In 2011, testimony was heard in the trial of Tahawwur Rana, who was charged with supporting terrorism related to the attack. The Chicago court heard testimony in Rana's trial, where he was charged with supporting terrorism related to the Mumbai attack. Three senior LeT members, including LeT chief Hafez Saeed and a purported ISI officer named \"Major Iqbal,\" were indicted in the case. Headley, the prosecution's key witness, revealed links between the ISI and terrorism, straining U.S.-Pakistan relations. Rana was acquitted of Mumbai attack charges but found guilty of aiding LeT and conspiring to attack a Danish newspaper. The longstanding rivalry between Pakistan and India, marked by three wars and ongoing military tensions, stems from the acrimonious partition of British India in 1947 and the unresolved Kashmir issue. Both countries have invested heavily in defense, impacting economic and social development. A \"Composite Dialogue\" between the two nations was reinitiated in 2004. The unresolved issue of Kashmiri sovereignty has been a major source of tension between nuclear-armed Pakistan and India since 1947. Both countries have large defense establishments, impacting economic and social development. A \"Composite Dialogue\" in 2004 led to modest successes, but relations deteriorated in 2008 after a terrorist attack in Mumbai. Territorial disputes over Kashmir, Siachen Glacier, and Sir Creek remain unresolved, with water resources also causing conflict in 2010. Pakistani leaders emphasize the importance of regional peace. Disputes over Kashmir, Siachen Glacier, and Sir Creek remain unresolved. Conflict over water resources emerged in 2010. Pakistani leaders stress the importance of regional peace. The US government maintains a policy of distance from the Kashmir dispute. Pakistan and India are involved in a \"shadow war\" in Afghanistan. Islamabad accuses New Delhi of interference in Pakistan's western regions. India holds Islamabad responsible for anti-India terrorist groups in Pakistan. India has refused to reengage in Composite Dialogue issues since the 2008 Mumbai attack. India and Pakistan resumed peace talks in early 2011, with high-level discussions and agreements on establishing a \"terror hotline\" and increasing economic cooperation. Bilateral talks included expanding confidence-building measures related to nuclear and conventional weapons, as well as boosting trade and travel. The June meeting in Islamabad between foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan resulted in positive agreements to expand confidence-building measures on nuclear and conventional weapons, increase trade and travel across the Kashmiri LOC. A successful Joint Statement was issued during Foreign Minister Khar's visit to New Delhi in July, signaling a revived peace process. Trade ministers from both countries met in September to further liberalize bilateral trade, addressing challenges like high transaction costs and slow deliveries. India also supported an EU initiative to waive duties on Pakistani exports from flood-affected areas. The killing of OBL impacted relations between Pakistan and India, with Indian PM Singh viewing it as a significant step against terrorism. The death of OBL had implications for Pakistan-India relations. Indian PM Singh saw it as a blow to AQ but was concerned about a hastened US withdrawal from Afghanistan. New Delhi used the opportunity to push for extradition of Mumbai attack suspects in Pakistan. Afghanistan's new strategic framework with India heightened Pakistan's fears of encirclement. Kabul's efforts to reconcile with the Taliban were also noted. In the 21st century, Afghanistan's closer ties with India raised Pakistan's fears of encirclement. The pact was seen as provocative and could hinder efforts to reduce Pakistan's reliance on militant proxies in Afghanistan. Pakistan's relations with India have improved, with progress in trade and visa agreements that could boost bilateral trade. Granting Most-Favored Nation (MFN) trade status to India by the end of 2012 could significantly boost bilateral trade with lower tariffs and fewer visa restrictions. Pakistan's move towards freer trade and the absence of terrorist attacks traced to Pakistan in India for over three years indicate progress in relations. President Zardari's visit to India in 2012 marked a positive step, following improved trade and visa agreements between Pakistan and India. In April 2012, President Zardari visited India for a lunch meeting with Prime Minister Singh, the first such visit by a Pakistani head of state since 2005. Shortly after, an avalanche at Siachen Glacier killed 139 Pakistani soldiers. Despite the tragedy, both governments remain unwilling to redeploy their forces in the region. In May 2012, Pakistan and India signed pacts with Turkmenistan to build a natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan, supported by the US as part of the New Silk Road Initiative. The New Silk Road Initiative, supported by Washington, aims to build a $7.6 billion energy project in Afghanistan to bypass Iran. However, security concerns in Afghanistan raise doubts among investors. India's reluctance to make concessions is influenced by Pakistan's failure to prosecute Mumbai attack masterminds and the presence of militant groups. Islamabad faces criticism for not acting on evidence provided by India. Despite these challenges, progress on the economic front is slow. Pakistan's generals play a crucial role in determining the future of relations with India. China has been a significant arms supplier to Pakistan since the 1960s and is heavily involved in the Pakistani economy. Beijing's plans to build nuclear reactors in Pakistan may violate international guidelines. China's involvement in the Pakistani economy is significant, with plans to build new civilian nuclear reactors in violation of international guidelines. The two countries have signed multiple agreements for cooperation in various sectors, totaling billions of dollars. Pakistan responded promptly to Chinese concerns about terrorist activities originating from Pakistan. China has expressed worries about Uighur separatists finding refuge in Pakistan, straining bilateral relations. In 2012, Beijing expressed concerns about Uighur separatists finding refuge in Pakistan, straining bilateral relations. Pakistani leaders showed increased closeness with China in 2011, with agreements for defense purchases. China and the United States share an interest in strengthening Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities. The United States and China are interested in strengthening Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities, with China recognizing the potential harm to its economic interests in the region from Pakistan-based terrorist groups. This could lead to greater U.S.-China coordination to improve Pakistan's military and intelligence services and pressure Islamabad to dismantle jihadist groups. Additionally, Chinese support for Pakistan hinders India's regional ambitions, while the U.S. seeks to deepen its partnership with India. Cooperation between the United States and China could expand into nonproliferation, governance, and economic growth in Pakistan. China's military and diplomatic support for Pakistan hinders India's regional ambitions. The Chinese government is unlikely to get involved in any U.S.-Pakistani rift and has no intention of replacing Washington as Islamabad's primary foreign benefactor. Pakistan's relations with Iran have been troubled by differences over Afghanistan and the presence of anti-Shia terrorist groups. Pakistan and Iran have cooperated on a pipeline project despite differences over Afghanistan and anti-Shia terrorist groups. Tehran claims construction on its side is complete and offered $500 million for Pakistan's side after a Chinese consortium withdrew. The US opposes the project due to Iran sanctions, but Islamabad remains committed to completing it. The US has expressed concerns to Pakistan about the Iran sanctions law violation related to a pipeline project. Tehran has tried to bypass sanctions by proposing barter deals with Pakistan. The security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is a top US concern due to the influence of Islamist militants and past illicit proliferation activities. Despite improvements, there are ongoing worries about potential leakage of nuclear know-how or technologies from Pakistan. Pakistan's nuclear security has improved, but concerns remain about potential leakage of nuclear know-how. Recent reports show a rapid growth in Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, possibly in response to US-India civil nuclear cooperation. China's plan to build nuclear reactors in Pakistan raises international concerns. Economic challenges, exacerbated by 2010 flooding, add to Pakistan's woes. The economic challenges in Pakistan, including unemployment, food and energy shortages, and corruption, have been worsened by devastating flooding in 2010 and 2011. Foreign direct investment has decreased significantly, mainly due to increasing militancy, global recession, and political instability. Pakistan's economic priorities include addressing inflation, budget deficit, reviving growth, and dealing with higher global oil prices. Pakistan's economic priorities include addressing inflation, budget deficit, reviving growth, and dealing with higher global oil prices. India's economic growth surpassed Pakistan's in the early 2000s, leading to higher national wealth figures. Islamabad sought multi-billion dollar loans from the IMF in 2008, with $3.6 billion yet to be disbursed from the $11.3 billion Stand-By Arrangement. The program was halted in 2010 due to a lack of required reforms, and any future IMF program is expected to have stricter conditions. Pakistan's $3.6 billion IMF Stand-By Arrangement is yet to be fully disbursed due to a lack of required reforms. Security concerns in 2011 further delayed negotiations, prompting Pakistan to seek U.S. help in influencing the IMF for relaxed conditions. Repayment of IMF loans will strain Islamabad's budget, with low revenue generation and high military spending exacerbating the situation. Secretary Clinton has criticized Pakistan's low tax-to-GDP ratio. Pakistan's low revenue generation is attributed to mass tax evasion by the economic elite and excessive military spending. Secretary Clinton has criticized the country's 9% tax-to-GDP ratio, one of the lowest globally. Efforts to implement tax reforms and reduce fuel subsidies have faced challenges, leading to political turmoil. Electricity shortages have further deteriorated the economy, forcing businesses to shut down due to power outages. Public protests over gas shortages have turned violent in some cities. Public protests over gas shortages in Pakistan have turned violent, with citizens ransacking offices and torching vehicles. Despite economic growth, the country faces challenges such as severe energy shortages and high inflation. Plans to address these issues, including tax reforms and subsidy reductions, have been delayed. The World Bank highlights deficiencies in Pakistan's economy, including low tax revenues and power shortages. Reforms such as implementing a general sales tax and broadening the income tax net are delayed. Power outages are estimated to reduce GDP growth by up to 4%. The Bank attributes these issues to poor governance. International financial institutions regularly assess the Pakistani economy, noting a deteriorated fiscal situation and lack of governance improvements. The outlook is negative, with significant macroeconomic risks. The World Bank recommends focusing on human development sectors. The World Bank and IMF report a negative outlook for Pakistan's economy due to fiscal deterioration and governance issues. Recommendations include focusing on human development sectors, strengthening public finances, reforming the energy sector, and reducing inflation. Pakistani leaders aim to improve access to Western markets, but security concerns deter foreign investors. Pakistani leaders aspire to improve access to Western markets, particularly for textile exports. The textile sector, employing 3.5 million people and accounting for 40% of urban factory jobs, seeks reduced tariffs on exports. Democracy in Pakistan has been unstable, marked by power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs. The bicameral Parliament holds federal power under the constitution. Pakistan has a history of power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs, with direct military rule for over half of its existence. The bicameral Parliament, consisting of a 342-seat National Assembly and a 100-seat Senate, holds federal power. President Zardari was elected in September 2008, but the military still influences foreign and national security policies. The civilian government led by the PPP has struggled to stay in power and enact reforms, while the judiciary battles with the executive branch over corruption charges. The judiciary empowered by the 2008 \"Lawyer's Movement\" continues to battle with the executive branch in Pakistan, seeking to pursue corruption charges against politicians, including President Zardari. Political turmoil threatens economic chaos due to widening deficits, with the PPP facing threats to its majority status from coalition politics. The MQM's withdrawal and rejoining of the ruling coalition in reaction to rising fuel prices and inflation have raised concerns about government stability. In 2011, the MQM withdrew and rejoined the ruling coalition three times, aiming to gain more administrative control in Karachi. The PPP strengthened its position by forming an alliance with the PML-Q faction and securing support in Punjab for the upcoming elections. The ANP, a PPP coalition ally, also governs the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Senate elections in 2012 were crucial for Zardari's political safety as PPP gains ensured control of the Senate. Senate elections in February 2012 were crucial for Zardari's political safety as PPP gains ensured control of the Senate through 2015. The circumstances of OBL's death embarrassed the Pakistani military, leading to rare domestic criticism and a potential shift in civilian leaders' control over foreign and national security policies. Despite media criticism of the security establishment, civilians have not taken advantage of the opportunity to assert more authority. Media criticism of the security establishment continued at unprecedented levels throughout the year, with little civilian response. Parliament formed a commission to investigate bin Laden's presence in Pakistan and American forces' incursion. Civil-military tensions escalated post-bin Laden raid, raising fears of a military coup. Political turmoil ensued in early 2012, with Prime Minister Gilani facing contempt charges for not pursuing a corruption case against President Zardari. In early 2012, Prime Minister Gilani faced contempt charges for not pursuing a corruption case against President Zardari, who claimed immunity. The Supreme Court issued a contempt notice, found Gilani guilty, but only sentenced him for the time it took to adjourn. Despite opposition demands for resignation, legal scholars predict Gilani may be disqualified after the appeal period ends in June. The State Department refrained from commenting, calling it a domestic political issue. Meanwhile, former cricket hero Imran Khan and his PTI party gained political prominence in late 2011. In late 2011, former cricket hero Imran Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party gained political prominence in Pakistan by attracting support from young and middle-class Pakistanis with anti-corruption and anti-American sentiment. Khan's rallies in Lahore and Karachi drew huge crowds, and the PTI has since won converts from major national parties. Khan poses a threat to former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League. While unlikely to win enough seats to become Prime Minister in 2013, Khan could become a \"kingmaker\" in future governance arrangements. He has vowed to cut off U.S. aid and end conflict with the Pakistani Taliban if he comes to power. Imran Khan's rise in late 2011 reflected the Pakistani public's desire for honest politicians. He has vowed to cut off U.S. aid, end conflict with the Pakistani Taliban, and tackle corruption if he comes to power. Khan's popularity has attracted support from young and middle-class Pakistanis, posing a threat to mainstream parties. Additionally, the emergence of conservative Islamist political forces under the Difa-e-Pakistan Council is a concern for international observers. The Difa-e-Pakistan Council (DPC) is a coalition of over 40 Islamist and right-wing parties, including banned extremist groups, advocating for an end to cooperation with the US and India. Led by Hafiz Saeed of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), the DPC opposes reopening the GLOCs and accuses the US and India of involvement in Baluchistan's insurgency. Anti-American sentiment is prevalent in Pakistani politics, with security services possibly supporting the DPC as leverage against the US and civilian leaders. Pakistan is also plagued by reported human rights abuses. Pakistan's security services may benefit from the rise of the Difa-e-Pakistan Council (DPC) as a tool of leverage against the United States and Pakistan's civilian leaders. The country has a poor human rights situation with serious abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, disappearances, and lack of government accountability. Other issues include poor prison conditions, arbitrary detention, weak criminal justice system, and infringements on citizens' privacy rights. The human rights situation in Pakistan is dire, with widespread abuses such as extrajudicial killings, torture, disappearances, and lack of government accountability. There are also issues of poor prison conditions, arbitrary detention, weak criminal justice system, infringements on citizens' privacy rights, harassment of journalists, restrictions on freedom of assembly and movement, religious freedom violations, discrimination against minorities, corruption, violence against women, child abuse, human trafficking, and societal discrimination. The human rights situation in Pakistan is dire, with widespread abuses such as forced labor, discrimination against minorities, violence by militant organizations, and attacks on journalists. The country is ranked as the most dangerous for journalists, with concerns over disappearances and extrajudicial killings by security forces. Laws prohibiting blasphemy are popular but criticized for restricting freedom of expression. The blasphemy laws in Pakistan are popular but criticized for being discriminatory and arbitrary in their application. In late 2010, a Pakistani Christian woman was sentenced to death for a minor offense, sparking calls for the law's repeal. Despite initial promises of reform, the government backed away after facing opposition from hardline Islamist groups. Several government officials advocating for reform were assassinated, leaving National Assembly member Sherry Rehman as the sole politician pursuing legislative changes. In 2011, two government proponents of reforming blasphemy laws in Pakistan were assassinated. National Assembly member Sherry Rehman withdrew her legislative proposal after PPP leaders announced no reforms would be undertaken. Congress renewed large U.S. assistance packages to Pakistan, totaling $15.3 billion over ten years, with $8.3 billion for development and humanitarian aid and $7 billion for security programs. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009 authorized increased nonmilitary aid and placed conditions on security-related aid. The Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act (EPPA) of 2009, also known as the \"Kerry-Lugar-Berman\" (KLB) bill, became law. Congress established the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) to enhance Pakistani security forces' ability to combat militancy. Billions of dollars have been appropriated for coalition support funds to reimburse Pakistan for its support of U.S.-led counterterrorism operations. The Administration's Pakistan Assistance Strategy Report outlined nonmilitary U.S. assistance objectives for building a stable Pakistan, with a proposed budget of $3.5 billion for FY2010-FY2014. The U.S. proposed $3.5 billion in nonmilitary assistance to Pakistan for infrastructure programs in energy and agriculture sectors. There are plans to help launch the construction of the Diamer Basha dam, a $12 billion project that could generate 4,500 megawatts of electricity. Concerns about corruption and capacity have hindered the spending of aid funds. The majority of appropriated aid funds for Pakistan have not been spent due to concerns about corruption and capacity. Security-related U.S. assistance includes \"train and equip\" programs, but major arms transfers have been slow. Pakistani officials have complained about delays in receiving defense equipment needed for counterinsurgency operations. Pakistani officials have complained about delays in receiving defense equipment needed for counterinsurgency operations, impacting the effectiveness of U.S. aid programs. The circumstances of OBL's death have led to a reevaluation of aid levels and the bilateral relationship, with significant reductions and new restrictions in pending legislation. Critics have raised concerns that U.S. military aid may not be effectively combating Islamist militancy in Pakistan. The U.S. has faced criticism for its military aid to Pakistan, with calls for more nonmilitary aid to strengthen civil society. Legislation in FY2013 includes provisions to limit aid to Pakistan until certain conditions are met, such as reopening ground lines of communication to Afghanistan. The U.S. government imposes conditions on military aid to Pakistan, including limiting FY2013 CSF payments to $650 million, withholding payments unless certain criteria are met, and restricting the disbursement of FY2013 PCF funds. The U.S. government imposes conditions on military aid to Pakistan, including limiting FY2013 CSF payments to $650 million and withholding payments unless certain criteria are met. Additionally, provisions in a bill for FY2013 funding require certification from the Secretary of State for the release of $50 million for the PCCF, contingent on Pakistan's cooperation in counterterrorism efforts and reopening of GLOCs to Afghanistan. The U.S. government imposes conditions on military aid to Pakistan, limiting aid to about $800 million and withholding $33 million unless certain criteria, including cooperation in counterterrorism efforts, are met. The U.S. government imposes conditions on military aid to Pakistan, limiting aid to about $800 million, including allocations for ESF, INCLE, and FMF. $33 million of FMF funds are withheld unless Dr. Shakil Afridi is released from prison. The Secretary of State must submit a spend plan for assistance to Pakistan with goals, benchmarks, and progress reports. $100 million of ESF funds can be used for Overseas Contingency Operations. The bill imposes conditions on aid to Pakistan, including withholding funds unless Pakistan meets counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation criteria. The House Appropriations Committee approved a bill to fund State Department operations for FY2013, which includes provisions to withhold funding for Pakistan unless certain conditions are met. The bill imposes conditions on aid to Pakistan, including withholding funds unless Pakistan meets counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation criteria. This includes dismantling IED networks, preventing nuclear-related proliferation, and providing humanitarian organizations access to detainees and displaced persons. The Secretary of State must submit a spend plan with goals and benchmarks for development, countering extremism, and promoting transparent governance. Assistance may be suspended if Pakistan fails to make progress towards these goals. The bill imposes conditions on aid to Pakistan, including withholding funds unless Pakistan meets counterterrorism and nuclear proliferation criteria. Assistance may be suspended if Pakistan fails to make progress towards stated goals and benchmarks. ESF funds can be used for cross border stabilization and development programs between Afghanistan, Pakistan, and central Asian republics. INCLE and FMF funds can be transferred to PCCF with notification to Congress."
