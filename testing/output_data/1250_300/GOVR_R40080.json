    "content": "Total nonfarm employment declined steadily between December 2007 and October 2009, falling from 137,951,000 to 129,633,000, with the majority of job losses occurring after November 2008. Despite a slight increase in employment in November 2009, the number of jobs on employer payrolls decreased the following month. The goods-producing sector, including mining, construction, and manufacturing, was most affected by job losses, while some service-providing industries like education and health services continued to add workers. The financial activities industry also experienced job losses before the economic downturn. The financial activities industry has been losing jobs, with job losses outweighing gains. This trend is similar to the construction industry, both affected by the housing market collapse. Despite the belief that the recession ended in 2009, history shows that sustained job growth may not be immediate. Job growth typically occurred within three to five months after previous recessions, but in some cases, it took up to 12 months for steady job growth to begin. Sustained job growth after recessions has varied historically, with delays in job creation seen in some cases. Congress often boosts job creation through increased federal spending, typically focusing on infrastructure projects. Green jobs, related to renewable industries, are a growing sector, although a consistent definition is lacking. The discussion focuses on the job-generating impact of infrastructure spending, particularly in the context of green economic activities. Green jobs are those related to industries utilizing renewable resources and energy-efficient goods and services. The section examines how job creation estimates are developed, including models for calculating nationwide and state-specific job numbers. Researchers face challenges in estimating the job impact of expenditures on the green economy. The section discusses the challenges researchers face in estimating the number of jobs created by green economic activities. It highlights the use of an input-output (I-O) model to calculate job numbers and emphasizes the caution needed when utilizing these estimates. Policymakers are interested in understanding the job impact of different stimulus options and shifting expenditures between federal budget categories. Unless there is an increase in total spending, the number of jobs in the labor market would remain largely unchanged. An input-output (I-O) model is often used to estimate the number of jobs created by economic activities. It shows the distribution of dollar value across industries and how much of a product comes from different industries. This information is then used to determine employment requirements based on productivity estimates. The total employment requirement includes jobs in the industry producing the final product and in supplier industries. An employment requirements table is a matrix showing the number of jobs supported by one billion dollars spent in a specific industry, including direct and indirect employment. It helps estimate the total employment associated with economic activities like a water reuse program. An employment requirements table allows for estimating the impact of expenditures on various industries and job creation. Input-output models freeze technology and productivity, leading to potential differences in job creation over time. Estimates of job creation are based on billion-dollar expenditures, but actual outcomes may vary due to changes in price levels and assumptions of unlimited resources in the models. The employment impact of expenditures may vary due to differences in estimated versus actual job creation, especially during economic downturns. Input-output tables may overstate domestic employment impact if inputs are imported and do not differentiate between full-time and part-time jobs. Programs relying on part-time workers may appear to create more jobs than those relying on full-time workers. A comprehensive estimate of job creation considers three components. The employment impact of economic activities can vary based on direct, indirect, and induced jobs. Induced jobs depend on spending by workers in direct and indirect jobs. Estimating induced jobs or the multiplier effect is challenging and depends on factors like spending habits and economic conditions. The multiplier effect of federal spending on infrastructure projects like roads can lead to job creation, with estimates varying widely. The Federal Highway Administration's analysis shows that $1 billion in federal funds could support around 27,800 to 47,575 jobs, depending on state matches and economic conditions. A $1.25 billion expenditure on highway construction, with $1 billion from the federal government and $250 million from the state government, could support 34,779 jobs. If a state match is not required, then $1 billion in Federal funds supports 27,800 jobs. The number of jobs has decreased over time due to increases in input prices like asphalt and diesel fuel. The estimate breaks down to 9,536 construction-oriented jobs, 4,324 jobs in supporting industries, and 13,962 induced jobs. Induced jobs make up half of the total estimate. The FHWA notes that induced jobs account for half of the total estimate, with a caveat that specific projects may alter the number of jobs supported. Highway funds spend out slowly, with only 27% of a project outlaying in the first year. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides employment figures for assessing the impact of different policies or actions. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides employment requirements tables for assessing the impact of policies. These tables are based on official I-O tables developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) every five years. The BLS updates the tables to reflect current production technologies and labor productivity. The employment requirements table referenced in the report reflects 2006 technologies and labor productivity. The BLS employment requirements table for the construction industry provides information on job dependencies and expenditures. It includes three major subdivisions: construction of buildings, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. Spending $1 billion on construction creates 11,768 jobs, with the majority in the construction industry itself. The BLS employment requirements table shows that $1 billion spending on construction creates 11,768 jobs, with most in the construction industry. Discrepancies in job figures for highway expenditures may be due to various factors like industry definitions and data sources. BLS data does not include other construction types like public school construction. BEA's RIMS II provides estimates of employment, earnings, and output linked to additional spending in different geographic areas. The BEA produces estimates of employment, earnings, and output dependent on additional spending in various industries. Job creation estimates vary by state due to different industry mixes and earnings levels. Estimating jobs from green infrastructure activities is more challenging than traditional infrastructure projects. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) does not separately identify green industries, such as renewable energy production. This poses a challenge in estimating the number of jobs supported by green activities, as traditional data collection methods do not account for these industries. The conventional Input-Output model is not suitable for estimating the number of jobs supported by green activities like wind and biofuel production due to the unique mix of inputs required. The construction industry lacks a specific category for retrofitting, making it challenging to use traditional models for estimating job creation in this area. This difficulty is often overlooked in analyses of green job creation, but one study commissioned by the Center for American Progress addresses this issue by explaining the limitations of current data collection methods. The researchers created synthetic industries to account for green activities like wind, solar, biomass, building retrofitting, and mass transit. They combined parts of existing industries to estimate job creation, with varying assumptions and time horizons. Estimates of green jobs often include direct, indirect, and induced employment, but the data collection methods have limitations. The curr_chunk discusses job creation estimates in the green economy, focusing on the shift from coal to wind and geothermal power generation. It highlights the challenges in generalizing results due to different state economies and unclear methodologies. The studies were not originally intended for quickly stabilizing job markets during a recession. The curr_chunk discusses job creation estimates in the green economy, focusing on a $100 billion \"green economic recovery program\" that could create almost 2 million jobs. The program includes federal spending on public building retrofits, mass transit expansion, and smart electrical grid development. The $100 billion \"green economic recovery program\" includes federal spending on public building retrofits, mass transit expansion, and smart electrical grid development. The Apollo Alliance proposed a $500 billion program to create 5 million green-collar jobs, with an initial step of $50 billion to create or maintain over 650,000 direct jobs and 1.3 million indirect jobs. The new initiative proposed federal spending of about $50 billion to create or maintain over 650,000 direct jobs and 1.3 million indirect jobs. The allocation includes funds for improving the electric grid, repairing roads and bridges, and replacing aging buses and trains with clean-energy vehicles. Congress emphasized timely tracking of job creation in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The 111th Congress focused on job creation through legislation, requiring entities receiving ARRA appropriations to report on the number of direct jobs created and retained by infrastructure projects. Federal agencies must post these reports online, with guidance from OMB and comments from CBO and GAO on job estimates. The 111th Congress focused on job creation through legislation, requiring entities receiving ARRA appropriations to report on the number of direct jobs created and retained by infrastructure projects. The reports included job estimates, with OMB, CBO, and GAO providing comments within 45 days. Recipients reported 633,342 jobs saved or retained through September 30, 2009. OMB revised its guidance on defining saved jobs in response to feedback, with recipients reporting 608,311 jobs funded by ARRA. The updated guidance defines jobs created or retained as those funded by the Recovery Act. Recipients reported 608,311 jobs funded by ARRA in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 682,370 jobs created or saved in the first quarter of 2010. The Council of Economic Advisers submitted quarterly reports on the effect of ARRA provisions on employment. The first report found that ARRA might have added around one million jobs in August 2009. The CBO estimated that ARRA's tax cuts and outlay increases through September 2009 added between 600,000 and 1.6 million jobs compared to employment levels without the law. This estimate aligns with the CEA's estimate of 1.0-1.1 million additional jobs as of August 2009. The CEA and CBO estimated that the ARRA law increased employment by 1.0-2.8 million jobs through various quarterly reports from 2009 to 2010. The CEA estimated that ARRA's policies increased employment by 1.2-2.8 million in the first quarter of 2010. The fourth quarterly ARRA jobs report suggested that public investment outlays under ARRA may have added over 627,000 jobs in the first quarter and over 800,000 jobs in the second quarter of 2010."
