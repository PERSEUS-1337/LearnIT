    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nanotechnology in the Schools Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. Congress finds that nanotechnology is rapidly growing and will benefit society by improving design and manufacturing processes. Nanotechnology is expected to have a positive impact on security, economy, and health in the US. To maximize these benefits, the US must maintain leadership in nanotechnology despite competition from other nations. Foreign students on temporary visas earned a significant percentage of science and engineering doctorates in the US in 2003. To maintain leadership in nanotechnology, the US must invest in educating its students in secondary schools and higher education. This includes providing access to scientific tools like scanning electron microscopes and training for teachers and professors. The purpose of this Act is to strengthen the capacity of US schools and institutions. The Act aims to enhance US schools' capacity to prepare students for nanotechnology careers by providing grants for tools and training. The Act aims to enhance US schools' capacity to prepare students for nanotechnology careers by providing grants for tools and training. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"eligible institution\" as a school offering advanced science courses, \"qualified nanotechnology equipment\" as necessary tools for nanotechnology, and references the meanings of terms like \"institution of higher education\" from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The term \"qualified nanotechnology equipment\" refers to equipment used for teaching nanotechnology in the classroom, manufactured in the United States with at least 50 percent domestic materials. SEC. 4. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Director of the National Science Foundation will establish a nanotechnology in schools program to enhance teaching capacity. Grants up to $150,000 will be awarded to institutions for acquiring equipment, providing educational services, and offering teacher education in nanotechnology. The National Science Foundation will award grants to institutions for teacher education in nanotechnology. Funds can be used for software, educational services, and certification. Grants are limited to undergraduate programs at eligible institutions. Applications must be submitted to receive a grant under this program. The National Science Foundation will award grants to institutions for teacher education in nanotechnology, limited to undergraduate programs. Eligible institutions must submit an application to the Director for selection, with a focus on geographic diversity and historically Black colleges and universities. The National Science Foundation will award grants to institutions for teacher education in nanotechnology, focusing on geographic diversity and historically Black colleges and universities. Eligible entities must be geographically diverse, encourage historically Black colleges and universities, and include institutions in states participating in the EPSCoR program. The Director may not award a grant unless the institution agrees to cover the costs incurred for the program. The Act requires eligible institutions to provide non-Federal contributions amounting to 1/4 of the grant received. The Director can waive this requirement for institutions with no or low endowment. Branches receiving grants over $100,000 cannot apply for another grant under this Act for 2 years. Branches or institutions receiving grants over $100,000 under this Act are not eligible for another grant for 2 years. SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT AND EVALUATION. Each institution receiving a grant must submit a report on fund usage within a year. The Director will review these reports annually and evaluate the program every third year. A report to Congress with recommendations on the program's federal support is due within six months of the evaluation. The Director will prepare and submit a report to Congress based on the evaluation, including recommendations on the need for Federal support of the program under this Act. Authorization of appropriations for the Director to carry out the Act includes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2009 through 2011."
