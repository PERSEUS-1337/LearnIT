    "content": "The Act titled \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" includes phased increases in fuel economy standards. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, with minimum standards set for different model years ranging from 25 to 40 miles per gallon. Higher standards can be set by regulation. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates increases in fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles, setting the standard at 17 miles per gallon for model years after 1984 and before 2006. Amendments include removing certain language and realigning paragraphs. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" sets fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles, with incremental increases from 17 to 27.5 miles per gallon based on model years. If standards are not increased within 24 months, a report must be submitted to Congress explaining the delay. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates that if fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles are not increased within 24 months, a report must be submitted to Congress explaining the delay. SEC. 3. INCREASED INCLUSIVENESS OF DEFINITIONS OF AUTOMOBILE AND PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE. SEC. 3. INCREASED INCLUSIVENESS OF DEFINITIONS OF AUTOMOBILE AND PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE.\n\n(a) Automobile.--Paragraph (3) of section 32901(a) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to increase the weight limit to 12,000 pounds. Section 32908(a)(1) is also amended to raise the weight limit to 14,000 pounds.\n\n(b) Passenger Automobile.--The definition of a passenger automobile is revised to include vehicles with a gross weight of 12,000 pounds or less. The definition of a passenger automobile is revised to include vehicles with a gross weight of 12,000 pounds or less, excluding vehicles with certain characteristics such as primary load carrying devices, seating capacity of more than 12 persons, or cargo areas extending beyond the vehicle frame. The definition of a passenger automobile is revised to include vehicles with a cargo area of at least 6 feet in interior length that does not extend beyond the frame of the vehicle and is an open area or is designed for use as an open area but is enclosed by a cap and is not readily accessible directly from the passenger compartment. The amendments made by this section shall apply with respect to automobiles manufactured for model years after the automobile model year in which this Act is enacted. SEC. 4. CIVIL PENALTIES. Increased penalty for violations of fuel economy standards under title 49, United States Code. The penalty amount is now $10, adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers. The penalty amount for violations of fuel economy standards is now $10, adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers. The term 'price index' refers to the Consumer Price Index published monthly by the Department of Labor. Amendments to subsection (c)(1) include the removal and redesignation of subparagraphs. These changes apply to automobiles manufactured for model years after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. ACCURATE FUEL ECONOMY TESTING. Biennial Report on Testing Quality: The Secretary of Transportation must submit a report to Congress every odd-numbered year on the accuracy of automobile fuel economy testing, including assessments of fuel economy accuracy and planned changes in testing methodology. The Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency consult on planned changes to automobile fuel economy testing methodology for accuracy assessment in a biennial report to Congress. The Secretary of Transportation will submit the first biennial report on testing quality to Congress in 2005. A study will be conducted to determine the most accurate automobile fuel economy testing process for highway, urban, and combined use. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress comparing automobile fuel economy ratings calculated under different testing processes. The report will include determinations and estimates of equivalent fuel economy adjustments. The Secretary of Transportation will prescribe a revised testing procedure for automobile fuel economy ratings within 180 days after submitting a report to Congress comparing ratings calculated under different testing processes. The revised procedure aims to closely align ratings with the most accurate testing process determined under subparagraph (A)(i). The Secretary of Transportation will prescribe a revised testing procedure for automobile fuel economy ratings within 180 days after submitting a report to Congress. The procedure will be based on the most accurate testing process identified in the report and will apply to automobiles manufactured after model year 2006. The Secretary of Transportation will amend fuel economy standards for automobiles manufactured after 2006 to reflect improved accuracy in testing procedures. The standards must be at least as stringent as those under the current law. The Secretary will amend fuel economy standards for post-2006 automobiles to be as strict as current standards, even after testing procedure revisions. SEC. 6. STANDARDS FOR EXECUTIVE AGENCY AUTOMOBILES. Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to set fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles. The amendment to Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code, sets fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles. The amendment includes regulations requiring at least 20 percent of passenger automobiles to be exceptionally fuel-efficient vehicles. The President shall prescribe regulations requiring that at least 20% of passenger automobiles leased or bought by executive agencies have a fuel economy rating 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard. Additionally, starting in fiscal year 2009, at least 10,000 vehicles in the executive agencies' fleet must have a fuel economy 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard."
