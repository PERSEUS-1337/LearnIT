    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Gulf Security and Iran Sanctions Enforcement Act\" and includes a restriction on participation in offshore oil and gas leasing. The \"Gulf Security and Iran Sanctions Enforcement Act\" mandates that leases for drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf require annual certification that the lessee does not engage in activities sanctionable under the Iran Sanctions Act. Failure to certify or providing false information can result in lease cancellation. The Secretary of the Interior must include a provision in each lease for drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, requiring disclosure of any involvement in energy-related ventures outside Iran with individuals blocked under Executive Order 13224. The Secretary of the Interior mandates disclosure in OCS drilling leases of involvement with individuals blocked under Executive Order 13224, Executive Order 13382, or entities listed in appendix A to part 560 of title 31, CFR. Failure to disclose or providing false information may result in lease cancellation. The Secretary of the Interior requires disclosure in OCS drilling leases of connections to sanctioned individuals or entities. Failure to disclose or providing false information may lead to lease cancellation. The Secretary may waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis if deemed in the national interest, with reporting obligations on waivers and lease cancellations to congressional committees. The Secretary of the Interior must report lease cancellations to congressional committees, including reasons for cancellation. Definitions for \"appropriate congressional committees\" and \"person\" are provided in this section. The Act will end 30 days after the President certifies that Iran has stopped supporting terrorism, pursuing weapons of mass destruction, and no longer poses a threat to the US or its allies."
