    "content": "The \"Keep Student Loans Affordable Act of 2013\" extends the interest rate deadline to July 1, 2014. It also includes modifications to required distribution rules for pension plans. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to require distribution of an employee's interest within 5 years of their death, with exceptions for eligible designated beneficiaries. The distribution of an employee's interest after death must be made to eligible designated beneficiaries within a year, following specific regulations. The distribution of an employee's interest after death to eligible designated beneficiaries must follow regulations set by the Secretary. For surviving spouses, distributions must begin no earlier than the employee's age of 70 1/2, and if the surviving spouse dies, specific rules apply. The distribution rules for eligible designated beneficiaries upon the death of an employee include starting distributions to surviving spouses no earlier than age 70 1/2. If the surviving spouse dies before distributions begin, the rules apply as if the spouse were the employee. If an eligible designated beneficiary dies before their portion is fully distributed, specific rules apply to the remaining distribution within 5 years. The term 'eligible designated beneficiary' refers to an individual designated by the employee, such as a surviving spouse, who must receive distributions within 5 years if they pass away before the full distribution is complete. The eligible designated beneficiary, in the event of the employee's death, includes the surviving spouse, a child under the age of majority, a disabled individual, or a chronically ill person with a certification of indefinite inability. The eligible designated beneficiary upon the employee's death can be a surviving spouse, a child under the age of majority, a disabled individual, or a chronically ill person with a certification of indefinite inability. An individual not more than 10 years younger than the employee may also qualify. Additionally, a child described in a specific clause will cease to be an eligible designated beneficiary upon reaching majority. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include provisions regarding the distribution of an employee's interest payable to an individual within 5 years. If an employee becomes a 5-percent owner after age 70 1/2, certain clauses will be applied based on the year of ownership. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include provisions for employee distributions based on ownership and retirement years. Effective dates for these amendments apply to distributions after December 31, 2013, and to employees becoming 5-percent owners before or after the enactment of the Act. Employees who have not retired before 2014 and meet certain ownership criteria will be treated as 5-percent owners for distribution purposes. In the case of a designated beneficiary who dies after 2013, the beneficiary will be subject to the new amendments, and the deceased employee will be considered an eligible designated beneficiary. The amendments made by this section do not apply to existing qualified annuity contracts. A qualified annuity is defined as a commercial annuity or one payable by a defined benefit plan, with substantially equal periodic payments over the lives of the beneficiaries. The qualified annuity contracts must meet specific requirements, including substantially equal periodic payments over the lives of the employee and a designated beneficiary, in accordance with section 401(a)(9)(A)(ii) of the Code. Annuity payments must have begun before January 1, 2014, for the contract to be considered qualified. An irrevocable election must be made by the employee before specific dates regarding the method and amount of annuity payments to the employee or designated beneficiaries."
