    "content": "The \"Community Access to Health Care Act of 2001\" aims to assist communities and health care providers in developing integrated health care delivery systems for uninsured and underinsured individuals, particularly in rural and Native American areas. This includes coordinating services, building infrastructure for collaboration among providers, and providing new federal resources without replacing existing funding for low-income populations. The \"Community Access to Health Care Act of 2001\" establishes a Community Access Program to provide grants for strengthening services for the uninsured and underinsured. The Secretary may grant funds to develop integrated health care delivery systems serving uninsured and underinsured communities, expanding services, and enhancing efficiency among providers. Eligible entities include public or nonprofit entities like Federally qualified health centers or hospitals meeting specific criteria. The Secretary may grant funds to develop integrated health care delivery systems serving uninsured and underinsured communities through eligible entities like public or nonprofit providers, including hospitals and health departments. These entities must represent a consortium of providers focused on offering coordinated health care services to specific community groups, regardless of their ability to pay. To be eligible for a grant under this section, an entity must define a community of uninsured and underinsured individuals in a specific geographical area or population. Preference is given to health care providers identified in paragraph (1) who serve these communities. Applications must include participating providers and related agencies. The consortium applying for the grant must identify providers who will participate in the program and describe their contributions to caring for uninsured and underinsured individuals. They must also demonstrate their ability to build on the current system and develop coordinated systems of care. The consortium applying for the grant must demonstrate their ability to provide a significant volume of care for the community, develop coordinated systems of care, involve the community in program development, ensure participants are enrolled in public insurance programs, leverage other funding sources for sustainability, and have a plan for evaluating activities. The grant applicants must show their ability to provide care for the community, involve the community in program development, ensure participants are enrolled in public insurance programs, leverage funding sources for sustainability, demonstrate fiscal responsibility, and commit to serving the community regardless of ability to pay. Priority may be given to applicants with public hospitals, Federally qualified health centers, and other providers in their consortium. The Secretary may prioritize grant applicants with consortiums including public hospitals, Federally qualified health centers, and other providers serving uninsured individuals. Priority may also be given to programs expanding preventive and primary care services, improving coordination between healthcare providers and social services. The curr_chunk focuses on criteria for grant eligibility, including improving coordination between healthcare and social service providers, collaboration with government entities, utilizing non-Federal contributions, and ensuring program sustainability. Grant funds can only be used for direct expenses related to integrating a healthcare delivery system. The curr_chunk specifies the direct expenses eligible for grant funds in integrating a healthcare delivery system, including patient care expansions and service improvements. Examples of grant fund uses include increasing outreach activities, enhancing case management, and improving coordination. The curr_chunk outlines specific conditions for the use of grant funds in healthcare delivery system integration, such as increasing outreach activities, improving case management, coordinating transportation, developing provider networks, recruiting personnel, acquiring technology, closing service gaps, enhancing provider communication, and other activities to increase access to the uninsured. The grant funds for healthcare delivery system integration have specific conditions, including limiting direct patient care to 15%, reserving 3% for national program purposes, and requiring maintenance of effort from grant recipients and participating providers. The Secretary may award a grant under specific conditions, including maintaining expenditures of non-Federal funds at a certain level. Recipients must report annually on progress and undergo financial audits. Renewal of grants is contingent on meeting established goals. The Secretary may award grants with conditions, including financial audits and technical assistance. $250,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2002, with additional funding for 2003-2006."
