The dairy industry faces issues of consolidation and industry concentration. Public workshops were announced by the Administration in 2009 to address competition concerns in agriculture. A workshop specifically focusing on the dairy industry is scheduled for June 25, 2010, in Madison, WI. This report provides background on the U.S. dairy industry structure, financial stress for dairy farmers, historical development, price movements, and industry structure in terms of consolidation and concentration at different market levels. The dairy industry faced financial stress in 2009 due to lower milk prices, leading to government support through various programs. Despite this assistance, the number of U.S. dairy farms and cows declined during the same period. The decline in U.S. dairy farms and cows in 2009 led to financial stress in the industry. Despite government support, dairy farmers faced challenges with feed prices and lost farm equity. This situation prompted a reevaluation of dairy policy options by industry stakeholders and Members of Congress. The U.S. dairy industry has evolved over the last 100 years due to advancements in milk marketing and government intervention. Producers formed cooperative associations to counter handler market power in the early 20th century. Urbanization led to milk being sent to processors for wider distribution. Financial stress in the industry has prompted a reevaluation of dairy policy options. In the early 20th century, dairy farmers formed cooperative associations to negotiate with milk handlers and established classified pricing for milk based on its use. The Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 provided limited antitrust exemption to farmer cooperatives. Federal milk marketing orders were later implemented during the Great Depression to stabilize the market and balance the power between dairy farmers and processors. Federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) were established to stabilize the market and equalize the power between dairy farmers and processors. Import quotas were enacted to protect producers from foreign competition. The government began supporting milk prices through the Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP) in the late 1940s. Additional programs such as the Dairy Export Incentives Program (DEIP) and the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) were added to national dairy policy in later years. These advancements have significantly impacted the U.S. dairy industry over the last century. Advancements in milk marketing have transformed the U.S. dairy industry over the last century, with improved transportation and national market integration. Raw milk was historically delivered locally, but factors like better roadways and tanker trucks facilitated a shift to a national milk market by the 1970s. Advancements in milk marketing have transformed the U.S. dairy industry over the last century, with improved transportation and national market integration. By the 1970s, most retail milk was purchased in stores in lightweight containers. Bulk milk is now transported long distances by tanker trucks to meet market demands. The relationship between farm and retail prices has been a long-standing issue, with concerns raised about the farm value share and economic stress in the agricultural sector. The farm share of the retail food dollar has been declining in recent decades across the agricultural sector, including for dairy farmers. In 1950, the farm share was 41%, but by 2006, it had decreased to 18.5%. Factors such as increased productivity, demand for value-added products, and changes in food marketing have contributed to this decline. Milk and dairy products have a farm share of approximately one-third of the retail dollar, higher than the all-food average. The farm share of the retail food dollar has been declining in recent decades, including for dairy farmers. Milk and dairy products have a farm share of approximately one-third of the retail dollar, higher than the all-food average. The farm-share trend for milk and dairy products was generally flat between 2000 and 2008, with a slight uptrend for cheddar cheese. In 2008 and early 2009, there was a decline in the farm-value share of retail product values and a widening of the marketing margin. In 2009, the difference between retail and farm milk prices increased to $2.35 per gallon, reaching a record-high of $2.43 per gallon in January. However, by December, the price difference dropped to $1.69 per gallon, below the recent five-year average margin. Retailers reduced prices amid lower farm milk costs, energy, and transportation inputs. Farm prices weakened slightly in early 2010, returning the price spread to the five-year average level. Retail price adjustments to farm price changes have time lags of months, with faster pass-through to consumers for higher farm prices than decreases. Food markets exhibit characteristics such as rapid adjustments in retail prices to higher farm prices compared to decreases, known as \"sticky\" retail food prices. Consumer behavior, store inventory management, and retailing strategies can limit retail price adjustments to downward farm price movements. Competition effects of supermarket services can attract less price-sensitive consumers, leading to higher prices for milk in stores offering additional services rather than competing on price. Consolidation in the agriculture industry, including the dairy sector, has led to fewer but larger operations along the production and marketing chain. Larger operations have lower costs, allowing them to be more competitive and gain market share. This trend has resulted in fewer dairy farms needed to produce the same amount of milk. Despite a decline in the number of operations at the farm level, consolidation at the cooperative and processor level has been slower in the last decade. Consolidation in the dairy industry has led to a decline in the number of dairy farms, with operations decreasing at a slower pace in recent years. Concentration of firms controlling sales or purchases has increased, with most segments becoming more concentrated over time. Despite the reduction in dairy farms, increased productivity has offset declines in the number of farms and cows, resulting in a steady increase in total milk production. The drop in dairy farm operations has slowed to 2,000 to 5,000 farms per year, totaling 65,000 in 2009. Productivity increases have offset declines in farms and cows, leading to a rise in milk production. Domestic milk demand has grown slowly, with cheese consumption offsetting a decline in fluid milk. Exports have increased, with larger farms seeing a 20% rise in numbers due to lower production costs. In 2005, dairy farms with 1,000 cows or more had lower production costs compared to smaller farms. Large farms accounted for 47% of U.S. milk output in 2009, with scale economies from automation and modern facilities. Farm sizes vary by region, with western states having larger average farm sizes. Large, modern dairy buildings reduce housing costs and utilize automated manure removal systems. Dairy farm structures vary by region, with western states having larger average farm sizes. Operating costs are influenced by feed prices, with western states facing high costs due to purchasing feed, while farms in regions like Wisconsin with on-farm feed production have lower operating costs. Farmer-owned dairy cooperatives benefit those who use their services. Operating costs are lower when grain and feed prices rise for dairy farms with fewer cows. Farmer-owned dairy cooperatives manage milk distribution, with some also manufacturing products for direct sale. The number of dairy cooperatives has decreased since the 1940s, with consolidations leading to more centralized management of milk supplies. In 2007, there were 155 cooperatives accounting for 83% of farm milk marketings. In 2007, there were 155 dairy cooperatives accounting for 83% of farm milk marketings. By 2008, the top four cooperatives accounted for 40% of U.S. milk production. Consolidations and strategic alliances have enabled cooperatives to serve large retail customers efficiently. The National Milk Producers Federation emphasizes the importance of the Capper-Volstead Act for farmers to cooperate. Cooperatives have historically improved farmers' bargaining power with milk handlers and represent members in federal milk marketing order changes. Some producers believe cooperatives may not always act in their best interests. The dairy processing industry faces challenges such as changing demand, technological advancements, and shifts in the retail sector. The dairy processing industry has seen changes in demand, technological advancements, and shifts in the retail sector. The number of dairy firms has decreased, with larger plant sizes to meet the demands of high-volume retailers. The number of dairy manufacturing plants in the US has stabilized around 1,100 facilities, with concentration trends similar to other food processing sectors. The four-firm concentration ratio for cheese processing is 35% and for fluid milk processing is 43%. The dairy processing industry has experienced changes in demand, technology, and retail competition. The four-firm concentration ratio for cheese processing is 35% and for fluid milk processing is 43%. Industry concentration in dairy processing is not unusually high nationally, but local markets can be more concentrated. The fluid milk industry has seen an increase in concentration following a merger in 2001. Retail competition in the food sector has also evolved in recent years. The four-firm concentration ratio for cheese manufacturing has ranged between 34% and 52% during 1972-2002, with no clear trend. Changes in the retail sector, including competition from nontraditional food retailers, have led to consolidation in the U.S. grocery retailing industry. The top four firms accounted for 17% of national sales in the early 1990s, increasing to 36% by 2005 due to acquisitions and mergers by large grocery retailers. Local-level concentration in the retail food sector is typically higher than at the national level. Local-level concentration in the retail food sector is typically higher than at the national level, with four-firm concentration shares averaging 74% in specific market areas in 2003. This high concentration limits choices for consumers at the individual level. Retail consolidation and concentration in the dairy industry have led to larger processors and manufacturers increasing market share to meet demands for lower costs from food retailers. The primary concern with concentration is its impact on consumer choice. Consolidation and concentration in the dairy industry have led to larger processors and manufacturers increasing market share to meet demands for lower costs from food retailers. Concerns about concentration include reduced competition and market power, but efficiency gains may benefit consumers through lower retail prices. Research findings have not conclusively shown adverse effects on agricultural commodity or retail food prices from concentration in the processing and retail sectors. The GAO report reviewed studies on concentration in the processing segment of the beef, pork, or dairy sectors and the retail sector. Most studies found no evidence of market power, with efficiency effects outweighing market power effects. Experts predict increased concentration in the future, raising concerns about market power and price manipulation. Concentration in dairy processing was found to have little impact on commodity or food prices, with efficiency benefits often outweighing market power effects. Dairy cooperatives can offset the market power of dairy processors. The authors concluded that efficiency benefits outweighed market power effects in the dairy sector. Market power of dairy processors can be balanced by dairy cooperatives. Studies showed evidence of market power in regional retail milk markets, with concerns about concentration leading to fewer retail outlets. Large retail firms may pressure food processors to consolidate, leading to further concentration in the industry. Large retail firms may pressure food processors to consolidate, leading to further concentration in the industry. Concerns exist about how this concentration affects price transparency in dairy markets, with fewer transactions impacting market efficiency. The move towards a more integrated dairy market results in fewer trades on the spot market, affecting the discovery of current prices. The primary spot market for dairy products is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where prices are determined by buyers and sellers. Some believe the CME is inadequate due to thin trading, lack of transparency, and volatility. The GAO found in a 2007 study that certain market conditions make the CME spot cheese market susceptible to manipulation. The GAO found in a 2007 study that the CME spot cheese market is susceptible to manipulation due to a small number of trades and traders. Industry participants are prepared to counteract manipulation by monitoring the market and increasing sales volume on the CME. The CFTC and CME monitor spot market activities for signs of manipulation, with some dairy industry participants agreeing to pay a penalty for attempting to manipulate milk futures prices in 2004. The CFTC and CME monitor spot market activities for signs of manipulation. In 2008, dairy industry participants agreed to pay a penalty for attempting to manipulate milk futures prices. The CME introduced new futures and options contracts for skimmed milk powder as a dairy risk management tool. Producers and policymakers aim to enhance dairy price transparency by expanding USDA's mandatory price reporting system. U.S. antitrust laws focus on market competition rather than protecting individual competitors. Antitrust laws in the United States, such as the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, focus on competition in markets and prohibit unlawful mergers and business practices. These laws are enforced by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission. Violations of these laws can result in fines and penalties. The Clayton Act prohibits mergers or acquisitions that may lessen competition, with fines of up to $1 million for individuals and $100 million for corporations. It also allows for premerger notification to examine potential transactions before completion. The Act aims to prevent activities that might restrain trade and is enforced by the DOJ and FTC. The Capper-Volstead Act provides an exemption from antitrust laws for farmer cooperatives, allowing them to collaborate on processing and marketing their commodities. This exemption is important in the context of antitrust enforcement agencies examining potential mergers/acquisitions to prevent activities that may lessen competition. The Capper-Volstead Act allows farmer cooperatives to collaborate on processing and marketing their commodities. In 2009, Dean Foods purchased two plants from Foremost Farms, leading to a civil antitrust suit in 2010 alleging a violation of the Clayton Act. The Department of Justice claimed that the acquisition would reduce competition in the milk market. The Department of Justice is suing Dean Foods for acquiring Foremost Farms, which would reduce competition in the milk market. Dean Foods now holds 57% of the market in certain regions, and the lawsuit aims to force them to sell the acquired dairy processing plants. Dean Foods believes the acquisition benefits dairy farmers and complies with antitrust laws. Dean Foods acquisition in compliance with antitrust laws, benefits dairy farmers by providing stable outlet for milk. Deal resulted in cost savings, benefits consumers, and spurs competition. Case highlights consolidation in U.S. dairy industry. Class action antitrust complaint filed against major firms in Northeast dairy market. Defendants include Dairy Farmers of America, Dairy Marketing Services, Dean Foods, and HP Hood. The lawsuit alleges that major dairy firms in the Northeast, including Dairy Farmers of America, Dairy Marketing Services, Dean Foods, and HP Hood, have conspired to control the supply of fluid milk, leading to lower prices for dairy farmers. The defendants have exclusive supply agreements with dominant processors, forcing producers to affiliate with either DFA or DMS. This consolidation has harmed independent producers and cooperatives in the region. The lawsuit alleges that major dairy firms in the Northeast, including Dairy Farmers of America and HP Hood, have used their market power to the detriment of dairy farmers. DFA claims to have increased returns for farmers through efficiencies, but observers note that the litigation may take years to resolve. Another ongoing case involves multiple class action lawsuits in the southeastern United States. Determining the net effect of concentration on market power and efficiency gains is complex due to various influencing factors. Market power and efficiency gains in the dairy industry are influenced by various factors such as product differentiation, market entry ease, technology changes, and government policies. Determining the impact of concentration on prices is challenging due to these multiple influencing factors."
