    "content": "The \"Human Rights Information Act\" may be cited as the short title. The findings section is included in the Act. Congress finds that the national and international protection of human rights is a key value in democracy, with the US possessing documents on human rights violations abroad needed by foreign authorities. Requests for legal assistance on human rights violations continue to be received, including declassification of documents for countries like Guatemala, Honduras, and Spain. The United States responds to requests for declassification of human rights documents from Guatemala, Honduras, and Spain. The protection and promotion of human rights require strengthening declassification procedures to enhance accountability and save resources. The United States aims to protect global human rights by enhancing accountability of Federal agencies and saving government resources. Efforts to promote human rights and democracy internationally are crucial for ending human rights violations and maintaining US leadership. The United States emphasizes the importance of holding newly established or reestablished democratic societies accountable for human rights violations. This can be achieved through measures such as truth commissions, human rights officers, and national investigations led by credible civil society organizations. The US has a history of providing international leadership in ending impunity for gross human rights violations through initiatives like the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal. The United States has ratified the Convention against Torture and actively participated in various international war crimes tribunals. It is obligated to provide assistance in criminal proceedings related to torture acts and should adopt measures to ensure free access to information in investigations. The United States supports the Guatemalan peace accords, which included an investigation by the Clarification Commission on human rights violations. Despite the investigation's conclusion, many questions remain unanswered, including the identity of perpetrators and the location of bodies of the disappeared. The Commission recommended utilizing all available resources for further investigation. The Clarification Commission recommended using all resources to clarify the whereabouts of the disappeared and deliver remains to relatives. Two days after presenting a parallel investigation, Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi was assassinated. President Clinton acknowledged support for military forces involved in repression in Guatemala was wrong and pledged to support peace and reconciliation. The National Commissioner for the Protection of Human Rights in Honduras has been requesting documentation from the United States on human rights violations since 1993, with some aspects still pending. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"human rights record,\" \"agency,\" and \"gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.\" SEC. 4 of the Act governs the declassification and public disclosure of human rights records regarding Guatemala and Honduras. Agencies must identify, review, and organize these records for declassification within 120 days. The President must report to Congress on agency compliance within 150 days. An agency can delay public disclosure of a human rights record if there is clear evidence that the threat to national security outweighs the public interest, especially if it involves revealing sensitive intelligence sources or methods. The public disclosure of a human rights record can be delayed if it would interfere with intelligence activities, impair national security, reveal confidential information, invade personal privacy, or compromise confidentiality. The disclosure of a human rights record may be postponed if it would harm personal privacy or compromise confidentiality, especially in cases involving intelligence assets of the United States Government. When an agency of the United States receives a request for human rights records from certain international entities or countries investigating human rights violations, they must review and disclose the records following the standards in the Act. Additionally, decisions to withhold records can be reviewed. The Appeals Panel reviews agency determinations to postpone public disclosure of human rights records. They direct disclosure unless there is clear evidence that the record is not a human rights record or qualifies for postponement. If they agree to postpone disclosure, they consult with the agency. The Appeals Panel, in cases of nondisclosure, determines alternative forms of disclosure for human rights records, including disclosure of a summary or a substitute record. Upon completion of review, the Appeals Panel notifies the agency head. The Appeals Panel notifies the agency head and the President of its determination on human rights records, publishing it in the Federal Register within 14 days. Guidelines for adjudicating appeals are also published. Presidential authority allows for public disclosure or postponement of disclosure. The President has the authority to review and make decisions on Appeals Panel determinations regarding human rights records. Within 30 days, the President must provide a written certification to the Appeals Panel, stating the decision and reasons, including if disclosure is postponed. The Appeals Panel will then publish the President's determination in the Federal Register. Upon receipt of the President's determination, the Appeals Panel will publish in the Federal Register any unclassified written certification, statement, and materials related to the postponement of disclosure of a human rights record. SEC. 8. The Information Security Policy Advisory Council will report to Congress on declassifying human rights records of other countries. SEC. 9. The Act does not limit the right to file requests or seek judicial review. SEC. 10. Creation of positions. SEC. 10. Creation of 2 additional positions in the Appeals Panel for individuals with substantial human rights expertise appointed by the President with recommendations from human rights organizations."
