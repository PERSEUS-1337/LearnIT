Representative Souder highlighted the increasing number of drug and alcohol-related incidents on college campuses, calling it an epidemic. As a response, Congress added a provision to P.L. 105-244, stating that students convicted of drug offenses would be ineligible for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA. Students convicted of drug offenses are ineligible for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA. The period of ineligibility depends on the type and number of convictions, with indefinite ineligibility for multiple offenses. Ineligibility begins from the date of conviction and can be reinstated after completing a drug rehabilitation program or having the conviction removed from the record. Possession of a controlled substance results in an ineligibility period for first, second, and third offenses: First offense - one year, Second offense - two years, Third offense - indefinite. Sale of a controlled substance leads to an ineligibility period for first and second offenses: First offense - two years, Second offense - indefinite. Convictions prior to turning 18 or overturned convictions do not affect eligibility. Indefinitely ineligible students must complete a drug rehabilitation program to regain eligibility. The program must meet specific requirements outlined in the regulations. An eligible rehabilitation program must meet specific requirements outlined in regulations, including receiving funds from government programs, being recognized by government agencies or courts, and conducting unannounced drug tests. Participation in the program can reduce ineligibility periods for drug convictions. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended the provision for federal financial aid eligibility for students with drug convictions. Participation in a recognized rehabilitation program can reduce ineligibility periods. Over 180,000 students have been affected by this provision, representing less than .25% of all federal financial aid applicants. California and Texas have had a high number of students declared ineligible. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended the provision for federal financial aid eligibility for students with drug convictions, specifying that only convictions during enrollment disqualify students from aid. The period of ineligibility depends on the type and recency of the conviction. Legislative proposals are being considered to modify the drug conviction provision in Title IV of the HEA. Issues continue to arise regarding implementation and penalties for drug convictions. During reauthorization discussions, issues arose regarding the drug conviction provision for federal financial aid eligibility. Critics argue that singling out drugs for disqualification is unfair, as it treats drug convictions more harshly than other crimes like rape or armed robbery. Representative Frank contends that drugs are unfairly targeted in this provision. Critics argue that singling out drugs for disqualification from federal financial aid eligibility is unfair, as it treats drug convictions more harshly than other crimes like rape or armed robbery. Representative Frank contends that drugs are unfairly targeted in this provision, with supporters justifying the focus on drug-related crimes due to their prevalence on college campuses. The existing provision does not differentiate between misdemeanor or felony drug-related convictions, resulting in a loss of eligibility regardless of the severity of the conviction. The eligibility for federal financial aid is lost regardless of the severity of drug-related convictions, with different ineligibility periods for selling versus possession. Congress may debate the impact of felony versus misdemeanor drug convictions on student aid eligibility."
