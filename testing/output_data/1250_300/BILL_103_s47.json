Chapter 154 of Title 28, United States Code, introduces special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases. This chapter applies to cases under section 2254 brought by prisoners in State custody subject to a capital sentence, with specific requirements for appointment of counsel. Chapter 154 of Title 28, United States Code, introduces special habeas corpus procedures for capital cases brought by prisoners in State custody subject to a capital sentence. The chapter applies if a State establishes a mechanism for appointing competent counsel in post-conviction proceedings for indigent prisoners with upheld capital convictions. The mechanism must offer counsel to all State prisoners under a capital sentence. The chapter introduces special procedures for appointing counsel in post-conviction proceedings for indigent prisoners with upheld capital convictions. Counsel may be appointed if the prisoner is indigent, unable to decide on legal matters, or has rejected counsel after understanding the consequences. Counsel appointed for a State prisoner under a capital sentence cannot have previously represented the prisoner unless requested. Ineffectiveness of counsel in post-conviction proceedings is not grounds for relief in subsequent proceedings. The chapter outlines procedures for appointing counsel in post-conviction proceedings for indigent prisoners with upheld capital convictions. Ineffectiveness of counsel in these proceedings is not a basis for relief in subsequent proceedings. Sec. 2257 discusses the mandatory stay of execution for State prisoners and the expiration of the stay if a habeas corpus petition is not filed within the specified time. The chapter outlines procedures for appointing counsel in post-conviction proceedings for indigent prisoners with upheld capital convictions. Sec. 2257 discusses the mandatory stay of execution for State prisoners and the expiration of the stay if a habeas corpus petition is not filed within the specified time. A stay of execution granted expires if a State prisoner fails to file a habeas corpus petition within the required time, or if the petition for relief is denied after court review and the prisoner waives the right to pursue habeas corpus review. The text discusses the conditions under which a State prisoner under a capital sentence can waive the right to pursue habeas corpus review. It also outlines the circumstances under which a Federal court can grant relief in a capital case, including presenting new claims or claims based on constitutional violations. The text outlines the time requirements for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254, with a deadline of 180 days after a state court order is issued. The time limit can be tolled during certain circumstances, such as when a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court by a State prisoner seeking review of a capital sentence. The time requirements for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 can be tolled in specific situations, such as when a State prisoner seeks review of a capital sentence in the Supreme Court or has a pending request for post-conviction review in a State court. Additionally, an extension of up to 60 days can be granted if there is a valid reason for the delay in filing the petition. The time requirements for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 can be tolled in specific situations, such as when a State prisoner seeks review of a capital sentence in the Supreme Court or has a pending request for post-conviction review in a State court. When a State prisoner under a capital sentence files a petition for habeas corpus relief, the district court shall determine the sufficiency of the evidentiary record for review based on the claims presented. The district court shall determine the sufficiency of the evidentiary record for habeas corpus review based on the claims presented and litigated in State courts. If a complete evidentiary record is developed, the court will rule on the merits of the claims before it. The district court will conduct any necessary evidentiary hearing to complete the record for habeas corpus review. Once a complete evidentiary record is developed, the court will rule on the merits of the claims before it. The requirement of a certificate of probable cause does not apply to habeas corpus cases under this chapter, except for second or successive petitions."
