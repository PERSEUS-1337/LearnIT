    "content": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, resulting in a significant reorganization of the executive branch. Similar to the Department of Defense (DOD), DHS underwent structural modifications through legislative compromises. The Secretary of Homeland Security has the authority to reorganize functions and units within DHS, with oversight from Congress and department officials. Secretary Chertoff utilized this authority to implement his plans. Additionally, the President had temporary authority to prescribe reorganization plans for DHS within a 12-month period after the Homeland Security Act's effective date. President George W. Bush utilized temporary authority granted by the Homeland Security Act to reorganize DHS, creating the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement within the department's Border and Transportation Security Directorate. DHS was initially structured with various directorates and units under the office of the Secretary/Deputy Secretary. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created with various directorates focusing on different areas such as technology, information analysis, border security, and emergency response. Additionally, there were other units like the Coast Guard and Secret Service reporting directly to the Secretary. DHS had around 170,000 employees, with a significant field organization. Secretary Michael Chertoff initiated a review of the department's organization and operations shortly after taking office in 2005. Secretary Chertoff initiated a comprehensive review of the Department of Homeland Security's organization and operations, involving 18 action teams and over 250 staff members. The review focused on evaluating specific operational and policy issues, seeking input from various partners at different levels. This led to a six-point agenda aimed at increasing preparedness for catastrophic events, strengthening border security, reforming immigration processes, enhancing transportation security, and improving information sharing. The Secretary of Homeland Security initiated a review resulting in a six-point agenda to increase preparedness for catastrophic events, strengthen border security, reform immigration processes, enhance transportation security, improve information sharing, and re-align the DHS organization for better mission performance. Secretary Chertoff announced the need for structural changes at DHS to improve mission performance, including organization changes in four key areas. Secretary Chertoff announced organization changes at DHS, including the formation of a new policy office, improvements in intelligence sharing, creation of an operations coordination office, and consolidation of the Department's preparedness mission. These initiatives aim to strengthen policy development and operational accountability within the Department. The formation of a new policy office at DHS, announced by Secretary Chertoff, focuses on refugee asylum policies and private sector liaison resources to strengthen policy development. This initiative builds upon previous recommendations for an Under Secretary of Policy and consolidation of policy analysis offices within the department. The DHS announced the creation of the Office of Policy, Planning, and International Affairs to oversee strategic policy development and program policy efforts. This new entity will expand on the existing Office of International Affairs and will be responsible for various policy analysis functions critical to forming Departmental policies. The Policy Review Board within this office will evaluate and promote major policy initiatives to ensure consistency with strategic goals and priorities. The Policy Review Board in the Department assesses major policy initiatives, ensures consistency with strategic goals, and enhances inter-departmental engagement. House and Senate appropriators approved funding for OPPIA, with the Senate expecting it to assume functions of the Operational Integration Staff. Secretary Chertoff has authority to reorganize functions within DHS. Secretary Chertoff established a new centralized policy office, OPPIA, to assume functions of the Operational Integration Staff within DHS. He notified Congress of the reorganization and intended to implement the changes on October 1, 2005. The new office would be led by an Assistant Secretary, with plans to elevate them to an Under Secretary. Various existing organizational units would be relocated to this new office, including the Office of International Affairs and elements of the Border and Transportation Security Office. Secretary Chertoff established a new centralized policy office, OPPIA, to assume functions of the Operational Integration Staff within DHS. Various existing organizational units were relocated to this new office, including the Office of International Affairs and elements of the Border and Transportation Security Office. Additionally, a strategic policy planning office and a refugee policy coordinator will be established within the new policy apparatus. The Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis will be designated as the Chief Intelligence Officer, heading a strengthened Information Analysis division that will report directly to the Secretary. This will ensure coordination, fusion, and analysis of intelligence within the Department, serving as a primary connection between DHS and the intelligence community. The Directorate for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) was tasked with analyzing information to identify terrorist threats after the Homeland Security Act of 2002. However, this provision was undermined shortly after the Act was signed into law. President George W. Bush instructed the leaders of the FBI and CIA to take over intelligence analysis duties. After the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the IAIP was responsible for analyzing terrorist threats. However, President George W. Bush later instructed the FBI, CIA, DHS, and DOD to establish the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) to merge and analyze threat information. TTIC's role was explained to focus on terrorism analysis, while IAIP matched threat assessments and capabilities. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 transferred the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) to the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), which is responsible for analyzing and integrating intelligence related to terrorism, except for domestic terrorism. NCTC also conducts strategic operational planning for counterterrorism activities. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 led to the creation of the National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) and the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC). The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations directed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to review the mission and functions of the Intelligence and Analysis Program (IAIP) in light of these changes and provide a report on its future role in the intelligence community. The Senate Committee on Appropriations directed DHS to review IAIP's resource requirements and submit findings to the committee. Secretary Chertoff announced plans to elevate Information Analysis resources to a stand-alone office reporting directly to him for more effective intelligence functions within the department. Secretary Chertoff announced plans to elevate the Information Analysis resources to a stand-alone office reporting directly to him, empowering it to coordinate activities and fuse information from all intelligence offices in DHS. The Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis will be designated as the Chief Intelligence Officer, leading the renamed Office of Intelligence and Analysis (IA) to provide intelligence support to the Department and disseminate information to State and local partners. Chertoff emphasized the importance of gathering and integrating intelligence from all department components to enhance participation in the larger intelligence community. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs emphasized the importance of the DHS Chief Intelligence Officer having more to contribute to the intelligence community by gathering and integrating intelligence from all department components. The Secretary also mentioned that the DHS Chief Intelligence Officer would be one of two officials from DHS involved in the intelligence community, with a potential role at the NCTC. The DHS Chief Intelligence Officer is expected to have a role at the NCTC, with DHS aiming to play a part in the center's activities. Secretary Chertoff outlined that seven operational components within DHS will have a direct line to him, and a new Director of Operations Coordination will enhance coordination and execution of operations. The DHS will establish a new Director of Operations Coordination to work with component leadership and federal partners to ensure joint, well-coordinated actions. Secretary Chertoff plans to create an Office of Operations Coordination (OOC) within DHS to streamline coordination efforts and eliminate inefficiencies in the current process. This move will also involve eliminating the position of Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security. Secretary Chertoff plans to consolidate the Department's preparedness efforts into a single directorate led by an Under Secretary for Preparedness, while FEMA will focus on its mission of response and recovery. This restructuring aims to streamline coordination and eliminate inefficiencies in the current process. The new Preparedness Directorate, reporting directly to the Secretary, will focus on response and recovery missions. It will support FEMA with training resources and appoint a Chief Medical Officer for medical preparedness. Additionally, an Assistant Secretary for Cyber and Telecommunications Security will be created within the directorate to protect technological infrastructure. The Secretary announced the creation of the Assistant Secretary for Cyber and Telecommunications Security within the Preparedness Directorate to consolidate preparedness resources and separate them from response and recovery functions. This reorganization does not require congressional action and will include portions of FEMA such as the U.S. Fire Administration and various emergency preparedness programs. Portions of FEMA, including the U.S. Fire Administration and various emergency preparedness programs, would be transferred to the Preparedness Directorate to focus on preparedness separate from response and recovery. Secretary Chertoff emphasized the importance of maintaining FEMA's core mission while allowing the Preparedness Directorate to utilize FEMA's expertise in preparedness efforts. The restructuring aims to streamline FEMA's focus and remove elements not directly related to its core mission. The Secretary emphasized the need to streamline FEMA's focus by transferring certain elements to the Preparedness Directorate, allowing FEMA to concentrate on its core mission of response and recovery. The new directorate will unify critical functions such as prevention, protection, and response and recovery under one coordinated effort. The new Preparedness Directorate will bring together critical functions of prevention, protection, response, and recovery. The Chief Medical Officer will oversee the health response system, focusing on prevention, protection, and recovery in emergency situations. The proposed Office of Cyber Security and Telecommunications will also be established. The proposed Office of Cyber Security and Telecommunications (OCST) will focus on cyber security threats and telecommunications infrastructure to support national security and emergency communications needs. It aims to address cyber threats and establish a leadership position within the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 proposes structural realignment to address cyber security threats and establish a leadership position. Changes include shifting the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center and transferring the Federal Air Marshal Service. The reorganization aims to improve responses to Congressional reporting requirements and inquiries. The Secretary planned to merge the Offices of Legislative Affairs and State and Local Government Coordination into a new Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs. The Office of Security would return to reporting to the Under Secretary for Management to integrate security concerns more effectively. Secretary Chertoff discussed these changes and other new entities within DHS in congressional testimony. The Secretary discussed proposed relocations and new entities within DHS during congressional testimony, including the relocation of the Office of the National Capital Region Coordination to the Preparedness Directorate to enhance preparedness planning for the Capital. The Secretary discussed plans to relocate the Federal Protective Service and the Federal Air Marshal Service, emphasizing the importance of enhancing preparedness functions for protecting the Capital. He also mentioned the creation of a new Domestic Nuclear Detection Office that would report directly to him, attracting senior personnel from various departments. The President and Secretary of Energy are both committed to making this new entity work. The Secretary discussed plans to relocate the Federal Protective Service (FPS) and the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) to enhance preparedness functions for protecting the Capital. He mentioned the consideration of putting FPS in ICE due to its law enforcement function, while FAMS would be moved back to TSA to allow ICE leadership to focus on FPS. A proposed merger of CBP and ICE did not materialize in Secretary Chertoff's plans. The House Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the acting DHS Inspector General discussed the future of DHS, with one expert opposing the idea of a merger between CBP and ICE. Secretary Chertoff was asked to study the issue and report back to the committee, while the House Committee included a provision in the DHS Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 for a review of CBP and ICE organizational structure. Secretary Chertoff took the merger proposal \"very seriously\" and met with the inspector general to understand the findings. Secretary Chertoff took the CBP-ICE merger proposal seriously, meeting with the inspector general to understand the findings. He considered the merger would result in minor changes and emphasized the importance of operational collaboration with other components like the Coast Guard and infrastructure protection. Chertoff recommended a comprehensive border security strategy that involves CBP, ICE, and Coast Guard working together with a department-wide operations and planning approach. The recommended plan involves a comprehensive approach that includes CBP, ICE, and Coast Guard working together with a department-wide policy and planning structure. Secretary Chertoff emphasized the need for operational collaboration across the department, including the Coast Guard, to address the identified problems. The Coast Guard should be part of the coordination function with CBP and ICE, as they deal with different functions. A merger may not solve the issues that need to be addressed, despite the need for coordination and financial improvements. The DHS Inspector General's draft report recommended collaboration between CBP and ICE. The DHS Inspector General's draft report recommended merging CBP and ICE into a single entity, contradicting Secretary Chertoff's 2SR realignment plan. Senator Susan Collins raised concerns about the lack of legislative authority for the proposed reorganization. The DHS Inspector General's draft report recommended merging CBP and ICE into a single entity, contradicting Secretary Chertoff's 2SR realignment plan. Senator Susan Collins raised concerns about the lack of legislative authority for the proposed reorganization. As the plan is reviewed, there are concerns about the narrow list of legislative changes and the need for a more comprehensive reauthorization bill. It is suggested that many proposed changes should be done by law rather than administratively. Senator Collins questioned Secretary Chertoff's interpretation of his reorganization authority, specifically regarding Section 872 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman questioned the broad scope of the Secretary's reorganization authority under Section 872 of the Homeland Security Act. This section allows the Secretary to reallocate functions and establish organizational units within the Department, with limitations on abolishing any mandated entities or functions. The Homeland Security Act allows the Secretary to reallocate functions and establish organizational units within the Department, with limitations on abolishing mandated entities or functions. Congress intended organizational units to be smaller than agencies or other statutorily created entities. The Homeland Security Act allows the Secretary to reorganize functions and units within the Department, with a focus on smaller organizational structures. This impacts the Secretary's authority to make changes within DHS, potentially limited to units smaller than agencies or bureaus. Other structures may need to be categorized differently for reallocation. The Homeland Security Act allows the Secretary to reorganize functions within the Department, focusing on smaller organizational structures. Secretary Chertoff's reorganization of DHS resulted in a \"flattening\" of the department, but raised concerns about the scope of the term \"organizational units\" and the increase in lines of reporting to the Secretary/Deputy Secretary. The Homeland Security Act allows the Secretary to reorganize functions within the Department, focusing on smaller organizational structures. Secretary Chertoff's reorganization of DHS resulted in a \"flattening\" of the department, raising concerns about oversight and control within the Secretary's office, particularly regarding operational agencies like ICE, CBP, and TSA. Minority members of the House Committee on Homeland Security expressed frustration with the lack of details provided by Secretary Chertoff regarding his proposals, especially concerning roles within the department. The report criticized the Secretary for various mistakes, including not merging CBP and ICE as recommended, and failing to seek strengthened investigative powers for the DHS Privacy Officer. It also raised concerns about the structure advocated by the Secretary, which may create harmful competition between infrastructure protection, cybersecurity, and first-responder needs. Additionally, the report noted the Secretary's disregard for GAO and DHS Inspector General assessments supporting the elevation of certain offices in the Management Directorate. The report criticized Secretary Chertoff for not implementing a long-term planning system like a Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) as mandated by Congress. It also raised concerns about the lack of clarity in the reorganization proposal regarding the compensation level and appointment authority for new leadership positions in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Secretary's proposal for top DHS leadership positions raised questions about his authority to establish and make appointments without congressional action. Congress typically establishes department hierarchies and determines leadership positions, creating a system of accountability. Congress also has discretion over presidential appointments, with many departmental leadership positions requiring Senate confirmation. The appointment of top leadership positions in the United States involves positions that require Senate confirmation (PAS positions) and those that can be appointed by the President alone (PA positions). Congress often creates departmental leadership positions as PAS positions, allowing Senators to have a role in nominee selection and oversight. Confirmation hearings provide an opportunity for Senators to extract commitments from nominees for future appearances before Congress. This process makes it easier for Congress to call officers for testimony when needed. The appointment process for top leadership positions in the United States involves Senate confirmation for PAS positions and presidential appointment for PA positions. Congress may assign appointment authority to the President or the Secretary, impacting the level of influence they have over appointments and responsibilities. The Homeland Security Act created seven PA positions in the new department, reducing Congress's influence over these appointments. The Homeland Security Act reduced Congress's influence over appointments by creating PA positions in the new department. These positions are appointed by the President with Senate confirmation, giving the Secretary less influence over appointments. The act also created 12 Assistant Secretary positions, appointed by the President with minimal congressional involvement. President submitted nominations for Assistant Secretary positions in various departments. Changes were proposed for the roles of Assistant Secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Assistant Secretary for the Transportation Security Administration. The Border and Transportation Security Policy and Planning Office was to become part of the new OPPIA. The Border and Transportation Security Policy and Planning Office was to become part of the new OPPIA, with the Assistant Secretary position potentially elevated to Under Secretary level. Several new Assistant Secretary positions were proposed, including Cyber Security, Grants and Training, International Affairs, Private Sector, and Strategic Plans. Secretary Chertoff's reorganization proposal included the creation of several new Assistant Secretary positions, but it was unclear if they would be among the 12 statutory Assistant Secretaries provided for in the Homeland Security Act or created administratively. The Act also established two additional Assistant Secretary positions appointed by the President alone, which was a departure from prior practices in other departments. The President endorsed the view that these positions were distinct from the others. The President endorsed the creation of two distinct presidentially appointed Assistant Secretary positions, separate from the 12 statutory Assistant Secretary positions provided for in the Homeland Security Act. These positions, the Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis and Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection, were responsible for assisting the Under Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection. Secretary Chertoff's proposal aimed to elevate the Information Analysis resources to a stand-alone office. Secretary Chertoff proposed elevating the Information Analysis resources to a stand-alone office, renaming it the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (IA). The Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis would be designated as the Chief Intelligence Officer, resulting in changes to the office's organizational location, responsibilities, and title. Additionally, two non-career Senior Executive Service positions were created within DHS for program and middle-level managers. The Secretary of Homeland Security proposed creating new leadership positions within DHS, including the Director of Operations Coordination, the Director of FEMA, the head of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, and the Chief Medical Officer. These positions were to report directly to the Secretary or the Under Secretary for Preparedness. The Secretary of Homeland Security proposed new leadership positions within DHS, including the Director of Operations Coordination, FEMA Director, head of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, and Chief Medical Officer. These positions were to report directly to the Secretary or Under Secretary for Preparedness, with appointment and compensation details left unspecified. The reorganization prompted questions about department leadership structure. The Secretary of Homeland Security proposed new high-level positions with significant authority for implementing law, prompting questions about the organization of department leadership. Conferees on the DHS appropriations bill accepted amendments supporting the Secretary's reorganization plan, including abolishing the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security and merging functions into other DHS components. The Secretary of Homeland Security's reorganization plan includes abolishing the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security, dividing the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate, transferring the Federal Air Marshal Service, expanding the Office of Policy, and reorganizing various offices within the department. The Secretary of Homeland Security's reorganization plan includes transferring various offices and functions within the department, such as the Office of Immigration Statistics, Office of Security, and Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness. Additionally, a new Preparedness Directorate is established, and a Quadrennial Homeland Security Review is conducted. The DHS appropriation bill was cleared for the President's signature in October 2005. The House and Senate approved the DHS appropriation bill (H.R. 2360) in October 2005. Despite controversy over FEMA's response to Hurricane Katrina, Secretary Chertoff implemented his reorganization plan on October 1, 2005. Some confusion arose regarding the restructuring process. Secretary Chertoff restructured DHS in accordance with Section 872 of the Homeland Security Act, with an implementation date of October 1, 2005. The FY2006 Homeland Security Appropriations Act incorporated many of the proposed organizational changes from the Second Stage Review. However, critics argue that funding allocation does not equate to establishing components, as stated in a DHS press release. The conference committee report highlighted DHS's internal review since March 2005, leading to a major reorganization announcement on July 13, 2005. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) underwent a major reorganization in 2005, known as the \"Second Stage Review.\" This included abolishing the Office of the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security and splitting the Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection into two new components. The Federal Air Marshals were transferred to the Transportation Security Administration as part of the reorganization. The conferees agreed to move State and local grants to the new Preparedness Directorate and transfer Federal Air Marshals to the Transportation Security Administration. They expanded the roles of the Office of Policy but disagreed on abolishing the Office of the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security, as it would require a statutory pronouncement. Secretary Chertoff made changes to FEMA's operations following the implementation of the 2SR plan. Following the implementation of the 2SR plan, Secretary Chertoff announced changes to FEMA's operations, focusing on contracting, communications, disaster-assistance calls, and staffing levels. He reiterated his commitment to making FEMA a stand-alone entity within DHS for response and recovery efforts. Legislation has been introduced to remove FEMA from DHS and restore its independence. Secretary Chertoff also planned to restructure FEMA to operate efficiently like a modern distribution company for emergency response. Chertoff planned to restructure FEMA to operate efficiently like a modern distribution company for emergency response. The DHS inspector general's report supported the merger of CPB and ICE into a single agency, sparking a dispute within the department. Secretary Chertoff and senior DHS officials resisted the merger recommendation, but there is support for it in Congress. Charles Allen, the DHS Chief Intelligence Officer, stated he had the mandate to integrate all intelligence capabilities within the department. Charles Allen, the DHS Chief Intelligence Officer, has the mandate to integrate all intelligence capabilities within the department, including those in the Office of Intelligence and Analysis. He plans to establish a Homeland Security Intelligence Council to discuss department-wide intelligence issues and drive integration among DHS operating components. Allen emphasized the importance of DHS intelligence becoming fully involved in the Intelligence Community. Jeffrey W. Runge, the DHS Chief Medical Officer, is developing a strategic plan to enhance the Department's medical readiness by utilizing cutting-edge science, technology, and intelligence. He aims for the DHS Medical Office to be data-driven and science-based, filling gaps in medical readiness and contributing to policy-making. Jeffrey W. Runge, the DHS Chief Medical Officer, is working on enhancing the Department's medical readiness by utilizing cutting-edge science, technology, and intelligence. He plans to establish a Deputy Chief Medical Officer and three Associate Chief Medical Officers. Jeffrey A. Lowell, a former senior medical affairs advisor, highlighted the lack of a unified medical capability within the Department of Homeland Security and recommended the creation of an Office of Medical Readiness with clearly defined duties and responsibilities. Jeffrey A. Lowell recommended creating an Office of Medical Readiness within DHS, headed by a Chief Medical Officer with clearly defined duties. David Heyman emphasized the need for clarifying authorities and national leadership roles in biodefense, questioning the specific role of the CMO. David Heyman emphasized the need for clarifying authorities and national leadership roles in biodefense by establishing a lead executive, suggesting that the Chief Medical Officer's role should be more aligned with that of a Chief Health Officer. He outlined four specific areas where clear leadership is needed, indicating that the CMO's responsibilities extend beyond providing medical advice to include providing sound scientific, medical, and public health advice, developing situational awareness of biological threats and healthcare preparedness, integrating various sectors in a national strategy, and leading outreach efforts to educate citizens on preparedness. The 2SR initiative has led to leadership changes in national biodefense strategy implementation. Nominees were confirmed for new positions at DHS, including George W. Foresman as Under Secretary for Preparedness and Stewart A. Baker as Assistant Secretary for Policy. Legislation for a similar position at the under secretary level was proposed but not enacted. The position of Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis was also moved within the Directorate. The position of Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis was moved to the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, reporting directly to the Secretary. Charles E. Allen was appointed as the Chief Intelligence Officer. Congress may need to clarify the responsibilities and authority of this position. Appointments are made by the President to assist in discharging the duties previously held by the Under Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection. The Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis was moved to the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, reporting directly to the Secretary. The position no longer exists, and its successor, the Under Secretary for Preparedness, does not have authority over the Chief Intelligence Officer. Congress may need to reassess the appointment process for this position. Tracy A. Henke's nomination for the Executive Director position was pending as the Senate adjourned. Tracy A. Henke's nomination for the executive director position was pending as the Senate adjourned. Three of the four newly created assistant secretary positions were established as non-career SES positions, with individuals previously from DHS filling these roles. Alfonso Martinez-Fonts, Jr. was appointed as Assistant Secretary for Private Sector, Cresencio S. Arcos as Assistant Secretary for International Affairs, and Robert Stephan as Assistant Secretary for Strategic Plans. The last assistant secretary position for Cyber remained unfilled. The Assistant Secretary for Cyber Security and Telecommunications position remained vacant as of the end of the first session, with the appointment pending completion of the FY2006 DHS appropriations process. The evolution of the DHS has created three categories of assistant secretaries, with varying levels of appointment authority and responsibility. The usage of the assistant secretary title across different categories within the DHS is unusual. It is unclear if all assistant secretaries will have the same policymaking authority. Senate-confirmed appointees are subject to greater scrutiny and accountability. Some positions remain vacant or are filled by acting officials. The Chief Medical Officer position was newly created and filled in 2005. The Chief Medical Officer position, newly created as a non-career SES position, was filled on September 4, 2005, when Secretary Chertoff appointed Jeffrey W. Runge. The Director of the Nuclear Detection Office, also established as a non-career SES position, was filled by Vayl Oxford. R. David Paulison continued to serve as the Acting Director of FEMA. The status of the Director of Operations Coordination position was uncertain. Congress may evaluate the leadership structure of DHS and consider codifying existing arrangements or alternative ones. The Department of Homeland Security Reform Act of 2005, introduced by Representative Bennie G. Thompson, aims to evaluate leadership selection processes and implement aspects of Secretary Chertoff's reorganization plan. It requires a comprehensive examination of DHS through a Quadrennial Homeland Security Review to assess various capabilities and resources. The Department of Homeland Security Reform Act of 2005 establishes an Office of Intelligence and Analysis led by a Chief Intelligence Officer appointed by the President. It abolishes the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Preparedness Directorate and directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to create a task force on protecting security-relevant, unclassified information from the private sector. The Department of Homeland Security Reform Act of 2005 establishes an Office of Intelligence and Analysis led by a Chief Intelligence Officer appointed by the President. It also redesignates the Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate as the Preparedness and Response Directorate, appoints an Assistant Secretary for Preparedness, and establishes a Military Liaison within the Preparedness and Response Directorate. The Department of Homeland Security Reform Act of 2005 establishes a Military Liaison within the Preparedness and Response Directorate, appoints a Director of FEMA with a five-year term, and establishes a Chief Medical Officer with specified responsibilities. The Department of Homeland Security Reform Act of 2005 establishes a Chief Medical Officer within the Preparedness and Response Directorate, with specified responsibilities, who shall be an Assistant Secretary. It also provides for the merger of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) into a single operational unit within DHS. Additionally, it strengthens the investigative authority of the Privacy Officer, abolishes the Under Secretary for Management, and establishes joint authority for the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer, and Chief Human Capital Officer over the component agencies and entities of DHS. The Department of Homeland Security Reform Act of 2005 establishes a Business Transformation Officer within DHS to develop a management integration strategy. It allows employees to file complaints with the Department of Labor for retaliation, establishes an Office of Tribal Security within DHS, and makes retaliation against whistleblowers punishable by ten years in prison. The Homeland Security Policy Act of 2005, introduced by Senator Susan Collins and Senator John Warner, amends the Homeland Security Act to establish various offices and positions within DHS, including an Office of Tribal Security, a National Cybersecurity Office, an Assistant Secretary for Physical Infrastructure Security, an Under Secretary for Policy, and a program for the secure handling of ammonium nitrate. The Homeland Security Policy Act of 2005, introduced by Senator Susan Collins and Senator John Warner, establishes an Under Secretary for Policy in the Department of Homeland Security."
