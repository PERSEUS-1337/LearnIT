    "content": "The United States has two tsunami warning centers managed by NOAA's National Weather Service. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii monitors and issues warnings for the Pacific basin, while the National Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska covers the West Coast and Alaska. The PTWC also monitors the Indian Ocean, South China Sea, and Caribbean Sea. Established in 1949 after a tsunami hit Hawaii, the PTWC issued warnings for Alaska until the WC/ATWC was created in 1967. The National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC) was established in 1967 after the Good Friday earthquake in Alaska. It issues tsunami warnings for Alaska, British Columbia, Washington State, Oregon, California, U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts, Atlantic coast of Canada, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and British Virgin Islands. The NTWC monitors seismic data to determine tsunami likelihood and transmits warnings to NOAA for dissemination. The National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC) monitors seismic data to determine tsunami likelihood and transmits warnings to NOAA for dissemination. After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Congress passed the Tsunami Warning and Education Act to enhance the Pacific Tsunami Warning System and improve forecast accuracy. NOAA uses a network of DART buoys to confirm tsunami generation and cancel warnings if necessary. The Tsunami Warning and Education Act (P.L. 109-424) was passed to enhance the Pacific Tsunami Warning System by expanding and modernizing the DART system. This included increasing the number of U.S. DART buoys to 39 and requiring NWS to prioritize maintaining tsunami detection equipment. Additionally, other countries operate 21 DART buoys globally. The Act also mandates NOAA to report any impaired forecasting capabilities or contractor failures related to the tsunami warning system. The National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP) was formed in response to the recognition of a tsunami threat to Oregon, Washington State, and Northern California from a large earthquake on the Cascadia subduction zone. As of November 18, 2015, 4 out of 39 U.S. buoys were not operational, which could lead to broader tsunami warnings and longer warning durations. NOAA monitors impaired forecasting capabilities and contractor failures related to the tsunami warning system. The National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP) addresses the tsunami threat to Oregon, Washington State, and Northern California from the Cascadia subduction zone. It aims to raise awareness, develop tsunami maps, improve warning systems, and incorporate tsunami planning into multi-hazard programs. NOAA is charged with addressing the nation's priorities in tsunami detection, warning, and mitigation. The NTHMP, authorized by P.L. 109-424, is responsible for NOAA's tsunami activities including detection, warning, forecasts, communication, outreach, education, and research. Congress has emphasized the importance of maintaining the DART buoy network. Bills in the 113th and 114th Congress address DART buoy maintenance and availability. In the 114th Congress, bills (H.R. 34 and S. 533) addressed DART buoy maintenance and NTHMP issues. Both bills aimed to amend the Tsunami Warning and Education Act, authorizing appropriations through FY2017 or FY2021. The legislation would broaden the program to include more focus on tsunami research and outreach without making fundamental changes. The House- and Senate-passed bills aim to amend the Tsunami Warning and Education Act by broadening the program to include more focus on tsunami research and outreach. Both bills would streamline and update language in several subsections, with some differences noted, such as the Senate version requiring 80% of DART buoys to be maintained at operational. Both the House- and Senate-passed bills aim to amend the Tsunami Warning and Education Act by updating language and requirements for the Tsunami Warning System. The Senate version includes provisions for maintaining DART buoys and cooperation among agencies for seismic information, while the House version focuses on forecasting tsunamis in various oceans and supporting international efforts. Both bills explicitly name the NTWC and emphasize the use of multiple models for predicting tsunami arrival times. The House-passed bill adds new subsections requiring fail-safe warning capability and coordination with NWS, NTHMP, and NOAA. The Senate-passed bill focuses on calculating new inundation estimates and coordinating with the Coast Guard. Both bills emphasize coordination with the NWS. The House-passed bill emphasizes coordination with the NWS and directs the NWS to coordinate with tsunami warning centers. The Senate-passed bill focuses on coordinating with the NOAA administrator and other program offices. Both bills aim to ensure timely delivery of tsunami warnings through mass communication tools. The House-passed bill and the Senate-passed bill differ in their approach to reporting requirements for the integration of the tsunami warning system with other U.S. observational systems. The Senate bill includes a provision for congressional notification within 90 days of a significant tsunami warning, while the House bill does not have this requirement. Both bills emphasize coordination with relevant agencies to ensure timely delivery of tsunami warnings. Both the House-passed and Senate-passed bills focus on improving tsunami preparedness and resilience in at-risk areas. They both require consultation with relevant agencies, such as FEMA and NOAA, for a community-based tsunami hazard mitigation program. The bills also include expanded and modified requirements for program components, such as providing technical and financial assistance to coastal states, tribes, and local governments. Additionally, they both emphasize the development of regional tsunami hazard and risk assessments. The Senate bill specifically mentions evaluations and technical assistance for vertical evacuation structure planning in communities with limited ability for evacuation. The House-passed and Senate-passed bills focus on improving tsunami preparedness and resilience in at-risk areas. They require consultation with relevant agencies like FEMA and NOAA for a community-based tsunami hazard mitigation program. The bills include expanded requirements for program components, such as providing technical and financial assistance to coastal states, tribes, and local governments. The Senate bill also mentions evaluations and technical assistance for vertical evacuation structure planning in communities with limited ability for evacuation. Section 5 of the House-passed and Senate-passed bills allows states to designate at-risk areas based on local conditions, in addition to federal designations. It also requires a report on accrediting the TsunamiReady program. Both bills modify the research program to involve NOAA and other agencies, academic institutions, and advisory committees. Section 6 expands the responsibilities of the research program. Section 6 of the bill broadens the responsibilities of the research program to include considering other research to mitigate tsunami impacts, improving near-field tsunami detection and forecasting abilities, and developing the technical basis for validation of tsunami maps and forecasts. The House-passed bill also allows NOAA to launch a pilot project in the Cascadia region for near-field tsunami forecasting, while the Senate-passed bill does not include this provision. The Cascadia subduction zone has the potential for major earthquakes and tsunamis, similar to the 2011 Great Sendai Earthquake in Japan. Both House and Senate bills aim to update language and require NOAA to coordinate with international entities for tsunami forecasting. A new advisory panel would be established to assist in these efforts. The House and Senate bills aim to establish a new advisory panel to advise NOAA on tsunami science, technology, and regional preparedness. The panel would meet every four years to review federal government activities and submit recommendations to NOAA, which would then report to Congress on progress in implementing the Tsunami Warning and Education Act. The proposed legislation includes detailed progress reports on implementing various sections, such as ensuring resources availability, disseminating guidelines for community planning and education, and developing technical validation for tsunami maps and models. It also requires standardization of tsunami warnings with other natural hazards and an additional report on national efforts for rapid emergency response following a domestic near-shore tsunami event. The House-passed bill authorizes $27 million annually for tsunami activities for three years, with specific allocations for NTHMP and Tsunami Research Program. The Senate-passed bill extends the program for six years and emphasizes coordination with state and local emergency managers for outreach and education on tsunamis. The House-passed bill authorizes $27 million annually for tsunami activities for three years, with specific allocations for NTHMP and Tsunami Research Program. Section 11 of the bill would reauthorize the NOAA administrator to convene a coordinating committee to assist with the administration of the NTHMP, ensuring representation from states at risk from tsunamis and providing feedback on fund prioritization and program improvements. The Senate Appropriations Committee instructed NOAA to maintain funding for the NTHMP at the FY2014 level for FY2015, rejecting NOAA's proposal to terminate funding for tsunami preparedness. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $27 million for the NOAA Tsunami Program, supporting maintenance for the DART buoy network and instructing NOAA to maintain availability at no fewer than 80% of stations. Additionally, $6 million was included above NOAA's request for FY2015 to restore proposed reductions to NTHMP grant funds. In FY2015, NOAA allocated $31.4 million for tsunami activities, with $12.2 million for Observations PPA and $19.2 million for Analyze, Forecast, and Support PPA. The FY2016 budget request was $6 million less than FY2015, leading to a reduction in NTHMP grant funds. NOAA's tsunami program funding historically supports warning, mitigation, and research activities. The NOAA tsunami program has historically supported warning, mitigation, and research activities. Funding for these activities ranged from $5 million to $10 million annually between FY1997 and FY2004, but increased after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami to $27 million in FY2005 and $42 million in FY2009. The proportion of funding allocated to warning activities increased from 40% in FY2004 to 70% in FY2009, while mitigation decreased from 50% to 30%, and research remained steady at 6-10%."
