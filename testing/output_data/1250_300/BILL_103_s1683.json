Management - The Commission shall manage the acquired land to enhance protection of watersheds, outdoor recreational, wildlife habitat, and Appalachian Trail values in the Sterling Forest area of the New York/New Jersey Highlands Region. SEC-3 Authorization of Appropriations. The Sterling Forest Protection Act of 1994 authorizes appropriations for acquiring land described in section 2 and allows the Secretary of the Interior to transfer funds to the Commission for implementation. The Act is also known as the \"Sterling Forest Protection Act of 1994.\" The Palisades Interstate Park Commission manages 23 parks and historic sites in New York and New Jersey, totaling over 82,000 acres. Sterling Forest, a biologically diverse area on the New Jersey border, covers approximately 17,500 acres and serves as a crucial watershed area providing clean drinking water for 25% of the state. It is also a significant outdoor recreational asset in the densely populated northeastern United States. Sterling Forest is strategically located on a wildlife migratory route and supports a mixture of hardwood forests, wetlands, lakes, and glaciated valleys. It provides habitat for 27 rare or endangered species and enhances the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. Protection of Sterling Forest through the Palisades Interstate Park Commission would involve minimal costs for stewardship and management. The protection of Sterling Forest through the Palisades Interstate Park Commission will involve minimal Federal funds due to stewardship and management costs being covered by New York and New Jersey. There is a clear Federal interest in acquiring Sterling Forest for permanent protection of its watershed, recreational, wildlife, and open space qualities, which is a cost-effective investment compared to the costs of protecting the region's drinking water if the forest is developed. The Sterling Forest Reserve in New York is established to protect the watershed, wildlife, and recreational resources in the region. Federal funding will be provided for acquisition costs, and the management will be overseen by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. The definitions of key terms like \"Commission,\" \"Reserve,\" and \"Secretary\" are also outlined in the Act. The Sterling Forest Reserve is established to protect the region's watershed, wildlife, and recreational resources. Federal funding will be provided for acquisition costs, and management will be overseen by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. The Sterling Forest Reserve is established in New York to protect the region's resources. The Reserve consists of approximately 17,500 acres of lands. Federal funds will be transferred for land acquisition, and management will be overseen by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. The Palisades Interstate Park Commission must agree to specific terms and conditions before receiving federal funds for land acquisition within the Sterling Forest Reserve. This includes managing acquired lands in accordance with the Act, obtaining consent from landowners for acquisitions, and prioritizing the acquisition of designated National Park Service lands. The Palisades Interstate Park Commission must convey conservation easements on designated National Park Service Wilderness and Conservation Easement Lands within 30 days of acquisition to protect wilderness character and restrict development. The Palisades Interstate Park Commission must convey conservation easements on designated National Park Service Conservation Easement Lands to restrict development and protect the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. Funds for the Commission must be matched from non-Federal sources. The Commission will manage lands in the Reserve according to its authorities and the Act's purposes. A general management plan must be prepared within 3 years for approval by the Secretary. Appropriations are authorized for the Act's implementation, with a limit of $17,500,000 for land acquisition within the Reserve."
