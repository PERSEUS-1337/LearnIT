    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Delta smelt, a small fish native to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, is a vulnerable species with low fecundity and a limited diet. Listed as threatened in 1993, it faces various threats including habitat loss, reduced food supply, invasive species, rising temperatures, and toxic contaminants. The Delta smelt faces threats such as habitat loss, reduced food supply, invasive species, rising temperatures, and toxic contaminants. It is crucial to implement a comprehensive strategy for a sustainable Delta to ensure the survival of sensitive species like the Delta smelt. Immediate action is needed to address the critical condition of the Delta smelt population, including the establishment of a Delta smelt hatchery to provide near-term benefits. The Delta Smelt Preservation and Restoration Act of 2016 establishes a program for Delta Smelt Hatchery in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to increase the population of Delta smelt. The act defines terms like \"banking partner,\" \"Delta,\" \"Delta smelt,\" and \"mitigation bank\" for the purpose of preserving and restoring the Delta smelt population. The Delta Smelt Preservation and Restoration Act of 2016 establishes the Delta Smelt Hatchery Program to preserve and restore the Delta smelt population. The program includes creating a genetic refugia population, developing broodstock for scientific and educational purposes, and providing fish for supplementation of wild populations. The program aims to implement a propagation facility and identify suitable sites for the hatchery by January 1, 2018. The Delta Smelt Preservation and Restoration Act of 2016 establishes the Delta Smelt Hatchery Program to preserve and restore the Delta smelt population. The program aims to create a genetic refugia population, develop broodstock for scientific and educational purposes, and provide fish for supplementation of wild populations. It includes identifying suitable sites for the hatchery, developing a hatchery management plan, establishing a mitigation bank, and adopting guidelines for participation. The department will enter into mitigation banking agreements with partners to provide take authorization for Delta smelt. Agreements must require partners to participate in the mitigation bank proportionally to their impact on Delta smelt and contribute financially for annual operations of the Delta smelt hatchery. If all requirements are met, the department will issue permits for incidental take to participating banking partners. The department will issue permits for incidental take to participating banking partners under a mitigation banking agreement. Delta smelt reared for various purposes will count towards mitigation credits, with excess hatchery production creating credits for future activities. Funding for program operation and a Delta smelt hatchery will come from revenues received from banking partners, dedicated solely to program implementation. Funding for the long-term operation and maintenance of a Delta smelt hatchery will come from revenues received from banking partners. Costs for planning, design, and construction of the hatchery will be allocated from specific funds. An audit of all program funds will be conducted every three years. The department may contract with public agencies for hatchery operations and partner with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for hatchery establishment. The department may partner with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to establish a Delta smelt hatchery, ensuring compliance with all requirements. They will cooperate on developing long-term Delta ecosystem solutions and include a program from Section 1712. Protections for Delta smelt under state law will not be diminished, illegal taking is prohibited, and compliance with the California Endangered Species Act is mandatory."
