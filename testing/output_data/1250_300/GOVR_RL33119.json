    "content": "Prior to the passage of SAFETEA, federal highway, highway safety, and transit programs were subject to periodic reauthorization. The most recent authorization was the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), which provided funds for FY1998-FY2003. Short-term extension acts were used after October 1, 2003, causing uncertainty in the highway and transit community. Long-term reauthorizations, like TEA-21, are preferred for better planning and construction. The passage of SAFETEA was welcomed, despite delays, as it provided funding until FY2009. Federal funding for surface transportation is closely linked to the revenue stream provided by the highway trust fund, which consists of separate accounts for highways and mass transit. The primary revenue sources are gasoline and diesel fuel taxes, with the transit account receiving 2.86 cents per gallon. Over the almost 50-year life of the trust fund, there have been several tax increases, with the last one occurring in 1993. Despite delays, the passage of SAFETEA was welcomed by transit interests at the state and local level, as it provided funding until FY2009. The fuel tax increased in 1993, with funds initially deposited into the Treasury general funds for deficit reduction until FY1998. The trust fund has been a reliable source of funding for surface transportation for almost 50 years. In FY2004, the highway account received $31 billion in tax revenues, while the mass transit account received $5 billion. The trust fund has historically collected more than spent, but this trend is changing. The unexpended balance is substantial but declining, leading to uncertainty about its long-term financial health. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 aimed to address these issues. The trust fund's balance is substantial but declining, causing uncertainty about its long-term financial health. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provided additional income through changes in gasohol taxation. However, disagreement between Congress and the Administration on program funding for reauthorization was due to differing views on project funding levels and fuel tax increases. The Administration objected to raising fuel taxes for project funding, while Congress proposed various mechanisms, including gasohol changes, to support a larger program. Conferees on SAFETEA considered tax and other changes to increase revenues for the trust fund. The revenue increases were modest and aimed at cutting tax fraud and transferring Treasury general fund revenues to the trust fund. TEA-21 aimed to finance a $286.4 billion program by cutting tax fraud and transferring Treasury revenues to the trust fund. It created new budget categories and set limitations on obligations, with adjustments based on highway revenues. TEA-21 established Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to adjust highway account amounts based on revenue changes. This ensured predetermined funding levels for core highway and transit programs, separate from the discretionary budget. \"Firewalls\" prevented funds from being used for other purposes, guaranteeing minimum funding levels. Additional funds could be allocated through annual appropriations. SAFETEA, like TEA-21, established guaranteed funding levels for highway and transit programs. SAFETEA provided $286.4 billion in spending authority for FY2004-FY2009, a significant increase from TEA-21's $218 billion for FY1998-2003. The debate around SAFETEA mainly focused on funding distribution and while it represented a funding increase, it fell short of original expectations. SAFETEA provided just over $244 billion in guaranteed spending authority between FY2005-FY2009, with significant funding increases for all major programs. Total annual spending increased each year, with FY2009 spending almost 23% higher than in FY2005. The House version of SAFETEA included a provision objected to by the Bush Administration. Detailed programmatic information can be found at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/safetealu/fundtables.htm. The House version of SAFETEA contained a provision called the \"re-opener\" that would have required Congress to reconsider funding at a later date. The Bush Administration opposed this provision, which was ultimately not included in the final act. SAFETEA changed how the spending mechanism RABA was calculated, using a two-year calculation instead of one year to make revenue swings less dramatic. SAFETEA changed how RABA is calculated by using a two-year calculation instead of one year, reducing spending reductions by requiring a $6 billion balance in the highway trust fund. Transportation policy battles often align regionally rather than along party lines, with debates over the distribution of federal highway aid among states. Congress has addressed funding distribution concerns through minimum guarantee provisions in surface transportation reauthorization acts since 1982. Some states have complained about receiving less federal highway aid than their highway taxes contribute to the highway trust fund. Some states have complained about receiving less federal highway aid than their highway taxes contribute to the highway trust fund. Donor states advocate for a higher share rate-of-return on their tax payments to the Treasury, citing the need for equity and fairness. They argue that they have been subsidizing the repair and improvement of infrastructure in donee states for too long, especially in the Northeast. Donor states also claim to be more road dependent and less benefited from federal transit spending compared to some donee states. Southern and western donor states emphasize their fast growth areas, seeking a larger portion of federal highway aid. Advocates from donor states argue for a fairer distribution of federal transit spending, emphasizing their road dependency and fast growth areas. Donee state advocates counter that fairness should consider infrastructure age, urban road congestion, and limited financial resources. They also argue for federal involvement in national highway networks and criticize Midwestern and southern states for seeking federal funds without investing their own resources. The debate over equity remedies in federal transit spending has implications for various overarching issues. Some argue that a 95% rate of return guarantee could limit addressing other federal transportation needs, while questions arise about the federal government's role as the guarantee approaches 100%. Controversial issues include whether the guarantee should include Federal Transit Administration programs and whether converting the Federal aid highway program to a revenue sharing or block grant program makes sense. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor state demands for a higher rate-of-return and donee state demands to be held harmless amidst HTF revenue constraints. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor state demands for a higher rate-of-return and donee state demands to be held harmless amidst HTF revenue constraints. To address this, a minimum guarantee mechanism was constructed in previous reauthorization bills, including \"hold harmless\" provisions to maintain base shares for all states. This required increasing the overall federal highway program size to bring donor state shares up to a designated percentage share of 90.5%. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor state demands for a higher rate-of-return and donee state demands to be held harmless amidst HTF revenue constraints. To address this, a minimum guarantee mechanism was constructed in previous reauthorization bills, including \"hold harmless\" provisions to maintain base shares for all states. Providing equity remedies involved giving more money to all states, with even more allocated to donor states to reach a designated percentage share of 90.5%. The SAFETEA Act replaced the TEA-21 MG program with an \"Equity Bonus\" program to ensure each state receives at least a return of 90.5% for FY2005-2006. The act directs the Secretary of Transportation to allocate funds to states to ensure a minimum return of 90.5% for FY2005-2006, 91.5% for FY2007, and 92% for FY2008-2009 on their estimated payments to the highway account of the HTF. Various programs are subject to the equity provision, including new formula programs and hold harmless provisions for certain states. States qualifying for the EB program must meet specific criteria to receive a minimum return of their annual TEA-21 apportionments. Twenty-seven states meet these criteria, including Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, and others. The EB program also guarantees that no state receives less than a set percentage of its average annual TEA-21 apportionments each fiscal year. The Equity Bonus Program ensures that qualifying states receive a minimum return of their annual TEA-21 apportionments. States like New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and others are included. Each state has an annual percentage floor, ranging from 117% to 121% for different fiscal years. The program distributes funds to core programs based on apportionment ratios, costing $40.9 billion over five years. The distribution of funds among various highway programs is based on apportionment ratios, with the Equity Bonus Program ensuring states receive a minimum return of their annual TEA-21 apportionments. Over five years, these distributions will cost $40.9 billion. The core programs, including interstate maintenance, national highway system, surface transportation program, highway bridge and bridge maintenance, congestion mitigation and air quality, and the new highway safety improvement program, receive funding through these apportioned programs. The surface transportation bill includes core highway programs such as interstate maintenance, national highway system, surface transportation program, highway bridge maintenance, congestion mitigation, air quality, and highway safety improvement. Additional smaller programs like metropolitan planning and recreational trails are also included. SAFETEA introduces new formula programs like Coordinated Border Infrastructure and Safe Routes to School. Funding distribution is based on apportionment ratios, with the Equity Bonus Program ensuring states receive a minimum return of their annual apportionments. The SAFETEA surface transportation bill introduces new formula programs like the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program and the Safe Routes to School Program. Funding distribution is based on apportionment ratios, with adjustments made to existing program formulas. The act eliminates the 10% safety STP set-aside and continues the STP Transportation Enhancements set-aside. The SAFETEA surface transportation bill eliminates the 10% safety STP set-aside and continues the STP Transportation Enhancements set-aside. Adjustments were made to the CMAQ calculation for non-attainment areas. The act also creates set-asides for ferry boats, Territorial Highway Program, and off-system bridges. Formula distribution is based on federal lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, and annual fatalities on federal-aid highways. The SAFETEA surface transportation bill adjusts funding distribution for federal-aid highways based on vehicle miles traveled and annual fatalities. It sets aside funds for the Railway-Highway Crossings program and requires states to allocate $90 million annually for high-risk rural road improvements. Under SAFETEA, funds are apportioned to states along the Canada-U.S. and Mexico-U.S. borders based on various factors such as commercial truck crossings, personal vehicle and bus crossings, weight of incoming cargo, and number of ports-of-entry. Additionally, funds are distributed among states based on total student enrollment in primary and middle schools, with no state receiving less than $1 million. Under SAFETEA, funds are apportioned to states based on total student enrollment in primary and middle schools, with no state receiving less than $1 million. Non-apportioned highway programs are subject to allocations based on criteria in highway laws and may be earmarked by Congress. The largest allocated program is for congressionally mandated high priority projects, with other significant programs including the federal lands program and the transportation improvement program. SAFETEA introduces new allocated programs like the transportation improvement program and projects of national or regional significance, all subject to 100% earmarking. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as GARVEEs, aim to expedite project completion and attract additional funds for highway projects. SAFETEA introduces new programs like the transportation improvement program and projects of national or regional significance, subject to 100% earmarking. It also implements innovative financing mechanisms such as GARVEEs, TIFIA, and SIBs to expedite project completion and attract additional funds for highway projects. The program provides federal financial assistance for major transportation projects through secured loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit, with changes to minimum project size thresholds and annual funding for leveraging activities. Federal funds under the SIB program help capitalize state infrastructure revolving funds. SAFETEA lowers the minimum project threshold for intelligent transportation system projects to $15 million and provides $122 million annually for TIFIA's leveraging activities. The program allows any state to establish SIBs capitalized with federal funds. SAFETEA authorizes tolling programs and HOV lane tolling, with $11 million for FY2005 and $12 million annually for FY2006-FY2009, including $3 million for non-tolling congestion pricing pilot projects. The current law authorizes $11 million for FY2005 and $12 million annually for FY2006-FY2009 for tolling projects. The program directs the Secretary of Transportation to carry out 15 demonstration projects for toll collection to manage congestion, reduce emissions, or finance highway expansion. Funding is mainly for HOT lanes, with restrictions on revenue use for debt service and operating costs. The current law authorizes funding for tolling projects, mainly for HOT lanes. Revenues are restricted to debt service, a reasonable return on financing, and operating costs. Tolls can vary by time of day or congestion level to improve air quality and manage traffic. A pilot toll program allows states to collect tolls on Interstate System highways for construction purposes. Fees must be collected electronically. The pilot toll program allows states to collect tolls on Interstate System highways for construction purposes. States must demonstrate toll financing is the most efficient way to advance the project. Revenues can only be used for debt service, investor returns, and maintenance costs. Private agreements cannot prevent states from improving adjacent public roads affected by toll facility traffic. Maintenance program funds cannot be used on toll facilities. The act allows states to collect tolls on Interstate System highways for construction purposes, with revenues used for debt service, investor returns, and maintenance costs. It also permits tolling of vehicles not eligible for HOV use, with requirements for enrollment, toll collection, demand management, and enforcement. Additionally, low emission and energy-efficient vehicles may receive preferential rates for HOV use. The act allows states to collect tolls on Interstate System highways for construction purposes, with revenues used for debt service, investor returns, and maintenance costs. It also permits tolling of vehicles not eligible for HOV use, with requirements for enrollment, toll collection, demand management, and enforcement. Section 1121 allows for tolling of \"low emission and energy-efficient vehicles\" at a preferential rate for HOV use. The act amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow tax-exempt private activity bonds for financing highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities. This provision qualifies three categories of projects for tax-exempt facility bonding with a $15 billion limit on the bonds that can be issued. The conference report places a $15 billion limit on the aggregate face amount of bonds that can be issued under Title 23 or Title 49 for infrastructure creation. This bonding provision could have a substantial impact, with California alone receiving more than $15 billion in formula highway assistance. The provision is considered important in SAFETEA, and projects using private activity bonds are likely to be supported by tolls. The ADHP is a road building program aimed at promoting Appalachian economic development, funded by the highway trust fund and administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission. The Appalachian Development Highway Program (ADHP) is funded by the highway trust fund and administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission. It receives annual funding under TEA-21 and SAFETEA, with a total estimated cost of $4.47 billion to complete the system. SAFETEA provides $470 million annually for the ADHP, with restrictions on toll revenues for non-federal matching funds. The program has a significant level of earmarking under SAFETEA, with over 5,092 projects funded. The SAFETEA act prohibits using toll revenues as credits for non-federal matching funds on ADHP-funded projects. It includes over 5,092 earmarks for high priority projects valued at $14.8 billion, compared to TEA-21's 1,849 earmarks worth $9.4 billion. Additionally, SAFETEA introduces new earmarked categories, such as projects of national and regional significance and national corridor infrastructure improvements. The SAFETEA act includes over 5,092 earmarks for high priority projects valued at $14.8 billion. There are new earmarked categories for national corridor infrastructure improvements and transportation improvements, totaling over $2.5 billion in funding. Individual projects may appear in multiple earmarking lists with varying funding amounts. Additionally, there are 32 individually listed earmarks in the highway title and 25 earmarks in the research title, requiring additional funding. The SAFETEA act includes numerous earmarks totaling billions of dollars. The bill contains earmarks for high priority projects, national corridor infrastructure improvements, and transportation improvements. Earmarks are found in various titles of the bill, with some projects receiving more funding than others. The discussion around earmarks has focused on their impact on the Equity Bonus calculation and state shares. The SAFETEA act includes earmarks for high priority projects, national corridor infrastructure improvements, and transportation enhancements. Earmarks are distributed across different titles of the bill, impacting state shares and the Equity Bonus calculation. The Transportation Enhancements program funds various project categories such as pedestrian and bicycle facilities, historic preservation, and outdoor advertising control. The Transportation Enhancements program funds various project categories such as pedestrian and bicycle facilities, historic preservation, outdoor advertising control, archeological planning, environmental mitigation, and transportation museums. Funding for the program is the greater of 10% of funds apportioned to a state under the Surface Transportation Program or the amount apportioned in FY2005, ensuring additional funding for enhancement projects. The TCSP program assists in integrating transportation, community, and system preservation plans and practices. Funding for enhancement projects is available through the TCSP program, which aims to integrate transportation, community, and system preservation plans. State, tribal, regional, and local governments are eligible for TCSP grants, with a total funding authorization of $270 million over six years. This is more than the previous authorization under TEA-21 but less than the funds appropriated during that time. The TCSP program, funded with $25 million for FY2005 and $61.25 million for FY2006-FY2009, provides significant funding for bicycle and pedestrian programs. Under TEA-21, TCSP spending was authorized at $20 million for FY1999 and $25 million per year for FY2000 through FY2003. SAFETEA continues to support pedestrian and bicycle mobility, with a focus on non-motorized trips, safety, health, and education programs. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program has been a key federal program for pedestrian and bicycle projects since ISTEA. The Transportation Enhancements (TE) program has been a key federal program for pedestrian and bicycle projects since ISTEA. It allows states to allocate funds for facilities, safety, and education activities for pedestrians and bicyclists. Other programs also support the construction of bicycle and pedestrian facilities. The Safe Routes to School Program, under SAFETEA, encourages children to walk and bike to school. The Safe Routes to School Program, part of SAFETEA, aims to promote walking and biking to school for children, making it a safer transportation option. It is funded at $612 million for FY2004-FY2009, with each state receiving a minimum of $1 million per year. The program is administered by each state's department of transportation. The Safe Routes to School Program allocates federal funds of at least $1 million per year for each state's transportation department to improve infrastructure for students to walk and bike to school. The federal share covers 100% of project costs, with funds remaining available until expended. Eligible agencies include state, local, and regional entities, as well as nonprofit organizations. Projects funded under the program include sidewalk improvements, traffic calming measures, bicycle facilities, pedestrian crossings, and secure bike parking. The Safe Routes to School Program provides federal funds for infrastructure improvements such as sidewalk enhancements, traffic calming measures, bicycle facilities, pedestrian crossings, and secure bike parking. Funds can also be used for non-infrastructure activities like public awareness campaigns, traffic education, and coordinator positions for safe routes to school programs. The Safe Routes to School Program requires states to use a portion of funding to support a full-time coordinator position. Grants are provided to a national nonprofit organization to operate a clearinghouse, develop educational programs, and offer technical assistance. A task force is established to study and advance safe routes to school programs nationwide. SAFETEA guarantees $45.3 billion for transit over five years, with a total of $52.6 billion over six years, a 46% increase from the previous authorization. The SAFETEA Act guarantees $45.3 billion for transit over five years, totaling $52.6 billion over six years, a 46% increase from the previous authorization. Congress shifted funding shares within the transit program, with changes in funding distribution among urbanized and non-urbanized areas and states based on population size. Minor changes were made to the federal transit program, including the addition of new programs and funding categories. The SAFETEA Act guarantees $45.3 billion for transit over five years, with changes in funding distribution among urbanized and non-urbanized areas and states based on population size. Minor changes were made to the federal transit program, including new programs and funding categories. Additional provisions include requirements for federal agencies in the National Capital Region to offer transit passes as a fringe benefit, eligibility for FTA grants for alternatives analysis, and earmarks for the Bus and Bus Facilities Program. These programs provide $1.7 billion in additional funding over the FY2006-FY2009 period. The SAFETEA Act allocates $45.3 billion for transit over five years, with changes in funding distribution based on population size. A formula program is implemented to increase transportation services for persons with disabilities, with $339 million authorized over FY2006-FY2009. Additionally, a discretionary grant program provides transportation alternatives in national parks and public lands. The discretionary grant program provides transportation alternatives in national parks and public lands to protect and provide access for everyone, including persons with disabilities. It has a total authorization of $97 million and is exempt from labor protection provisions. A new formula program within the Urbanized Area Formula Program provides additional funding for small urbanized areas with populations under 200,000 that offer comparable transit service to larger urbanized areas. The Urbanized Area Formula Program provides additional funding for small urbanized areas with populations under 200,000 that offer comparable transit service to larger urbanized areas. This program addresses the issue of smaller areas not receiving recognition and funding for providing higher levels of transit service. DOT concluded that changes in the apportionment formulas are needed to reward these transit-intensive areas. The Urbanized Area Formula Program aims to reward transit-intensive areas with populations under 200,000 for providing comparable service to larger urbanized areas. Changes in the apportionment formulas will shift funding from larger to smaller urbanized areas. The New Starts program funds fixed-guideway transit systems, with a streamlined evaluation process for projects seeking less than $75 million in federal funding. $200 million annually is authorized for FY2007-FY2009, with $45 million set aside for grants to Indian tribes for public transportation. The evaluation process for projects seeking less than $25 million in federal funding is eliminated. $45 million is set aside for grants to Indian tribes for public transportation on Indian reservations. 20% of the Non-Urbanized Area Formula program funding will be apportioned based on a state's share of the nation's total non-urbanized land area. The act authorizes $90 million for magnetic levitation train deployment for FY2005-FY2009, with 50% allocated for a project between Las Vegas and Primm, Nevada, and 50% for a project east of the Mississippi River. The TEA-21 program authorized $950 million for maglev projects, with 50% allocated for a project between Las Vegas and Primm, Nevada, and 50% for a project east of the Mississippi River. The program aims to administer new projects and reauthorizes the Swift Rail Act for high-speed rail corridor development. Funding levels are set at $70 million annually for corridor development and $30 million for technology improvements. Additionally, $50 million is authorized for rail-highway grade crossing hazard elimination in high-speed rail corridors. Grants are also directed to the Alaska Railroad for capital rehabilitation and improvements. The act authorizes a total of $50 million over FY2005-FY2009 for the elimination of rail-highway grade crossing hazards in high-speed rail corridors. Grants are directed to the Alaska Railroad for capital rehabilitation and improvements benefiting passenger transportation. The act also requires the Federal Railroad Administration to establish a program for reviewing rail joint bar inspection data and improving identification of cracks in rail joint bars. Additionally, FRA is directed to develop regulations for pressurized tank cars and recommend ways to reduce the risk of catastrophic fracture in older tank cars. The SAFETEA Act authorizes a new grant program for highway safety, the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), which replaces the existing roadway hazard elimination program. Under TEA-21, funds were allocated for hazard elimination projects such as installing barriers and guard rails. Additionally, the act authorizes $50 million for the elimination of rail-highway grade crossing hazards in high-speed rail corridors and directs the Federal Railroad Administration to improve crack identification in rail joint bars and develop regulations for pressurized tank cars. The HSIP Program, authorized under the SAFETEA Act, replaces the previous hazard elimination program. It is funded at $1.2 billion in FY2006, increasing to $1.3 billion by FY2009. Funding is apportioned based on lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and fatalities on federal-aid highways. There are set-asides for rail-highway grade crossing hazard elimination and high-risk rural road projects. The HSIP program, authorized under the SAFETEA Act, is funded at $1.2 billion in FY2006, increasing to $1.3 billion by FY2009. There are set-asides for rail-highway grade crossing hazard elimination and high-risk rural road projects. States must prepare a strategic highway safety plan and can use funds for other safety projects if needs are met. The act also establishes the Safe Routes to Schools program to fund infrastructure projects promoting children's safety within two miles of schools. Funding is based on student enrollment, with a minimum of $1 million for each state. At least 10% of funds are allocated for programs related to school safety. The Safe Routes to Schools program encourages children to walk or bike to school, with funding based on student enrollment. At least 10% of funds are allocated for non-infrastructure projects. The program is authorized at $54 million in FY2005, increasing to $183 million in FY2009. Additionally, the act creates a grant program to promote seat belt use and expands a grant program to reduce alcohol-impaired driving. Grants are available for states with primary seat belt laws or high seat belt use rates. The act authorizes a grant program to reduce alcohol-impaired driving, with funding of $125 million annually for FY2006-FY2009. States must meet certain criteria or implement specified programs to receive grants, including checkpoints, prosecution programs, increased blood alcohol testing, harsher penalties for high BAC levels, and effective rehabilitation strategies. The act authorizes a grant program to reduce alcohol-impaired driving, with funding of $125 million annually for FY2006-FY2009. States must meet certain criteria or implement specified programs to receive grants, including checkpoints, prosecution programs, increased blood alcohol testing, harsher penalties for high BAC levels, and effective rehabilitation strategies. Additionally, the program includes grants for effective alcohol rehabilitation, specialized courts for driving while impaired cases, prevention strategies for underage drinking, administrative license revocation, and returning fines collected for DUI to communities for prevention programs. The total authorization for the program is $555 million over the authorization period, with additional programs for motorcyclist safety and child restraint incentives. The act authorizes a grant program to fund safety training and education programs, as well as an incentive grant program for states that require children to be in appropriate child restraints. It also directs the DOT to establish standards to reduce vehicle rollover crashes and enhance passenger motor vehicle occupant protection. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are used to improve performance and safety in highway or transit projects by providing real-time information on traffic flow, incidents, events, crashes, and weather conditions. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) enable traffic management centers to receive real-time information on traffic flow, incidents, events, crashes, and weather conditions to improve performance and safety in highway or transit projects. Federal investment in ITS during TEA-21 totaled about $230 million per year, with $100 million for research and $120 million for deployment. SAFETEA provides $110 million annually for ITS research and the ITS deployment program ended after FY2005. The act focuses on advancing new technologies, improving standards, and developing a national ITS program plan. The curr_chunk discusses the federal role in advancing and testing new technologies in surface transportation systems to address challenges such as congestion, security, and infrastructure rehabilitation. Various agencies like FHWA, FTA, NHTSA, and RITA oversee research and development activities in transportation. The focus is on deploying improved technologies and processes to enhance safety and efficiency. The federal role in transportation research and development is primarily overseen by agencies like FHWA, FTA, NHTSA, and RITA. FHWA conducts an extensive program focusing on highway system advancements, with SAFETEA authorizing funds for research, education, and technology deployment. This includes funds for surface transportation research, training, education, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, and University Transportation Research Program. The goal is to advance technologies to improve highway systems. Title IX of SAFETEA authorizes research, development, and testing funds for transit and motor carrier activities, as well as other technological objectives. These funds are used to advance technologies for highway pavements, structures, roadway safety, and highway policies. State and industry experts emphasize the importance of FHWA's research and development funds for maximizing the effective use of federal aid funds. Additionally, Title IX addresses issues related to freight rail transportation, such as infrastructure capacity, rail-to-rail competition, and grade crossing conflicts. Congress is considering the capability of freight railroads to expand their infrastructure capacity to handle increasing trade volumes and alleviate congestion on highways. Congress is evaluating the need for federal assistance to help freight railroads expand their infrastructure capacity due to increasing trade volumes and highway congestion. There are concerns about the frequency of freight train traffic through towns and neighborhoods, leading to delays at grade crossings. The captive shipper question, regarding high rail rates and poor service, has been a recurring issue since rail industry deregulation in 1980. The captive shipper question, concerning high rail rates and poor service, has been a long-standing congressional issue since rail industry deregulation in 1980. Congress is addressing these concerns through legislation like SAFETEA, which includes funding mechanisms to improve rail track infrastructure. SAFETEA (section 9003) expands a federal loan and loan guarantee program authorized in TEA-21 for rehabilitating and improving rail track. The RRIF Program increases from $3.5 billion to $35 billion in total value of available loans, with $7 billion reserved for smaller railroads. Loan approval process is expedited, and loans can be issued for constructing rail connections between facilities and carriers. SAFETEA expands federal loan program for rail track improvements, including constructing rail connections between facilities and carriers. It also creates a grants program for relocating or separating rail tracks to improve community traffic flow. Funding is allocated for enhancing rail infrastructure capacity and eliminating grade crossings. SAFETEA provides funding for various rail projects, including improving rail connections, eliminating grade crossings, and conducting a comprehensive study of the nation's rail transportation system since deregulation in 1980. The federal share of project costs is capped at 90%, with specific allocations for projects of national and regional significance. SAFETEA creates a new grant program for improving freight mobility around U.S. ports and intermodal facilities, with designated projects in Oregon, Georgia, California, Alaska, and North Carolina. It also continues the Recreational Trails Program to develop and maintain recreational trails for various uses. The Recreational Trails Program (RTP) is a federal-aid program that helps states develop and maintain recreational trails for various uses, including hiking, biking, and off-road vehicle use. SAFETEA authorizes $370 million in funding for the RTP from FY2005-2009, with funds allocated to states based on a legislative formula. Under SAFETEA, the Recreational Trails Program (RTP) receives $840,000 annually for administrative expenses. Funds are allocated to states based on a formula: 50% equally among all eligible states and 50% in proportion to off-road recreational fuel use. States must allocate 30% of RTP funds for motorized trail uses, 30% for non-motorized trail uses, and 40% for diverse trail uses. SAFETEA eliminates the discretionary waiver for the 30% provisions but retains the small state exemption for states with less than 3.5 million acres. The program also includes a \"sliding scale\" provision for additional federal share in states with large federal lands. Additionally, SAFETEA encourages states to use youth conservation or service corps for construction and maintenance of recreational trails. SAFETEA changes federal share for RTP projects to a sliding scale, encourages states to use youth conservation corps, expands permissible uses for RTP funding, allows funding for trail condition assessment, and permits pre-approval planning costs to be credited toward non-federal share. Compliance documentation is required before applying for RTP funds. Before final design, property acquisition, or construction on a highway or transit project can proceed, DOT must comply with environmental review requirements, including those of NEPA. NEPA requires consideration of environmental impacts and preparation of an EIS for federally funded actions that significantly affect the human environment. Projects with unclear impacts require an EA, and if impacts are significant, an EIS must be prepared. Projects with no significant impact can proceed without an EIS. The NEPA process requires an EIS to be prepared for projects with significant impacts. Projects with no significant impact are processed as categorical exclusions. Compliance with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 is also required, which prohibits the use of certain resources for transportation projects unless there is no feasible alternative. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) included Environmental Streamlining provisions to address concerns about inefficiencies in the environmental review process for transportation projects. This involved developing a coordinated environmental review process for highway projects with significant environmental impacts. Improved interagency cooperation was identified as crucial for the success of environmental streamlining. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) mandated a coordinated environmental review process for highway projects with significant impacts. SAFETEA further streamlined this process, focusing on NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements to expedite compliance with environmental regulations. SAFETEA aims to expedite compliance with environmental requirements, particularly NEPA and Section 4(f), by introducing provisions like designating DOT as the lead agency, specifying roles of agencies, and allowing decision-making deadlines to be set. It also establishes a new entity called a \"participating agency\" in the NEPA process. The SAFETEA Act introduces changes to expedite compliance with environmental requirements, including the establishment of a participating agency in the NEPA process, setting deadlines for collaborative development of project statements, a 180-day statute of limitations on judicial claims, and authorization for states to determine project classifications and pilot programs for assuming federal responsibilities. The SAFETEA Act allows for the use of publicly owned parks, recreation areas, wildlife refuges, and historic sites if de minimis impacts are determined. It also requires the Department of Transportation to issue regulations clarifying factors for determining prudent and feasible alternatives under Section 4(f) requirements. The SAFETEA Act requires the Department of Transportation to issue regulations clarifying factors for determining prudent and feasible alternatives under Section 4(f) requirements. Additionally, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 directed the Secretary of DOT to establish a Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement program to reduce emissions from highway travel. The CMAQ Program aims to reduce emissions from highway travel to help states comply with air quality standards. It funds projects like transportation control measures, auto emission inspections, alternative fuel vehicles, traffic flow improvements, and pedestrian/bicycle facilities. Funding is based on population and pollution needs, with a minimum allocation for states without nonattainment areas. TEA-21 expanded the program's use for various projects. SAFETEA expanded the CMAQ program funding eligibility to include projects like advanced truck stop electrification systems, transportation systems management improvements, emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits. Total CMAQ funding for FY2005-FY2009 was $8.6 billion, compared to $8.1 billion under TEA-21. SAFETEA expanded CMAQ program funding eligibility to include advanced truck stop electrification systems, transportation systems management improvements, emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits. SAFETEA also directed DOT to evaluate CMAQ projects' impacts on air quality and congestion levels. As of May 2005, 124 areas with a total population of 159 million people were required to develop State Implementation Plans (SIPs) under the Clean Air Act to reach air quality standards. Federal agencies are prohibited from funding projects in these areas unless they conform to the SIPs, ensuring they do not worsen air quality or delay attainment of standards. Highway projects must demonstrate conformity with Transportation Improvement Programs (TIP) to address emissions from increased vehicle miles traveled. The Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) must demonstrate conformity with air quality standards to receive federal funds for highway and transit projects. The impact of conformity requirements is expected to increase due to emissions from SUVs and light trucks, court decisions tightening rules, and stricter air quality standards. Metropolitan areas may face a temporary suspension of funds unless emissions are reduced. The Clean Air Act requires metropolitan areas to reduce emissions to receive federal funds for transportation projects. Only a limited set of exempt projects can be funded in areas where conformity lapses, with no waivers allowed. The rules do not permit funding for new projects that could reduce emissions. The Clean Air Act mandates emission reductions in metropolitan areas to receive federal transportation funds. Exempt projects in nonattainment areas are limited to safety-related or existing facility repair. Concerns include restrictions on funding new emission-reducing projects and a need for better coordination between planning cycles. The GAO recommended extending the time frame between transportation plan updates, but this was met with opposition from environmental groups and air quality officials. P.L. 109-59 now requires less frequent conformity demonstrations and a shorter planning horizon for conformity. P.L. 109-59 mandates less frequent conformity demonstrations (every four years instead of every two) and shortens the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases. Consultation with the local air pollution control agency and public comments are required to shorten the planning horizon. The law also includes a 12-month grace period after a failure to demonstrate conformity before a lapse is declared."
