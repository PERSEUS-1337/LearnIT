    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nonprofit Athletic Organization Protection Act of 2004\". Congress finds that amateur sports and education-based athletics are important for youth development, academic achievement, and social skills. Nonprofit organizations play a key role in promoting the well-being of young athletes despite the inherent risks of injuries. Participation in sports leads to lower obesity levels, better health in adulthood, and fewer health issues as individuals age. Rules in amateur sports are essential for fair play. Participation in amateur sports leads to lower obesity levels and better health in adulthood. Rules makers face increasing lawsuits for negligence in developing rules for sports. The increasing number of lawsuits against rules makers for negligence in developing rules for amateur sports is unfair and detrimental to their ability to provide services. Defending these claims discourages top coaches, officials, and administrators from serving on rules committees. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include economic loss (pecuniary loss from harm), harm (physical, nonphysical, economic, and noneconomic losses), noneconomic loss (loss from pain, suffering, etc.), and nonprofit organization. The term \"nonprofit organization\" refers to organizations exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or not-for-profit organizations operated for public benefit. A \"nonprofit athletic organization\" is a nonprofit organization primarily involved in adopting rules for athletic competitions. A \"nonprofit athletic organization\" is a nonprofit organization involved in athletic competitions, including employees, agents, and volunteers acting within their duties. The term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia and other U.S. territories. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR NONPROFIT ATHLETIC ORGANIZATIONS. Liability protection for nonprofit athletic organizations is provided, except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence. Employees, agents, and volunteers of these organizations are not affected by this limitation on liability. Liability protection is provided for nonprofit athletic organizations, with exceptions for cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence. State laws imposing risk management procedures or making organizations liable for the acts of employees, agents, and volunteers are not inconsistent with this protection. The limitation of liability for nonprofit athletic organizations extends to employees, agents, and volunteers. State laws can still hold organizations liable for certain actions, such as civil rights violations, despite this protection. This Act preempts State laws inconsistent with it, except for laws providing extra liability protection for nonprofit athletic organizations' rule-making activities. The Act takes effect upon enactment and applies to claims for harm caused by such organizations filed after the effective date."
