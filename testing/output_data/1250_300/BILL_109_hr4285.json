    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Detection Canine Augmentation Act of 2005\". It includes findings related to the use of detection canines. The Congress finds that detection canines are crucial for homeland security, as they can quickly detect explosives, narcotics, and concealed humans in various areas. There is a shortage of detection canines available to assist law enforcement personnel, despite the authorization of new Border Patrol agents. The Congress has authorized 2,000 new Border Patrol agents annually for 5 years, but there is a lack of detection canines deployed with them. Canines are essential for security in airports and mass transit systems. They were effectively used during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and are regularly used by various agencies for security purposes. The Subcommittee on Management, Integration, and Oversight of the Committee on Homeland Security discussed the shortage of trained detection canines for homeland security activities during a hearing on September 28, 2005. Various federal agencies, a local transit police department, a private canine security company, and a university-based canine training center highlighted the need for more trained canines. SEC. 3. INCREASING THE NUMBER OF TRAINED DETECTION CANINES. The Secretary of Homeland Security will increase the number of trained detection canines in fiscal years 2007 through 2011. This includes a 25% increase in trained canine detection teams at ports of entry, airports, mass transit systems, Coast Guard stations, Secret Service operations, Federal Protective Service operations, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. SEC. 4. COORDINATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF CANINE TRAINING PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to coordinate canine training programs for various security missions, utilize existing resources efficiently, and explore partnerships to increase the number of trained detection canines available to law enforcement agencies. Additionally, a report on the Department's plan for coordinating and consolidating canine training must be submitted to relevant committees within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The Department of Homeland Security must submit a report to Congress within 120 days on its plan to coordinate and consolidate canine training programs, including increasing coordination with other federal agencies like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to prioritize increasing the use of domestically bred canines for counter-terrorism missions, including protecting ports of entry and the US border. They must also work with other federal agencies and the Office of Management and Budget to promote domestic breeding and consolidate canine procurement to reduce costs."
