    "content": "High levels of oil imports and high crude oil and gasoline prices in recent years have increased interest in the U.S. fuel supply. Congressional focus has been on alternatives to petroleum, improving transportation sector efficiency, and enhancing stability and security in the petroleum supply and refining sectors. Global oil prices and refinery constraints led to historic highs in U.S. gasoline pump prices from 2006 to 2008. Interest in alternative fuels and vehicles fluctuates with oil and gasoline price volatility. Statutory policies can help maintain interest during market fluctuations. Gasoline prices fluctuated from fall 2006 to 2012, peaking in spring 2011. Environmental concerns have increased interest in alternatives to petroleum. Federal policies aim to reduce petroleum consumption through promoting alternative fuels and efficient vehicles. Key tax incentives for biofuels and electric vehicles expired in 2011. Key tax incentives for biofuels and electric vehicles expired at the end of 2011, but some were extended through 2013. The mandate to use biofuels in transportation is set to increase yearly through 2022, with the RFS requiring the use of 15.2 billion gallons of ethanol and other biofuels in 2012. The RFS mandate for 2013 is 16.55 billion gallons, including a proposed 14 million gallons of cellulosic fuel. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandate for 2013 is 16.55 billion gallons, including 8.65 million gallons of cellulosic biofuels. Fraud cases in the biodiesel RINs market have led to criminal prosecutions. EPA approved blends of up to 15% ethanol in gasoline (E15) in 2011, removing a component of the \"blend wall.\" The EPA approved blends of up to 15% ethanol in gasoline (E15) for 2001 and later passenger cars and light trucks, removing a component of the \"blend wall\" limiting ethanol blending nationwide. Concerns over potential damage to engines and infrastructure have led to challenges in federal court, with bills introduced in Congress to limit EPA's authority. Interest in alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies has grown due to oil crises, environmental awareness, energy security concerns, increasing vehicle emissions, and high gasoline prices. In the 1970s, environmental concerns, energy security issues, vehicle emissions, and high gasoline prices led to a push for alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies in the United States. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 required federal agencies, state governments, and fuel providers to purchase alternative fuel vehicles. This law also established tax incentives for electric vehicles and alternative fuel/hybrid vehicles. Congress began working on comprehensive energy legislation in 2001 due to high fuel prices and other energy policy concerns. In the late 1990s, there was little congressional action on energy policy. Congress started working on comprehensive energy legislation in 2001 due to high fuel prices and other concerns. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 addressed topics like vehicle tax credits and renewable fuels. President Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to further discuss energy policy. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) expanded renewable fuel mandates, tightened fuel economy standards, and established the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program. Biofuels are promoted for energy security and environmental benefits, with Farm Bills in 2002 and 2008 supporting their development, including cellulosic fuels from woody materials. The 2008 Farm Bill expanded biofuels tax credits to promote cellulosic fuels from woody materials. The ARRA of 2009 included provisions for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles. Tax credits for biodiesel and renewable diesel production were extended through 2011. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended incentives for alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles through 2011. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further extended these incentives through 2013, including retroactive extensions for expired credits. Various credits were extended for biofuels, electric vehicles, and alternative fuel infrastructure, but the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit was not extended. The Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) for conventional ethanol was not extended, but various laws and acts have been put in place to promote alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles, including tax incentives and federal research on alternative fuels and infrastructure. Recent events, such as high fuel prices and concerns over energy security, have renewed interest in alternative fuels and advanced vehicles. Recent events have sparked a renewed interest in alternative fuels and advanced vehicles due to high pump prices for gasoline and diesel fuel. There is a growing focus on more efficient vehicles or those that do not rely on petroleum, especially with the increase in sales of light trucks that have lower fuel economy. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) mandates an increase in fuel economy to 35 mpg by 2020. Ongoing technological advancements in hybrid vehicles, ethanol fuel, fuel cells, and hydrogen fuel raise key policy questions regarding tax incentives and government involvement in the vehicle and fuel markets. The recent events have sparked interest in alternative fuels and advanced vehicles due to high pump prices for gasoline and diesel fuel. Key policy questions include establishing more generous tax incentives for hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, reducing government's role in vehicle and fuel markets, costs and environmental impacts of ethanol and hydrogen production, and focusing research funds on high-risk technologies like fuel cells or near-term technologies like hybrids. Gasoline price spikes and supply disruptions have raised congressional interest in alternatives to petroleum, driven by various factors such as hurricanes, high crude prices, refining capacity issues, and concerns about ethanol supply. Congressional interest in alternatives remains due to concerns over the environmental impact of petroleum and other fossil fuels. The high pump prices for gasoline and diesel fuel in the first half of 2011 sparked congressional interest in alternatives to petroleum. Key tax incentives for alternative fuels included credits for ethanol, biodiesel, and other alternative fuels, which expired by the end of 2011. The American Taxpayer Relief Act extended most of these incentives through 2013, except for the conventional ethanol tax credit. The American Taxpayer Relief Act extended key tax incentives for alternative fuels through the end of 2013, excluding the conventional ethanol tax credit. There is ongoing debate over the necessity of tax incentives for alternative fuels, with supporters arguing that they are needed to compete with conventional fuels due to market dominance and infrastructure, while opponents believe federal programs and mandates make incentives unnecessary. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established requirements for renewable fuel use by motor fuel suppliers. Fuel suppliers are increasingly providing renewable fuels to meet the mandate set by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Environmental Protection Agency finalized rules for the expanded Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) in 2010, requiring the use of 12.95 billion gallons of renewable fuels. The overall mandate for 2013 is 16.55 billion gallons, with controversy surrounding the greenhouse gas impacts of biofuels. EPA's methodology for assessing emissions has been criticized by biofuels supporters. The EPA finalized rules for the expanded Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) in 2010, requiring the use of renewable fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The methodology for assessing emissions was modified after criticism from biofuels supporters, but some opponents felt the final rules went too far. The RFS includes a mandate for cellulosic biofuels, starting at 100 million gallons in 2010 and increasing to 16 billion gallons by 2022. However, EPA set the mandate at 6.5 million gallons for 2010 due to low production capacity. The EPA set the cellulosic biofuel mandate at 6.5 million gallons for 2010, lower than the initial proposal of 100 million gallons. Due to project delays and capacity issues, the mandate was further reduced to 6.6 million gallons for 2011 and 8.65 million gallons for 2012. These lowered mandates faced legal challenges. The EPA established lower cellulosic biofuel mandates for 2011 and 2012, facing legal challenges. The 2013 proposed mandate is 14 million gallons. Ethanol concentration in gasoline was limited to 10% due to various factors. The EPA faces challenges with lower cellulosic biofuel mandates for 2011 and 2012. The 2013 proposed mandate is 14 million gallons. Ethanol concentration in gasoline is limited to 10%, but stakeholders are pushing for higher blends like E15 or E20. Growth Energy applied for a waiver to increase the maximum concentration to 15% (E15) in 2009, which was approved by the EPA in 2010. In 2009, Growth Energy applied for a waiver to increase ethanol concentration in gasoline to 15% (E15). EPA approved E15 for MY2007 and newer vehicles in 2010, expanding it to MY2001 and later vehicles in 2011. However, a waiver for older vehicles, motorcycles, heavy trucks, and non-road engines was denied due to emissions concerns. EPA requires proof that E15 will not harm emission control systems. The blend wall concerns the effects of higher ethanol concentrations on vehicle warranties, infrastructure, and emissions. Automakers and small engine manufacturers limit ethanol levels due to equipment damage concerns. Older vehicles may experience corrosion and higher emissions with higher ethanol concentrations. Fueling infrastructure may need modifications to accommodate ethanol blends higher than E10. The EPA waiver for E15 has implications for fueling infrastructure and labeling at gas pumps. Ethanol, mainly produced from corn, raises concerns due to its impact on animal feed and prime farmland. There are questions about fuel suppliers' willingness to sell E15 and how to prevent its use in older vehicles. EPA finalized pump labeling rules in June 2011. Biofuels in the United States are mainly produced from corn, which is also used for animal feed and human consumption. However, corn is resource-intensive and grown on prime farmland, leading to interest in biofuels from cellulosic materials like trees and grasses. These materials offer a potential strategy for reducing environmental impact and expanding biofuel production. While corn and sugars are easily fermented into alcohol, cellulose requires complex processing before fermentation. The future expansion of the U.S. biofuels industry is expected to focus on these alternative feedstocks. Cellulose must be broken down into sugars or starches through enzymatic or thermochemical processes before fermentation. Biomass can also be converted into synthesis gas for fuel production. However, processing cellulose into fuels is currently expensive, so research is focused on reducing costs. Questions remain about the feasibility and environmental impact of these fuels, as many proposed feedstocks have not been grown on a large scale. Research is also aimed at increasing the yield of biofuel crops, developing harvesting techniques, and minimizing environmental impact. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 supports the development of cellulosic biofuels through increased funding, grants, loans, and incentives. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and subsequent legislation provided funding, incentives, and mandates to promote the development of cellulosic biofuels, including grants, loans, and per-gallon incentives for domestic production. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 established a depreciation allowance for cellulosic ethanol plants, while the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded the renewable fuel mandate to include advanced biofuels with lower greenhouse gas emissions. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2022, with specific requirements for advanced biofuels like cellulosic biofuels and biomass-based diesel fuels. A tax credit of up to $1.01 per gallon is available for cellulosic biofuel production. Obligated parties must use Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to cover their obligations, with each RIN representing a gallon of renewable fuel and being valid for the year it was generated and the following year. Concerns have been raised about RIN generation and the RIN market. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2022, with specific requirements for advanced biofuels. Obligated parties use Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to cover their obligations, with each RIN representing a gallon of renewable fuel. Concerns have been raised about RIN generation and the market. EPA established the EPA Moderated Transaction System (EMTS) to address errors and fraud in RIN transactions. Buyers must certify RIN validity and are responsible for any fraudulent RINs they pass on. EPA issued Notices of Violations (NOVs) to companies for alleged fraudulent activities. In response to cases of fraudulent Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), the EPA is considering a system where RINs can be certified by third parties. The agency issued Notices of Violations to companies for generating fraudulent biodiesel RINs. EPA proposed a Quality Assurance Plan program to provide an \"affirmative defense\" for obligated parties if RINs are found to be fraudulent. Invalid RINs would need to be replaced with valid ones. EPA aims to finalize the rules by July 2013. The EPA is considering certifying RINs through third parties to address fraudulent cases. The price of renewable fuel RINs, mainly corn ethanol, saw a significant increase in early 2013, possibly due to concerns over the blend wall and market speculation. Corn growers and ethanol producers support the renewable fuel standard. Some stakeholders are concerned about a potential scarcity of RINs in 2013 or 2014, possibly due to market speculation. Corn growers and ethanol producers support the renewable fuel standard for its impact on corn and ethanol prices. Concerns have arisen about ethanol imports, with lower prices in countries like Brazil due to production costs and government incentives. The expiration of added duties on ethanol imports has made it easier for imports to enter the U.S. market. The added duty on fuel ethanol imports expired with the tax incentive, making it easier for imports to enter the U.S. market. Ethanol from Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries was granted duty-free status before the duty expired, allowing imports to avoid tariffs. With the renewable fuel standard in place and high U.S. gasoline and ethanol prices, there may be more interest in importing ethanol. Increased ethanol imports from Brazil may grow in the future due to the RFS requiring more advanced biofuels. The duty on fuel ethanol imports expired, making it easier for imports to enter the U.S. market. Increased ethanol imports from Brazil may grow in the future due to the Renewable Fuel Standard requiring more advanced biofuels. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 extended the duty on imported ethanol, but it has since expired. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established mandatory alternative fuel vehicle purchase requirements for federal and state vehicle fleets. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated that 75% of federal and state vehicle fleets' passenger vehicles must be capable of running on alternative fuels. However, the law did not require the actual use of alternative fuels, leading to criticism of its effectiveness. Many purchased vehicles are dual-fuel and primarily use gasoline due to its cost and availability. Despite the mandate, agencies have often failed to meet their obligations, leading to a lawsuit in 2002 by the Center for Biological Diversity. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated that federal and state vehicle fleets must have 75% of passenger vehicles capable of using alternative fuels. Despite the mandate, many agencies failed to meet their obligations, leading to a lawsuit in 2002. The court ruled that agencies must prepare reports on their compliance, and most have since met the requirement. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 modified the requirements for compliance, with dual-fuel vehicles now required to operate on alternative fuels unless granted a waiver. The Secretary of Energy is required to conduct a study on the effectiveness of these requirements. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 allows waivers for federal agencies on alternative fuel use requirements. The law also grants credits for hybrid, advanced diesel, and fuel cell vehicles. The Department of Energy can extend requirements to local and private fleets. President Bush signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, amending the definition of \"alternative fuel vehicle.\" The Energy Policy Act of 2005 allows waivers for federal agencies on alternative fuel use requirements and grants credits for hybrid, advanced diesel, and fuel cell vehicles. The Department of Energy has the authority to extend requirements to local and private fleets. President Bush signed Executive Order 13423 in 2007, which requires federal agencies to use commercially available plug-in hybrid vehicles. President Bush signed Executive Order 13423 in 2007, requiring federal agencies to purchase vehicles with high fuel economy, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles. President Obama's Executive Order 13514 in 2009 affirmed these goals and set government-wide fuel savings and greenhouse gas reduction targets. Tax incentives for alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles are seen as more effective than purchase mandates. EPAct 1992 and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 established tax incentives for electric, clean-fuel, hybrid, and advanced diesel vehicles, with credits worth up to $3,400 for hybrids and advanced diesels, and up to $4,000 for others. The government has expanded vehicle purchase incentives, offering tax credits for fuel cell, hybrid, alternative fuel, and advanced diesel vehicles. The credits range from $3,400 for hybrids and advanced diesels to $4,000 for alternative fuel vehicles. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 introduced a tax credit of up to $7,500 for plug-in vehicles, including pure electric and plug-in hybrids. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 modified the plug-in credits, eliminating credits for vehicles above 14,000 pounds and offering credits for two-wheeled, three-wheeled, and low-speed four-wheeled plug-in vehicles. The law established tax credits for plug-in vehicles up to $2,500 for two-wheeled, three-wheeled, and low-speed four-wheeled vehicles, and up to $4,000 for converting existing vehicles to run on battery power. Purchasers can claim these credits even if subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. Eligibility for the tax credit phases out after a manufacturer produces 200,000 eligible vehicles. Biodiesel and renewable diesel are synthetic fuels produced from vegetable oils and can be used in diesel engines with minimal modifications. Biodiesel, made from vegetable oils, can displace conventional diesel in engines with minimal modifications. It is of interest to farmers and environmentalists for its potential to promote rural economies, reduce waste, and limit greenhouse gas emissions. However, production costs are currently high, leading to calls for tax incentives and new technologies to reduce costs. Tax incentives, such as production tax credits and excise tax exemptions, are being considered to overcome barriers in biodiesel and renewable diesel production. High costs of organic oils used as raw materials are a major challenge, necessitating a significant decrease in soybean oil and other oil prices or the development of cheaper feedstocks. The American Jobs Creation Act provided tax credits for biodiesel sales, with extensions granted through the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Additionally, EPAct 2005 introduced credits for small agri-biodiesel producers and renewable diesel. Tax incentives for biodiesel and renewable diesel production were extended through various acts such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Tax Relief Act of 2010. Interest in hydrogen fuel and fuel cells has also increased in recent years as a way to reduce dependence on energy imports. Hydrogen fuel production is expensive, as are fuel cells, but they can drastically reduce vehicle emissions. The Bush Administration supported research and development for hydrogen and fuel cells through initiatives like the FreedomCAR initiative and the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative. In his January 2003 State of the Union address, President Bush announced the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative, which increased federal spending on hydrogen fuel and stationary fuel cell R&D. Congress appropriated a total of $1.4 billion for the initiatives, and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized $3.3 billion through FY2010 for fuel cell and hydrogen R&D. Opponents argued that funding should focus on near-term technologies like hybrid vehicles and tightening fuel economy standards for all vehicles. In response to the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative, Congress appropriated $1.4 billion for hydrogen fuel and stationary fuel cell R&D. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized $3.3 billion for fuel cell and hydrogen R&D through FY2010. Opponents suggested focusing on near-term technologies like hybrid vehicles and tightening fuel economy standards for all vehicles. Hybrids combine gasoline/diesel engines with electrical motor systems to improve efficiency and could help limit oil consumption without significant infrastructure changes. Some states exempt drivers of hybrid vehicles from HOV lane requirements due to their energy and environmental benefits. The 2005 surface transportation reauthorization act permits states to exempt high-efficiency vehicles from HOV restrictions. The 2005 surface transportation reauthorization act (P.L. 109-59) allows states to exempt high-efficiency vehicles from HOV restrictions. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 expanded incentives for hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The EISA established a program to provide federal loans for the production of fuel-efficient vehicles, with the ATVM Loan Program offering up to $25 billion in direct loans for automakers and parts suppliers. Critics question the effectiveness of the ATVM program in promoting technologies already incentivized by stricter fuel economy standards. The ATVM Loan Program offers federal loans for fuel-efficient vehicles, with critics questioning its effectiveness in promoting technologies already incentivized by stricter fuel economy standards. The Government Accountability Office has also raised concerns about DOE's technical expertise in assessing loan applications and project performance. The curr_chunk provides a list of organizations and websites related to alternative fuels and energy sources, including hydrogen, methanol, biodiesel, natural gas vehicles, propane, ethanol, and reports from the U.S. Department of Energy. The information is updated as of April 2013 and includes links to various resources. The curr_chunk lists resources related to alternative fuels and energy sources, including reports from the Department of Energy and the U.S. Government Accountability Office on energy policy and vehicle technology programs."
