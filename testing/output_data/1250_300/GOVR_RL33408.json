    "content": "The President's gravest decision is directing the use of nuclear weapons through Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) and the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS), which provide the infrastructure for planning, directing, and controlling nuclear weapon operations. The NCCS is essential for nuclear weapon operations, supporting the President's authority. Congress oversees DOD's plans for NCCS modernization. The NCCS structure, originating from the Cold War, may need revisiting due to decreased threat from Russia. The NCCS architecture, rooted in the Cold War era, may need to be reevaluated as the threat from Russia diminishes. Analysts suggest potential nuclear challenges from China, North Korea, or Iran could require a different structure for robust NC2. The addition of non-nuclear responses and active defenses could lead to complex requirements. Legacy systems and equities from other user agencies need to be reconciled with recommendations to retire Cold War platforms. Despite its strategic importance, the NCCS receives little attention outside the military establishment. The NCCS, often overlooked outside the military, includes the National Military Command System (NMCS) for command and control. The NMCS supports the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff, providing command nodes like the National Military Command Center (NMCC). The National Military Command System (NMCS) includes the National Military Command Center (NMCC) as the primary location for national command and control. The NMCC is staffed around-the-clock and monitors nuclear forces and ongoing military operations. The National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) serves as a survivable airborne backup to the NMCC, with a fleet of modified Boeing 747-200B aircraft based at Offutt AFB in Nebraska. The NAOCs are modified Boeing 747-200B aircraft based at Offutt AFB in Nebraska, with communications hardened against EMP. USSTRATCOM provides personnel and administration, while Air Combat Command manages resources. Site-R in Maryland can serve as an alternate NMCC location. The USSTRATCOM GOC at Offutt AFB serves as a backup for emergency actions and day-to-day management. The USSTRATCOM Commander oversees day-to-day operations and situational awareness. The facility is protected against EMP and has its own emergency power supply. The USSTRATCOM Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) serves as a survivable airborne backup with modified Boeing 707 aircraft. The ABNCPs carry a crew of 22, including aircrew, communications operators, and battlestaff personnel. The aircraft can communicate launch codes directly to ICBM launch facilities and serve as the Take Charge And. The E-6B aircraft serves multiple missions, including communicating launch codes to ICBM launch facilities and acting as a TACAMO relay for Navy ballistic missile submarines. It can deploy a trailing wire antenna for communication and uses various frequency systems. The USSTRATCOM Mobile Consolidated Command Center (MCCC) is a convoy of trucks that serves as a road-mobile backup during crises. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) ensures that only the President can direct the use of nuclear weapons. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) serves the President's requirements for strategic nuclear forces advice and decision-making. Key functions include situation monitoring for intelligence indicators and weather tracking, as well as tactical warning and attack assessment for detecting and analyzing potential attacks. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) includes situation monitoring for tracking weather and detecting potential attacks through Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (TW/AA). TW/AA centers use dual phenomenology to verify attacks using satellites and radars. Decision-making involves the President consulting with senior commanders and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) as the primary military advisor. Connectivity is crucial between the President, advisors, and nuclear commanders. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) serves as the primary military advisor to the President, who may also consult with other advisors. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) ensures connectivity between the President, advisors, and nuclear commanders for decision-making. Force Management involves data on the readiness of nuclear deterrent forces, while Force Direction includes nuclear surety and positive control measures. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) ensures connectivity between the President, advisors, and nuclear commanders for decision-making. It must be survivable, reliable, and support rapid connectivity during time critical events. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) must be survivable, reliable, and secure to ensure connectivity between decision makers and forces during critical events. Security measures are crucial to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the authenticity of communications, especially in the face of potential asymmetric threats like computer attacks. Nuclear command and control was emphasized in the DOD's 2001 Nuclear Posture Review, mandated by Congress in the FY2001 National Defense Appropriations Act. The DOD's 2001 Nuclear Posture Review, mandated by Congress, outlined the role of nuclear forces in US military strategy, policy requirements for a credible nuclear deterrence posture, nuclear delivery systems, weapons complex, and stockpile management. Assistant Secretary of Defense for International, J.D. Crouch, addressed these aspects on January 9, 2002. The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review outlined the role of nuclear forces in US military strategy and the need for changes in response to evolving threats, including the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Assistant Secretary Crouch emphasized the shift away from mutual assured destruction and the importance of a capabilities-based approach to address emerging threats. The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review emphasized the need for a \"capabilities based approach\" to address evolving threats, including the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It introduced a \"new triad\" of capabilities, including offensive forces, defensive technologies, and a responsive weapons infrastructure. The focus was on enhancing command, control, intelligence, and planning to improve precision in strike and defense operations. The Administration emphasizes command and control in the new triad of capabilities outlined in the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review. It aims to enhance precision in strike and defense operations, improve planning adaptability, and integrate nuclear and non-nuclear forces for quicker response and increased flexibility. USSTRATCOM has taken on additional missions following the NPR's publication. The Bush Administration and the Department of Defense have implemented the framework of the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review, with USSTRATCOM taking on additional missions such as global strike, space operations, missile defense, and combating weapons of mass destruction. General James Cartwright established a Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction in partnership with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. The NPR thinking is being incorporated into DOD's doctrinal guidance to military commanders. The Department of Defense has started integrating the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) thinking into its doctrinal guidance for military commanders. There were plans to update the \"Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations\" in 2005, focusing on deterring weapons of mass destruction and crisis action planning. However, reports suggest that the update may have been cancelled. The new joint doctrine was expected to emphasize rapid crisis action planning in response to WMD threats, aligning with the 2001 NPR. Crisis action planning involves time-sensitive development of joint operations plans in response to imminent crises. This requires rapid planning, integration with other military operations, and potential increases in computer workstation capability and communications capacity. Networked collaborative planning systems are becoming more common in military operations, with senior leaders expecting bandwidth-heavy video-teleconferencing links for long-distance deliberations. Senior leaders are increasingly relying on bandwidth-heavy video-teleconferencing links for long-distance deliberations and analysis. A 12-member commission was directed by Congress to review the implementation of the 2001 NPR, focusing on programmatic requirements and NC2 needs. The commission is expected to submit its report by June 30, 2007, potentially advancing the debate on NPR implementation. The NPR does not address the policy for the role and uses of nuclear weapons, but suggests precision non-nuclear options. The NPR commission is expected to advance the debate on nuclear weapons policy. It suggests using precision non-nuclear weapons to reduce the need for nuclear arsenals. The current command and control systems for nuclear weapons were established during the Cold War. During the Cold War, control systems like NORAD-Cheyenne Mountain Complex and USSTRATCOM were established to manage nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union. The question now arises if these systems are still relevant post-Cold War. New threats may require updates to the NC2 infrastructure, especially to address challenges like decapitation attacks targeting leadership. During the Cold War, concerns over decapitation attacks targeting national and military leadership shaped upgrades to nuclear command and control systems in the 1980s. The focus was on ensuring government control of nuclear weapons even during an attack. Today, the threat of such attacks from Russia is significantly reduced, with U.S. policy no longer viewing Russia as adversarial. This shift in relations is reflected in agreements like the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, signed in 2002 by Presidents Bush and Putin, aimed to reduce deployed nuclear weapons to 1,700-2,200 levels. Despite the diminished threat from Russia, questions arise on the necessity of maintaining a costly command and control architecture for nuclear exchanges. Analysts warn of potential challenges, including a nuclear threat from China, with their military expenditures possibly tripling by 2025. There is debate over a potential nuclear threat from China, with analysts suggesting their military expenditures could triple by 2025. China is acquiring more survivable systems like the mobile DF-31A ICBM and has ICBM systems that can target the United States. General Zhu Chenghu threatened to attack U.S. cities with nuclear weapons if the U.S. aids Taiwan against China. Some experts believe China is striving for preeminence in the Pacific Rim and East Asia, while others argue that the China threat is overstated. Kurt Campbell suggests that the relationship with China is not a clear confrontation like the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Some argue that the \"China threat\" is exaggerated, with suggestions that it is a search for a great power peer competitor. While some believe that a potential threat from China could justify the development of major weapons systems, others point to rogue states like Iran and North Korea as posing more immediate threats. North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Il, has actively pursued a nuclear weapons capability since the 1960s. A.Q. Khan, a Pakistani nuclear scientist, may have provided assistance to North Korea in their nuclear efforts. Estimates suggest North Korea may possess up to ten nuclear bombs and has developed various missile systems, including SCUD, NoDong, and TaepoDong missiles. The extent of their nuclear capabilities remains uncertain. North Korea is believed to have up to ten nuclear bombs and has developed various missile systems, including SCUD, NoDong, and TaepoDong missiles. It is unclear if they can attach a nuclear warhead to these missiles. Reliable information on North Korea's nuclear program is scarce, and there are doubts about their claims. The Iranian nuclear program is also a concern, with estimates suggesting they are about ten years away from having a nuclear weapon. Some predict Iran could acquire nuclear weapons sooner, with Israel suggesting within two years. Iran is roughly ten years away from having an atomic bomb capability, with some predicting they could have it sooner. Iran's nuclear activities at Natanz and other sites have raised suspicions, and they may be developing long-range delivery systems. There are concerns about Iran's military studying high explosives, essential for constructing a nuclear weapon. Iran's rhetoric regarding the destruction of Israel and the United States is increasingly strident. The Iranian military's study of high explosives, linked to their civilian nuclear program, raises concerns about their intentions. Small nuclear arsenals could pose a threat to U.S. infrastructure through an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack, causing widespread damage and failures in critical systems. The EMP Commission was chartered by Congress to assess the threat of an electromagnetic pulse attack on the US. Analysts suggest that China, North Korea, and Iran may use high altitude nuclear bursts to target critical infrastructure with EMP, potentially causing catastrophic failures. William Graham highlighted China's interest in EMP attacks, while recent missile tests by North Korea and Iran could indicate preparation for such a strategy. The purpose of North Korean and Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile programs may involve high altitude detonations for EMP attacks. Recent missile tests suggest preparation for such a strategy, potentially launching missiles from freighters off the U.S. coast. There is skepticism about the extent of the EMP threat, as some systems have protection against it. The motivation for China to use EMP against the U.S. is unclear. The EMP threat from North Korea and Iran may involve high altitude detonations for attacks. Some analysts doubt the feasibility of large area EMP effects from rogue states or terrorist groups. The EMP Commission found a decline in EMP hardening and procedures in the military since the 1990s. Congress has directed the reestablishment of the EMP Commission to assess military system vulnerabilities. The EMP threat from North Korea and Iran may involve high altitude detonations for attacks. Congress recently directed the reestablishment of the EMP Commission to assess military system vulnerabilities and deliver a report by June 30, 2007. The current command and control system may need improvements to integrate nuclear and non-nuclear offensive forces, as well as defensive forces, to address new challenges. The current command and control system may need improvements to integrate nuclear and non-nuclear offensive forces, as well as defensive forces, to address new challenges. This could drive a demand for additional capacity and speed in key conferences, especially for directing release of non-nuclear strikes. The inclusion of additional choices like information operations and electronic warfare raises questions about \"release authority.\" The President's involvement in directing military operations, including non-nuclear or non-kinetic options, raises questions about \"release authority.\" While historically Presidents have not been involved in planning specific conventional missions, strategic importance or criticality of targets may warrant personal Presidential involvement. The targets that USSTRATCOM may respond to could have strategic importance requiring Presidential involvement. Difficulties may arise in enforcing Presidential authorization for releasing strikes, especially when conventional and nuclear weapons are mixed on the same platform. Non-kinetic strikes like cyber-attacks may pose even greater challenges. Non-kinetic strikes, such as cyber-attacks, could have strategic effects like shutting down a nation's power grid, raising concerns that they could be as impactful as WMD strikes. This raises questions about the level of Presidential control needed and the complexity of adding non-nuclear responses to the command and control process. The merging of active defenses, particularly missile defenses, into the NC2 architecture will require adaptation in decision-making processes to prevent delays in responding to critical targets. Delegating missile defense release authority may be necessary to avoid missing opportunities to stop incoming missiles within the defense system's operational \"envelope.\" Presidential involvement in such decisions may be crucial, but time constraints could necessitate delegation of authority. Some analysts suggest delegating missile defense release authority to the unified combatant commander to prevent delays in responding to incoming missiles. Presidential consideration may be needed to choose between defensive launches and offensive strikes, with choreographed conversations required to make decisions within limited time frames. Defensive responses may impact offensive options, while the inclusion of non-nuclear offensive strikes and defensive considerations will add participants to the decision-making process after detecting a potential attack. The decision-making process for missile defense and non-nuclear offensive responses involves considering defensive responses after detecting a potential attack. Regional combatant commanders will have responsibility for defense in their area, with USSTRATCOM leading missile defense efforts linked to regional command systems. General Cartwright has directed personnel to ensure interoperable command and control systems. Adding participants to decision conferences will strain network bandwidth. The command and control systems for missile defense and non-nuclear offensive responses must be interoperable with common technical standards and protocols. The system should present choices to the President in a clear and understandable manner, facilitating smooth interaction with advisers and aiding quick decision-making without overwhelming the Commander-in-Chief. It is crucial to maintain tight Presidential control over nuclear weapons and ensure clear and actionable orders reach weapons operators. The nuclear command and control systems support civilian and military leadership in nuclear operations and have the potential to serve multiple military and government functions. These systems can also aid in non-nuclear military forces direction and status monitoring, such as the National Military Command Center (NMCC) providing 24-hour monitoring of worldwide military operations and assisting in peacetime contingencies like natural disasters. The NMCC aids in managing peacetime contingencies like natural disasters and crises. A response cell or crisis action team may be formed from various agencies to prepare orders and monitor forces. Command and control assets also supported mitigation and recovery activities after the 9/11 attacks. These assets are crucial for continuity of operations during domestic contingencies or natural disasters. President Bush used USSTRATCOM in Omaha, Nebraska as a secure facility to receive updates and communicate during the 9/11 crisis. President Bush utilized USSTRATCOM in Omaha, Nebraska as a secure facility to receive updates and communicate during the 9/11 crisis. The press reported his use of command and control assets at U.S. Northern Command to monitor the government response to Hurricane Rita in 2005. Nuclear command and control assets can support civil authorities for consequence mitigation after disasters. FEMA and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have an agreement to make the National Airborne Operations Center available for FEMA support during disasters and emergencies. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) is valued for its versatile capabilities in situation monitoring, communications, and tele-conferencing. Senior government leadership, including Secretary Rumsfeld, relies on the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) for support during official travel and emergencies. However, using NC2 assets for non-nuclear missions may lead to competition for access during crises, potentially affecting response plans. Integrating these systems with other agencies, such as FEMA, creates additional stakeholders invested in their continued viability. The DOD chartered a committee in 2001 to review the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System, chaired by Brent Scowcroft. The changing nature of threats and recommendations from the Nuclear Posture Review raise questions about the requirements for today's systems. The use of NC2 assets for non-nuclear missions may impose costs on the military and strain operators, affecting readiness for primary missions. Manpower shortages exacerbate these challenges. The commission chaired by Brent Scowcroft reviewed the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System, focusing on survivability and maintenance issues. The report suggested transferring NC2 system life cycle management to operators for better maintenance and procedural discipline. The End-to-End Review advocated shifting NC2 system life cycle management to operators from the acquisition community. Operator requirements for new capabilities may not always align with acquisitions, leading to unrealistic or costly demands. Total costs of sustainment and operation are sometimes overlooked in the focus on technical capability. The debate continues on balancing operator needs with cost-effective acquisition programs. There is a concern about the decreasing number of individuals with NC2 expertise since the end of the Cold War, leading to a \"brain drain\" and lack of depth in key NC2 positions. This could hinder responses during crises. Additionally, the legacy NC2 architecture faces threats from potential adversaries. The legacy NC2 architecture may face challenges from the Defense Department's move towards military transformation, with USSTRATCOM establishing subordinate functional component commands for specific mission aspects. These multi-service organizations are geographically separated, promoting decentralization of activities away from USSTRATCOM headquarters towards a more collaborative and horizontal process. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review proposes significant changes in NC2 programs to facilitate USSTRATCOM's transition. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review recommends retiring legacy mobile platforms like the E-4B NAOC aircraft and replacing them with C-32 aircraft. The new distributed command and control capabilities must be survivable in the event of WMD, electronic, or cyber-warfare attacks. The systems are also proposed to be tailored for the mission of WMD elimination, requiring a robust communications infrastructure. The DOD proposes new distributed command and control capabilities tailored for WMD elimination, requiring a robust communications infrastructure. USSTRATCOM is studying an IP-based communications architecture, but concerns exist about its ability to ensure rapid message transmission for nuclear command and control. The growing need for communications bandwidth in the military, particularly for nuclear force direction messages, is a significant challenge. The DOD has seen a significant increase in communications capacity requirements, especially for satellite communications links. The nuclear community will need to compete for these links amidst a high operations tempo military. Coordination of new systems like missile defense into the NC2 network is crucial, along with determining certification and configuration management levels. Ensuring compatibility and defining the chain of command in a distributed architecture are key to avoiding chaos. Reconciliation of procedures and protocols is essential as more agencies access data. The procurement programs linked to nuclear command and control are also important. The DOD is seeking funds for procurement and research and development to upgrade the Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) in the nuclear command and control system. This includes modernization efforts such as high data rate terminals. The Defense Appropriations Act funded $49 million for R&D but no money for procurement. DOD is seeking $3.4 million for procurement and $64.1 million for R&D in the FY2007 budget. Modernization efforts for MEECN include upgrades for data terminals, secure computer terminals, satellite communications, and installation of new communication systems for bomber and tanker forces. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is reportedly personally involved in these efforts. The Defense Department is modernizing communications systems for bomber and tanker forces, including VLF and EHF communications through the Ground Element MEECN System (GEMS). Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is overseeing upgrades to the National Military Command System (NMCS) and directing the consolidation of separate command centers into two new centers in the Pentagon. These new centers will focus on tracking global crises and providing military advice to the President, while also being more secure against threats and intelligence gathering. This effort will coincide with ongoing Pentagon renovation work and free up space in the facility. The Defense Department is consolidating separate command centers into two new centers in the Pentagon to track global crises and provide military advice to the President. This effort aims to make the centers more secure against threats and intelligence gathering, coinciding with ongoing Pentagon renovation work. The Defense Department requested funding for planning and system engineering for this effort, as well as for developing a future missile warning and attack assessment system. Congress authorized the requested funding for FY2006 and provided support for the DOD's budget request. The Defense Department is requesting funds for enhancing its airborne nuclear command and control platforms, the E-4B NAOC and the E-6B ABNCP. Congress authorized the full amounts in the FY2006 National Defense Authorization Act and funded the DOD request in the FY2006 appropriations bill. For FY2007, DOD is asking for $50.9 million for further TW/AA research and development. DOD's FY2007 budget request includes $5.6 million for E-4B modifications procurement and $283 thousand for R&D. The requested improvements cover various aircraft systems such as audio distribution, office in the sky for senior leaders, LAN upgrades, radio link transition, navigation capability upgrades, and integration with Global Air Traffic systems. The proposed upgrades for the E-6B would cost $11.2 million for procurement and $31.4 million for RDT&E, including cockpit displays enhancements. The Navy requested modifications for the E-6 aircraft systems and mission systems, costing $11.2 million for procurement and $31.4 million for RDT&E in FY2006. Congress supported the request in the Defense Authorization Act. For FY2007, the Defense Department is seeking $99.2 million for E-6 modifications procurement and $37.4 million for research and development. The most controversial aspect of nuclear command and control modernization is the acquisition of Advanced EHF communications. The Navy requested modifications for the E-6 aircraft systems and mission systems, costing $11.2 million for procurement and $31.4 million for RDT&E in FY2006. Congress supported the request in the Defense Authorization Act. For FY2007, the Defense Department is seeking $99.2 million for E-6 modifications procurement and $37.4 million for research and development. The most controversial aspect of nuclear command and control modernization is the acquisition of Advanced EHF communications satellite, which will replace the aging MILSTAR constellation. Lockheed Martin and Northrop-Grumman are the contractors for the AEHF program. The Air Force requested $665.3 million in RDT&E and $529 million for procurement in the FY2006 budget, which was fully funded by Congress. In FY2006, Congress fully funded the Air Force budget request for AEHF, matching the DOD budget request. The DOD did not request procurement funds for FY2007 as three satellites were already purchased for the AEHF constellation. The Air Force is seeking $633 million for AEHF R&D in FY2007. AEHF has faced schedule delays and cost overruns, with technical shortfalls in communications encryption equipment causing delays. The program is now estimated to cost over $7 billion, with a 20% cost growth. AEHF is intended to bridge the gap between MILSTAR and newer systems. The AEHF program has faced substantial delays and cost overruns, now estimated to cost over $7 billion with a 20% cost growth. It is intended to bridge the gap between MILSTAR and the Transformational Satellite program. Congress considered acquiring additional AEHF satellites and modifying Wideband Gapfiller satellites in case of further delays in the TSAT program. The analysis of alternatives report explores acquiring more AEHF satellites and modifying Wideband Gapfiller satellites to address potential TSAT delays. Congress reduced funding for TSAT in FY2006 and directed focus on technology development. The nuclear command and control system faces challenges due to increased demands driven by the 2001 NPR and DOD policy. The system's Cold War architecture may compete for budget priority against more immediately relevant systems in today's threat environment. The NCCS faces challenges in today's threat environment, with debates on its value for missions beyond traditional DOD purview. Modernization initiatives are ongoing, but budget constraints may impact these efforts. USSTRATCOM's activation of functional component commands and recommendations in the 2006 QDR could signal a change in direction for the system. Congress may need to address the nature of the threat, with differing views on China's military capabilities. The 2006 QDR recommendations could signal a change in direction for the NCCS. Congress may need to address the nature of the threat, including debates on China's military capabilities and the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. strategy. The appropriate architecture for the NCCS is also a key consideration. The NCCS architecture may need revisions to incorporate new command and control requirements. A more dispersed approach, like the one proposed by USSTRATCOM, could be more suitable for the current threat environment. The level of investment in modernization or new procurement needs to be determined. NCCS modernization initiatives are projected to continue for years, with potential adjustments based on the 2001 NPR and 2006 QDR findings. The NCCS modernization and procurement initiatives are ongoing and may require adjustments based on the 2001 NPR and 2006 QDR findings. Questions arise regarding the adequacy and necessity of existing NCCS platforms, as well as the value of their secondary uses. Considerations for continued investment in platforms with potential for greater utility in homeland security and disaster response missions are raised."
