    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Personal Health Investment Today Act\" or the \"PHIT Act.\" Congress finds that almost 20 percent of American children aged 2 to 19 are overweight or obese, leading to increased healthcare costs. Investing in physical activity could significantly reduce medical expenses, and offering financial incentives could encourage more Americans to be active. The United States lags in preventing obesity-related deaths, highlighting the importance of promoting physical activity from a young age. The Act aims to promote health by encouraging healthier lifestyles, providing financial incentives for healthy behavior, and increasing access to physical fitness activities. It emphasizes the importance of preventing obesity-related diseases and deaths, especially in children, by instilling lifelong healthy habits early on. Certain amounts paid for physical activity, fitness, and exercise are treated as amounts paid for medical care. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include qualified sports and fitness expenses as amounts paid for medical care. This includes membership at a fitness facility, participation in physical exercise programs, and equipment for physical activity. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for qualified sports and fitness expenses, including equipment for physical exercise programs, with an overall dollar limitation of $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for joint filers or heads of households. A fitness facility is defined as a place that offers physical exercise programs and facilities for physical fitness, excluding private clubs. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for qualified sports and fitness expenses, including equipment for physical exercise programs, with a dollar limitation. A fitness facility must comply with State and Federal anti-discrimination laws and not offer certain recreational facilities. Videos, books, and similar materials providing instruction in physical exercise are also eligible expenses. Amounts paid for sports and fitness equipment must be used exclusively for physical activity programs, not apparel or footwear, and limited to $250 for sports equipment. Rules similar to section 213(d)(6) apply to programs with components other than physical exercise. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act, with a limit of $250 for sports equipment and rules similar to section 213(d)(6) for programs with components other than physical exercise."
