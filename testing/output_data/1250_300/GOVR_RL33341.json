Elevated petroleum prices impact the United States' trade balance and reduce disposable income. The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established in response to the 1973 Arab-Israeli War and the subsequent oil embargo. Strategic stocks cannot fully protect oil-consuming nations from market price fluctuations during supply emergencies. The United States saw a significant increase in imported crude oil prices from $4/barrel in late 1973 to $12.50/barrel in 1974. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established to mitigate the economic impacts of oil supply disruptions, such as the Arab oil embargo. The SPR was created to prevent a repeat of the economic dislocation caused by the embargo by introducing oil from the Reserve into the market during interruptions. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to prevent economic dislocation from oil supply disruptions. It was designed to calm markets, mitigate price spikes, and buy time for diplomacy. The SPR initially aimed for 500 million barrels, expanded to 750 million barrels in 1978, and is authorized for 1 billion barrels. Managed by the Department of Energy, it consists of five underground storage facilities in Texas and Louisiana. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized by Congress to raise the size to 1.5 billion barrels and is managed by the Department of Energy. The SPR comprises five underground storage facilities in Texas and Louisiana, created from salt domes. Oil stored in the SPR remains undisturbed unless sold or exchanged. The capacity reached 727 million barrels by 2005, with nearly 700 million barrels before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Some oil was loaned to refiners and sold after the storms. By the end of 2009, the SPR was virtually filled to its capacity at 726 million barrels. Oil from the SPR is sold competitively through a Notice of Sale. The Department of Energy manages the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) with a capacity of 726 million barrels of crude oil. Oil from the SPR is sold competitively through a Notice of Sale, with bids reviewed and awards offered. The SPR could be drawn down initially at a rate of roughly 4.4 mbd for up to 90 days. A Life Extension Program was initiated in 1993 to upgrade or replace all major systems to ensure readiness to 2025. The Life Extension Program, initiated in 1993, upgraded or replaced all major systems of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to ensure readiness to 2025. The International Energy Agency (IEA) was established in response to the Arab oil embargo to develop emergency response plans. Signatories to the IEA commit to maintaining emergency reserves representing 90 days of net imports and developing demand restraint programs. The United States has over 100 days' cushion of emergency reserves, but only about 20% of privately held stocks would be available in an emergency. At full capacity, the SPR could provide roughly 70 days of oil supply. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in the United States provides roughly 70 days of net import protection at full capacity. Less than 20% of privately held stocks would be available in an emergency, as most support product movement. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires the SPR to expand to 1 billion barrels for maintaining stocks equivalent to 90 days of net imports. Two-thirds of IEA stocks are held by the oil industry, while one-third is held by governments and supervisory agencies. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT) mandates the expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to 1 billion barrels for 90 days of net imports. Funding has been allocated for expansion activities, including evaluating a site in Richton, MS, and purchasing a cavern at Bayou Choctaw. Restrictions are in place to prevent SPR appropriations from supporting entities involved with Iran. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) allows the President to drawdown the Reserve in case of a severe energy emergency.

Funding has been allocated for expansion activities, including evaluating a site in Richton, MS, and purchasing a cavern at Bayou Choctaw. Restrictions are in place to prevent SPR appropriations from supporting entities involved with Iran. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) authorizes the President to drawdown the Reserve in case of a severe energy emergency, with additional drawdown authority enacted in 1990 after the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 made the SPR authorities permanent, allowing for a limited use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve without declaring a severe energy supply interruption. This authority permits the sale of up to 30 million barrels over 60 days to address significant energy shortages domestically or internationally. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 made the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) authorities permanent, allowing for a limited use of the SPR to prevent or reduce adverse impacts of energy shortages. This authority permits the sale of up to 30 million barrels over 60 days, with restrictions if the SPR level is below 500 million barrels. Legislation may alter these authorities, transferring drawdown authority from the President to the Secretary of Energy in the event of a severe energy market supply interruption. The proposed legislation, S. 1462, aims to amend the drawdown authority of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) by allowing drawdown and sale in the event of a severe energy market supply interruption that causes a significant increase in prices. This departure from existing authorities discourages the use of the SPR to address high prices directly. Additionally, the refined product reserves established by S. 1462 could be drawn down to mitigate the impacts of weather-related events or other acts of nature causing a severe energy market supply disruption. The broader authorities would also allow drawdown in the event of a severe energy market disruption that is likely to have a major adverse impact on the economy. The proposed legislation, S. 1462, aims to amend the drawdown authority of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) by allowing drawdown and sale in the event of a severe energy market disruption that causes a significant increase in prices. The use of the SPR historically required a physical shortage of supply, but the new legislation focuses on market disruptions that could have a major adverse impact on the economy. Price considerations were deliberately kept out of the authorities to avoid influencing private sector practices. The proposed legislation, S. 1462, aims to amend the drawdown authority of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) by allowing drawdown and sale in the event of a severe energy market disruption that causes a significant increase in prices. High prices were not due to shortages but reflected international supply concerns. Some policymakers suggested releasing crude from the SPR, but it would not have significantly affected prices. The legislation would require a report to Congress on acquiring refined products for the Reserve at minimal cost and disruption of markets. Storage options and potential locations of facilities would also be assessed. The report would assess the option of exchanging crude oil in the SPR for refined products to establish a refined product reserve. Arguments in favor include efficiency in market calming and addressing potential disruptions in refineries or oil pipelines. Arguments against include the prospect of supplemental gasoline supplies overwhelming U.S. port facilities. The possibility of establishing a refined product reserve is being considered, with arguments for efficiency in market calming and addressing disruptions in refineries or oil pipelines. However, concerns exist that supplemental gasoline supplies could overwhelm U.S. port facilities, especially in the wake of European responses to Hurricanes Rita and Katrina. Storage costs for refined products are higher than for crude, and maintaining product quality would require periodic replacement. Legislation enacted in 2008 prohibits the Department of Energy from initiating new activities related to this issue. The Bush Administration announced plans to purchase oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in January 2009, including replacing sold oil, returning borrowed oil, delivering deferred oil, and resuming fill at a volume of 26,000 barrels per day from May 2009 to January 2010. These activities aim to fill the SPR. The government announced plans to deliver 2.2 million barrels of deferred RIK oil and resume filling the SPR at a rate of 26,000 barrels per day from May 2009 to January 2010, aiming to reach the SPR's capacity of 727 million barrels by early 2010. This initiative follows the decision to replenish the SPR due to energy security concerns and to support domestic oil producers. The Secretary of Energy proposed using royalties from oil leases in the Gulf of Mexico to purchase oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), but the plan was initially rejected. However, a plan to proceed with this arrangement was announced in February 1999, despite opposition from the Department of the Interior. This alternative method of acquiring oil for the SPR was supported by producers who believed the current valuation system for oil was flawed. The wellhead is complex and flawed. Acquiring oil for the SPR through RIK avoids direct outlays by Congress but results in a loss of revenues as royalties are settled in wet barrels instead of cash. President Bush ordered the fill of the SPR to 700 million barrels in 2001, mainly through RIK. The RIK plan was initially seen as a positive step, but became controversial when crude prices rose sharply in 2002. Some argued that diverting RIK oil to the SPR was driving up prices, while others disagreed. Legislative attempts to suspend RIK fill began in 2004. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required the Secretary of Energy to develop procedures for filling the SPR, considering factors like revenue loss, price impact, and national security. DOE's final rule in 2006 outlined acquisition parameters, rejecting tying decisions to oil price differentials. RIK fill of the SPR resumed in 2007, following legislative attempts to suspend it in 2004. In 2008, Congress passed P.L. 110-232 as gasoline prices rose. DOE did not accept bids for 13 million barrels of RIK oil, causing forgone revenues of $4.6 billion. Opponents of RIK fill argued against government-owned strategic petroleum stocks. Opponents of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) argue that government-owned stocks are inappropriate and burden the public sector with expenses that could be borne by the private sector. Despite plans for expansion in Richton, MS, the priority for SPR expansion is unclear. The history of the SPR reflects debates over what constitutes a \"severe energy supply interruption.\" The SPR traces differences of opinion over defining a \"severe energy supply interruption.\" Recent legislation aims to allow drawdowns of the SPR and Northeast Heating Oil Reserve in response to price increases, reflecting shifts in oil market operations. The debate over when to initiate a drawdown of SPR oil reflected significant shifts in oil markets after the experiences of the 1970s and deregulation. The rise in oil prices from 2005-2008 renewed interest in the debate. The Reagan Administration's SPR Drawdown Plan in 1982 provided for price-competitive sale of SPR oil, rejecting the idea of conditioning distribution on a trigger or formula to encourage private sector initiatives. Many agreed that reliance on the marketplace during shortages would have been less disruptive than price and allocation regulations. Many analysts agreed that using the marketplace during shortages would have been less disruptive than regulations. The SPR was seen as a tool to moderate price effects during shortages, with early drawdown essential. The Reagan Administration changed its policy in 1984 to draw upon the SPR early during disruptions, easing congressional discontent. International coordination of stock drawdowns was also emphasized to prevent transfer of stocks between nations. In July 1984, the International Energy Agency agreed to an early drawdown of stocks in response to pressure from the United States. The debate resurfaced after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, with some calling for the use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to address potential oil shortages. The George H. W. Bush Administration decided not to draw down the SPR solely to lower prices in the absence of a physical shortage. Some argued that a perceived shortage could cause immediate damage, emphasizing the importance of managing oil supply disruptions effectively. During the Gulf War crisis in 1990, there was a debate on whether to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to address potential oil shortages. The George H. W. Bush Administration decided not to draw down the SPR to lower prices unless there was a physical shortage. However, some argued that a perceived shortage could cause immediate damage and that flooding the market with stockpiled oil could help calm markets. Eventually, in January 1991, after the first air strike against Iraq, President Bush authorized a drawdown of the SPR, leading to a significant drop in crude oil prices. During the Gulf War crisis in 1990, there was a debate on whether to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to address potential oil shortages. The George H. W. Bush Administration decided not to draw down the SPR to lower prices unless there was a physical shortage. However, in January 1991, after the first air strike against Iraq, President Bush authorized a drawdown of the SPR, leading to a significant drop in crude oil prices. Crude prices plummeted by nearly $10/barrel in the next day's trading, falling below $20/bbl for the first time since the original invasion. The price drop was attributed to optimistic reports about the allied forces' crippling of Iraqi air power and the diminished likelihood, despite the outbreak of war, of further jeopardy to world oil supply. The IEA plan and the SPR drawdown did not appear to be needed to help settle markets, and there was some criticism of it. Nonetheless, more than 30 million barrels of SPR oil was put out to bid, but DOE accepted bids deemed reasonable for 17.3 million barrels. The oil was sold and delivered in early 1991. The Persian Gulf War was an important learning experience about ways in which the SPR might be deployed to maximize its usefulness in decontrolled markets. Legislation enacted by the 101st Congress, P.L. 101-383, liberalized drawdown authority for the SPR to allow for its use to prevent minor or regional shortages from escalating into larger ones. In the 102nd Congress, omnibus energy legislation broadened the drawdown authority for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to include instances where a reduction in supply could cause a major adverse impact on the national economy. Exchanges of oil for acquiring additional oil for the SPR were permitted, with seven exchanges occurring between 1996 and 2005. The Clinton Administration proposed selling 7 million barrels from the SPR in its FY1996 budget to help finance the program. The Clinton Administration proposed selling 7 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in its FY1996 budget to help finance the program. This led to three sales of SPR oil during FY1996, totaling 28.1 million barrels and raising $544.7 million in revenue. The SPR was filled with RIK oil to replace the volume sold. Prior to Hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, and Rita in 2005, growth in oil demand had begun to strain U.S. refinery capacity. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was filled with RIK oil to replace the volume sold during FY1996. Growth in oil demand strained U.S. refinery capacity before Hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, and Rita in 2005. This led to a shift in the correlation between crude oil and refined product prices, with product prices no longer solely driven by changes in crude prices. The increase in gasoline and petroleum product prices post-hurricanes was due to shortages in product supplies and refining capacity, not crude oil shortages. The rise in crude prices to over $140/barrel by the summer of 2008 was due to various factors, including increasing international demand and concerns about potential production shortages. Market conditions were described as \"tight,\" with limited spare production capacity. Refinery outages and weekly reports of U.S. crude and petroleum stocks also influenced price spikes. Some argued that the high prices were not supported by market conditions. During 2007-2008, oil prices continued to increase despite market conditions not supporting the high prices. Legislation in the Senate proposed a price basis for releasing oil from the SPR, but it was uncertain if this would lower prices. By mid-July 2008, U.S. gasoline prices exceeded $4.00/gallon and diesel fuel averaged $4.75/gallon, demonstrating why an SPR release may not necessarily lead to a decline in petroleum prices. In mid-July 2008, U.S. gasoline prices surpassed $4.00/gallon and diesel fuel averaged $4.75/gallon. Despite high prices, oil prices had risen without a clear disruption or shortage. Factors driving the price escalation included limited oil production capacity globally, inelastic demand for oil products, international tensions, the value of the U.S. dollar, and the potential impact of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Calls for an SPR drawdown were made before Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, but legislation requiring a 10% drawdown of SPR oil failed on July 24, 2008. Legislation to require a 10% drawdown of SPR oil failed in July 2008. The proposal included selling 70 million barrels of light grade petroleum from the SPR within six months, with 20 million barrels to be offered for sale in the first 60 days. The oil sold would be replaced with \"sour\" crude within five years. This was partly based on a Government Accountability Office analysis noting the need for a more compatible oil grade mix in the SPR. The Government Accountability Office analysis highlighted the need for a more compatible oil grade mix in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Refiners face penalties in gasoline and diesel production when running lighter crude in units designed for heavy crudes. The impact of a 70 million barrel draw on SPR on prices is uncertain. SPR oil is only sold at fair prices to the U.S. government, and there may be limited interest from oil companies unless they have spare refining capacity or want to build crude oil stocks. The announcement of tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) may not lower oil prices if bids are not fair to the U.S. government. It is uncertain how an SPR drawdown would affect oil prices in 2008 due to various factors. A unilateral drawdown of U.S. stocks may have less impact than an international drawdown like after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Producing nations could reduce production to offset any SPR oil delivered into the market. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is seen as a defensive tool against high oil prices, but its impact on prices may diminish if not used effectively. In 1999-2000, low middle distillate stocks led to a doubling of home heating oil prices, prompting interest in establishing a regional reserve. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) allows for regional reserves under the broader SPR. Congress and the Clinton Administration supported this initiative. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) authorized the establishment of a regional reserve of home heating oil in the Northeast. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) was funded with $8 million in the FY2001 Interior Appropriations Act. It was filled by October 2000 and is meant to provide approximately 10 days of home heating oil demand in the Northeast. Controversy arose over the reserve's potential impact on private sector inventories and its conditions for drawdown during supply shortages. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) was established to provide a regional reserve of home heating oil in the Northeast. The conditions for drawdown included a significant supply shortage or a 60% price differential between crude oil and home heating oil. In December 2000, the 60% differential was breached due to a decline in crude prices, not a rise in home heating oil prices. This raised concerns about the reserve's impact on private sector inventories. The NHOR was established to provide a regional reserve of home heating oil in the Northeast. In December 2000, a 60% price differential between crude oil and home heating oil was breached due to a decline in crude prices. Despite calls for NHOR use during a cold winter, the price of heating oil fell short of meeting drawdown guidelines. Congress requested DOE to advise on NHOR usage circumstances. The NHOR was established to provide a regional reserve of home heating oil in the Northeast. Committees directed DOE to advise Congress on the circumstances for NHOR use. The price threshold for NHOR drawdown will increase as home heating oil prices rise. S. 283 introduced in 2009 would allow drawdown based on price and supply, releasing 20% of heating oil if the average price exceeds $4.00 per gallon on November 1."
