    "content": "The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 9858 et seq.) is amended by this Act. The purpose and findings of the Act are outlined in Section 2. Congress finds that two-thirds of mothers with children under 6 are in the workforce, over 10 percent of young children have disabilities, and there is a limited supply of infant care and care for special needs children, especially in low-income communities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act mandates early intervention and special education preschool services for children with disabilities. The purpose of this Act is to increase the supply of quality child care for children with disabilities, as there is limited care available for children in low-income communities and those with special health care needs. Staff often lack training to meet the needs of children with disabilities, leading to their exclusion from many child care programs. SEC. 3. APPLICATION AND PLAN.\n\nAmends Section 658E(c) to include families with children with disabilities.\n\nSEC. 4. ACTIVITIES TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CHILD CARE. Section 658G (42 U.S.C. 9858e) is amended to require states to use at least 5 percent of funds for activities to improve child care for children with disabilities, including training and technical assistance. States are required to allocate 5 percent of funds to improve child care for children with disabilities. This includes training and technical assistance for child care providers, licensing agencies, and parents on implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Assistance is also provided to family home and center child care providers to include children with disabilities in child care settings. Training and assistance are provided to child care directors and staff on using assistive technology for children with special needs and disabilities. Leadership skills are developed for directors to operate inclusive child care programs, including financial and program development, parent education, and community development. State and local child care resource agencies are supported in complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Grants are provided for recruitment and retention of qualified child care staff, including scholarships for obtaining degrees or training in child development, salary increases for staff with higher education, and grants to retain qualified providers in the field. The Secretary shall make grants and low-interest loans to public agencies and nonprofit organizations for projects that increase the availability of inclusive child care programs, child care for infants, and child care during evenings and weekends. SEC. 5. REPORTS.\n\nSection 658K(a)(1)(B)(iii) (42 U.S.C. 9858i(a)(1)(B)(iii)) is amended to include \"disability status\" in addition to age.\n\nSEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\nSection 658P (42 U.S.C. 9858n) is amended to define \"child with a disability\" and \"inclusive child care program\" in relation to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act."
