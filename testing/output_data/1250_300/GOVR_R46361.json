    "content": "The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-93) overview tracks its legislative history, budgetary context, and treatment of major components of the Trump Administration's budget request. The Trump Administration requested $750.0 billion for national defense activities, with $718.3 billion allocated to the Department of Defense. The bill also includes funding for defense-related activities of the Energy Department and other agencies. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act, enacted as Division A of H.R. 1158, provides a total of $687.8 billion for DOD, which is $2.86 billion less than President Trump requested for FY 2020. This bill does not include funding for military construction and family housing, which is provided by a separate appropriations bill. Additionally, $7.8 billion in accrual payments for the TRICARE for Life program is not included in the defense bill. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act, enacted as Division A of H.R. 1158, provides $687.8 billion for DOD, $2.86 billion less than President Trump's request. DOD organizes its budget requests to designate funding for activities related to post-9/11 attacks or distinct from regular costs. Non-base budget funds are designated for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) since 2009. OCO funds are exempt from spending caps set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The defense spending cap for FY2020 was $576.2 billion, with additional funds allocated for emergency requirements like storm damage remediation. The FY2020 defense appropriations bill, enacted as Division A of H.R. 1158, provides $687.8 billion for DOD, $2.86 billion less than President Trump's request. The defense spending cap for FY2020 was raised to $666.5 billion with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019. The House passed H.R. 2740 on June 19, 2019, incorporating the defense appropriations bill.

The Senate committee reported its version of the bill (S. 2474) on September 12, 2019, but no action was taken. A compromise version was agreed upon by House and Senate negotiators and incorporated into H.R. 1158, which was passed by both chambers. The President's FY2020 budget request for DOD reflects a shift in strategic emphasis towards countering threats from China and Russia. The U.S. national security policy is shifting towards countering evolving threats from China and Russia, marking a change from the focus on terrorism and regional aggressors in recent decades. This renewed emphasis on competition between nuclear-armed powers reflects a return to the Cold War era strategy. The U.S. national security agenda is now focused on countering evolving threats from China and Russia, highlighting the competition between great powers and the challenges posed by fragile states, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation. The U.S. national security strategy is shifting towards great power competition with China and Russia, while also addressing challenges such as fragile states, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation. Adversaries are collaborating and blurring the lines between conventional and irregular conflict, making it more difficult to prioritize and manage these threats. The National Security Strategy (NSS) and the National Defense Strategy (NDS) focus on great power competition with China and Russia, emphasizing the need to bolster U.S. forces' competitive advantage. The NDS highlights the erosion of this advantage and the increased contestation of military objectives. The Trump Administration's strategy aligns with past administrations in identifying China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and global terrorist groups as significant threats. The National Defense Strategy (NDS) identifies five significant external threats to U.S. interests: China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and global terrorist groups. The NDS prioritizes maintaining a strategic competitive edge over China and Russia, known as the \"2+3\" strategy. Federal spending has increased significantly over the past four decades, with mandatory spending for entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid growing rapidly. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established annual limits to reduce federal discretionary spending by $1.0 trillion through FY2021. Sequestration enforces automatic cancellation of appropriations to meet the spending caps, with exceptions for emergency or OCO funding. Congress has raised the caps through legislation, but defense-related spending is subject to the caps. The Administration's FY2020 budget request adhered to the defense spending cap, but included $165 billion in OCO funding, with $98 billion intended for base budget purposes. The House and Senate Committees considered all funding for base budget purposes. P.L. 116-93 funded a modest increase in active-duty military personnel but included a reduction of 7,500 in the Army's end-strength. P.L. 116-93 funds a modest increase in active-duty military personnel across all four armed forces, with a reduction of 7,500 in the Army's end-strength. It also includes a 3.1% increase in military basic pay effective January 1, 2020, and allocates funds for the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office and the Special Victims' Counsel program. Additionally, it provides funding for a pilot program for the treatment of military personnel. The Special Victims' Counsel (SVC) program received $3.0 million in funding for legal counsel in the military justice system for sexual assault victims. Additionally, a pilot program for treating military personnel with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder related to sexual trauma was funded with $3.0 million. P.L. 116-93 added $110 million to the DOD's childcare program, supporting the largest employer-sponsored childcare program in the U.S. with plans for capacity expansion and construction requirements. The report on DOD's childcare system includes plans to increase capacity and a prioritized list of the top 50 childcare center construction requirements. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget prioritizes modernization of nuclear and long-range strike weapons, including hypersonic missiles with conventional warheads. DOD has been funding hypersonic weapons development since the early 2000s. The DOD has been funding hypersonic weapons development since the early 2000s, but the focus has increased due to reports of China and Russia developing similar weapons. The FY2019 and FY2020 budgets prioritize hypersonic programs, with Congress providing additional funding for defense against hypersonic missiles and creating a Joint Hypersonics Transition Office. These weapons are challenging to detect and intercept due to their speed, maneuverability, and low altitude flight. The FY2020 defense bill added $100 million for a Joint Hypersonics Transition Office to coordinate hypersonic R&D programs. Concerns were raised about duplication of effort and increased costs in hypersonic weapons development. The bill supported strengthening defenses against ballistic missile attacks, reflecting the Administration's proposals. Changes were made to the missile defense budget to defend against ICBMs, following DOD's cancellation of an effort to develop an improved warhead. The FY2020 defense bill allocated funds for developing an improved interceptor missile to replace the Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) following the cancellation of the Replacement Kill Vehicle (RKV) program. It also provided funding for additional GBI missiles, support equipment, and research to enhance GBI reliability. Additionally, the bill supported the Administration's funding requests for military space satellites and satellite launches, including $40 million for the newly created Space Force. Congress approved $40.0 million of the $72.4 million requested for the Space Force's operation, authorized by P.L. 116-92. The Explanatory Statement criticized DOD for insufficient justification in their budget request, resulting in a 44% reduction in funding. The Secretary of the Air Force was directed to provide a monthly spending plan for Space Force O&M funding. The bill supported upgrades to the Army's ground-combat vehicles, including a 30% increase in funding to enhance the firepower of the Stryker troop-carrier with a 30 mm cannon. This decision reflects mixed congressional support for the Army's strategy in developing new combat capabilities. The Army's strategy for developing new combat capabilities received mixed congressional support. The service plans to fund new programs by cutting funds from planned upgrades to legacy systems, such as Bradley fighting vehicles and CH-47 Chinook helicopters. The enacted bill provided less than requested for Bradley upgrades but nearly tripled the amount for the Chinook upgrade. The enacted appropriations bill provided $46.2 million for the Chinook upgrade, triple the amount requested. It also allocated $205.6 million for the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle program, challenging the Army's plan to forego upgrades to the existing CH-47 fleet. The Army's Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle program faced criticism for being too ambitious under streamlined acquisition processes. However, after P.L. 116-93 was enacted, the Army canceled the OMFV contracting plan and restarted with new design parameters. The budget request for major aviation programs of all four armed forces was generally supported by P.L. 116-93, but disagreements may arise over the planned upgrade of the CH-47 Chinook helicopter. The Army had initially projected a $46.4 million FY2020 request for procurement of improved \"Block II\" CH-47s, but the amended request was reduced to $18.2 million. The Army's FY2020 budget request for the CH-47 Chinook helicopter program was initially $46.4 million but was reduced to $18.2 million. The enacted defense bill provided $46.2 million for the program. Additionally, $985.5 million was allocated for eight F-15s to address the Air Force's fighter strength gap, with funds shifted for testing purposes. The Secretary of the Air Force was directed to review options for reducing the Air Force's fighter shortfall. The Secretary of the Air Force was directed to review options for reducing the Air Force's fighter shortfall and provide a report to the House and Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees. The Navy's shipbuilding budget request in P.L. 116-93 supports increasing the fleet size to 355 ships, including funds for unmanned surface and subsurface ships. The act also reallocated funds for Virginia-class submarines to incorporate the Virginia Payload Module. The Navy's shipbuilding budget request in P.L. 116-93 reallocates funds for Virginia-class submarines to incorporate the Virginia Payload Module, adding $1.4 billion for the two funded ships. Additionally, $1.2 billion is provided for specialized ships and a landing craft to support amphibious landings by Marine Corps units.
