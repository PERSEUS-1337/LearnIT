States have started setting their own standards, such as Massachusetts at 2 ppb and California at 6 ppb. Perchlorate contamination is linked to DOD activities and has been found near military facilities and disposal sites. Perchlorate contamination, linked to DOD activities, has been found near military facilities, disposal sites, and manufacturing facilities. It is also naturally occurring in some areas and can be a byproduct of certain products. Detected in drinking water primarily in the Southwest and scattered locations nationwide, it is most often found in groundwater, including large aquifers in California. EPA required monitoring for perchlorate in public water systems in 1999 to determine its presence and levels nationwide. Perchlorate contamination has been detected in public water supplies nationwide, with 4.1% of systems testing positive for levels greater than 4 \u00b5g/L. In California, 58 systems had detectable levels, and 14 systems exceeded the EPA's remediation goal. Overall, 1.9% of samples collected showed perchlorate detections at 4 \u00b5g/L or higher, with an average concentration of 9.85 \u00b5g/L. California has implemented more extensive monitoring, detecting perchlorate in 241 sources of drinking water since 2002. Additionally, perchlorate contamination has been found at various federal and private sites. Perchlorate contamination has been detected in public water supplies nationwide, with 4.1% of systems testing positive for levels greater than 4 \u00b5g/L. In 2005, EPA reported perchlorate contamination at 65 DOD facilities, 7 other federal facilities, and 37 private sites. The Government Accountability Office found perchlorate at 395 sites through various sampling methods. FDA testing in 2004 and 2005 detected perchlorate in lettuce, milk, and other foods, with levels varying across samples. Perchlorate was detected in 50% of samples and 74% of foods tested by the FDA in 2005. Levels were higher in some foods like shrimp, tomatoes, spinach, and bacon. Children aged 2 years had the highest perchlorate intake, followed by infants and children aged 6-10 years. Perchlorate disrupts iodine uptake in the thyroid, affecting thyroid hormone production. This can lead to delayed development in fetuses and nursing infants. EPA considers non-water exposures when setting standards for contaminants like perchlorate. Iodine deficiency can lead to decreased thyroid hormone production, affecting metabolism and growth. Pregnant women with thyroid impairment may impact fetal development and learning capacity. Studies show perchlorate exposure can affect thyroid hormone levels in iodine-deficient women. EPA is evaluating perchlorate for potential regulation in drinking water due to its health effects. In the past decade, EPA has evaluated perchlorate for potential regulation in drinking water under the Safe Drinking Water Act. In 1998, perchlorate was listed as a candidate for regulation, but more research was needed. EPA required water systems to monitor perchlorate in 1999 to determine its presence in public water supplies. EPA required water systems to monitor perchlorate in 1999 to determine its presence in public water supplies. By January 2007, EPA had collected enough data to make a regulatory determination on perchlorate exposure levels. Draft reference doses for perchlorate exposure were issued in 1992 and 1995, with a range of 0.0001 to 0.0005 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day. EPA considers these doses when setting a drinking water standard, along with costs and monitoring capabilities. The EPA considered reference doses of 0.0001 to 0.0005 mg/kg body weight per day for perchlorate exposure when setting a drinking water standard. In 1999, an Interim Assessment Guidance recommended a drinking water equivalent level of 4-18 ppb for perchlorate-related assessment activities. A draft risk assessment in 2002 highlighted potential health risks of perchlorate exposure on the nervous system and thyroid tumors based on rat studies. The draft risk assessment in 2002 concluded that perchlorate exposures could impact human health by affecting the developing nervous system and causing thyroid tumors, based on rat studies showing adverse effects on fetal brain development. The document proposed a draft RfD of 0.00003 mg/kg per day, equivalent to a drinking water level of 1 ppb, sparking controversy over cleanup costs and scientific methodology. Various stakeholders, including DOD and water suppliers, expressed concerns about the stringent cleanups that could result from the proposed RfD. In response, a federal interagency perchlorate working group was formed in 2002 to address risk assessment, research, and regulatory issues. The interagency working group, consisting of various government agencies, requested the National Research Council (NRC) to review the science on perchlorate and EPA's draft assessment. The NRC committee found limitations in using rat studies to assess human health risks from perchlorate exposure and concluded that perchlorate is unlikely to cause thyroid tumors in humans. The NRC committee found limitations in using rat studies to assess human health risks from perchlorate exposure. They concluded that perchlorate exposure is unlikely to lead to thyroid tumors in humans due to multiple mechanisms to compensate for iodide deficiency and thyroid disorders in humans. The committee disagreed with EPA's risk assessment model and definition of adverse effects related to changes in thyroid hormone levels. The NRC recommended using inhibition of iodide uptake as the basis for risk assessment of perchlorate exposure, leading to an RfD of 0.0007 mg/kg per day to protect sensitive populations like fetuses of pregnant women. This recommendation was based on human studies and an uncertainty factor of 10 for intraspecies differences. The NRC recommended an RfD of 0.0007 mg/kg per day to protect sensitive populations like fetuses of pregnant women from perchlorate exposure. EPA adopted this recommendation in 2005, setting a drinking water equivalent level of 24.5 ppb to ensure no adverse effects on health. EPA based this level on the assumption that all exposure would come from drinking water. The EPA set a drinking water equivalent level of 24.5 ppb for perchlorate in 2005 to protect fetuses of pregnant women. The EPA's Superfund office later adopted this level as the preliminary remediation goal (PRG) for cleanup at Superfund sites. However, the Children's Health Protection Advisory Committee (CHPAC) raised concerns that the PRG did not adequately protect infants, who could be more exposed to perchlorate through breast milk. The CHPAC recommended lowering the PRG and developing a standard for perchlorate in drinking water. The committee recommended lowering the PRG for perchlorate in tap water to protect infants, as mothers exposed to 24.5 ppb could exceed safe levels. EPA decided not to regulate perchlorate due to low occurrence in water systems, but the Science Advisory Board argued for regulation based on toxicity and occurrence. EPA sought advice from the NRC in January 2009. EPA sought advice from the NRC in January 2009 regarding setting a drinking water standard for perchlorate. The agency replaced the preliminary remediation goal with an interim health advisory of 15 ppb, based on the NRC's recommendation to protect fetuses. However, concerns were raised about nursing infants being more exposed than fetuses. The EPA sought advice from the NRC in 2009 on setting a drinking water standard for perchlorate, considering exposures from food and water. Concerns were raised about nursing infants being more exposed than fetuses. EPA decided not to ask the NRC for further review, opting instead to reevaluate the science on perchlorate's health effects, particularly on infants and young children. The agency published a notice seeking public comment on ways to analyze data for the regulatory determination on perchlorate. EPA published a Supplemental Request for Comments notice in the Federal Register to gather public input on analyzing data for the regulatory determination on perchlorate. The agency is reevaluating perchlorate exposure to sensitive life stages, including infants and developing children, and considering a broader range of alternatives for interpreting available data. DOD has allocated significant resources to address perchlorate contamination, spending over $114 million on research activities for treatment technologies and detection methods. DOD has spent over $114 million on research activities for perchlorate treatment technologies, detection methods, toxicity studies, and cleanup. In 2006, EPA established a DWEL for perchlorate, and DOD adopted a policy setting 24 ppb as the level of concern for managing perchlorate releases. Cleanups are typically driven by drinking water standards or other established cleanup standards, with ambiguity in cleanup goals and responsibilities outside of California and Massachusetts where standards have been set. The DOD policy directs testing for perchlorate on installations and former military lands. If levels exceed 24 ppb, a risk assessment is required, and if adverse health effects are indicated, the site must be prioritized for management. EPA recommends using a 15 ppb health advisory level for cleanup. Legislation has been introduced in Congress regarding perchlorate regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. H.R. 3206 would require EPA to propose a drinking water regulation for perchlorate within 12 months of enactment, with funding allocated for remediation of perchlorate contamination. Additionally, bills like H.R. 2316 and H.R. 4252 focus on studying water resources in California, specifically the Rialto-Colton Basin. The House passed H.R. 4252 in March 2010, which focuses on studying water resources in California, including the Rialto-Colton Basin. Additionally, during the 110th Congress, several perchlorate bills were considered, but none were enacted. S. 24 was introduced to require community water systems to test for perchlorate and disclose its presence in annual consumer reports. S. 24 was introduced to require community water systems to test for perchlorate and disclose its presence in annual consumer reports. S. 150 and H.R. 1747 aimed to set a standard for perchlorate. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee reported on S. 24 and S. 150. H.Con.Res. 347 urged the CDC and FDA to educate the public on the importance of adequate iodine intake to protect against perchlorate exposure."
