    "content": "The Act titled \"Helping Responsible Homeowners Act\" allows for affordable refinancing of mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Act defines key terms such as Director, Enterprise, Qualified mortgage, and Refinancing mortgage. A refinancing mortgage is a mortgage used to pay off an existing qualified mortgage and any associated closing costs. The property subject to the mortgage must be the same as the one being refinanced, and the interest rate cannot exceed 40 basis points above the required net yield. The refinancing mortgage must bear a fair interest rate not exceeding 40 basis points above the required net yield for a prime conventional conforming fixed rate mortgage. The loan-to-value ratio is not limited, prepayment penalties must be waived, and the term to maturity should not exceed 40 years. The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation will carry out a program to refinance qualified mortgages on single-family housing. The program requires the purchase or guarantee of the refinancing mortgage used to refinance a qualified mortgage. Loan level price adjustments and post-settlement penalties related to default or delinquency must be waived. The mortgage must have a term to maturity of not more than 40 years. The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation will not charge upfront fees beyond the standard guarantee fee for refinancing qualified mortgages. Servicers or creditors refusing to resubordinate second liens preventing refinancing will have new mortgages ineligible for purchase. The requirement to refinance qualified mortgages under this program expires after a 1-year period. The Director may extend the program for refinancing qualified mortgages established under this section beyond the initial 1-year period. Regulations and guidance will be issued to carry out the program. The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation must ensure that mortgage servicers inform borrowers about the refinancing program. The Director will include updates on the program in the monthly Foreclosure Prevention & Refinance Report."
