It had a 10% tax rate and included eight tax preference items, with capital gains income being a significant one. The tax has been modified multiple times since 1969, with major changes in 1976 and 1978 creating the predecessor of the current alternative minimum tax (AMT). The alternative minimum tax was introduced as a new tax on a taxpayer's regular taxable income, including certain deductions and excluded capital gains income. Tax rates ranged from 10% to 25%, payable if it exceeded regular income tax liability. Congress repealed the add-on minimum tax in 1982, expanded the AMT base, and changed the rate to 20%. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 further modified the AMT by increasing the rate to 21%, changing the exemption amount, broadening the tax base, and introducing a phase-out for certain taxpayers. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 substantially changed the alternative minimum tax by increasing the tax rate to 21%, altering the exemption amount, broadening the tax base, and introducing a phase-out for certain taxpayers. The most significant change was the repeal of the exclusion for long-term capital gains income, reducing the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT. The 1986 Act repealed the exclusion for long-term capital gains income, taxing it fully under regular income tax instead of as a tax preference item under the AMT. This change reduced the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT. Subsequent acts increased the AMT tax rate and exemption amounts, and established a two-tiered tax rate structure for the AMT. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 aligned the maximum tax rate for capital gains income under the regular income tax with that under the AMT. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 aligned the maximum tax rate for capital gains income under the regular income tax with that under the AMT. Legislative changes in subsequent acts allowed nonrefundable personal tax credits to offset an individual's regular income tax in full for tax year 1998 only, regardless of the AMT. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999 extended the provision allowing individuals to offset their regular income tax by the full amount of their nonrefundable personal tax credits through December 31, 2001. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 aligned the maximum tax rate for capital gains income under the regular income tax with that under the AMT. Subsequent acts allowed nonrefundable personal tax credits to offset an individual's regular income tax in full for tax year 1998 only. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 expanded the provision to include the child tax credit, adoption tax credit, and IRA contribution tax credit. The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 extended the provision through December 31, 2003. The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 increased the basic AMT exemption amount. The Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA; P.L. 108-27) increased the basic AMT exemption amount for joint returns and unmarried taxpayers. The Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 (WFTRA; P.L. 108-311) extended the AMT exemption amounts through 2005 and allowed nonrefundable personal tax credits to offset both regular and AMT tax liability. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA; P.L. 108-357) made changes to the AMT, coordinating farmer and fisherman income averaging, repealing the 90-percent limitation on the AMT foreign tax credit, and allowing certain credits to be used against the AMT. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 made the credit for prior year minimum tax liability refundable, allowing taxpayers to claim an AMT refundable credit amount based on unused minimum credit from previous years. The refundable credit is reduced for taxpayers with higher adjusted gross incomes. The AMT refundable credit is reduced for taxpayers with higher adjusted gross incomes. The U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007 allowed tax credits to be used against both corporate and individual alternative minimum taxes. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2007 set AMT exemption levels and allowed nonrefundable personal credits to offset AMT liability. The Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act extended the AMT patch for the 2008 tax year. The Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act extended the AMT patch for the 2008 tax year by raising exemption amounts and allowing personal credits against AMT liability. Subsequent legislation in the 111th Congress continued to patch the AMT for the 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax years with increased exemption amounts for individuals and joint filers. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 permanently indexed the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) based on FY2012 exemption amounts. The exemption amounts for 2012 were $50,600 for single filers and $78,750 for joint filers, increasing to $51,900 and $80,800 for 2013. The AMT for individuals is calculated by adding back tax preference items to taxable income, subtracting the basic exemption, and applying a two-tiered tax rate structure of 26% and 28% to determine AMT tax liability. The AMT tax calculation involves subtracting the basic exemption from the tax base, applying a two-tiered tax rate of 26% and 28%, and paying the greater of regular income tax or AMT tax liability. Tax preference items, such as certain interest and depreciation deductions, are added to the AMT tax base. Differences in depreciation rates between AMT and regular income tax can increase or decrease the AMT tax base. The AMT tax credit can be carried forward to offset future regular income tax liabilities. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) involves adjustments to the tax base, including differences in depreciation rates and limitations on itemized deductions. Other adjustments include using the percentage of completion method for long-term contracts, capitalizing mining exploration costs, and including the excess of fair market value on incentive stock options. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) requires using specific accounting methods, capitalizing mining costs, and including excess stock option value in the tax base. The AMT exemption is subtracted from the tax liability, with exemptions varying for joint and single filers. The exemption is reduced as income exceeds certain thresholds, phasing out for higher income levels. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) exemption starts to phase out at certain income levels, with reductions of $0.25 for each additional dollar over the thresholds. The AMT tax rate schedule for 2013 is 26% on the first $179,500 of AMT taxable income and 28% on any additional income. The maximum tax rate for capital gains and dividends is 15%. Personal and business credits can reduce the AMT tax liability, which can also impact regular income tax liability. The AMT tax rate schedule for 2013 is 26% on the first $179,500 of AMT taxable income and 28% on any additional income. Personal and business credits can reduce the AMT tax liability, impacting regular income tax liability. Taxpayers can offset their AMT liability with nonrefundable personal tax credits, with certain credits still allowed against the AMT for 2012. The AMT tax credit is a multi-step operation designed to prevent tax deferrals from being taxed twice. Before ATRA, concerns were raised about the increase in taxpayers subject to AMT due to inflation and reductions in regular income tax. Over 30 million taxpayers would have been affected in 2012. Before ATRA, concerns were raised about the increase in taxpayers subject to AMT due to inflation and reductions in regular income tax. The lack of indexation for the AMT led to an increase in tax liabilities over time, narrowing the gap between regular income tax and AMT liabilities. With AMT indexation under ATRA, this issue is no longer a critical concern for Congress. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) indexation under ATRA has addressed concerns about the increase in taxpayers subject to AMT due to inflation. This ensures that the baseline tax revenue will be lower if the AMT is indexed. However, the role of the AMT may still be considered in future tax reforms. An economically ideal income tax system would eliminate the need for the AMT by accurately measuring a taxpayer's change in net worth without eroding the tax base. An economically ideal income tax system would accurately measure a taxpayer's change in net worth, eliminating the need for an alternative minimum tax. Efforts to reform the regular income tax by ending special tax preferences could lead to the elimination of the AMT. However, broadening the tax base of the regular income tax may still necessitate the existence of the AMT to ensure a minimum level of income tax for all taxpayers. Congress may need to modify both the AMT and the regular income tax to maintain social and economic incentives in the tax code. If Congress aims to maintain social and economic incentives in the tax code while limiting the number of taxpayers subject to the AMT, modifications to both the AMT and regular income tax are necessary. The coverage of the AMT was originally intended for high-income taxpayers, but changes in the tax code have allowed middle and upper-middle income taxpayers to benefit from special tax preferences, leading to significant deviations in income tax liabilities."
