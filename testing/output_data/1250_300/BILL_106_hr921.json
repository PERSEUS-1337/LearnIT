    "content": "The \"Swine Producers Market Loss Assistance Act of 1999\" includes sections on short title, table of contents, findings and purposes, definitions, market loss assistance, payment amounts, relationship to other payments, emergency requirements, livestock market reporting, and regulations. The marketing relationships between swine producers and meat packers have changed significantly, leading to lower prices for swine. The concentration of the meat packing industry and increased imports of live swine have reduced slaughter capacity and affected swine prices in the United States. A swine market price crisis in 1998 was caused by a 10 percent increase in swine available for slaughter and an eight percent decrease in packer slaughter capacity. In the fourth quarter of 1998, there was a 10 percent increase in swine available for slaughter and an eight percent decrease in packer slaughter capacity. Additionally, there was a 37 percent increase in Canadian swine imports into the United States. Swine producers experienced a significant reduction in equity capital investment and received a lower share of the consumer pork dollar in 1998. In 1998, swine producers received less than 30 percent of the consumer dollar spent on pork products. Despite stable retail prices, pork consumption increased by seven percent. The Act aims to compensate producers for losses due to economic factors and lack of government support in the swine market. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"swine,\" \"swine producer,\" \"crisis period,\" \"packer,\" \"feeder pig,\" \"swine operation,\" and \"Secretary.\" The Secretary of Agriculture will provide financial assistance to swine producers to offset market losses during the crisis period. Eligibility requires maintaining a swine operation and marketing swine for slaughter. Certain producers affiliated with publicly owned packers are ineligible. Assistance will be limited to eligible swine producers. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide financial assistance to swine producers during the crisis period. Eligibility requires maintaining a swine operation and marketing swine for slaughter. Assistance will be limited to eligible swine producers through an application process outlined in the Act. The payment amounts and limitations for financial assistance to swine producers during the crisis period will be outlined in the Act. Financial assistance under this Act will be distributed fairly and equitably to swine producers who have incurred losses. The maximum payment per slaughter-weight swine is $25.00, and for feeder pigs, it is $9.00, as determined by the number of eligible swine marketed and slaughtered during the crisis period. Payments to swine producers during the crisis period are calculated by multiplying the number of eligible swine marketed and slaughtered by $25.00, adding the number of eligible feeder pigs marketed by $9.00, and deducting payments received from other programs. Payment limitations are set at $50,000 per swine operation. SEC. 6. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PAYMENTS. Assistance provided under this Act is in addition to assistance, payments, and loans obtained under various agricultural programs and crop insurance indemnities for the 1998 crop year. Payments made to swine producers under the Small Hog Operation Program are also included. Payments made to swine producers under the Small Hog Operation Program announced on January 8, 1999, will be deducted from payments made under this Act. SEC. 7. EMERGENCY REQUIREMENT; USE OF COMMODITY CREDIT CORPORATION. Congress designates funds as emergency requirement for this Act. The Secretary will utilize Commodity Credit Corporation for Act provisions. SEC. 8. MANDATORY LIVESTOCK MARKET REPORTING. Amends Agricultural Marketing Act to include mandatory livestock market reporting. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like livestock, livestock product, and packer. Livestock includes cattle, sheep, and swine. Livestock product refers to products derived from livestock. A packer is defined as a person involved in buying livestock for slaughter or processing livestock products for sale. Prices, volume, and terms of sale encompass various factors like base price, premiums, discounts, and quality characteristics. The term 'prices, volume, and terms of sale' covers factors like base price, premiums, discounts, and quality characteristics. The Secretary of Agriculture is referred to as the 'Secretary'. Mandatory reporting is required for packers engaged in buying, manufacturing, or marketing more than five percent of livestock or livestock products in the United States. The Secretary requires packers to report information on prices, volume, and terms of sale for domestic and imported livestock and products. Packers must report separately for domestic and imported items and comply with reporting requirements by the next business day. Noncompliance with reporting requirements is unlawful. The Secretary may take actions to verify information provided by packers, and it is unlawful for packers to knowingly fail to provide required information. The Secretary can issue a cease and desist order and impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for each violation if a packer is found to be violating reporting regulations. The Secretary can issue a civil penalty for violations after a hearing. Factors considered include gravity of offense, business size, and impact on the packer. If the penalty is not paid, the matter may be referred to the Attorney General for legal action. The Secretary encourages voluntary reporting by packers not under mandatory reporting. The United States district court encourages voluntary reporting by packers not under mandatory reporting. The Secretary ensures timely availability of information to the public while protecting the confidentiality of parties involved and proprietary business information. This section does not restrict the Secretary's authority to collect voluntary reports under other laws. The reporting requirement established by subsection (b) shall expire at the end of the three-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this section. Section 416 of the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 is repealed. SEC. 9. REGULATIONS. The Secretary and the Commodity Credit Corporation must issue regulations promptly after the enactment of the Act to implement it.
