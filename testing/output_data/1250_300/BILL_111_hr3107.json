    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop Nuclear Assistance to State Sponsors of Terrorism Act of 2009\". The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established in 1957 with the objective of promoting atomic energy for peaceful purposes. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA and its Technical Cooperation Fund, which provides nuclear technical cooperation for peaceful purposes worldwide. The United States is the largest financial contributor to the IAEA's Technical Cooperation Fund, providing assistance to countries worldwide. A report by the Government Accountability Office found that Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria received over $55 million in assistance from 1997 to 2007, despite being designated as state sponsors of terrorism. Proliferation concerns persist due to the dual-use nature of nuclear equipment and technology. The Technical Cooperation Program has raised proliferation concerns due to its assistance to certain countries and the dual-use nature of nuclear technology. The GAO report highlighted projects in Iran related to nuclear power development and identified challenges in identifying and resolving proliferation risks. The GAO report highlighted concerns with the Technical Cooperation Program, noting that countries are not excluded based on political considerations. It also raised doubts about the State Department's ability to prevent the advancement of weapons of mass destruction in state sponsors of terrorism. The GAO report raised concerns about the Technical Cooperation Program potentially advancing weapons of mass destruction in state sponsors of terrorism. Legislation prohibits funding for programs in Libya, Iran, Cuba, and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Programs Appropriations Act, 1998 and the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 prohibited funds for IAEA programs in Cuba. The GAO report suggested withholding funding for projects in Cuba related to nuclear facilities. The IAEA reported Iran's ongoing heavy water projects. The IAEA has repeatedly reported Iran's violations of UN Security Council Resolutions by continuing heavy water projects and uranium enrichment. Iran now has around 7,000 centrifuges for uranium enrichment, as reported by the IAEA Director General in 2009. The IAEA Director General reported in June 2009 that Iran has around 7,000 centrifuges for uranium enrichment, running almost 5,000 of them, with a stockpile of over 1,300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium. Concerns remain about possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program and Iran's failure to implement the Additional Protocol. The IAEA Director General reported in February 2009 that Iran has not implemented the Additional Protocol, hindering the IAEA's ability to verify the absence of undeclared nuclear activities. Iran has also refused to provide access to key locations related to centrifuge manufacturing and uranium enrichment, impeding progress on addressing concerns about possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program. Iran has consistently refused to comply with IAEA resolutions regarding its nuclear program, blocking inspections and denying access to key sites. Recent reports indicate Iran's denial of access to its enrichment site at Natanz and refusal to allow additional surveillance cameras. Additionally, in 2008, it was revealed that Syria, with North Korea's help, was building a secret nuclear reactor at the Dair Alzour site. In 2008, it was revealed that Syria, with North Korea's help, was building a secret nuclear reactor at the Dair Alzour site capable of producing plutonium for nuclear weapons. The reactor was reportedly destroyed by an Israeli air strike in September 2007. General Michael Hayden stated that the reactor could have produced enough plutonium for 1 or 2 bombs within a year of becoming operational. The IAEA Director General reported that the Syrian facility at Dair Alzour bore features resembling those of an undeclared nuclear reactor. The IAEA Director General stated that Syria has not provided requested documentation or access to determine the nature of the destroyed facility at Dair Alzour. Uranium particles were found at the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor facility in Damascus, not included in Syria's declared inventory of nuclear material. The text chunk states \"PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FUNDS.\" No US funds to IAEA can support Technical Cooperation for countries like North Korea that sponsor terrorism, breach agreements, or are under investigation. The Secretary of State must withhold voluntary contributions proportional to IAEA spending on assistance from 2007 to 2008. The Secretary of State must withhold US contributions to IAEA proportional to spending on assistance to specified countries. If not done within 30 days, assessed contributions will also be withheld. SEC. 4. WAIVER. The provisions in subsections (b) and (c) of section 3 may be waived if the IAEA suspends assistance to countries in section 3(a) or if the President certifies these countries no longer pose a threat. SEC. 5. UNITED STATES ACTIONS AT IAEA. The President will direct the US Representative to the IAEA to block funds for assistance to countries in section 3(a). SEC. 6. REPORT. Within six months of enactment, the President must report to Congress on this Act. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. SEC. 6. REPORT.
