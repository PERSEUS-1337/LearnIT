    "content": "Inland waterways, managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, cover 38 states and handle half of all inland waterway freight. The Corps funds maintenance and construction through appropriations and user fees, with new construction costs shared equally. The Corps pays for studies, operations, and maintenance on the inland waterway system, while new construction costs are shared with the commercial industry. Congress is considering proposals for future financing, as the current fuel tax revenue is insufficient for major expenditures. This shortfall limits new projects and ongoing construction, prompting calls for changes in the financing system. Previous attempts to replace the fuel tax with lock usage fees have been rejected by Congress. The federal government has funded and supported inland waterways for commerce since the early 1800s. Despite advancements in rail and highway transport reducing reliance on waterways, they remain an important part of the nation's transportation system. Recent proposals suggest increasing fuel taxes and federal funding for inland waterway costs. Inland waterways remain a significant part of the nation's transportation mix for many commodities, accounting for 4%-5% of total commercial tonnage shipped annually. They are crucial for transporting bulk goods over long distances, especially for specific commodities like grain, oilseed, coal, petroleum, chemicals, and more. Despite projections of increased traffic, actual inland waterway traffic has remained relatively flat over the last 20 years. Inland waterway traffic has remained somewhat flat over the last 20 years, despite projections of increased traffic. Overall freight tonnage for all modes of domestic shipping has increased at an average annual rate of 1.2% from 1997 to 2007 and is expected to double over the next 25 years. Inland waterway traffic is projected to increase at a rate significantly less than rail and highway shipping. The Mississippi and Ohio River System handle approximately 90% of the tonnage transported on inland waterways, primarily through bulk shipping on barges. The federal government invests in inland waterways due to their value to the nation. The federal government invests in inland waterways, with almost all tonnage transported through the Mississippi and Ohio River System via bulk shipping on barges. In the early 1800s, federal investment began, leading to full funding for investigations, operations, maintenance, and construction costs through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Legislation in the 1970s and 1980s introduced user cost-sharing requirements, transforming inland waterway financing. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 established the current financing system for Corps inland waterway projects. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 established a fuel tax on commercial barges, cost-share requirements for inland waterway projects, and a trust fund to hold revenues for construction investments. These laws shifted financial responsibility to commercial operators on the inland waterway system. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund was initially funded by a fuel tax and later authorized for appropriations in WRDA 1986. WRDA 1986 authorized increases to the fuel tax on commercial barges, setting it to rise to $0.20 per gallon by 1994. It established a cost-sharing process for inland waterway projects, with 50% funding from the IWTF and 50% from the Treasury's General Revenue fund. Expenditures from the IWTF for construction projects require authorization from Congress and annual discretionary appropriations. The IWTF on a construction project must be authorized by Congress and funded through annual appropriations. WRDA 1986 authorized projects funded by the IWTF, with subsequent Acts authorizing more projects. Federal funding for inland waterway costs is 100% except for construction and major maintenance. WRDA 1986 also established the Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) as a federal advisory committee. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) was established by WRDA 1986 to represent shipping interests on inland waterways. The board meets regularly to make recommendations on investments to the Secretary of the Army and Congress. The IWTF balance has varied significantly between 1986 and 2011, with proposals to increase fees on the user industry for funding operations and maintenance. Since 2002, there have been proposals to increase fees on the user industry and have the IWTF fund operations and maintenance. Appropriations from the IWTF increased significantly from FY2005 onwards, exceeding fuel tax collections. Balances fell sharply from 2005 to 2010, leading Congress to take \"stopgap\" measures to prevent unsustainable levels. Congress has implemented various \"stopgap\" measures to prevent the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) balance from falling to unsustainable levels. These measures include exempting major rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements, limiting projects with access to the IWTF, providing construction funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and prohibiting new contracts requiring IWTF funding. As a result, the trust fund balance has stabilized, but funding for new projects is expected to be limited without changes to IWTF financing. The Inland Waterways Trust Fund balance has stabilized due to stopgap measures implemented by Congress. However, funding for new projects is expected to be limited without changes to IWTF financing. Concerns have been raised about inefficiencies and inequities in the Corps project planning process for inland waterways investments. Reforms were implemented in FY2006 in response to these concerns. Decisions in the executive branch have led to inefficient project implementation and use of tax dollars, with cost escalation and schedule delays on some IWTF projects. In FY2006, the Corps implemented reforms including risk-based cost estimates and prioritized funding for high-risk projects. While improvements were recognized, advocates call for additional structural reforms. The Olmsted Locks and Dam project exemplifies ongoing planning and oversight issues, with costs increasing from $775 million to $2.9 billion by FY2014. The authorized cost of the Olmsted Locks and Dam project increased from $775 million to $2.9 billion in FY2014. The project was 49% complete as of January 1, 2013, with the lock components already finished. Concerns about the solvency of the IWTF and financing for fuel-taxed inland waterways have led to various proposals by past administrations and the user industry. The IWUB recently adopted a proposal different from the Administration's. It includes increasing the fuel tax and requiring a higher federal share for certain inland waterway investments. Past administrations, like Bush and Obama, have proposed raising commercial user fees on inland waterways. In 2008, the Bush Administration suggested a lock usage fee to replace the fuel tax, phasing in charges for commercial barges based on lock chamber size. The Bush Administration proposed tying IWTF balances to user fees based on lock usage, but Congress rejected this approach due to concerns about burdening lock users. The Obama Administration also proposed new user fees for inland waterways, with the FY2010 budget suggesting a similar plan to increase fees at high-traffic locks. The FY2010 budget proposed new user fees for inland waterways, including the option to increase fees at high-traffic locks. Congress rejected the proposal, but subsequent budgets continued to suggest user fees to supplement fuel tax revenues. Despite various proposals, none have been enacted to date. The 2011 Obama Administration proposed a new inland waterway financing structure, including a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers based on revenue targets. This proposal aimed to supplement fuel tax revenues and included higher fees for vessels using locks. The Obama Administration proposed a new inland waterway financing structure with a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers, aiming to supplement fuel tax revenues. The proposed fee did not specify an amount but targeted revenue goals, estimating an additional $1 billion for the IWTF over 10 years. The proposal included adding 39 new segments to the inland waterway system, but it was opposed by the user industry and not enacted. In 2010, the Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) proposed a new financing system and recommended increasing the existing IWTF fuel tax by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon. The proposal was introduced as legislation in the 112th and 113th Congress but was not formally endorsed by the Corps or the Administration. The IWUB report recommended a new financing system for inland waterways, including increasing the IWTF fuel tax by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon. Other proposed changes include modifying cost-share requirements and increasing overall spending on inland waterways. The report also suggests increased IWUB involvement in project planning and construction. The IWUB report proposes increasing the inland waterway fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon, depending on fuel tax collections. This would generate approximately $112 million per year in revenues for the IWTF. The report also suggests shifting more project costs to the federal government and not indexing the tax for inflation. The IWUB report recommends shifting more project costs to the federal government by increasing federal funding for inland waterway projects and reducing cost-sharing requirements. It also proposes exempting dam-related expenses and small lock rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing, establishing a cap on IWTF funds to prevent construction cost overruns, and increasing the federal share for new investments to approximately 70% over the next 25 years. The IWUB report proposes an overall increase in funding for inland waterways, including an increase in federal funding and a reduction in cost-sharing requirements. It suggests increasing the federal share for new and major rehabilitation investments to approximately 70% over the next 25 years, with an average annual expenditure of $380 million, a significant increase from historical averages. Funding for these investments would primarily come from the General Revenue fund in the immediate future. The IWUB report proposes an increase in federal funding for inland waterways, with most of the funding coming from the General Revenue fund initially. Over the first five years, federal funding would need to be $1.33 billion, or 74% of the total required investment. The report also recommends reforms to improve cost-effectiveness of IWTF projects overseen by the Corps, including increased involvement of the IWUB in project delivery. The IWUB report recommends reforms to increase the board's involvement in Corps project delivery for IWTF investments, including appointing representatives to project design teams and obtaining sign-off on project plans. The report also outlines specific projects for funding once changes to the financing system are made. The IWUB report recommends reforms to increase the board's involvement in Corps project delivery for IWTF investments, including appointing representatives to project design teams and obtaining sign-off on project plans. Specific projects were prioritized based on asset condition, performance likelihood, consequences, and system improvement. Final funding decisions would still be made by Congress or the Corps. The proposal suggests implementing selection criteria similar to those in the report to increase project selection likelihood. Some have advocated for shifting costs away from the federal government to increase user-financed share of inland waterway costs. Some groups advocate for shifting costs away from the federal government to increase user-financed share of inland waterway costs. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office in the 1990s found that the current tax system distorts the actual costs of maintaining the inland waterway system. A user fee structure that recovers true costs for operations would increase economic efficiency, resulting in increased costs for waterways with low traffic-to-expense ratios. Several proposals have been made to increase user fees on inland waterways in order to shift costs away from the federal government. These proposals aim to make the waterways \"self-funding\" and cover construction, operations, and maintenance costs. Estimated savings from these proposals range from $1 billion to $4 billion over the next five to ten years. Several proposals have been suggested to raise user fees on inland waterways to cover construction, operations, and maintenance costs. These proposals aim to save around $4 billion over the next decade. The suggested user fee structures include annual licensing fees, congestion pricing, tolls, and lockage fees, with the goal of fundamentally changing the current financing system for inland waterways. Congress faces the challenge of deciding on new investment levels and revenue sources to address ongoing issues with the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. Several proposals have been suggested to raise user fees on inland waterways to cover construction, operations, and maintenance costs, aiming to save around $4 billion over the next decade. The proposals include annual licensing fees, congestion pricing, tolls, and lockage fees, with the goal of fundamentally changing the current financing system for inland waterways. Changes to inland waterways financing have been enacted in the 113th Congress through the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-121), which made limited changes to inland waterways financing, including adjustments to project delivery recommendations and cost-sharing requirements for specific projects. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 made changes to inland waterways financing, including reducing cost-sharing requirements for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project. Efforts were authorized to study revenue collection efficiency, potential use of bonds or new fees, and convening a stakeholder roundtable to evaluate future options for inland waterways. The House Appropriations Committee funded the Olmsted Project with a reduced cost-sharing requirement of 15% from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. The House Appropriations Committee funded the Olmsted Project under the newly enacted WRRDA cost-sharing requirement of 15% from the IWTF, allowing for significant funding for other inland waterways construction projects. Observers believe more funding is needed for waterway upgrades in the long-term, with support for user proposals like H.R. 1149 (the WAVE4 Act) which includes a fuel tax increase and alterations to cost-sharing responsibilities. The IWUB proposal, supported by bills like H.R. 1149 and S. 407, recommends infrastructure investments in federal waterways. These bills propose fuel tax increases and changes to cost-sharing responsibilities, with the federal government taking on more financial responsibility for dam construction and rehabilitation projects. Commercial users argue for increased investment due to aging infrastructure and the need for expanded capacity. Commercial users argue for increased investment in federal waterways due to aging infrastructure, the need for expanded capacity, and positive environmental benefits. However, taxpayer and environmental advocacy groups oppose increased federal funding, claiming that the benefits are overstated. Despite disagreements, most agree that the current financing system is inadequate for future needs. The Corps is expected to have appropriations for only one lock replacement project due to funding drawdown. The Corps of Engineers is facing funding challenges for ongoing lock replacement projects, with appropriations only available for the Olmstead Lock on the Ohio River through at least FY2016. Without new revenue or federal appropriations, future IWTF construction projects may be delayed, despite the urgent need to address aging infrastructure. The majority of locks in the U.S. are past their intended design age of 50 years, leading to decreased efficiency and increased lock unavailability. Some user industries advocate for new lock construction and expanded capacity, while others argue against significant investments in inland waterway projects. In recent years, there has been an increase in the need for new lock construction and expanded capacity in the user industry. However, some groups argue against significant investments in inland waterway projects, advocating for regular maintenance of existing locks instead. They believe that the costs of new lock construction outweigh the benefits and suggest small-scale improvements as a solution. The Corps of Engineers has noted that the justification for new navigation alternatives depends on unpredictable traffic forecasts and other variables. The Corps of Engineers notes that future navigation alternatives depend on traffic forecasts, which are difficult to predict due to various factors. Total domestic freight traffic is expected to increase by 70% by 2020, with waterway traffic projected to increase by 2% annually. Shipping interests suggest that improving inland waterway efficiency could reduce pressure on highway and rail shipments. Lock upgrades or new construction may increase demand for inland waterways. Shipping interests argue for increased investment in inland waterways due to their efficiency and environmental friendliness compared to other modes of shipping. Some groups have questioned the need for new lock construction based on flat or decreasing traffic at certain locks. The Corps of Engineers has refrained from using projected traffic increases as a basis for investment changes in inland waterways. Shipping interests advocate for investing in inland waterways over other modes of transportation due to their efficiency and environmental benefits. Studies show that barge shipping is more fuel-efficient and emits fewer greenhouse gases compared to rail and highway transportation. However, taxpayer and environmental groups question the validity of these studies, citing factors like river flow constraints that may impact fuel efficiency calculations. Environmental groups raise concerns about the negative impact of inland waterway projects on riparian habitat and species. Structural changes like locks, dams, and levees alter natural flows, leading to sedimentation, increased turbidity, and bank erosion. Increased construction and expansion of inland waterways can have adverse environmental effects. Congress may need to consider changes to the financing system for these investments. Increased construction and expansion of inland waterways can have negative environmental effects. Congress is considering changes to the financing system for these investments, including proposals such as an increase to the fuel tax, new annual fees, lock usage fees, or a toll system. The IWUB's proposed fuel tax increase aims to rebuild the trust fund balance and fund new investments, but some groups argue that the associated increases to federal cost share responsibilities are unacceptable. The user industry's stance on accepting fuel tax increases without changes to cost-sharing remains unclear. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees in 2011 to address inadequate revenues from commercial users on the inland waterway system. The fees would include fuel taxes and new fees for non-lock users, with lock users paying even more. The Administration also plans to add new waterway segments to the fuel-taxed list to increase revenues. Commercial shippers are seen as the primary beneficiaries of waterway investments and should continue to pay for new capital investments, with lock users paying the most. The IWUB argues against the new Administration proposal to impose lock usage fees on commercial shippers, stating that it unfairly burdens a subset of waterway users. They believe that targeting users of individual segments goes against the interconnected nature of the inland waterways system. The user industry also opposes the proposal as it delegates fee-setting authority to the Secretary of the Army. Congress has considered other means to raise revenue, such as lock usage fees, in the past. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 proposed various fees as replacements or supplements to the fuel tax, including lock usage fees, annual licensing fees, tolls, ton-mile charges, and lock charges for congested areas. A financing concept called \"capital recovery\" was also discussed, where user fees would adjust to recover government investments. This could prevent future trust fund shortfalls and prioritize essential projects. The Obama Administration proposed user fees tied to trust fund balances after FY2022 to prevent future shortfalls. Congress could also consider inflation adjustments to increase revenue reliability for inland waterways. Some argue that automatic adjustments could provide additional revenues and increase purchasing power of IWTF funds. Some argue that an inflation adjustment could increase the real purchasing power of IWTF funds, but others see it as a hidden tax increase. Without a long-term solution, Congress may need to take measures to ensure the trust fund's solvency, such as capping withdrawals or halting new contracts. Congress is also considering exempting some IWTF investments from cost-sharing requirements, which would come at an additional cost to taxpayers. The IWUB proposal aims to modify cost-sharing arrangements for inland waterway projects, excluding dams and minor rehabilitation from cost-share requirements. This would shift funding for these projects to 100% federal funding from the General Revenue stream, increasing costs to taxpayers. The IWUB proposes changes to cost-sharing arrangements for inland waterway projects, excluding dams and minor rehabilitation from cost-share requirements. This would shift funding for these projects to 100% federal funding from the General Revenue stream. The IWUB also suggests a new threshold of $100 million for major lock rehabilitation projects, increasing the number of federally funded maintenance and rehabilitation projects. Additionally, all cost overruns for IWTF construction projects would become a 100% federal responsibility, potentially adding hidden costs to the federal government. The IWUB proposes changes to cost-sharing arrangements for inland waterway projects, shifting costs towards the federal government. Critics argue that this change represents an additional hidden cost to the government. The cost-share arrangement for IWTF construction projects would shift to approximately 68% federal, 32% non-federal. Taxpayer and environmental groups are concerned about the significant federal support the IWTF already receives. In recent years, federal support for inland waterways has increased to $500 million-$650 million annually with no cost-sharing requirements. Federal costs for inland waterways could rise to over 90% of total costs under the proposal. The Obama Administration's proposals suggest changes to user fees but maintain a 50/50 cost-share structure between federal and nonfederal expenditures. Some advocate for shifting cost shares away from the federal government towards increased user responsibility for construction, operations, and maintenance of inland waterways. The IWTF system may shift cost shares away from the federal government towards increased user responsibility for construction, operations, and maintenance of inland waterways. Some groups argue that waterway users should pay for not only 50% of construction costs but also for operations and maintenance costs. Congress may consider these proposals as part of government cost-cutting efforts. The IWUB has proposed reforms to increase its involvement and improve project prioritization to prevent cost overruns in IWTF projects. The IWUB has proposed reforms to increase its involvement and improve project prioritization to prevent cost overruns in IWTF projects. The Corps' method for prioritization of inland waterway projects may receive congressional attention, with a recommendation to adopt a priority ranking system. This system aims to address concerns related to conflicts of interest and ensure more transparent decision-making processes. The IWUB proposes a priority ranking system to alter the current practice of project selection and funding, potentially limiting Congress's role to providing authorizations and funding levels. This change could align with federal approaches to project allocations in other agency programs."
