    "title": "SB 127",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges that many areas in California are disproportionately affected by drought due to reliance on overdrafted or contaminated groundwater. While state programs exist to assist communities with water needs, there is a lack of support for individual homeowners who rely on their own wells and cannot afford necessary water improvements. The program created by this act aims to provide low-interest loans and grants to individual homeowners for improving drinking water and wastewater treatment. This includes actions like digging deeper wells, addressing contaminants, and connecting to local systems. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Program established by the board offers assistance for extending service lines, connecting to systems, and closing abandoned septic tanks and wells for health and safety reasons. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund is created to provide financial assistance for improving drinking water and wastewater treatment for individual homeowners. This includes actions like connecting to local systems, addressing contaminants, and closing abandoned septic tanks and wells for health and safety reasons. The fund is available for expenditure by the board in accordance with regulations adopted to carry out the program's purposes. The Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund deposits repaid grant or loan moneys, including interest, and allows for earning interest. Eligible loan applicants must have a household income below the statewide median, own the residence, lack private lender assistance, and demonstrate repayment ability. To qualify for a grant or loan from the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund, applicants must have a household income below 60% of the statewide median, own the residence, and show the ability to repay. Loans are secured by a mortgage on the residence, must be repaid within 20 years at a 1% interest rate, and require homeowner's insurance. The board may partner with a financial institution to provide loans and may use funds for loan guarantees. An eligible applicant for a grant must have a household income below 60% of the statewide median, own the residence, and demonstrate the inability to secure financial assistance from private lenders. Grant recipients must repay the full amount if they sell the residence within five years and return any unused funds. $10 million is transferred to the Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Fund. This act is deemed urgent for public peace, health, or safety. The act is an urgency statute to provide eligible households with access to safer drinking water and wastewater treatment during California's drought. It defines \"water project\" and establishes procedures for actions against environmental impact reports or approvals for such projects. The Judicial Council must adopt a rule of court by July 1, 2016, to expedite actions challenging the certification of environmental impact reports for water projects. The draft and final reports must include a notice about certain comments not considered after the public comment period. The draft and final environmental impact reports must include the full text of the section. Within 10 days of the draft report release, an informational workshop must be held. A public hearing should take place within 10 days before the end of the comment period. Commenters can request nonbinding mediation within five days after the comment period closes. The lead agency selects mediators with expertise in land use and environmental law or science for mediation requested by commenters. Mediation sessions address areas of dispute, and agreed-upon measures become conditions of approval. Written comments after the public comment period are considered only if they raise new issues in the response to comments. The lead agency may consider written comments submitted after the public comment period if they address new issues raised in response to comments, new information released by the public agency, changes made to the project, proposed conditions for approval, mitigation measures, or new information not reasonably known during the public comment period. The lead agency must file the required notice within five days after the last initial project approval. The lead agency must file the notice within five days after the last initial project approval and prepare the record of proceedings in accordance with specific rules. The draft environmental impact report and related documents must be made available to the public in an electronic format within three business days of release. Any additional documents related to the proceedings must also be accessible within five business days. The lead agency must make an index of copyright protected documents available in electronic format by the release of the draft environmental impact report. Written comments on the project should be encouraged to be submitted electronically and made available to the public within five days. Comments not in electronic format must be converted and made accessible within seven days. Within seven business days, the lead agency must convert non-electronic comments into electronic format for public access. Comments not considered will be noted in the record without including their content. The lead agency must certify the proceedings record within five days of filing a notice and provide an electronic copy upon request, with a reasonable fee for reproduction. Within 10 days of receiving a complaint, the lead agency must lodge a copy of the certified record with the court. Within 10 days of receiving a complaint, the lead agency must lodge a copy of the certified record with the court. Any disputes over the record content will be resolved by the superior court. The court can only stop construction of a water project if it poses an imminent threat to public health and safety. The court may enjoin specific activities of a water project if it poses a threat to public health or important artifacts, historical, archaeological, or ecological values. An action against a lead agency's decision must follow Chapter 6 requirements. An action to challenge a lead agency's decision on a subsequent project approval must adhere to Chapter 6 requirements. No reimbursement is needed for this act as local agencies have the authority to levy charges to cover mandated services."
