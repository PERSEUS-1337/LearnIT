    "content": "The Act titled \"FERS Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Buyback Act of 2000\" allows for the crediting of service. The Act allows for the crediting of service as a temporary or intermittent employee for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation performed between December 31, 1988, and June 30, 2000, of at least 1 year's duration, if the individual later becomes subject to this chapter. An employee or Member must deposit 1.3 percent of basic pay for certain services performed, with interest if the deposit is made more than 5 years later. If the deposit under paragraph (1) is not made or is incomplete, the service of the employee or Member will still be creditable, but any annuity based on their service will be reduced similar to section 8418(b). SEC. 3. PROVISIONS RELATING TO PERSONS WHO HAVE SEPARATED. The Office of Personnel Management will establish regulations for obtaining credit for service performed by individuals who have separated from Government service. Credit will only be given upon submission of a written application by December 31, 2001. Any annuity or survivor annuity will be recalculated to include the service, effective for amounts accruing after 30 days from the application submission date. If the full deposit required under section 8411(j) of title 5 is not made timely, a reduction will be made in the annuity amount. Interest is not included in the deposit. The Office of Personnel Management is required to notify individuals of their rights under the Act and assist them in obtaining necessary information from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Corporation must provide information on an individual's service performance upon request from the Office."
