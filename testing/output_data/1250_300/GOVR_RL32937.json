    "content": "The Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources have approved legislation to reauthorize and revise the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant, including changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. The CSE program, enacted in 1975, is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) and funded by general revenues, providing services to families receiving TANF benefits. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program is operated by all 50 states, DC, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, with federal matching funds. Families receiving TANF benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage automatically qualify for CSE services. Child support collected for nonwelfare families goes to the family. Between FY1978 and FY2003, child support payments increased significantly, but the program still only collects 18% of child support obligations it is responsible for. The Child Support Enforcement program has seen a significant increase in child support payments, with collections rising by 1,274% from 111,000 to 1.525 million. Despite this, the program only collects 18% of child support obligations it is responsible for. The program handles at least 50% of all child support cases and provides various services including parent location, paternity establishment, and support order establishment. Collection methods include income withholding, intercept of tax refunds, and reporting to credit bureaus. The Child Support Enforcement program utilizes various methods to collect child support payments, including income withholding, intercepting tax refunds, and reporting to credit bureaus. Legislation such as P.L. 105-187 and P.L. 104-193 have established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children. States are required to implement expedited procedures to secure assets for child support arrearages. The Child Support Enforcement program, established by legislation such as P.L. 104-193, allows states to withhold licenses and assets of noncustodial parents who owe child support. It also authorizes the denial or restriction of passports for debtor parents and requires states to implement the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act. The federal government reimburses states for administering their Child Support Enforcement programs. The Child Support Enforcement program, established by legislation such as P.L. 104-193, clarified court jurisdiction in cases with multiple child support orders. The federal government reimburses states for program administration and laboratory costs for establishing paternity. P.L. 105-200 established a new incentive payment system for states, with a statutory limit of $446 million for FY2005. The program focuses on cost-recovery, service delivery, and promoting self-sufficiency and parental responsibility to strengthen families by securing financial support for children from noncustodial parents. The Child Support Enforcement program aims to promote self-sufficiency and parental responsibility by securing financial support for children from noncustodial parents. Child support payments are a significant income source for single-parent families, with an average of 17% of family income coming from child support. S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to improve the program and increase collections to enhance economic independence for former welfare families and provide stable income for all single-parent families. Both bills focus on simplifying rules, strengthening family-first policies, and revising enforcement tools. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to simplify Child Support Enforcement (CSE) rules and strengthen \"family-first\" policies. The bills revise enforcement tools and require families receiving TANF benefits to assign their child support rights to the state. Assigned child support covers payments accrued during and before TANF benefits. For a detailed comparison of CSE provisions in both bills, refer to Table 1 in the report. The child support assignment process involves noncustodial parents owing support payments, which are kept by states and the federal government to partially reimburse welfare benefits. Families receiving TANF benefits must assign their child support rights to the state, with different rules for pre-assistance and during-assistance arrearages based on the assignment date. Under S. 667, child support assignment during TANF benefits only covers support accrued during that time, not pre-assistance arrearages. H.R. 240 does not change assignment rules. Distribution rules determine order of child support payment. Distribution rules determine the order in which child support collections are paid, prioritizing current support and assigned arrearages up to the amount of TANF benefits received by the family. States have the discretion to decide how much of the state's share of child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families to send to the family and whether to treat these payments as income. States are required to pay the federal government its share of child support collections collected on behalf of TANF families. The federal government required states to pay their share of child support collections collected on behalf of TANF families. States have discretion over how much of the state's share to pass on to families as income. Some states continue to provide a $50 pass-through and disregard policy. Two bills aim to incentivize states to direct more child support to families, differing in the amount of federal cost-sharing and whether to support current policies or encourage new ones. The Senate Finance Committee's S. 667 proposes federal cost-sharing for states' pass-through and disregard policies, allowing states to pay up to $400 per month to TANF families without counting it towards benefits. In contrast, the House bill H.R. 240 incentivizes states to increase their pass-through and disregard policies. The House bill H.R. 240 incentivizes states to increase their pass-through and disregard policies for TANF families by allowing them to pay more child support without affecting TANF benefits. The federal government would share in the cost of increased pass-through payments, with a limit set at $100 per month or $50 more than the state previously shared with the family. Child support collections for former TANF families are prioritized under the 1996 welfare reform law, with current and never-assigned arrearages going to the family first. Child support accrued before and after TANF benefits belong to the family, while support during TANF goes to the state. This aims to reduce dependence on welfare. Under current law, child support accrued before and after TANF benefits go to the family, while support during TANF goes to the state. S. 667 and H.R. 240 would give states the option to distribute the full amount of child support collected to former TANF families, simplifying the distribution process and sharing costs with the federal government. This aims to reduce dependence on public assistance. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 propose giving states the option to distribute child support payments to former TANF families, sharing costs with the federal government. The bills also include provisions for passport denial, collecting child support from Social Security and veterans' benefits, and using the federal income tax refund offset program for past-due child support. The bill includes provisions for collecting past-due child support, authorizing the HHS Secretary to compare information of noncustodial parents with insurers, allowing assisting states to establish child support interstate cases, and expanding states' ability to collect child support payments. The bill includes provisions for collecting past-due child support, authorizing the comparison of noncustodial parents' information with insurers, requiring medical support from parents, and notifying health care plan administrators in certain cases. It also mandates states to review and adjust child support orders for TANF families every three years, report procedures for locating custodial parents, establish minimum funding levels for technical assistance and the Federal Parent Locator Service, and designate Indian tribes for access to information. Additionally, there is a provision for a $25 annual fee for individuals receiving CSE services but have never been on TANF, and an increase in funding for the CSE access and visitation program. The bill includes provisions for collecting past-due child support, requiring medical support from parents, and increasing funding for the CSE access and visitation program. It also mandates states to adopt a later version of UIFSA for interstate child support payments and allows Texas to operate its CSE program without a federal waiver.
