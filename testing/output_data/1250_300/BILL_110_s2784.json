    "content": "The Howard M. Metzenbaum ``Menu Education and Labeling Act'' or the ``MEAL Act'' is the short title of this legislation. The Act includes findings related to menu education and labeling. Congress finds that there is a strong link between diet and health, with diet-related diseases starting early in life. Increased caloric intake is a key factor contributing to the alarming increase in obesity in the United States. Two-thirds of American adults are overweight or obese, with rates of obesity doubling in children and tripling in teens since 1980. Obesity increases the risk of various health problems and costs the US $117 billion annually. Additionally, there has been a significant increase in meals prepared or eaten outside the home, with a third of calories and almost half of total food dollars spent on food from restaurants and food-service establishments. The increase in meals eaten outside the home contributes to excess saturated fat intake, a major risk factor for heart disease. Heart disease is a leading cause of death and disability in the US, costing $142 billion in healthcare expenditures and lost productivity. Increased sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure, which can lead to cardiovascular disease. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 requires food manufacturers to provide nutrition information. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 mandates nutrition information on packaged foods, but not on restaurant foods unless a nutrient content or health claim is made. Consumers struggle to limit calorie intake at restaurants due to limited nutrition information availability. Studies show consumers want nutrition information when ordering at restaurants to make informed decisions. Studies show consumers want nutrition information at the point of sale in restaurants to make educated decisions. Surgeon General and Secretary of Health recommend increased availability of nutrition information to reduce obesity. SEC. 3. NUTRITION LABELING OF STANDARD MENU ITEMS AT CHAIN RESTAURANTS. Section 403(q)(5) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require chain restaurants with 20 or more locations to disclose nutrition information for standard menu items. The restaurant or establishment must disclose calorie, fat, and sodium content of standard menu items in a clear manner. Additionally, they must provide information to help the public understand the significance of the nutrition information in the context of a daily diet. The nutrition information provided on menus must include the number of calories in a serving of the food, along with a notification that this information can be provided in writing upon request. This requirement does not apply to items not listed on a menu or daily specials. The regulations require restaurants to display calories per serving at self-service facilities like salad bars or buffets. Retail food establishments can voluntarily provide additional nutrition information that complies with labeling requirements. The regulations allow for voluntary provision of additional nutrition information by restaurants, beyond the required labeling requirements. The Secretary must propose regulations within a year and consider variations in serving sizes and food preparation in the final regulations within two years. The Secretary must promulgate final regulations within 2 years of enactment to implement requirements related to inadvertent human error and training of food service workers. If final regulations are not issued on time, proposed regulations will become effective as final regulations. The Secretary must publish final regulations in the Federal Register regarding vending machines that do not allow customers to see calorie information before purchasing. Operators with 20 or more machines must display calorie counts on a sign near the item. The Secretary will propose regulations within 1 year and finalize them within 2 years for vending machine operators to provide voluntary nutrition information. States can also require additional nutrition information beyond federal requirements. The Secretary will propose regulations within 1 year and finalize them within 2 years for vending machine operators to provide voluntary nutrition information. If final regulations are not promulgated within 2 years, proposed regulations will become effective as final regulations."
