    "content": "The \"Coastal Resources Enhancement and Restoration Act of 2000\" establishes National Science Foundation research grants for coastal engineering and shoreline protection, allocating at least 10 percent of engineering research grants for this purpose starting in fiscal year 2001. Additionally, the Act includes provisions for supplemental environmental programs in coastal areas. SEC. 3 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to allow federal agencies violating the Act to choose to construct artificial reefs or restore aquatic habitats instead of paying fines. SEC. 4 grants access to publicly owned shores. The amendment allows publicly owned shores with insufficient public access to be considered privately owned for eligibility and cost-sharing purposes. The Secretary of the Army will issue rules to implement these changes and ensure public access to every one-half mile of shoreline. The Secretary of the Army will issue rules to ensure public access to every one-half mile of publicly owned shore, with exceptions for environmentally sensitive areas. SEC. 5. BEACH NOURISHMENT ACCOUNT. Establishment of the Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury to receive funds from the general fund for beach nourishment projects without the need for further appropriation. The funds are allocated for a pilot program by the Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA, and for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control projects by the Secretary of the Army. The Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury receives funds for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control projects. The Secretary of the Army carries out these projects according to cost-sharing requirements and reports transactions to Congress. The Secretary of the Treasury invests excess funds in interest-bearing accounts. The Secretary of the Treasury invests excess funds from the Beach Nourishment Account in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, which can be acquired on original issue or by purchasing outstanding obligations at market price. Any acquired obligations can be sold at market price, and the interest and proceeds from their sale or redemption are credited to the account. SEC. 6. COMPREHENSIVE OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM PILOT PROGRAM. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA will jointly implement a pilot program to establish a comprehensive ocean monitoring network in the United States. Partnerships will be formed with local interests to collect a wide range of data on coastal oceans and waterways for real-time availability. Data collected will include wave heights, coastal currents, mammal movement, sewage outfall, and water quality information. The pilot program will involve monitoring various aspects of coastal oceans and waterways, including temperature, coastal currents, mammal movement, sewage outfall, water quality, fishing boat tracking, oil spill tracking, beach erosion data, weather, river mouth outflow sediment observation, and coastal mapping using a Global Information System. Federal cooperation will include partnerships with the Geological Survey, the Navy, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Regional test projects will be established in Southern California and another location to be determined. The pilot program will involve monitoring various aspects of coastal oceans and waterways in the California Bight region, with Orange County as the focal point. The Secretary and the Administrator will coordinate existing efforts and seek to obtain additional information. $4,000,000 will be available annually from the Beach Nourishment Account for regional test projects in fiscal years 2001 through 2006."
