    "content": "Coal-fired power plants are responsible for a significant portion of CO2 emissions in the U.S., making it a target for reducing greenhouse gases. Options include capturing CO2 emissions, switching to low-carbon sources like wind or nuclear power, or increasing the use of natural gas, which emits less CO2 than coal. Recent increases in natural gas reserves have sparked interest in using it as a lower carbon energy option. This was discussed in a 2009 Senate hearing on the role of natural gas in mitigating climate change. Natural gas can achieve near-term reductions in carbon emissions by increasing the use of existing gas-fired power plants. This was emphasized in a 2009 Senate hearing on the role of natural gas in mitigating climate change, where industry executives highlighted the immediate and verifiable CO2 emission reductions that can be achieved without the need for large spending programs. This solution offers a reliable and readily available option for reducing CO2 emissions in the power sector. The report discusses the immediate carbon reductions that can be achieved by increasing the use of existing natural gas-fired power plants, without the need for large spending programs. It highlights the feasibility of displacing coal-fired generation with electricity from natural gas plants, aiming to reduce CO2 emissions quickly and substantially. The report provides an overview of the issues involved in this transition and presents key considerations for Congress to encourage the displacement of coal-fired electricity with power from existing natural gas plants. The report discusses key issues for Congress to consider in displacing coal-fired electricity with power from existing natural gas plants. It includes background on gas-fired generation, feasibility issues, and policy considerations. Appendices provide additional information on the electric power system and gas-burning combined cycle generating technology. The report does not address the cost implications of displacing coal with natural gas, the feasibility of burning natural gas in existing coal plants on a large scale, or how circumstances may change over time. Assessing the potential for displacing coal generation with increased use of underutilized \"combined cycle\" natural gas plants is the focus of this report. Other types of gas-fired plants with low utilization rates are not reviewed due to inefficiency and limitations for baseload operation. Further analysis beyond the scope of this report would be needed to address these issues. The report focuses on the potential of replacing coal with underutilized natural gas plants, specifically combined cycle plants. The United States has a large base of advanced gas-burning power plants that have been underutilized. Gas-fired plants have been the primary source of new generating capacity in the US since the 1990s. This shift is illustrated in Figure 1 from 1990 to 2007, with minimal new coal capacity and limited growth in nuclear capacity. Wind energy has also emerged as a challenger to natural gas in recent years. Natural gas has become the largest source of new generating capacity in the US since the 1990s, surpassing coal and nuclear. Despite this, coal still accounts for a significant portion of electricity generation, with 49% in 2008. The growth in natural gas capacity was driven by factors such as cost, environmental concerns, and safety issues associated with nuclear and coal power. Natural gas became the primary source of new power capacity in the 1990s and early 2000s due to cost, environmental, and safety concerns surrounding nuclear and coal power. The growth of gas-fired plants was also driven by favorable technological and market characteristics, with combustion turbines being a key innovation. These turbines were used in modern natural gas combined cycle power plants, which were designed to serve as baseload generators. The most important technological development in the 1990s and early 2000s was the application of combustion turbines in modern natural gas combined cycle power plants. These plants are efficient, cost-effective, and can be built relatively quickly. NGCC plants can operate as baseload generators, capturing waste heat to maximize energy efficiency. They can be economically built at unit sizes of about 100 MW, with larger projects constructed by adding units over time. Combined cycle technology, specifically natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants, is suitable for small-scale and modular construction. NGCC plants can be economically built at unit sizes of about 100 MW, with the option to add units in a building block fashion over time. This technology became popular among independent power producers in the 1990s and after due to its cost-effectiveness and environmental advantages over coal plants. The operation of NGCC plants produces fewer harmful environmental impacts than coal-fired plants, making them easier to site and permit. Additionally, low natural gas prices in the 1990s further encouraged the construction of new gas-fired capacity. Natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants have fewer harmful environmental impacts than coal-fired plants due to the nature of the fuel and greater efficiency. NGCC emits about 40% less CO2 per MWh compared to existing coal plants. The restructuring of the electric power industry in the 1990s led to the rise of independent power producers (IPPs) who bought and constructed most new generating capacity. The restructuring of the electric power industry in the 1990s led to the rise of independent power producers (IPPs) who bought and constructed most new generating capacity, including over 168,000 MW of NGCC capacity between 1990 and 2007. This massive building program added 23% to the national generating fleet in 1990, with an additional 89,843 MW of less efficient peaking turbines and 56,939 MW of other generating technologies. Overall, generating capacity grew by 43% during this period. Between 1990 and 2007, there was a significant increase in generating capacity, with a large portion coming from the construction of less efficient stand-alone peaking turbines and other generating technologies. However, the building boom led to excess capacity due to questionable investment decisions and a spike in gas prices after 2000. This resulted in underutilized generating capacity, especially for NGCC plants, with only 13% operating at a capacity factor of 70% or greater. In 2007, only 13% of combined cycle plants in the study group operated at a capacity factor of 70% or greater. A third of the capacity had a utilization rate of less than 30%, with plants idle more than 70% of the time. The average capacity factor for NGCC plants was 42%, while coal plants had an average of 75%. The mismatch between the two types of plants creates an opportunity to displace coal power with gas generation. The potential displacement of coal-fired generation and emissions by existing NGCC plants is estimated in Table 3 and Table 4. The study group's NGCC plants had an average capacity factor of 42% in 2007. Doubling this utilization could displace 32% of coal-fired generation and 19% of CO2 emissions. However, achieving this maximum displacement is unlikely due to various factors like transmission, system dispatch, natural gas supply, price, transportation, and storage. The NGCC plants may not always be able to use the same transmission lines as coal units to displace coal-fired generation due to different locations and transmission paths. Regional differences in plant locations are evident, with some regions having both coal and NGCC plants while others have only one type. Transmission system constraints can hinder the displacement of coal-fired generation by NGCC plants. The report discusses transmission system constraints that can prevent NGCC plants from displacing coal-fired generation. These constraints include isolation of interconnections, limited transmission capacity, and system congestion. The electric power grid is divided into three independent interconnections: Eastern, Western, and ERCOT covering Texas. Surplus capacity in one interconnection cannot be used to meet load in another, hindering coal displacement by NGCC plants. The power grid is divided into three independent interconnections: Eastern, Western, and ERCOT covering Texas. Surplus capacity in one interconnection cannot be used to meet load in another due to limited links between them. The grid operates like a single giant machine, but is not designed to move large amounts of power between interconnections. The power grid operates as a single giant machine, linking generators and loads within an interconnection. However, it is not designed to move large amounts of power long distances due to historical development patterns. The grid lacks very long-distance inter-regional lines, limiting its capacity to transmit power between regions efficiently. The power grid lacks long-distance inter-regional lines, limiting its capacity to transmit power efficiently over hundreds of miles. Debate over increased renewable power use involves building new transmission lines to move wind and solar power to population centers. The power grid needs upgraded transmission lines to move renewable energy from remote areas to cities, displacing fossil fuels. Transmission congestion can limit the movement of power, causing issues at regional, state, and local levels. Transmission congestion can restrict power flows at regional, state, and local levels, leading to increased costs for consumers. It can limit the ability to import power into load pockets, like New York City, forcing utilities to rely on nearby inefficient power plants. The annual costs of transmission congestion range from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. The key aspect of congestion is the restrictions it imposes on power flows, rather than just the cost impact. Solutions for congestion may not always require massive transmission construction. The solution for transmission congestion may not always involve massive construction. A small number of selective additions to transmission capacity could lead to significant economic benefits for consumers. Analyzing transmission limitations on coal displacement can be done using computer models. Proximity analysis can help determine the likelihood of NGCC plants connecting to the same transmission lines as coal plants. A proximity analysis can determine if NGCC plants will connect to the same transmission lines as coal plants, potentially replacing coal generation. The analysis involves defining study groups of large coal plants and NGCC plants, entering their coordinates into a GIS, and identifying coal plants within a ten-mile radius of NGCC plants. This analysis was conducted using 2007 data. The analysis in 2007 involved entering plant coordinates into a GIS to identify coal plants within a ten-mile radius of NGCC plants. Surplus generation from NGCC plants was calculated to potentially displace coal generation, with a second analysis including NGCC plants within 25 miles. This approach estimates coal displacement potential based on proximity, considering factors like utility dispatch, transmission system configuration, and fuel availability. The analysis suggests that existing NGCC plants near coal plants may be able to displace 15% to 28% of potential coal generation and CO2 emissions. However, this would only account for 5% to 9% of total U.S. coal generation and 3% to 5% of associated CO2 emissions. Overall, existing NGCC plants may only be able to displace around 30% or less of coal-fired generation and CO2 emissions. The analysis suggests that existing NGCC plants near coal plants may be able to displace around 30% or less of coal-fired generation and CO2 emissions. The configuration and capacity of the transmission system will play a crucial role in determining the potential for displacing coal with power from existing NGCC plants. System dispatch refers to how power plants are operated to meet changing load patterns. The assumption that NGCC plants are underutilized when coal plants are operating may not always hold true, as shown in the monthly utilization of coal and gas-fired plants. The monthly utilization of coal and gas-fired plants shows that when coal plant operation is at its highest, NGCC plant operation is also at its highest, leading to surplus gas-fired generation being at its lowest. This is illustrated in Figure 9, which provides a national, monthly picture of power plant dispatch. Additionally, Figure 10 demonstrates hourly dispatch at Plant Barry in Alabama, highlighting the potential for existing NGCC plants to displace coal with excess capacity. The data from Plant Barry in Alabama for November 2007 shows that even during low utilization months for NGCC units, there were still periods of near maximum output. This detailed analysis is necessary to estimate the potential for displacing coal with natural gas. Large-scale displacement of coal-fired generation by NGCC plants could significantly increase U.S. gas demand. Plant dispatch could displace coal with natural gas, leading to a significant increase in U.S. gas demand. Estimates show that replacing all coal-fired generation with existing NGCC plants could raise gas demand by 5% to 20%. This demand could be met through increased domestic production, pipeline imports, Alaskan supplies, and LNG imports. The interest in displacing coal with natural gas has increased due to higher production and reduced demand during the recession, leading to a sharp decline in gas prices. Optimism surrounds the gas supply and price outlook, with estimates showing abundance in gas resources, particularly from shale formations. The recent increase in natural gas production is mainly attributed to advancements in extracting gas from shale formations, leading to a significant rise in supply. Forecasts predict a drop in wellhead prices for 2020 and 2030 due to the rapid expansion of shale gas production. Despite the positive outlook, natural gas markets remain challenging to predict accurately. Natural gas markets historically difficult to forecast, with major price discrepancies. Witness cautionary note on shale gas supply increase, citing past instances of overestimation. Drilling declines as prices fall. In 2009, drilling declined as prices fell, leading to demand destruction and job losses. The potential increase in natural gas demand from a coal displacement policy could significantly impact total demand, reaching levels not projected until after 2028 by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) does not foresee total gas demand reaching 24,886 TBtus until after 2028. Rapidly transitioning from coal to gas could accelerate gas demand growth beyond EIA's 2035 forecast. The national pipeline network, with 293,000 miles of pipelines, can handle peak loads and is supported by natural gas storage facilities. Pipeline capacity is unlikely to be a constraint on displacing coal. Gas storage facilities hold gas produced during lower demand periods until needed for peak demand. National pipeline capacity unlikely to constrain coal displacement by existing NGCC plants. Increase in gas demand from NGCC plants for coal displacement could stress specific pipelines and storage facilities. Illustrative estimates show a potential 16% to 66% increase in gas demand for power generation. The natural gas industry has the capacity to handle a material increase in gas demand for power generation. Capacity additions to the pipeline system have been significant, with more planned for the future. The potential for displacing coal consumption in the power sector by utilizing existing NGCC power plants depends on various factors. The potential for displacing coal consumption in the power sector by utilizing existing NGCC power plants depends on factors such as excess capacity, operating patterns, transmission grid capabilities, gas supply, and environmental impacts. Future conditions must be considered, as well as the question of cost. The potential for displacing coal consumption in the power sector with gas must consider future conditions and costs. Factors like gas and coal prices, infrastructure needs, and economic impacts need to be analyzed. Congress may need to commission a study on replacing coal with gas from existing power plants to understand the implications on the power system and economy. Congress may consider commissioning a study to assess the feasibility of replacing coal with power from existing gas-fired plants. The study would analyze the potential for displacing coal, consider the direct costs and impact on electric rates, and evaluate different scenarios due to uncertainties like future natural gas prices. Additionally, an analysis could be conducted on using gas in existing coal-fired plants, taking into account engineering challenges and infrastructure requirements. The appendix provides background on the electric power system, including power plants, transmission lines, and distribution systems. It discusses the potential for using gas in existing coal-fired plants to displace coal while utilizing existing transmission lines. The electric power system includes power plants using combustible fuels like coal, natural gas, and biomass, as well as non-combustible sources like wind, solar, and nuclear energy. Transmission lines carry electricity from power plants to demand centers, with higher voltage lines having less power loss. Policy discussions focus on high voltage networks for long-distance power transmission. Capacity is the potential output of a generating unit in watts, while energy is the actual electricity generated or released by a storage device in watt-hours. Capacity factors are important for determining the efficiency of power plants. The capacity factor of a power plant measures how intensively it is utilized, calculated as the ratio of actual electricity produced to the maximum possible output. Demand for electricity varies throughout the day, peaking in the afternoon and decreasing at night. The power system's daily load curve dictates its operation, with baseload units meeting minimum demand and ramping up or down as needed. Intermediate units handle most fluctuations in demand, with fast ramp rates and the ability to serve as spinning reserve units. Load-following plants with fast ramp rates can adjust output to match changes in demand and serve as spinning reserve units. Peaking units, although expensive to operate, can quickly start up and shut down to meet brief peaks in demand, also serving as spinning reserve and quick start units. Economic dispatch prioritizes generating units based on lowest variable cost, with efficiency measured by heat rate in converting fuel to electricity. The efficiency of a power plant is measured by its heat rate, which is the fuel input needed to produce electricity. Lower heat rates mean greater efficiency and lower costs. Economic dispatch prioritizes generating units based on lowest variable cost, with baseload units being the first to come online. The power plants are categorized into baseload, combined cycle, and peaking plants. Baseload generators run throughout the year with low fuel costs. Combined cycle units meet intermediate load and ramp up and down during the day. Peaking plants run only when needed to meet high loads. Variable renewable plants like wind and solar are used to displace generation from gas-fired plants with higher costs. Variable renewable plants like wind and solar can displace coal generation when demand is low. These plants are not firm resources as their output depends on weather conditions. Linking them to electricity storage can make their generation firm, but current storage options are limited and expensive. Combined cycle technology achieves high efficiency by capturing waste heat in the generating process. Combined cycle technology uses natural gas to power a generator through a combustion turbine. The exhaust is then used to produce steam in a heat recovery steam generator, increasing energy efficiency. Different configurations like 1x1, 2x1, or 3x1 designs allow for flexibility in capacity. Natural gas is the predominant fuel used in combined cycle plants in the United States, but they can also use fuel oil or gasified coal. Combined cycle plants in the United States primarily use natural gas as fuel, but can also utilize fuel oil or gasified coal. Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants are being developed, with two prototypes currently operating and a commercial-scale unit under construction in Indiana."
