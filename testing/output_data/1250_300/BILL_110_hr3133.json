The Congress finds that expanded access to credit has led to high homeownership rates, but some lenders engage in predatory practices, making it costly for vulnerable families. Borrowers with fair credit can access prime loans with low rates, while those with poor credit resort to subprime loans with higher costs. Predatory lending involves unjustifiably high interest rates and fees in various mortgage products. Predatory lending includes home mortgages, refinancing, equity loans, and repair loans with high interest rates, fees, and unfair terms. These loans have disproportionately affected minority neighborhoods, stripping away wealth accumulated over decades. Vulnerable communities lacking access to traditional institutions are targeted by lenders offering high-interest home equity loans, leading to foreclosure for many homeowners who struggle to meet payments. The joint report by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of the Treasury in 2000 called for legislation to curb predatory home mortgage lending, including restricting abusive terms, improving consumer literacy and disclosures, and prohibiting government-sponsored enterprises from purchasing predatory loans. The joint report in 2000 proposed a four-point plan to address predatory lending practices, including improving consumer literacy and disclosures, disclosing credit scores to borrowers, and providing timely and accurate information on loan costs. Government agencies are involved in reducing lenders' use of high-pressure sales techniques and misleading borrowers. Predatory lending threatens the work of nonprofit organizations in distressed neighborhoods, and more assistance is needed for borrowers with predatory loans. Nonprofit organizations work with lenders and local governments to improve distressed neighborhoods. More assistance is needed for borrowers with predatory loans, to educate consumers about the dangers of home loans, and to refer them to appropriate agencies for help. Grant program established for education and counseling on predatory lending. The Secretary of the Treasury may provide grants to States, local governments, and nonprofits for anti-predatory lending activities. These activities include education programs to inform vulnerable consumers about unfair lending practices and counseling programs offered by certified organizations.

The maximum grant amount for any single grantee in a fiscal year is $1,000,000. The Secretary will select grant recipients based on established criteria.
