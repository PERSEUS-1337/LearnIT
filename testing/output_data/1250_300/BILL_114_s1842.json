Additionally, it addresses information sharing regarding criminal aliens. Section 642 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 is amended to update references to the Department of Homeland Security, change \"may\" to \"shall\" in subsection (a), specify law enforcement activities in subsection (b), and outline notifying the Federal Government about inadmissible and deportable aliens and complying with requests for information from Federal law enforcement. The amendment to Section 642 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 updates references to the Department of Homeland Security, specifies law enforcement activities, outlines notifying the Federal Government about inadmissible and deportable aliens, and prohibits sanctuary policies that violate Federal law or restrict cooperation with Federal law enforcement. The amendment prohibits State and political subdivisions from assisting Federal immigration enforcement to receive certain funds or grants. The Secretary of Homeland Security must annually determine non-compliant States and report to Congress. The Secretary of Homeland Security must determine non-compliant States or political subdivisions and report to Congress. Non-compliant jurisdictions will be ineligible for federal financial assistance for at least one year and can only regain eligibility after compliance certification. Funds not allocated due to non-compliance will be reallocated to compliant States or political subdivisions. Failure of States or political subdivisions to comply with providing information about apprehended aliens will result in reallocation of funds to compliant entities. The Secretary of Homeland Security will determine non-compliant jurisdictions annually and report to Congress. Non-compliant entities will lose federal financial assistance for at least one year. The Secretary of Homeland Security will reimburse States and political subdivisions for reasonable costs incurred due to providing information. Law enforcement officials are not required to provide information on crime victims or witnesses under this section. SEC. 4. CLARIFYING THE AUTHORITY OF ICE DETAINERS. The Secretary is required to execute all lawful writs, process, and orders issued under the authority of the United States. States or political subdivisions that do not comply with DHS detainers will lose funding and grants. States and political subdivisions acting in accordance with federal immigration detainers are granted immunity. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 allows states or political subdivisions to hold aliens in custody for transfer to Federal custody under color of Federal authority. Congress believes the Department has probable cause when issuing detainers for inadmissible or deportable aliens. SEC. 5. ILLEGAL REENTRY. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to increase the minimum sentence for illegal reentry to not less than 5 years."
