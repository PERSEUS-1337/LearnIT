    "content": "The United States has a history of relying on domestic energy sources, but growing industrialization and population led to increased dependence on foreign energy in the 20th century. Federal efforts have been made to increase energy independence through programs focusing on energy efficiency, conservation, and research into renewable sources. These programs have been periodically reauthorized and redesigned to adapt to changing economic conditions and national interests. Since 2005, Congress has enacted major energy laws to establish, expand, or modify energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. The Department of Energy operates the most incentive programs, with additional programs run by the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Agriculture. The Department of Energy (DOE) operates numerous energy efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs, with additional programs run by the Department of the Treasury, Department of Agriculture, and other agencies.
