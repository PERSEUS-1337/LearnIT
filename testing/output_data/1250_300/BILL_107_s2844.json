Congress makes the following findings regarding the need for new teachers, especially in rural and high poverty schools, to meet the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Rural education is crucial in 25 states, and high poverty schools require special assistance to ensure teacher certification in their fields. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards was established in 1987 to address these issues. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, founded in 1987, aims to establish high standards for accomplished teachers. Over 16,000 teachers from all states have completed certification through a rigorous assessment process. Data shows that certified teachers outperform their peers on key teaching measures. Teachers certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards excel in 11 out of 13 teaching expertise measures compared to non-certified peers. Teacher salaries have stagnated, with two-thirds of states below the national average. The Act aims to incentivize teachers to work in rural or high-poverty schools and provide tax credits for National Board certification to attract and retain qualified teachers. The Act introduces a tax credit for individuals teaching in high poverty or rural schools and certified teachers. The Act introduces a tax credit for eligible teachers in high poverty or rural schools, allowing a credit against the tax imposed for the taxable year based on the applicable amount for the eligible academic year. The applicable amount is $1,000 for teachers in schools where at least 75% of students receive free or reduced-cost lunches. The Act provides a tax credit for eligible teachers in high poverty or rural schools based on the applicable amount for the academic year. Eligible teachers are defined as kindergarten through grade 12 classroom teachers or instructors. The applicable amount is $1,000 for certified teachers and $2,000 for teachers in schools with high poverty or in rural areas. The tax credit for eligible teachers is $2,000 for those in high poverty or rural schools. An eligible teacher is defined as a kindergarten through grade 12 classroom teacher in a public school on a full-time basis. Additional definitions include terms like elementary and secondary schools as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Eligible academic year refers to any academic year ending in a taxable year after December 31, 2002. Conforming amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section related to tax credits for eligible teachers in high poverty or rural schools. The table of sections is also updated to reflect these changes.
