Mortgage brokers are held to a fiduciary standard in home mortgage loan transactions. The Borrower's Protection Act of 2007, also known as the Truth in Lending Act, establishes standards for mortgage brokers and originators in home mortgage loan transactions. Mortgage brokers are required to have a fiduciary relationship with consumers and act with reasonable skill, care, and diligence. Mortgage originators must assess the borrower's ability to repay before facilitating any home mortgage loan. Before facilitating a home mortgage loan, mortgage originators must verify the borrower's ability to repay the loan, including principal, interest, real estate taxes, and insurance fees. For variable mortgage rates, the ability to pay is based on the maximum monthly payment for the first 7 years, calculated using the highest allowable interest rate and a repayment schedule for full amortization. Required verification documents must be provided. Mortgage originators must verify the borrower's ability to repay the loan by documenting income, financial resources, debt-to-income ratio, and residual income. This includes tax returns, payroll receipts, bank records, or other reliable documents. A borrower's statement alone is not sufficient for verification. Rate spread mortgages require the borrower to make monthly escrow payments for taxes, insurance, and flood insurance. An exception applies if the mortgage originator believes the borrower will make escrow payments for another loan on the same property. Following loan closing, the obligor must make escrow payments on the property securing the loan for another loan on the same property. Lenders are liable for acts of mortgage brokers in rate spread mortgage loan transactions. Mortgage originators are prohibited from steering consumers to disadvantageous terms in home mortgage loans. Mortgage originators must suggest advantageous home loan options to consumers or disclose if they cannot offer one, directing them to other creditors. Mortgage originators must offer beneficial home loan options to consumers or inform them if they cannot provide one, guiding them to other lenders. Prohibited conduct includes misrepresenting credit history, property values, or discouraging consumers from seeking loans elsewhere. In the appraisal process, a mortgage originator must not enter into a home mortgage loan if they suspect the appraiser did not act in good faith or if the appraisal was not conducted according to state and federal regulations. This ensures fair dealing with consumers in property valuation. The appraisal must be conducted in accordance with all applicable standards, and the appraiser must not have any direct or indirect interest in the property or transaction. The appraiser cannot charge compensation without a qualifying bond, and the appraisal order cannot include the loan amount or property value. Mortgage originators are prohibited from influencing appraisers to target a specific value for a home mortgage loan.

They cannot select appraisers based on expected values or use another person in the appraisal process as a defense.

The Truth in Lending Act is amended to include provisions for mortgage originators, specifically adding duties for mortgage originators in section 129A."
