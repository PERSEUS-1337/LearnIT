    "content": "Residential energy efficiency can benefit consumers by reducing utility bills and supporting national environmental policy objectives. Various policies have been adopted since the 1970s to increase conservation and energy efficiency, including tax incentives. The federal government is still deciding on the best policy tools to meet energy-efficiency objectives. In 2016, one-fifth of total energy consumed in the US was by the residential sector. Residential energy consumption has slightly decreased in recent years on a per capita and aggregate basis. Residential energy consumption has fallen slightly as a percentage of all energy consumption and on a per capita basis. Per capita energy use has remained constant since the 1970s but started trending downward in the mid-2000s. Despite energy-efficiency gains, experts believe there is still potential for increased efficiency in the residential sector. Concerns exist that consumers may not invest in optimal energy efficiency levels. Increasing energy efficiency could lead to reduced residential energy use per capita over time, but population growth may offset these gains. Increasing energy efficiency could change residential energy use trends, leading to reduced energy use per capita over time. This report explores tax credits as a policy option for promoting residential energy efficiency, providing an economic rationale for incentives to correct market failures and barriers. It also includes an economic analysis of primary tax incentives and various policy options for the 2017 tax year. Taxpayers can claim tax credits for residential energy-efficiency improvements and renewable-energy technologies in the 2017 tax year. The nonbusiness energy property tax credit allows for a 10% credit on building envelope improvements and high-efficiency appliances, capped at $500. In 2017, taxpayers could claim tax credits for residential energy-efficiency improvements and renewable-energy technologies. The nonbusiness energy property tax credit offered a 10% credit on building envelope improvements and high-efficiency appliances, capped at $500. Another credit, the residential energy efficient property tax credit, allowed for a tax credit on properties that generate renewable energy, with a credit rate of 30% in 2017. The Section 25D tax credit for renewable energy technologies offers a credit rate of 30% in 2017, decreasing to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021 before expiring. There is no maximum value for this credit, and consumers are encouraged to invest in energy-efficient technologies if the savings outweigh the costs. Consumers may not invest in optimal residential energy efficiency due to market failures and barriers. Section 25C and Section 25D credits do not fully address these issues, limiting their impact on increasing energy efficiency. Market failures and barriers, such as externalities and informational issues, may limit the impact of incentives like Section 25C and Section 25D on increasing residential energy efficiency. Energy consumption externalities, like pollution costs not reflected in electricity prices, can lead to underinvestment in energy efficiency. The environmental consequences of electricity production lead to underinvestment in energy efficiency. Adoption of energy-efficient technologies can have positive externalities through knowledge spillover effects, benefiting society as a whole. Market failures, such as the principal-agent problem, can hinder the adoption of emerging technologies. Market failures, like the principal-agent problem, can lead to underinvestment in energy efficiency. Landlords and builders may not prioritize energy-efficient investments if they do not see a direct benefit. Capital market imperfections can also hinder households, especially low-income ones, from investing in energy-efficient property due to high initial costs. Investments in energy efficiency often involve high initial costs, leading some purchasers to opt for less efficient alternatives, especially low-income households. Lack of information about energy-saving technologies can also deter consumers from making investments. Government policies, such as tax incentives, can help address market failures and barriers to energy-efficient investments. Tax incentives, grants, rebates, credit enhancements, regulations, mandates, informational programs, tax credits like Section 25C and Section 25D, and supply-side incentives like the energy-efficient appliance manufacturer credit can help address barriers to energy-efficient investments. Tax credits, like the energy-efficient appliance manufacturer credit, can reduce the cost of producing energy-efficient products and encourage additional investment. However, they may not be the most economically efficient policy option if markets underinvest in energy efficiency due to artificially low electricity prices. Removing federal financial support for electricity could be a more efficient way to increase investment in energy efficiency. Increasing electricity prices to reflect full costs can drive investment in energy efficiency by removing federal financial support or taxing electricity production with external costs. Current tax incentives do not effectively address the principal-agent problem, as they are not available to renters or landlords for residential energy efficiency investments. Other incentives like the tax credit for energy-efficient new homes are not discussed in this report. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not benefit landlords or renters, as they are not eligible for Section 25D credits. While tax incentives like the IRC \u00a745L credit for energy-efficient new homes address market problems, they may not be effective for consumers with credit constraints. Subsidizing efficiency through tax credits could increase adoption of energy-efficient technologies and improve societal welfare. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency, like Section 25C and Section 25D, may increase adoption of energy-efficient technologies and improve societal welfare. However, recent research suggests that tax credits may not be necessary for well-informed consumers, leading to windfall gains for recipients. Targeting consumers with the largest energy inefficiencies may maximize the benefits of tax credits. These credits may not address all market failures, limiting their ability to increase energy-efficient technology usage to optimal levels. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency, like Section 25C and Section 25D, aim to increase adoption of energy-efficient technologies and improve societal welfare. However, there are concerns about their effectiveness in encouraging additional investments and their fairness, particularly in benefiting higher-income taxpayers. Administrative issues with these tax benefits have also been identified by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. The current tax benefits for residential energy efficiency aim to encourage investments, but concerns exist about their effectiveness in generating additional investment. Tax credits may not lead to increased energy efficiency investments, potentially resulting in windfall gains for recipients without achieving the policy goal. These concerns were raised when residential energy tax credits were first introduced in the 1970s. Energy efficiency tax credits introduced in the 1970s may not have led to additional investment as expected. Concerns were raised by Members of Congress about the effectiveness of these credits, with some stating that the tax credits did not provide enough incentive in the marketplace. Empirical evidence on whether these tax credits resulted in increased investment in energy-efficiency property is mixed. The effectiveness of residential energy tax credits introduced in the late 1970s and early 1980s is questioned. Empirical evidence on whether these tax credits led to additional investment in energy-efficiency property is mixed. Some researchers suggest that the tax incentives may have only resulted in windfall gains for recipients rather than increased energy-efficiency investment. Policymakers need to consider whether tax credits can truly encourage enhanced residential energy-efficiency investment. Consumers may not be significantly influenced by these tax credits due to other market incentives, such as high energy prices. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency may not effectively incentivize investment for all taxpayers. Federal revenue losses from tax credits can be seen as windfall gains for consumers who would have invested in energy-efficient property regardless. The savings from tax credits are delayed until tax returns are filed, reducing their incentive power. Additionally, tax credits only benefit taxpayers with income tax liability, excluding those without federal tax liability. This means that higher-income taxpayers are more likely to benefit from these incentives. Tax incentives for residential energy efficiency primarily benefit higher-income taxpayers, motivating them to invest in energy-efficient equipment. These incentives aim to increase investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy properties, targeting homeowners as the main beneficiaries. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency mainly benefit higher-income homeowners, with over three-quarters of claims made by taxpayers with incomes above $50,000 in 2015. Incomes below $50,000 make up 61.4% of all tax units, with 22.4% claiming residential energy tax credits. As income rises, the average credit amount also increases. The nonrefundability of certain tax credits limits who can benefit fully, as the credits cannot exceed a taxpayer's tax liability. Taxpayers with other tax incentives may not fully benefit from residential energy-efficiency credits. Taxpayers with other tax incentives may not fully benefit from residential energy-efficiency credits, limiting the effectiveness of using tax credits to motivate energy-efficiency investments. Tax incentives are often limited to higher-income households, which may not effectively address market barriers for energy-efficiency investments. An ideal tax code should be simple for taxpayers to comply with and for the government to administer, to encourage more taxpayers to claim benefits. The IRS faces challenges in verifying eligibility for residential energy tax credits, leading to opportunities for fraud. Taxpayers may not claim benefits if compliance costs are high, impacting the effectiveness of using tax credits to promote energy-efficiency investments. The IRS had difficulty confirming the eligibility of taxpayers claiming residential energy tax credits due to lack of required information about the residences where the modifications were made. Prior to 2011, the tax form did not ask for details to confirm eligibility, resulting in uncertainty about whether claimants were homeowners. The IRS updated the form in 2011 to request additional information about the taxpayer's home. The IRS updated Form 5695 in 2011 to gather more information about taxpayers' homes for energy efficiency credits. TIGTA found IRS errors denying $1.5 million in credits to nearly 800 eligible taxpayers. The $500 limit on the 25C credit was mistakenly applied to the 25D credit, causing some taxpayers to be improperly denied the full amount. Congress may let these credits expire, with the 25C credit already expired in 2017 and the 25D credit set to expire in 2021. The Section 25C credit expired in 2017 and the Section 25D credit will expire in 2021. Congress is considering options for future residential energy efficiency incentives, including letting the credits expire or modifying them. Extending the credits with the $500-per-taxpayer cap would provide limited incentives. The current tax credits for residential energy efficiency have evolved since 2005, with potential expansions to increase incentives for homeowners. These expansions could include more generous formulas, broader technology eligibility, and removing caps. The value of these credits grew significantly between 2007 and 2009. Policymakers could also consider scaling back provisions, such as reinstating technology-specific caps. The expansion of tax credits for residential energy efficiency may provide windfalls to taxpayers, but policymakers could scale back provisions by reinstating technology-specific caps or introducing an overall cap. Changes from current policy may increase confusion among taxpayers. Extension of current policy, whether expanded or scaled back, will have a greater budgetary cost than expiration of benefits. Policymakers may also consider phasing out credits for upper-income taxpayers and replacing them with a rebate program or alternative mechanism for direct cash payments to consumers. Policymakers may consider replacing tax credits with a rebate program to provide direct cash payments to consumers for energy-efficient purchases. Legislation in 2010 proposed a rebate program called Home Star, but it was not passed by the Senate. This alternative mechanism could benefit consumers who do not have sufficient funds for eligible expenditures or have little to no tax liability. In 2010, a temporary rebate program called Home Star was created but not passed by the Senate. Tax credits for residential energy efficiency were first introduced in the late 1970s and reintroduced in 2005, similar to earlier incentives. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced the first tax credit for conservation and renewable energy generation. In 1980, Congress passed the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-223), which increased the residential energy efficiency tax credit. The credit consisted of two components, with the maximum value reaching $4,000. This credit expired in 1985 but was reintroduced in 2005 under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05). The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05) created temporary tax credits for homeowners who made energy-efficiency improvements to their homes. The nonbusiness energy property credit (IRC \u00a725C) allowed taxpayers to receive a nonrefundable tax credit equal to 10% of qualified expenditures, with specific limits for different types of property. The maximum credit for windows was $200, and the lifetime cap was $500 for 2006 and 2007. The credit could only be applied to improvements made to the taxpayer's principal residence. The Section 25C credit for windows in 2006 and 2007 was capped at $200, with a lifetime cap of $500. It could only be applied to improvements on the taxpayer's main home. Another credit, Section 25D, was for energy-efficient property like photovoltaic and solar water-heating properties, with a 30% credit on expenditures subject to annual limits. The credits for photovoltaic and solar water-heating properties were up to $2,000 per year, while fuel cells were up to $500 per year. Section 25C expired in 2007, but Section 25D was extended to 2008. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 extended the Section 25D credit for solar energy property through 2008. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 reinstated and modified the Section 25C credit for 2009, adding biomass fuel stoves and removing geothermal heat pumps. The Section 25D tax credit was extended through 2016, with the $2,000 annual credit limit for solar-electric property expenditures eliminated. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 extended the Section 25D tax credit for solar energy property through 2016, eliminating the $2,000 annual credit limit. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 further expanded the tax credits to include small wind-energy and geothermal heat pump properties, with specific caps on the credit amounts. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended and modified tax credits for energy-efficiency improvements and energy property. The credit was increased to 30% of qualified expenditures, with an aggregate cap of $1,500 for 2009 and 2010. The efficiency standards were reduced, expanding the availability of the credit to additional products. In 2010, taxpayers could claim up to $1,500 in tax credits for qualified windows under ARRA. The Section 25D tax credit was changed, removing maximum credit caps for most technologies. The number and total amount of credits claimed increased. The 2010 Tax Act extended the Section 25C credit through 2011. The 2010 Tax Act extended the Section 25C credit through 2011, reinstating the general lifetime limit and window lifetime limit. The American Taxpayer Relief Act extended the credit for two more years, and the Tax Increase Prevention Act also made changes to tax credits. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) extended the Section 25C credit for 2012 and 2013, while the Tax Increase Prevention Act (TIPA) extended it for 2014. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act (PATH Act) extended and modified the 25C credit for 2015 and 2016, with stricter Energy Star 6.0 standards for windows and doors starting in 2016. Division P of PATH Act extended the 25D credit for solar technologies through 2021. The Energy Star 6.0 standards for windows and doors will be more stringent starting in 2016. The 25D credit for solar technologies has been extended through 2021, with a modified formula. The credit for solar technologies will be 30% of qualifying expenditures from 2017 to 2019, 26% in 2020, and 22% in 2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25C credit retroactively for 2017 and extended the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies through 2021. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 extended the 25D credit for nonsolar technologies through 2021, harmonizing the credit formula with solar technologies. The credit rates for nonsolar technologies are now 30% for property placed in service before 2019, decreasing to 26% in 2020 and 22% in 2021."
