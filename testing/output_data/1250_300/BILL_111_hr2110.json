    "content": "The Act titled \"Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Fairness and Simplification Act\" limits state withholding and taxation of employee income. The \"Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Fairness and Simplification Act\" restricts state income tax withholding and reporting for employees working in multiple states. Income earned is only subject to taxation in the state of residence and the state where the employee works for more than 30 days in a calendar year. Employers can rely on employees' estimates of time spent working in different states for tax purposes. Employers can rely on employees' estimates of time spent working in different states for tax purposes, unless there is fraud or collusion to evade tax. If an employer maintains records of an employee's location for business purposes, it does not override the employee's estimate. However, if the employer has a time and attendance system tracking where the employee works daily, that data takes precedence over the employee's estimate. The time and attendance system data takes precedence over employee's determination for location of work. Definitions and rules for determining employee presence and duties within a state are outlined. Transit time does not count towards determining location of work. The term \"employee\" is defined by the State where duties are performed, excluding professional athletes, entertainers, and certain public figures. A professional athlete is someone paid for services in a professional athletic event, while a professional entertainer is paid for services in the performing arts on a per-event basis. Transit time does not count towards determining an employee's location of work. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"certain public figures\" as individuals of prominence who are paid for services at a discrete event. It also defines \"employer\" and \"State\" while explaining the term \"time and attendance system\" as a system for recording work location in real-time. The curr_chunk defines \"time and attendance system\" as a system for recording work location outside the state where duties are primarily performed, used to allocate wages across taxing jurisdictions. The Act will be effective on January 1, 2011."
