    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pre-K for USA Act.\" Congress finds that the United States ranks 25th in early learning enrollment, with studies showing that access to high-quality prekindergarten programs leads to academic success and reduces the likelihood of negative outcomes such as drug problems and incarceration. Additionally, every public dollar spent on prekindergarten programs yields a $7 return through reduced spending on other services. Despite these benefits, about 40 percent of school districts do not offer prekindergarten programs. Texas missed out on up to $118.48 million in Federal funding to expand prekindergarten programs, as the state legislature cut approximately $5.4 billion in education funding in 2011. In response, certain local governments funded full-day prekindergarten programs, highlighting the need for direct application prekindergarten Federal program funding for localities. SEC. 3. PREKINDERGARTEN DEVELOPMENT GRANTS. The Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will award competitive grants to increase capacity for high-quality prekindergarten programs. Grants will be awarded for up to 3 years and applications must be submitted by Governors or chief executive officers of eligible entities. States must consult with the State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care when developing their grant applications. To be eligible for a grant under this Act, a State must consult with the State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care and provide non-Federal matching funds equal to at least 20% of the grant amount. The matching funds can come from State funding, local funding, philanthropy, or in-kind contributions. The Secretary may waive the matching requirement in cases of financial hardship. The Secretary may waive or reduce matching funds for entities facing financial hardship when applying for a grant. Grant recipients can use funds to award subgrants to eligible local entities for grant activities. The subtitle allows grant funds to be used for subgrants to local entities for grant activities. Subgrantees must comply with Act requirements. The Secretary cannot award a subgrant if the State or entity already received funding for the program in that fiscal year. Authorization of appropriations is set at $750,000,000 for fiscal year 2016 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2017 through 2025. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"eligible local entity\" refers to a local educational agency, early childhood education program provider, or a consortium of these entities. The term \"full-day\" means a day equivalent to a full school day in the state and not less than 5 hours. \"High-quality prekindergarten program\" is a program supported by an eligible local entity.
