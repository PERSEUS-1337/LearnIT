    "content": "The Motor Donor Act, also known as the National Organ Donor Registry, amends the Public Health Service Act to establish a National Organ Donor Registry. The subpart aims to increase organ and tissue donor registrations, improve information on donation, ensure accurate information on individual wishes, and provide grants for state donor registries through driver's license applications. The term \"motor vehicle driver's license\" refers to any ID issued by a state motor vehicle authority. The subpart establishes a national organ and tissue donor registry called the Registry, consisting of individual information like name, address, date of birth, and a unique identification number. The Secretary will coordinate with states and organ procurement organizations to facilitate donor registrations. During the initial 2-year period after the Motor Donor Act's enactment, the Secretary will coordinate with states to share data from organ and tissue donor registries. In the following 4 years, efforts will be made to establish registries through the driver's license process. The Secretary will also work with organ procurement organizations to facilitate donor registrations. The Motor Donor Act mandates the Secretary to provide organ procurement organizations with access to the Registry 24/7. Additionally, within 3 years of enactment, the Secretary must distribute a pamphlet to US citizens with information on organ and tissue donations and a website for registry participation. The Motor Donor Act requires the Secretary to provide organ procurement organizations with 24/7 access to the Registry. Within 4 months of registering on the website, individuals will be notified of their participation. Participation in the Registry does not impact organ or tissue allocation and serves as an intent registry only, not legally binding consent. The Motor Donor Act establishes a registry for individuals to indicate their intent to be organ or tissue donors. Participation in the Registry is not legally binding consent for donation, except as required by State law. Individuals can cancel their participation at any time, and the Secretary will promptly remove their information from the Registry. States can receive grants to implement State registries linked to the motor vehicle driver's license application process. Each State seeking a grant for a registry linked to driver's license applications must submit an application demonstrating procedures for organ donation consent. The application must include assurances of legally binding donation procedures. Each State applying for a grant for a registry linked to driver's licenses must ensure that their procedures for organ donation consent comply with specific requirements. This includes providing individuals with the option to designate their intent to be an organ and tissue donor on their driver's license application. The State procedures for organ donation consent must include a question on the application asking if the individual wishes to have their organ donor designation on their driver's license. Only those who answer affirmatively will have their preference noted in the State registry or on their driver's license. The State will forward the names of individuals to the Registry. The State procedures require individuals to indicate if they want their organ donor designation on their driver's license. Names of those who agree will be forwarded to the Registry within 100 days, while those who decline will not be included. The State procedures involve individuals indicating their organ donor designation on their driver's license. Information of those who agree will be sent to the Registry, while those who decline will not be included. Additionally, organ procurement organizations have 24-hour access to donor information without any fees. States collaborating with organ procurement organizations receive priority in grant awards. The Secretary gives priority in grant awards to States collaborating with organ procurement organizations. Grants awarded under this subsection cannot exceed $300,000. An advisory task force on organ and tissue donation, consisting of 5 members appointed by the Secretary based on their experience in organ donation, procurement, or transplants, is established. The Task Force members are appointed based on their experience with organ or tissue donations, procurement, or transplants. At least one member must be a physician with transplant experience, and another must have organ procurement experience. Each member serves a 3-year term, with staggered terms for initial members. The Task Force members are appointed based on their experience with organ or tissue donations, procurement, or transplants. Two initial members' terms expire after 2 years. Vacancies do not affect the Task Force's powers and are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. The Task Force partners with the Coalition on Donation for a national awareness campaign and submits a report with recommendations to the Secretary within 1 year of the Motor Donor Act enactment. The Task Force, appointed based on experience with organ or tissue donations, conducts a study and submits a report with recommendations to the Secretary within 1 year of the Motor Donor Act enactment. Task Force members do not receive compensation but are allowed travel expenses for their services. The Task Force, appointed based on experience with organ or tissue donations, conducts a study and submits a report with recommendations to the Secretary within 1 year of the Motor Donor Act enactment. Task Force members may provide voluntary and uncompensated services, and government employees can be detailed without reimbursement. The Department of Health and Human Services will provide administrative support, and the Task Force is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Authorization of Appropriations for the Task Force includes necessary funding for registry, grants, and an awareness campaign from 2002 to 2006, with funds remaining available until expended. \"Subpart 2--Organ Procurement\" is an amendment of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 6103(m) of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to allow disclosure of taxpayer information to the Department of Health and Human Services for the organ donor program. The information can only be used for contacting individuals regarding the national organ and tissue donor registry. SEC. 4. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS. Subpart 2 of part H of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended in sections 374(a), 374(d), 375(1), and 378, by replacing \"this part\" with \"this subpart\"."
