    "content": "The Act titled \"Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1997\" is aimed at addressing the purposes outlined in Section 2. The Act aims to establish early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks for hearing loss in babies, ensuring screening before leaving hospitals, within 3 months for non-hospital births, timely diagnostic testing, and linkage to intervention services. Public policy in early hearing detection, diagnosis, and intervention should be research-based and consider the unique language and communication needs of deaf or hard-of-hearing infants, toddlers, and children. Collaboration with relevant public and private sectors is essential for effective implementation. STATEWIDE EARLY DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND INTERVENTION NETWORKS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to develop statewide networks for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for newborn hearing loss. This includes developing state capacity, monitoring hearing detection in birthing hospitals, developing models for effective screening and referral, and collecting data for research and policy development. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide grants for technical assistance to State agencies for infant hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. This includes data collection, standardized procedures, cost-effectiveness studies, identifying causes of hearing loss, and assessing program effectiveness. The National Institutes of Health will conduct research on new screening techniques and technology for early hearing detection, diagnosis, and intervention programs. This includes clinical trials, efficacy studies, and basic research to improve preventive interventions for hearing loss. Sharing data with State-based monitoring programs aims to identify unknown causes of hearing loss. SEC. 5. COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION. In carrying out programs under this Act, the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health shall collaborate with various agencies, organizations, and professionals to serve deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals and their families. The Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health will collaborate on policy recommendations for early hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. They will also assist States in establishing early detection networks and developing data collection systems. Authorization of Appropriations:\n- $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary sums for 2001-2003 for Statewide Early Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Networks.\n- $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary sums for 2001-2003 for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n- $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary sums for 2001-2003 for National Institutes of Health."
