    "content": "Severe wildfires have been burning more structures and area due to unnaturally high accumulations of biomass. Congress is urged to provide more funding and authority for activities like prescribed burning and thinning to reduce biomass fuels and wildfire severity. Current federal authorities for fuel reduction are broad but lack sufficient reporting on funding and progress. Improved reporting on funding and accomplishments for fuel reduction activities is necessary for Congress to assess progress in reducing biomass fuels and wildfire severity. Distinguishing data on funding and results by ecosystem or fire regime can help in understanding the benefits and costs of these activities. All biomass is potential fuel for wildfires, and better reporting on funding and results disaggregated by ecosystem can aid Congress in allocating appropriate funding among activities and agencies. In temperate ecosystems, wildfires are inevitable due to dry conditions and ignitions. Wildfires can be low-intensity surface fires or high-intensity crown fires, depending on fuel characteristics and weather conditions. Fire protection efforts focus on altering fuel characteristics to prevent or minimize damages caused by crown fires. Four characteristics of biomass fuels significantly affect wildfire behavior: moisture content, size, distribution, and quantity. Moisture content is crucial in controlling flammability. The moisture content of fuels is a key factor in controlling flammability during wildfires. Green foliage and dead biomass have varying moisture levels, with higher moisture content requiring more heat to burn. Fuels with up to 20%-30% moisture can be ignited, while 100% moisture content can still burn in high winds. Fine fuels dry out quickly, with needles, leaves, and grass becoming potential wildfire fuels within hours. The smallest diameter fuels, known as fine fuels or flash fuels, dry out quickly and are the most important for spreading fires due to their ability to ignite and burn rapidly. The 1-hour time lag fuels, such as needles and leaves, contribute little to fire intensity and damage. The 10-hour time lag fuels, like woody twigs and branches, also ignite quickly and can be carried by winds to start new fires ahead of the current one. Fuel distribution plays a crucial role in the rate of spread of fires. Compactness of fuels affects their resistance to burning, with highly compact fuel beds being more resistant. Continuity of fuels also impacts fire spread, as a continuous distribution allows for more air flow, drying out the fuels and feeding the fire until the continuity is broken. Fuel distribution and continuity are crucial factors in fire spread. Less compaction allows for more air flow, drying out fuels and feeding the fire until continuity is broken. Firelines are used to control wildfires by breaking the continuity of fuels. Factors like fuel size, moisture content, slope, and wind speed determine the width of the break needed. Steep slopes and high winds can make fuels more flammable by reducing moisture content and raising temperatures. Vertical continuity, such as \"fuel ladders,\" can spread fires into the canopy, turning a surface fire into a crown fire. Fuel ladders play a crucial role in spreading fires into the canopy, turning a surface fire into a crown fire. They provide continuous fuels between the ground and the canopy, pre-heating the green foliage and increasing fire intensity. Fuel loads vary widely and include dead biomass, undergrowth, and undesirable trees. Fuel loads can vary widely, ranging from less than 1 ton to over 200 tons per acre, including dead biomass, undergrowth, and undesirable trees. Live crown biomass plays a significant role in sustaining crown fires. Not all fuel is consumed in a wildfire, with larger fuels being less likely to be fully consumed. The nature of fuel characteristics and resulting fires is influenced by different ecosystems. Some ecosystems are adapted to low-intensity surface fires, while others are adapted to high-intensity crown fires. Some have a mixed regime of both. Many ecosystems in the US are adapted to frequent wildfires, characterized by fine fuels like grasses and needles. Forested frequent-fire ecosystems have fire-resistant trees with open spaces due to frequent fires killing seedlings and shrubs. Examples include ponderosa pine. Surface-fire ecosystems in the US account for about 34% of wildlands and historically consisted of grasses, needles, and small shrubs. Grazing and logging practices in the late 1800s reduced grass cover, allowing fuel loads of branches and small trees to increase. Effective fire suppression also contributed to fuel loads by eliminating low-intensity fires. Surface-fire ecosystems in the US have higher fuel loads than historically natural due to logging practices and fire suppression. This has led to an increased risk of catastrophic crown fires. Activities that reduce fuel loads have been shown to decrease wildfire severity. On the other hand, ecosystems adapted to periodic, high-intensity crown fires have dense, uniform fuels and frequent fires. Crown-fire ecosystems, like chaparral and lodgepole pine forests, have dense, uniform fuels and infrequent, high-intensity fires. These ecosystems account for 42% of wildlands in the US and are not significantly impacted by human activities like logging or fire suppression. The ineffectiveness of fuel treatment in crown-fire ecosystems like chaparral and lodgepole pine forests is noted, as large fires are not dependent on old age classes of fuels. Catastrophic crown fires do not completely destroy all vegetation and typically leave some areas lightly burned or unburned due to minor localized variations in moisture and fuel characteristics. For example, in the Yellowstone fires of 1988, 30% of the reported burned area was actually unburned, and another 15%-20% had only low-intensity surface burns. The Yellowstone fires in 1988, largely in lodgepole pine forests, had areas that were lightly burned or unburned. About half of the reported acres burned were severely burned, with the rest having low-intensity surface fires. Some ecosystems, like whitebark pine, have mixed-fire regimes with both crown fires and low-intensity surface fires. Whitebark pines survive mixed-intensity fires and are spread by Clark's nutcrackers. Mixed-fire-regime ecosystems, such as those with true firs and spruces, rely on sporadic fires to allow for germination and growth. Clark's nutcrackers play a crucial role in spreading seeds, particularly for whitebark pines in severely burned areas. Other species, like ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine, can also exhibit mixed-fire types under certain conditions. However, the consequences of fuel reduction activities in these ecosystems are not well understood, raising questions about the natural levels and distributions of fuels. Fuel reduction activities in mixed-fire-regime ecosystems are not well understood, leading to uncertainty about the levels and distributions of fuels. It is unclear if these ecosystems may experience abnormal crown fires, and if fuel reduction would significantly alter wildfire extent or severity. While reducing fuel loads may help suppress wildfires in some ecosystems, it may not be suitable for all. Additionally, reducing fuel loads may not necessarily protect structures and communities from wildfires, as seen in the Hayman Fire where 132 homes were burned despite efforts to reduce the risk of crown fires. Reducing fuel loads and eliminating fuel ladders may be necessary for the safe use of low-intensity wildfire and prescribed fire in surface-fire ecosystems, as seen in the Hayman Fire where 132 homes were burned despite efforts to reduce the risk of crown fires. Reducing fuel loads and eliminating fuel ladders are necessary for the safe use of low-intensity wildfire and prescribed fire in surface-fire ecosystems. Proposed activities include prescribed burning and thinning, which can increase surface fire intensity and the risk of crown fires. Prescribed burning is the deliberate use of fire in specific areas within prescribed fuel and weather conditions. It can increase surface fire intensity and the likelihood of crown fires. Conditions such as wind speed can cause prescribed fires to escape control and result in extensive damage. Wildland fire use is another term used for naturally occurring fires that are allowed to burn within acceptable areas and conditions. Prescribed burning eliminates fine and small fuels through burning, but has limitations in reducing large diameter fuels and controlling tree density. It can be risky, leading to escaped fires and high implementation costs. Prescribed burning can be risky, leading to escaped fires and high implementation costs. Federal land management agencies allow fire managers to use naturally-occurring fires for fire management objectives, known as wildland fire use. This practice involves monitoring wildfires without aggressive suppression efforts. Wildland fire use, also known as \"let-burn\" or prescribed natural fire, involves monitoring wildfires without aggressive suppression efforts. Thinning is the mechanical cutting and removing of trees in a stand, which can be commercial or precommercial depending on tree size. Thinning alters biomass fuels through low thinning, crown thinning, or selection thinning approaches. Thinning is a method of removing trees from a stand to reduce fuel levels. It can be done through low thinning, crown thinning, or selection thinning. Thinning offers advantages over prescribed burning as it allows for controlled removal of trees, reduces crown density, and targets specific fuel components like ladder fuels. Thinning can effectively reduce the risk of crown fires by eliminating vertical fuel continuity. Thinning of small trees and shrubs can reduce vertical fuel continuity and target ladder fuels. However, it leaves slash on the ground, increasing short-term fuel load. Mechanical treatments are costly, and not all thinning aims to reduce biomass fuels; some thinning is done to promote growth of desired commercial trees. This can increase fire hazards in the short run. Thinning is used to increase biomass growth of desired commercial trees by concentrating growth on fewer stems. It can leave slash on the ground, increasing fire hazards in the short run. Thinning may not provide effective wildfire protection in crown-fire ecosystems but can reduce the likelihood of catastrophic crown fires in surface-fire and mixed-fire regime ecosystems when combined with prescribed burning. However, the effectiveness of this combined approach is limited and costly. Other activities like logging are sometimes suggested to reduce fuel loads. Commercial logging, particularly salvage logging of dead trees, is sometimes proposed to reduce fuel loads. However, it focuses on large diameter trees and does not address crown base height, which contributes significantly to the \"ladder effect\" in wildfire behavior. The effectiveness of commercial logging in reducing canopy fires is untested in scientific literature. Salvage of standing dead trees may reduce fuels, but some argue that they contribute less to the intensity and spread of crown fires compared to live trees. Salvage of standing dead trees and pruning can alter fuels for wildfire protection. Pruning focuses on removing lower tree branches to reduce crown density. Five federal agencies are responsible for wildfire protection on federal lands, but none are explicitly authorized to reduce biomass fuels. Each agency is implicitly authorized to reduce fuels within its mandate to preserve and protect the lands. Since 1897, federal agencies like the Forest Service, National Park Service, and Bureau of Land Management have been directed to protect lands from destruction by fire and preserve natural resources. None of these agencies are explicitly authorized to reduce biomass fuels, but they are implicitly authorized to do so for wildfire protection within their jurisdiction. The federal agencies have been directed to protect lands and preserve natural resources since 1897. While not explicitly authorized to reduce biomass fuels, they are implicitly authorized to do so for wildfire protection within their jurisdiction. The management direction for the agencies includes conservation, management, and restoration of fish, wildlife, and plant resources for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans. Indian forest land management activities involve forest land development, protection against losses from wildfire, and specific funding programs for biomass fuel reduction activities. The Forest Service has funding programs for biomass fuel reduction activities, primarily through the Hazardous Fuels sub-account. This funding can be used for prescribed burning and thinning. The funding for prescribed burning rose substantially from FY2001 to FY2009. The specific allocation of funds for prescribed burning versus other activities and the ecosystems where these activities occur are not reported. Hazardous Fuels funding increased significantly from FY2001 to FY2009, with a spike in FY2009 due to economic stimulus legislation. Thinning activities, including fuel reduction and other purposes like timber production, are funded within the Vegetation and Watershed Management account. This account also covers reforestation, rangeland improvements, watershed protection, noxious weed control, and air quality management. The portion of funding used for thinning varies annually, and the specific allocation for wildfire protection is unknown. The Forest Service has three mandatory spending accounts that provide funds for various activities. The Forest Service has three mandatory spending accounts that provide funds for activities to reduce biomass fuels, including Brush Disposal (BD) and Knutson-Vandenberg (K-V) Fund. These accounts collect deposits from timber purchasers for activities like slash treatments following thinning operations and reforestation. The primary purpose of slash treatment is to reduce fire hazards. The Forest Service has three mandatory spending accounts for activities to reduce biomass fuels, including the Knutson-Vandenberg (K-V) Fund. This fund collects deposits from timber purchasers for reforestation and forest improvement following logging operations. Funds can be used for activities like thinning for fuel reduction, but specific funding allocations for wildfire protection are unknown. The DOI agencies receive appropriations for fuel reduction activities, with the majority of funding coming from the Hazardous Fuels sub-account. Funding for prescribed burning is included in this account, but specific details on the amount used for this purpose and the ecosystems treated are not reported. Wildland Fire Management funding has transitioned to a department-wide program, with funding levels remaining relatively stable since FY2001. Other fuel reduction activities, such as thinning, are funded through general land and resource management accounts for each agency within DOI. These funds can be used for various activities to reduce fuel loads and improve wildfire protection. Funding for fuel reduction activities within DOI agencies comes from various accounts, such as Land Resources for BLM, Park Protection and Resource Stewardship for NPS, and Resource Management for FWS. These funds can be used for activities that reduce wildfire threats by reducing fuel loads. The BIA and BLM have funding accounts that can be used for activities to reduce wildfire threats on Indian lands, including fuel reduction. The portion of funds used for these activities is unknown. The FS has assistance programs for fuel reduction, but federal authorities for assisting fuel reduction on nonfederal lands are indirect. Other agencies do not have financial and technical assistance programs for state or local governments or private landowners for fuel reduction. The FS has two wildfire protection assistance programs for fuel reduction on nonfederal lands. State Fire Assistance provides technical and financial aid for fire prevention and prescribed burning. Volunteer Fire Assistance offers assistance to rural volunteer fire departments for fire protection activities. The Fire Service (FS) offers assistance to rural volunteer fire departments for fire protection activities, including fuel reduction and prescribed burning. Eligibility is limited to departments serving communities of up to 10,000 people with at least 80% volunteer firefighting personnel. The program aims to expand outreach, education, and establish defensible space around private properties. No funds have been allocated yet, but State Fire Assistance funding could be used for implementation. The FS offers assistance to rural volunteer fire departments for fire protection activities, including fuel reduction and prescribed burning. No funds have been allocated for this program yet, but State Fire Assistance funding could be used. Other FS programs provide financial and technical assistance for forest stewardship, forest health protection, and emergency restoration. The portion of funds that might contribute to wildfire protection through biomass fuel reduction is unknown."
