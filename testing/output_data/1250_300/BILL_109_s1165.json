    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act of 2005\". Congress finds that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge to promote the recovery of 4 species of endangered Hawaiian waterbirds. They lease approximately 240 acres of wetland habitat and have entered into a contract to purchase more land for habitat protection and Refuge management. Additionally, they have identified 800 acres of wildlife habitat adjacent to the Refuge owned by the estate of James Campbell. The estate of James Campbell owns approximately 800 acres of high-value wildlife habitat adjacent to the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge on the Kahuku Coast. This land features coastal dunes, wetlands, and strand that support a variety of threatened and endangered species, including Hawaiian waterbirds, migratory shorebirds, waterfowl, seabirds, native plant species, monk seals, and green sea turtles. Expanding the Refuge will provide more opportunities for wildlife-dependent public uses like observation, photography, and environmental education. Acquisition of this land will create a larger and more manageable habitat for conservation efforts. Acquisition of the land adjacent to the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge in Kahuku is necessary to create a larger, ecologically-intact unit for wildlife conservation. This expansion will provide more opportunities for wildlife observation, photography, and environmental education while also reducing flood damage to the town of Kahuku. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
