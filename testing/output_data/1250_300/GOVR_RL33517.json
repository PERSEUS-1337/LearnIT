    "content": "Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the President can propose rescinding funding from an appropriations act by sending a special message to Congress. If Congress does not approve the rescission within 45 days, the funding must be made available for executive agencies. President George W. Bush advocated for a line-item veto to address excessive earmark projects, leading to the introduction of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006. This act required at least one house of Congress to vote on presidential rescission proposals. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 (LLIVA) was transmitted to Congress on March 6, 2006. It introduced \"expedited rescission,\" requiring at least one house to vote on presidential rescission proposals. In contrast to the previous \"enhanced rescission\" framework, LLIVA focuses on procedural changes in Congress to ensure prompt approval of the President's rescission requests. The expedited rescission approach in Congress focuses on procedural changes to ensure prompt approval of the President's rescission requests. It requires congressional approval to rescind funding but encourages an up-or-down vote on the President's proposal. This approach is seen as transferring less power from Congress to the President compared to other methods. In the past, the House has passed expedited rescission bills, such as H.R. 2164 in the 102nd Congress, which allowed the President to propose rescissions within three days of signing an appropriations act. The bill included expedited procedures to prompt a floor vote within 10 days. The expedited rescission approach in Congress focuses on procedural changes to ensure prompt approval of the President's rescission requests. In the 103rd Congress, H.R. 1578 allowed the President to request rescission of 100% of a program's funding, with expedited procedures for floor votes and judicial review. H.R. 4600 in 1994 strengthened expedited rescission by allowing submission of a special rescission message at any time. In the 103rd Congress, H.R. 4600 passed the House in 1994 with strengthened expedited rescission procedures. It allowed submission of special rescission messages at any time and proposed the repeal of targeted tax benefits within 20 days. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006, introduced as H.R. 4890 and S. 2381, aimed to further amend the ICA framework for rescission authority. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006, introduced as H.R. 4890 and S. 2381, proposed to amend the ICA framework by granting the President the authority to propose rescission of discretionary budget authority, direct spending items, or targeted tax benefits through special messages to Congress. The President would have flexibility in submitting these messages, with no time constraints and the ability to include multiple rescissions in a single message. Any amounts rescinded must be used for deficit reduction. The LLIVA allows the President to propose rescissions of budget authority or direct spending items through special messages to Congress. Rescinded amounts must be used for deficit reduction. The bill outlines fast-track procedures for considering the President's proposed rescissions, including a timeline for introduction, committee review, and final passage. The LLIVA bill outlines expedited procedures for considering the President's proposed rescissions of budget authority or direct spending items. It allows the President to withhold funds proposed for rescission or suspend the execution of direct spending for up to 180 days, with the option to release the funds before the expiration of the 180 days. The bill also sets a timeline for final passage and limits debate time in both the House and Senate. Amendments to the approval bill are not allowed in either chamber. The LLIVA bill allows the President to withhold funds proposed for rescission or suspend direct spending for up to 180 days, with the option to release the funds before the expiration of the 180 days. Supporters argue it provides temporary withholding until Congress can act, while critics see it as potentially enabling policy deferrals. The LLIVA bill allows the President to withhold funds for up to 180 days, with the option to release them earlier if deemed necessary. Supporters argue it provides temporary withholding until Congress can act, while critics view it as potentially enabling policy deferrals. Critics also raise concerns about the bill not prohibiting the President from initiating multiple 180-day withholding periods. The provisions are seen as possibly sanctioning the return of policy deferrals invalidated by previous court decisions. The bill's language allows for early release of funds if the President determines it is necessary, but does not require it even if one chamber rejects the approval bill. The provisions in the LLIVA are stated to be severable for judicial review, meaning that if a portion is found unconstitutional, the rest remains in force. The LLIVA bill, H.R. 4890 / S. 2381, includes provisions that are severable for judicial review, meaning if a portion is deemed unconstitutional, the rest remains in force. It would become effective upon signing and only apply to spending or tax provisions in bills enacted after its passage. Other measures with expedited rescission provisions have been introduced in the 109th Congress, including H.R. 2290, which allows the President to propose rescissions of wasteful budget authority. The President could propose to reduce discretionary spending limits under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Representative Mark Udall introduced the SLICE Act of 2006 to enable Congress to debate and vote on spending reduction proposals. The SLICE Act of 2006, also known as the \"Stimulating Leadership in Cutting Expenditures Act,\" allows the President to propose spending reductions for Congress to debate and vote on. Senator John Kerry introduced a similar bill, the Expedited Budget Item Veto Review Act of 2006, which would give the President the authority to cancel discretionary budget authority, new direct spending items, and limited tax benefits. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 allowed the President to propose cancellations for discretionary budget authority, new direct spending items, and limited tax benefits. The President would submit a special message proposing cancellations within three days of enactment, with expedited procedures for a vote within 10 legislative days. Representative John Spratt introduced H.R. 5667 in 2006, which included a legislative line item veto provision similar to previous bills in the House. H.R. 5667, introduced in 2006, includes a legislative line item veto allowing the President to propose cancellations of discretionary spending and limited tax provisions. The bill also allows for expedited congressional consideration of the President's proposals, with limited opportunities for amendments. The House Budget Committee and Rules Committee both approved the bill, which was later passed by the House. The House approved H.R. 4890, as amended, by a vote of 247-172. Meanwhile, Senator Judd Gregg introduced the Stop Over Spending Act, which includes a modified version of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act. The Senate Budget Committee voted 12-10 to report the bill favorably. Table 1 provides a comparative overview of major features in three expedited rescission bills. The House approved H.R. 4890 with modifications, while Senator Judd Gregg introduced the Stop Over Spending Act containing a revised version of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act. The Senate Budget Committee also voted to report the bill favorably. Noteworthy differences among the versions include deadlines for submission of special rescission messages and limits on the number of messages allowed. The House-passed version of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act allows for more special messages than the Senate bill, but the Senate bill is more lenient in the timing of message submissions. The House version allows the President to withhold funds for up to 90 days, while the Senate bill limits withholding to 45 days with a possible 45-day extension. The House version includes a sunset termination date after six years, while the Senate bill does not specify a termination date. The House-passed version of the Legislative Line Item Veto Act allows for more special messages than the Senate bill, with a 90-day withholding period. The House version includes a sunset termination date after six years, while the Senate bill does not specify a termination date. Both versions narrow the range of targeted tax benefits that can be canceled compared to the Administration's proposal. The Senate Budget Committee version and the 1996 act would require identification of targeted tax benefits, with differences in the House-passed version. The House version also addresses the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The current bills aim to expedite rescissions, raising questions about their impact. H.R 4890/ S. 2381 and S. 3521 would amend Title X of the ICA by replacing Part C with new text. The bills aim to expedite rescissions, potentially affecting the President's authority to propose rescissions. A manager's amendment clarified that cancelled amounts from trust funds would return to the original fund. Most changes in H.R. 4890 occurred during committee markups, while S. 3521 had a manager's amendment offered by Senator Gregg. The changes in H.R. 4890 and S. 3521 focus on expediting rescissions and altering the President's authority. A manager's amendment in S. 3521 addresses resubmission of rejected items and proposes a reduction in the President's suspension period for new spending. The provisions for expedited rescission remain consistent over the years. The provisions for expedited rescission of funds in S.3521 remain consistent over the years, with bills in the 109th Congress seeking a vote on the approval bill within 10 days. Earlier bills included discretionary budget authority, entitlements, and targeted tax benefits, while H.R. 4699 in the 109th Congress would add certain transportation projects. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 allowed for the rescission of discretionary budget authority and direct spending items. The LLIVA in the 109th Congress expanded the President's power to cancel any amount of discretionary budget authority or new direct spending items. Some supporters of the LLIVA acknowledged possible constitutional issues, but the expedited rescission approach was generally seen as constitutionally sound, with a severability provision to protect the rest of the act if one part was deemed unconstitutional. The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 allowed for the rescission of discretionary budget authority and direct spending items. The LLIVA in the 109th Congress expanded the President's power to cancel any amount of discretionary budget authority or new direct spending items. The severability provision in the LLIVA protects the act if one part is found unconstitutional. The Bush Administration supported the LLIVA and sought its enactment in the 109th Congress, with the President calling for quick passage to target pork in large spending bills. The President supported the Line Item Veto Act to target pork in large spending bills and enhance fiscal discipline."
