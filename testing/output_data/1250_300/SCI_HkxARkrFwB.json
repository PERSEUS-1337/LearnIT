    "content": "Deep learning NLP models use word embeddings like word2vec or GloVe to represent words as continuous vectors, enabling easier integration with neural layers. Storing and accessing embedding vectors for all words requires a large amount of space. Two efficient methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, reduce the space needed to store embeddings by a hundred-fold or more without sacrificing accuracy in NLP tasks. Modern deep learning NLP models use word embeddings like word2vec or GloVe to convert human language into continuous vectors for neural network processing. These embeddings capture semantic relationships between words and reduce the width of neural network layers. Storing the embedding matrix in GPU memory is necessary for efficient training and inference. The d \u00d7 p embedding matrix in deep learning NLP models reduces the width of neural network layers. Storing this matrix in GPU memory is essential for efficient training and inference. The dimensionality of embeddings ranges from p = 300 to p = 1024, with vocabulary sizes reaching d = 10^5 or 10^6. In classical computing, information is stored in bits, while in quantum computing, qubits are fully described by complex unit-norm vectors. The quantum register in quantum computing corresponds to a vector in C 2n, where qubits need to be interconnected for exponential dimensionality of the state space. Entanglement is a purely quantum phenomenon where states of qubits become interconnected. In classical computing, bits are always independent, but quantum registers can be approximated classically by storing vectors of size m using O(log m) space. This approximation does not significantly impact NLP machine learning algorithms that use high-dimensional word embedding matrices. The paper introduces two methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, for efficient storage of word embedding matrices in NLP machine learning algorithms. These methods offer high space saving rates with minimal impact on model accuracy. The tensor product space of separable Hilbert spaces V and W is defined, showing properties of addition and multiplication. The tensor product space V \u2297 W is a separable Hilbert space H constructed using ordered pairs v \u2297 w, where v \u2208 V and w \u2208 W. Addition and multiplication in H have specific properties, with inner product defined as a product of individual inner products. The space is a collection of equivalence classes of pairs v \u2297 w, with vectors often referred to as tensors. An orthonormal basis in V \u2297 W can be formed using basis sets from V and W, with coefficients indexed by pairs and numerically equal to products of corresponding coefficients. Dimensionality of V \u2297 W is the product of the dimensions of V and W. The tensor product space V \u2297 W forms an orthonormal basis with coefficients indexed by pairs and dimensionality equal to the product of V and W dimensions. Tensor product spaces can be created by multiple applications of tensor product, with arbitrary bracketing. In Dirac notation, vectors are represented as kets. The tensor product space has properties like bilinearity and linearity. Expressing v \u2297 w + v \u2297 w as \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8 for some \u03c6 \u2208 V, \u03c8 \u2208 W is not always possible. The tensor product space V \u2297 W is formed by pairs of coefficients with dimensionality equal to the product of V and W dimensions. While some vectors in the tensor product space can be expressed as \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8, others, like entangled tensors, cannot be decomposed in this way. The maximum rank of a tensor in a tensor product space of order higher than two is unknown. A p-dimensional word embedding model maps word identifiers into a p-dimensional real Hilbert space. The curr_chunk discusses the representation of word embeddings using entangled tensors in a word2ket model. It proposes using a tensor of rank r and order n to represent embeddings, with a dimension of p = qn. The space complexity is O(rq log q log p), and it is recommended to use q \u2265 4 to avoid loss of information. The curr_chunk explains the computational efficiency of inner product calculations between word embeddings in a word2ket model. It highlights the time complexity of O(rq log q log p) and the space requirement of O(bp + rq log q log p) for processing embedding vectors in neural networks. Additionally, it mentions the reconstruction of word embeddings from tensors and the organization of tensor product spaces into a balanced tree for parallel processing. The curr_chunk discusses the reconstruction of word embeddings from tensors using a balanced tensor product tree for efficient parallel processing. It also mentions the use of gradient descent for training word embeddings and the potential challenges with high Lipschitz constant of the gradient. The curr_chunk discusses the use of LayerNorm in a balanced tensor product tree to address the high Lipschitz constant of the gradient in word embedding training. Linear operators A and B are defined, and the tensor product of linear operators is explained. This involves representing linear operators as matrices and viewing a word embedding model as a linear operator mapping one-hot vectors. The curr_chunk explains the representation of linear operators as matrices in word embedding models. It discusses the matrix representation of the linear operator F and the efficiency of tensor product-based exponential compression. The resulting matrix F has dimensions p \u00d7 d and takes O (rq log qt log t log p log d) space. The curr_chunk discusses the efficiency of tensor product-based exponential compression in word embedding models, utilizing lazy tensors to save space. The proposed space-efficient word embeddings were evaluated in three NLP tasks: text summarization, language translation, and question answering. The proposed space-efficient word embeddings were tested in text summarization, language translation, and question answering tasks. The experiments used a specific dataset, encoder-decoder architecture, and evaluation metrics like Rouge scores. The experiments tested space-efficient word embeddings in text summarization and language translation tasks. The results showed a significant reduction in trainable parameters with minimal drop in Rouge scores. The focus was on word2ketXS for further evaluation in NLP tasks. In German-English machine translation, the same model as in text summarization task was used, with BLEU score as the evaluation metric. In German-English machine translation, the study used the IWSLT2014 dataset of TED and TEDx talks, employing a sequence-to-sequence model similar to the one used in text summarization. Different embedding dimensions were explored, showing a decrease in BLEU score with reduced parameter space. Additionally, the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) was utilized with the DrQA model, achieving a test set F1 score with a larger embedding matrix allowing for higher space savings. DrQA uses an embedding with a vocabulary size of 118,655 and dimensionality of 300, resulting in a 0.5 point drop in F1 score with significant parameter space savings. The computational overhead for word2ketXS embeddings increased training time, with a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU card used for the experiments. The memory footprint of word embeddings decreased substantially. The experiments used a machine with 2 Intel Xeon Gold 6146 CPUs, 384 GB RAM, and a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU card. The training time increased, but the dynamics of model training remained largely unchanged. Significant decreases in the memory footprint of word embeddings were observed, particularly in the input layers of sequence-to-sequence models. Transformer models like BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and Sparse Transformers require hundreds of millions of parameters to work, with a large portion belonging to word embeddings. During training, memory is also needed to store activations in all layers, which can dominate the memory footprint. During training, memory is needed to store activations in all layers, which can dominate the memory footprint. Various approaches have been proposed to decrease the memory requirements for word embeddings, including dictionary learning, word embedding clustering, bit encoding, and optimized quantization methods. Techniques such as pruning and quantization have been used to compress models for low-memory inference and training. Various approaches have been proposed to reduce memory requirements for word embeddings, including pruning, quantization, sparsity, and low numerical precision methods. Fourier-based approximation methods have been used for matrix approximation. Word2ketXS achieves higher space saving rates compared to other methods. Bit encoding approaches are limited to a space saving rate of 32 for 32-bit architectures. Other methods like parameter sharing or PCA offer higher saving rates but are limited by vocabulary size and embedding dimensionality. Tensor product spaces have been used for document embeddings."
