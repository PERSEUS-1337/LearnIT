The Secretary of the Interior is referred to as the Secretary. The Act provides grants for the preservation and restoration of historic buildings and structures at historically women's public colleges or universities. The Secretary awards grants to historically women's public colleges or universities for preserving and restoring historic buildings. Grants are funded through the National Historic Preservation Act for fiscal years 2002-2006. Grantees must agree to conditions such as obtaining Secretary's approval for alterations and allowing public access for educational purposes. Matching requirement applies to buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Secretary may provide grants for preserving historic buildings with conditions including public access for educational purposes. Grantees must match 50% of program costs with non-Federal funds, which can include in-kind contributions. In addition to cash payments, non-Federal interests can contribute property or personnel services for the non-Federal share of costs. Up to $16,000,000 can be allocated annually for grants, with $2,000,000 designated for specific universities in fiscal year 2002. The University of North Carolina in Greensboro, Winthrop University in Rock Hill, University of Montevallo in Alabama, Texas Woman's University in Denton, University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma in Chickasha, and Wesleyan College in Macon are among the institutions eligible for funding under this section. If less than $16,000,000 is available for fiscal year 2002, the amount allocated to each institution will be reduced by the same amount. Funds for fiscal years 2003-2006 will be distributed by the Secretary. The Secretary will distribute funds for fiscal years 2003-2006 to eligible grantees on a uniform basis.
