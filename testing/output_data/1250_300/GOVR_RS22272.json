    "content": "The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), regulates \"federal election activity,\" including voter registration drives, voter identification, get-out-the-vote drives, and public communications that refer to federal candidates. Regulated federal funds, or \"hard money,\" are used for such activities by candidate and party committees. Candidate and party committees can only use regulated federal funds, also known as \"hard money,\" to pay for federal election activities, including voter registration drives, voter identification, get-out-the-vote drives, and public communications that refer to federal candidates. In 2002, the FEC exempted Internet communications from federal campaign finance regulation, but this decision was challenged in court by Representatives Shays and Meehan. In 2004, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia overturned the FEC's regulations, agreeing with the BCRA sponsors that not regulating Internet activities could lead to circumvention of federal campaign finance laws. In 2004, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia overturned FEC regulations on Internet political communications, stating that excluding them from the definition of \"public communication\" was inconsistent with Congress's intent in enacting BCRA. The court upheld the definition of \"generic campaign activity\" as a \"public communication\" but left it to the FEC to determine what constitutes \"general public political advertising\" online. The court overturned FEC regulations on Internet political communications in 2004, stating that excluding them from the definition of \"public communication\" was inconsistent with Congress's intent in enacting BCRA. The court upheld the definition of \"generic campaign activity\" as a \"public communication\" but left it to the FEC to determine what constitutes \"general public political advertising\" online. The court also found that the FEC's 2002 NPRM did not provide adequate notice to the public about establishing such a definition. Additionally, the court ruled that Internet communications exempted from the definition of \"public communications\" could not be considered \"coordinated communications\" subject to FECA regulation, even if closely coordinated with political parties or candidate campaigns. The court overturned FEC regulations on Internet political communications in 2004, stating that excluding them from the definition of \"public communication\" was inconsistent with Congress's intent in enacting BCRA. The court remanded the case to the FEC for further action consistent with its decision, leading to the FEC seeking comments on proposed rules to include paid Internet advertisements in the definition of \"public communication.\" The FEC sought comment on proposed changes to disclaimer regulations and exceptions to definitions of \"contribution\" and \"expenditure\" for certain Internet activities. The new regulations aimed to ensure proper financing and disclosure of Internet communications by political committees without restricting individual citizens' freedom to speak online about candidates and elections. After a public hearing in June 2005, the FEC unanimously approved the regulations in March 2006, citing the 2004 Shays v. FEC court decision as a driving factor. The regulations aimed to exempt blogs maintained by individuals from FECA regulation. The FEC proposed regulations to exempt blogs maintained by individuals from FECA regulation, citing the 2004 Shays v. FEC court decision. The regulations aimed to treat paid Internet advertising on another person's website as a \"public communication.\" The FEC proposed regulations to exempt blogs from FECA regulation, citing a court decision. They aim to treat paid Internet advertising on another person's website as a \"public communication,\" subject to FEC regulations including disclaimer requirements. The advertiser, not the website operator, is responsible for public communication in ads, subject to FECA limits and disclosure requirements. Disclaimers are required on political committee websites for paid Internet ads advocating for or against federal candidates. Disclosure of fees paid to bloggers by candidates is only required on candidate disclosure statements. Coordinated Internet ads placed on another website for a fee and coordinated with a candidate are considered \"coordinated communications.\" During Congress's consideration of BCRA in 2001 and 2002, coordinated Internet advertisements placed on another website for a fee and coordinated with a candidate are considered \"coordinated communications,\" constituting in-kind contributions subject to FECA regulations. Individual or volunteer activity on the Internet to influence a federal election is exempt from FECA regulation. Media exemptions apply to news stories, commentaries, and editorials distributed online. During the consideration of BCRA in Congress, there was a debate on whether to exempt communications over the Internet from regulation under FECA. Various bills were proposed, including the Online Freedom of Speech Act, but they failed to pass. During the 109th and 110th Congress, bills were proposed to regulate political communications on the Internet under FECA, but failed to pass due to concerns about circumvention. The House Administration Committee ordered a bill favorably reported in 2006, but postponed the vote pending FEC regulatory action. New FEC regulations in 2006 led to indefinite postponement of House floor action on the issue. During the 110th Congress, regulations on political communications on the Internet were not a major legislative focus. Bills like H.R. 894 and H.R. 5699 aimed to extend disclaimer requirements to Internet communications and exempt certain Internet services from being treated as contributions or expenditures. H.R. 5699 aimed to exempt blogs and Internet publications from being considered expenditures by political committees. It also addressed the rental and transfer of email address lists by political committees. The bill was referred to the Committee on House Administration during the 110th Congress."
