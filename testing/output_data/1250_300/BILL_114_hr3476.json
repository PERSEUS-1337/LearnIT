The \"Prevent a Government Shutdown Act of 2015\" was created due to the Budget Control Act of 2011 setting spending caps and requiring deficit reduction through negotiations or sequestration. Despite unsuccessful negotiations, a two-year agreement was reached in 2014 and 2015 to avoid deep cuts. A two-year agreement in 2014 and 2015 set higher levels of defense and non-defense discretionary spending to avoid deep budget cuts. Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry criticized the impact of sequestration on defense spending, while NDD United highlighted the negative effects on non-defense spending. The impact of cuts on non-defense discretionary spending is evident, affecting economic recovery, business growth, public health, education, oversight, scientific discovery, infrastructure, and emergency response. House Appropriations bills for 2016 propose significant cuts to education, housing vouchers, and veterans affairs. The sequester also poses risks to defense spending. The sequester, if not eliminated, will weaken the Nation's economic recovery, endanger defense, and harm vulnerable Americans. Relief from the sequester could boost GDP by 0.4% in 2016 and 0.2% in 2017, increase employment by 500,000 next year and 300,000 in 2017, and prevent a Government shutdown. The 2013 shutdown cost 120,000 private-sector jobs and shrunk GDP growth by 0.2% to 0.6%. The 2013 Government shutdown lasted 16 days, costing 120,000 private-sector jobs and shrinking GDP growth by 0.2% to 0.6%. It resulted in 6.6 million days' worth of work lost, $500 million in visitor spending at national parks, $4 billion in delayed tax refunds, 6,300 children losing access to Head Start, and delayed food safety inspections. Immediate negotiations for a budget agreement are necessary to prevent another shutdown and fund vital services adequately for fiscal year 2016. Congress should raise discretionary spending caps for defense and non-defense to eliminate the sequester and reduce its impact. Negotiations should focus on raising discretionary spending caps for defense and non-defense, eliminating the non-defense sequester, and reducing the defense sequester. Congress should aim to offset the cost of sequester relief with deficit reduction from closing tax loopholes, but sequester relief must happen regardless of this agreement. Bipartisan, bicameral agreement reached on sequester relief. A bipartisan measure will be negotiated to increase discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, with provisions to reduce the deficit. Members appointed by House and Senate leaders will be responsible for negotiating the measure. The Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the Senate will each appoint a quarter of the total number of individuals to approve a measure for increasing discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. If approved, the measure will be considered under specific procedures outlined in the Budget Control Act of 2011. SEC. 3. ALTERNATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016 AND 2017. If the measure described under section 2(a) is not enacted into law before October 1, 2015, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 will be amended to adjust discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. This includes specific dollar amounts for security and nonsecurity spending categories. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 will be amended to adjust discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 by inserting \"2015, 2016, and 2017\". Any adjustments made before the enactment of this Act by the Office of Management and Budget will have no force or effect if the measure described under section 2(a) is not enacted into law before October 1, 2015."
