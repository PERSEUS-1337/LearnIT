These medications are prescribed to treat various mental health conditions, but there is limited evidence on their safety and efficacy in children. Congress is closely monitoring the use of psychotropic medications in foster children, as federal law requires states to have a plan for overseeing their prescription drug use. The report discusses the mental health needs of children in foster care and the use of psychotropic medications. It also covers congressional oversight and efforts by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to ensure appropriate medication use. State monitoring of medication use for foster children is briefly mentioned. Child welfare agencies intervene in cases of abuse or neglect, leading to some children being placed in foster care for round-the-clock care. Placement in foster care occurs when a judge determines a child's removal from their home is necessary due to neglect, abuse, or behavioral issues. It is meant to be temporary until reunification with parents or a permanent placement is found. In FY2015, 671,000 children spent time in foster care, with 243,000 exiting the system, leaving 428,000 in care by the end of the fiscal year. States must ensure the safety and well-being of children in foster care, addressing their physical and mental health needs. During FY2015, 671,000 children spent time in foster care, with 243,000 exiting the system, leaving 428,000 in care by the end of the fiscal year. The national foster care caseload has been declining for over a decade, with about 77,000 fewer children in care compared to FY2006. Children in foster care have higher mental health service needs due to abuse or neglect before entering care, leading to difficulties in regulating emotions and socialization issues. In a national survey conducted in 2008 and 2009, children in foster care have a higher risk of behavioral or emotional problems compared to the general population. Children in foster care are more likely to receive mental health diagnoses such as attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. Children in foster care have an increased likelihood of being diagnosed with mental health disorders, including attention disorders, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorders, conduct disorders, depression, and schizophrenia. Medicaid provides health care services for nearly all children in foster care, with the share of children diagnosed with mental health disorders increasing from 2002 to 2007. The most common diagnoses vary by age group, with older children more likely to be diagnosed with conduct disorders and depression. Children in foster care are more likely to be diagnosed with mental health disorders, with rates increasing from 2002 to 2007. The most common diagnoses vary by age group, with older children more likely to have conduct disorders and depression. National standards recommend mental health screenings and assessments for children in foster care, with Medicaid providing diagnostic and treatment services. Children in foster care are entitled to Medicaid services, including mental health screenings and treatments through the EPSDT program. Medicaid covers all medically necessary services for eligible children in foster care, ensuring they receive the care they need. The EPSDT program under Medicaid covers health screenings, assessments, immunizations, and mental health services for children, including those in foster care. States are required to provide treatment to meet children's identified health needs, including mental health needs, with services such as counseling and case management. Medicaid financing can be used for services provided by mental health professionals and prescription drugs. Children with mental health challenges may benefit from psychosocial treatment like counseling and case management. Evidence shows that interventions like CBT and family-focused treatment are effective for children with disruptive behaviors. CBT, including anger management and social skills training, is also effective for children who have experienced trauma. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed to children in foster care when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective. Psychotropic medications may be prescribed to children in foster care when psychosocial treatment alone is not effective. However, medications may be used without accompanying psychosocial therapies due to a lack of resources and support. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have expressed concerns about an over-reliance on medication for children in care, highlighting the need for timely access to effective behavioral health care and evidence-based psychosocial therapies. Children in foster care are more likely to receive mental health supports compared to those who remain in their own homes following investigations of abuse or neglect. Research shows an increased use of psychosocial mental health interventions among foster children on antipsychotic medication. However, studies indicate that not all children in foster care who need mental health services receive them. Between 2009 and 2011, 65.5% of children in foster care were in Medicaid, compared to 28.0% to 29.0% of non-foster children. Studies show that some foster children needing mental health services do not receive them, with 16% to 33% using psychotropic medication. Rates of psychotropic medication use among foster children exceed those among children generally. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care far exceed the rates among children generally, with children in foster care receiving medication at three to nine times the rate of all other children served by Medicaid. Research shows that children in non-relative foster family homes are no more likely than child-welfare involved children living in their own homes to be prescribed psychotropic medication. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care vary by state and over time. Rates of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care vary by state and over time, with research showing great variation in prescription practices. State practices play a significant role in prescribing psychotropic medication, as seen in a study of Medicaid claims data from 2002 to 2007. This study found an initial increase in psychotropic medication use followed by a decline in most states, but an increase in the use of antipsychotic medications among children in foster care. The study found an increase in antipsychotic medication use among children in foster care based on Medicaid eligibility. 45 states saw an increase from 2002 to 2007, with rates ranging from 2.8% to 21.7%. A review of 20 states showed a rise from 2005 to 2008, followed by a slight decrease by 2010. Non-foster care children and privately insured children had lower usage rates, but the latter saw a slight increase from 2005 to 2009. Children with Medicaid coverage and those with private insurance had lower levels of antipsychotic use. Among privately insured children, the percentage using antipsychotics increased slightly from 2005 to 2009 and remained steady through 2013. Data from the National Survey on Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II) was used to examine psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. The survey included children who remained in their homes after investigations of abuse or neglect, as well as those placed in foster care. The NSCAW II survey examined psychotropic medication use among children in foster care, including those living with biological or adoptive parents and those in foster care. Children's ages ranged from 2 months to 20 years at different follow-up times. Children living with their own parents post-investigation were less likely to use psychotropic medication compared to those in foster care. Children living with their own parents post-investigation were less likely to use psychotropic medication compared to those in foster care. Among children in foster care, living in congregate care and being school age forecasted a higher likelihood of taking psychotropic medications. There was no significant difference in medication use between children in foster care and those who remained at home at four to six months post-investigation. However, at 18 months, children in foster care were more likely to be on psychotropics. By the 36-month follow-up, one-third of children in care were taking psychotropic medications, compared to 12.9% of children who stayed at home. Among children placed in foster care, those in group settings had the highest prevalence of psychotropic medication use, with 48.2% of children in care for six months or less being prescribed medication. This rate was significantly higher compared to children in other foster care settings, those who remained at home, and informal kin care. After 18 months, children in group settings continued to have the highest rate of psychotropic medication use at 67.4%, while other foster care settings ranged from 15.9% to 23.8%, children at home were at 10.9%, and informal kin care at 11.9%. Children in group settings had the highest prevalence of psychotropic medication use, with 67.4% prescribed medication, compared to 15.9% to 23.8% in other foster care settings, 10.9% for children at home, and 11.9% for those in informal kin care. 52% of children in group settings were taking psychotropics, with 48.6% taking two or more drugs, the highest among all placement settings. Children in group settings had the highest prevalence of psychotropic medication use, with 67.4% prescribed medication. At 36 months following the initial investigation, about 4 out of 10 children in group settings were taking two or more psychotropic medications. Children in foster care were more likely to be using psychotropic medication if they were of elementary and secondary school age. Youth ages 11 to 17 were most likely to be using psychotropics at each follow-up wave. At each follow-up wave, youth ages 11 to 17 had the highest likelihood of using psychotropic medications, followed by youth ages 6 to 10, 18 and older, and 1.5 to 5 years. The research literature describes prescribing patterns for foster children as \"too many, too much, and too young,\" with polypharmacy rates remaining consistent at 5.2% to 5.9% annually from 2002 to 2007 among children in foster care. An analysis of Medicaid claims data for 20 states in 2011 showed polypharmacy rates of three or more antipsychotic drugs for children in foster care (2.8%) and non-foster care (3.1%) were comparable. Concerns have been raised about the concurrent use of certain classes of psychotropics, such as antipsychotics, due to greater adverse effects with only marginal benefits. Antipsychotic polypharmacy has not been well researched and has typically shown negative outcomes. Concerns have been raised about the concurrent use of multiple antipsychotic medications for children in foster care, with studies showing greater adverse effects and limited benefits. There are worries about prescriptions exceeding recommendations and very young children being prescribed psychotropics. Research has found that a small percentage of children under 6 in out-of-home care are prescribed psychotropics, with higher rates among foster children compared to those not in foster care. Between 0.3% to 2.1% of children under age 1 were prescribed psychotropics, with higher rates among infants in foster care (0.1% to 1.2%). ADHD and antipsychotic medication prescribing rates increased with age among children ages 3 to 6 in foster care. Concerns exist regarding the use of psychotropic drugs in infants and young children due to potential serious health effects. Children in foster care may receive psychotropics more readily due to limited mental health services available. The lack of mental health services for children in foster care has led to an increase in the prescribing of antipsychotic medications. The use of these drugs has steadily grown, with a slight decrease in recent years. Factors contributing to this trend include limited research on efficacy, pharmaceutical marketing, and a general increase in psychotropic medication use among children. The use of psychotropic medications in children, especially those in foster care, has raised concerns due to limited research on their efficacy and safety. Studies on antipsychotics show insufficient evidence for their effectiveness in addressing mental health disorders in children, with a high risk of bias in most studies. Additionally, there is little to no evidence available for certain conditions like disruptive behavior disorders and eating disorders. The median study duration of eight weeks is deemed insufficient to evaluate long-term outcomes. The analysis highlighted concerns regarding the use of psychotropic medications in children, particularly those in foster care. Studies on antipsychotics showed limited evidence of effectiveness, with a high risk of bias due to various factors. Some children may benefit from these medications for managing symptoms related to mental health and behavior issues stemming from complex trauma. Stimulants for ADHD appear to be well-researched among the antipsychotic classes. Stimulants for treating ADHD are well-researched and effective in reducing core symptoms. Children in foster care have higher rates of mental health diagnoses, leading to increased use of psychotropic medications. Inconsistent state oversight and multiple placements may contribute to this trend. Congress is interested in overseeing prescription medication use in children. In 2005, Congress held a hearing on the enrollment of foster children in clinical drug trials. The Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006 required state child welfare agencies to consult with medical professionals for children in foster care. Oversight of psychotropic medication use for foster children was briefly discussed in a 2007 congressional hearing on health care. The oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in foster care was briefly discussed in congressional hearings in 2007 and 2008. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 expanded requirements for states to consult with medical professionals and develop oversight plans for children in foster care's health and well-being, including mental health services. The 2008 law directed states to ensure oversight of drugs prescribed to children in foster care. The 2008 law expanded requirements for states to oversee psychotropic medication use for children in foster care. In 2011, further amendments stipulated protocols for prescribing psychotropic medication. GAO reviewed state policies against best practice guidelines for prescribing psychotropics for foster children. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry developed best practice guidelines for prescribing psychotropics for foster children. GAO found that state programs lacked comprehensive oversight, with only one state fully implementing consent procedures. GAO recommended HHS endorse guidance for monitoring psychotropic medications for children in foster care. Witnesses discussed the role of HHS and state Medicaid programs in increasing cooperation. In April 2013, the Senate Finance Committee convened a roundtable discussion with Senate staff and child welfare stakeholders to address issues associated with the prescription of psychotropic medications for children in foster care and highlight alternative strategies to respond to trauma. Witnesses at the hearing emphasized the need for increased cooperation and communication between HHS and state Medicaid programs to improve oversight of psychotropic medication use. A 12-year-old former foster youth shared his experience of being prescribed multiple psychotropic medications and the side effects he faced while in foster care. He also mentioned the positive impact of therapy with his adoptive parents. The roundtable discussed issues related to prescribing psychotropic medications for children in foster care and emphasized the importance of therapy as an alternative. Former foster youth shared their experiences, highlighting the need for invested caregivers and professionals in mental health treatment. Child welfare stakeholders addressed the prevalence of psychotropic medication use, the role of the federal government in promoting alternatives, and tools for determining medication necessity. In May 2014, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on this topic. In May 2014, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources held a hearing on the use of psychotropic medications among children in foster care. Witnesses included the Associate Commissioner of HHS's Children's Bureau, GAO, a researcher focusing on psychotropic medication use among children in care, and Dr. Phil McGraw. GAO examined prescribing rates among children in foster care in five states from 2011 to 2014, finding varying quality in documentation supporting the use of psychotropics. The GAO contracted child psychiatrists to examine the use of psychotropics among 24 children in care. They found varying quality in documentation supporting the use of psychotropics, especially regarding dosage amounts and concurrent use of multiple medications. GAO recommended that HHS issue guidance to states on oversight of medication for children in foster care, but the guidance did not address the role of third-party managed care organizations. The GAO issued guidance to state child welfare and Medicaid agencies on oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in care, but it did not address the role of third-party MCOs. State officials in seven states developed practices to support appropriate mental health diagnoses and treatment for foster children, including guidelines on prescribing psychotropic medications and promoting the use of psychosocial services. State officials in seven states collaborated with child welfare, Medicaid, and other agencies to implement oversight of psychotropic medication use for children in care. They use various measures to assess outcomes, such as reviewing physician prescribing practices and monitoring child placements. The GAO recommended that HHS consider convening meetings with stakeholders engaged in state oversight efforts. HHS has supported states in oversight work since 2014, but has not convened meetings with stakeholders involved in state oversight of psychotropic medication for children in care. GAO recommended cost-effective ways for HHS to convene state stakeholders to collaborate on medication oversight. Federal agencies have implemented requirements for states to have protocols for monitoring psychotropic medication use and have publicized best practices and successful state strategies for oversight. The Obama Administration proposed increased funding for psychotropic medication oversight in its annual budgets. The Obama Administration proposed expanding funding for oversight of psychotropic medications for children with mental health needs. States must develop a coordinated strategy and oversight plan to ensure access to health care, including mental health services, for children in foster care. This plan must be developed collaboratively between the state child welfare agency, the state Medicaid agency, and health care experts. It should include a schedule for health screenings and address emotional trauma associated with maltreatment and removal from home. The coordinated strategy for children in foster care must include a schedule for health screenings, monitoring and treating health needs, updating medical information, ensuring continuity of health care services, oversight of prescription medicines, consulting with medical professionals, and developing transition plans for children aging out of foster care. The federal child welfare law requires state agencies to have written plans for children in foster care, including health-related records like immunizations, medication, and provider information. These records must be updated and provided to foster care parents or providers at each placement, and to youth upon leaving care. States report on oversight of psychotropic medications through annual reports to HHS for federal funding. The Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP) and Annual Progress and Services Reports (APSRs) require jurisdictions to report on oversight of psychotropic medications for federal funding. The reports must address screening, consent, monitoring, mental health expertise, and information sharing. The most recent CFSP covers FY2015-FY2019. The most recent five-year CFSP for FY2015-FY2019 requires jurisdictions to report on oversight of prescription medicines, including protocols for appropriate use and monitoring of psychotropic medications. In 2011, HHS convened an interagency working group to address research on psychotropic medication use among children in foster care and support state efforts in implementing requirements on psychotropics. The working group aims to expand evidence-based screening, diagnosis, interventions, oversight, monitoring of psychotropic medications, and research on medications and psychosocial treatments for children in foster care. Led by ACF, the group includes representatives from CMS and SAMHSA. The interagency working group, led by ACF, includes representatives from CMS and SAMHSA. In 2011, the group released a letter addressing actions to support effective management of prescription medication use for children in foster care. State Medicaid/CHIP agencies and mental health authorities play a significant role in providing services for eligible children. The interagency working group, led by ACF, CMS, and SAMHSA, released a letter in 2011 addressing actions to support effective management of prescription medication use for children in foster care. State Medicaid/CHIP agencies and mental health authorities are crucial in providing continuous access to quality mental health services for children in out-of-home care. Collaboration between State child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health authorities is essential for improving health, including medication use and prescription monitoring structures. ACF, SAMHSA, and CMS provided guidance through webinars and information memoranda to raise awareness about psychotropic use among children in foster care. In 2012, HHS agencies conducted webinars and discussion sessions for child welfare stakeholders on monitoring psychotropic medication use in foster care. A summit called \"Because Minds Matter\" was held to enhance collaboration among state leaders on oversight of medication use. States were urged to identify areas for improvement, outline activities, address challenges, and set timelines for implementation. In April 2012, ACF provided guidance to state child welfare agencies on implementing protocols to monitor the use of psychotropic medication, emphasizing coordinated planning, informed decision-making, medication monitoring, mental health expertise, and information sharing. ACF issued guidance in April 2012 to state child welfare agencies on improving outcomes for children who have experienced abuse or neglect, focusing on brain development, social-emotional development, and the impact of trauma. ACF also published guides on tools for youth in foster care to ask questions about medications and for child welfare staff on mental health issues and psychotropic medications. Additionally, ACF awarded FY2012 funds to support projects for improving mental health services for children in foster care. ACF awarded funds to entities to support projects for youth in child welfare with mental and behavioral health needs. SAMHSA provided funding for developing guidelines on prescribing psychotropic medications for children and youth. A medical director funded by SAMHSA works with child and adolescent psychiatrists to address issues related to psychotropic medications. The medical director, funded by SAMHSA, collaborates with child and adolescent psychiatrists to address issues related to psychotropic medications in state and county governments. The network disseminates best practices through a community listerv and webinars on medication oversight, including for children on Medicaid. States are required to have Drug Utilization Review programs in place to oversee the prescribing of drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries, with examples of oversight methods provided in an informational bulletin by the CMS Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services. The bulletin highlighted oversight of psychotropic medication use, including automated edit checks and multidisciplinary teams in some states. In 2015, CMS assisted state Medicaid agencies in improving antipsychotic medication use for children on Medicaid. Joint guidance in 2013 emphasized the importance of providing psychosocial interventions to children who have experienced complex trauma. The 2013 joint guidance from CMS, ACF, and SAMHSA emphasized the importance of providing psychosocial interventions to children who have experienced \"complex trauma,\" such as children in foster care. It highlighted the need for functional assessments, trauma screening, mental health assessment, and outcome measurement to ensure proper treatment. President Obama's FY2017 budget proposed a five-year joint initiative between CMS and ACF to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care and improve their well-being. This would involve providing performance-based incentive payments to state Medicaid agencies totaling $500 million over five years. States could also apply for competitive grant funding under Title IV-E for improved care coordination and delivery of evidence-based psychosocial interventions to Medicaid-eligible children served by child welfare agencies. The initiative proposed in President Obama's FY2017 budget aims to reduce reliance on psychotropic medications for children in foster care. Incentive payments would be provided to state Medicaid agencies over a five-year period, with additional grant funding available for implementing psychosocial interventions. Research has focused on state oversight of psychotropic medication use in foster care, including consent procedures and monitoring policies. Researchers conducted surveys of states to understand their policies on overseeing psychotropic medications, specifically focusing on children in foster care. Over half of the states expressed high concern about psychotropic medication use, with some having written policies or guidelines in place. About a quarter of states rated psychotropic medication use as a moderate concern, while 13% rated it as a low concern. 26 states had a written policy in place, 13 were developing one, and 9 had no policy. Over half of states used \"red flag\" markers to identify issues with medication use, such as in young children or exceeding recommended dosages. Researchers found a lack of systematic implementation or study of approaches to improve outcomes for children in foster care. Researchers have raised concerns about the lack of systematic implementation and study of approaches to improve outcomes for children in foster care, particularly regarding the oversight of psychotropic medication use. A 2014 study found that many states had underdeveloped policies on psychotropic drug use, lacking essential criteria for protecting children. Despite this, states have started to address oversight of psychotropic medication more systematically. States have taken steps to address oversight of psychotropic medication use among children in foster care. Representatives from child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health agencies convened working groups as part of an HHS summit. Some states collaborated with the Center for Health Care Strategies to improve oversight, defining common terms and measures on psychotropic medication utilization. Best practices in oversight and monitoring were developed, with states implementing protocols in areas such as gaining consent and obtaining real-time data on medication use. The states have implemented protocols in four areas for psychotropic medication oversight and monitoring: gaining consent, obtaining real-time data on utilization, reviewing \"red flags,\" and tailoring monitoring processes to local needs. The Center for Health Care Strategies, with support from SAMSHA, provides technical assistance to states on this issue. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing (NSCAW) II examined psychotropic medication use among children involved in child welfare due to abuse or neglect, with data collected in 2008-2009. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing (NSCAW) II collected data on psychotropic medication use among children in child welfare due to abuse or neglect in 2008-2009. Follow-up surveys at 18 and 36 months after the investigation showed medication use by age and foster care status. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing (NSCAW) II collected data on psychotropic medication use among children in child welfare due to abuse or neglect in 2008-2009. Follow-up surveys at 18 and 36 months after the investigation showed medication use by age and foster care status. Children in foster care were more likely to be using psychotropic medications compared to those living at home, with statistically significant differences observed at the 18-month and 36-month follow-up for children of various age groups. The percentage difference between in-home and foster care groups was statistically significant at the 18-month follow-up but not at the initial survey or 36-month follow-up. For children aged 11-17, there was no statistical significance at the initial survey, but significant differences were found at the 18-month and 36-month follow-up."
