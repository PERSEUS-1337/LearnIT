    "content": "The Act titled \"Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2007\" introduces the Higher Education Opportunity Credit under Section 25A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Higher Education Opportunity Credit allows eligible students to receive a tax credit for qualified tuition and related expenses paid during the taxable year, with varying percentages based on the amount spent. There are limitations based on modified adjusted gross income to determine the final credit amount. The Higher Education Opportunity Credit reduces taxable income based on modified adjusted gross income, with specific ratios determining the amount of reduction. The modified adjusted gross income is the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable year, increased by any excluded amounts. The credit allowed for any taxable year is limited by the regular tax liability and other credits, and can only be claimed for up to 3 eligible students. The credit under subsection (a) is limited to 3 eligible students per taxable year. Additionally, the credit can only be claimed for up to 4 taxable years for each eligible student, and the individual must be at least a half-time student for part of the year to qualify. The tax credit for qualified tuition and related expenses is limited to 3 eligible students per year and can be claimed for up to 4 years per student. To qualify, the student must be at least a half-time student and not have a felony drug conviction. Eligible student is defined as per the Higher Education Act of 1965. The tax credit for qualified tuition and related expenses is available for up to 3 eligible students per year for a maximum of 4 years per student. To qualify, the student must be enrolled at least half-time in an eligible educational institution and not have a felony drug conviction. Qualified tuition and related expenses include tuition and fees required for enrollment at the institution. The tax credit for qualified tuition and related expenses allows a deduction for courses at an eligible educational institution. This includes 50% of expenses for books, up to $250 per student, excluding sports, games, or hobbies unless part of the degree program. The term 'eligible educational institution' refers to an institution described in the Higher Education Act of 1965 and eligible for participation in a program under the same act. Taxpayers can elect not to apply this section to qualified tuition and related expenses. Taxpayers can elect not to apply this section to qualified tuition and related expenses, but must include the individual's name and taxpayer identification number on the tax return. Additionally, any scholarships or benefits paid for the individual must be subtracted from the total expenses considered for the tax credit. The academic period can be reduced by amounts paid for an individual's benefit, such as qualified scholarships, educational assistance allowances, and payments for educational expenses. If a deduction is allowed to another taxpayer for expenses paid by a dependent, it affects the taxable year. Treatment of expenses paid by a dependent affects the taxable year, with qualified tuition and related expenses being treated as paid by the other taxpayer. Prepayments for academic periods starting in the first 3 months after the taxable year are also considered in the same year to avoid double benefits. The section discusses the treatment of expenses for qualified tuition and related expenses, including prepayments for academic periods starting in the first 3 months after the taxable year. It also mentions the denial of double benefits, restrictions for married individuals filing separate returns, and nonresident aliens. Additionally, it includes provisions for inflation adjustments regarding the dollar limitation on the amount of credit. Inflation adjustments are made to increase dollar amounts under subsection (a) for taxable years after 2008 based on the cost-of-living adjustment determined for the calendar year. If the adjusted amount is not a multiple of $100, it is rounded down. Additionally, income limits are specified for taxable years. \"In the case of taxable years after 2008, dollar amounts in subsection (b)(1)(B) are increased by the cost-of-living adjustment for that year. Adjusted amounts not multiples of $1,000 are rounded down.\" The Secretary may prescribe regulations for this section, including recapture of the credit in cases of refund. Section 222 regarding qualified tuition expenses is repealed, with conforming amendments made to section 26(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The item relating to section 222 is removed from the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with various conforming amendments made to different sections of the Code. Section 529, 530, and 1400O of the Internal Revenue Code are amended to replace references to section 25A with section 25(e)(2) or section 25A(c)(1). Additionally, subsection (e) of section 6050S is also amended. The text chunk discusses amendments to various sections of the Internal Revenue Code, including section 6050S and section 6213(g)(2), to update references from section 25A to section 25A(e)(1) or section 25A(c)(1). The table of sections is also updated to reflect these changes. The amendments made by this section apply to expenses paid after December 31, 2007 for education in academic periods beginning after that date."
