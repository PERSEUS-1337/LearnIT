    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act\" and includes findings related to the issue. Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States each year, caused by inadequately treated sewage filled with harmful pathogens. Swimming in contaminated waters can lead to various illnesses, resulting in significant economic losses annually. Many sewer systems lack routine monitoring for early detection. Public health authorities are not routinely notified of sewer overflows that threaten public health, leading to economic losses estimated at $28 billion annually in the United States. Better monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sewer overflows could prevent millions of Americans from getting sick each year. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system. Monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sewer overflows are emphasized to prevent public health risks and economic losses. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require publicly owned treatment works to implement a system for timely detection and notification of sanitary sewer overflows to protect public health. Owners must alert the public within 24 hours of an overflow and notify health authorities immediately. Owners or operators of treatment works must promptly notify public health authorities and other affected entities of any sanitary sewer overflow that poses a significant health risk. They must report the overflow to the Administrator or State within 24 hours orally or electronically, and provide a written report within 5 days detailing the overflow's magnitude, duration, and suspected cause. Owners or operators of treatment works must report all sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State, including details of each incident such as wastewater released, overflow duration, and location. Owners or operators of treatment works must report all sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State, including details of each incident such as wastewater released, overflow duration, location, responses for cleanup, and actions to mitigate impacts and prevent future overflows. States must then annually summarize reported overflows to the Administrator. SEC. 5 amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include requirements for monitoring and reporting sanitary sewer overflows. SEC. 6 authorizes $2.2 billion for fiscal years 2006 through 2012."
