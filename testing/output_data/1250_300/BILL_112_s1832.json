    "content": "The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" allows States to enforce sales and use tax laws equally for all sales transactions, regardless of how they are conducted. States have the right to collect taxes owed under State law. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" allows States to enforce sales and use tax laws equally for all sales transactions. Member States under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement can require sellers to collect and remit taxes on remote sales, while non-Member States can do so if they adopt simplification requirements. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" allows States to enforce sales and use tax laws equally for all sales transactions. States must adopt minimum simplification requirements, including a single State-level agency to administer all sales and use tax laws, a single audit for all taxing jurisdictions, and a uniform sales and use tax base. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" requires remote sellers and providers to collect sales and use taxes based on destination rates, which include State and local jurisdiction rates. It also mandates the provision of software and services to identify applicable tax rates and certification procedures for compliance. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" mandates destination-based sales tax rates for remote sellers, certification procedures for compliance, and holds providers harmless for errors. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" requires remote sellers to collect sales or use tax based on destination rates, provide notice of rate changes, and exempts small sellers from tax collection requirements. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act\" allows states to require remote sellers with over $500,000 in annual remote sales to collect sales or use tax. Sales of related persons must be combined to meet the threshold. SEC. 4. TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY. The authority granted by this Act shall terminate when the highest court determines the State no longer meets the Act's requirements, with no further appeal. SEC. 5. LIMITATIONS. The Act does not subject sellers to various taxes other than sales and use taxes, does not affect tax application, and does not change state authority to impose taxes. It also does not impact nexus determination for taxes other than sales and use taxes. The Act does not prohibit states from licensing, regulating, or taxing businesses unrelated to sales, or from regulating interstate commerce. Additionally, the Act does not introduce new taxes. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement Act prohibits states from imposing new taxes on goods or services not previously taxed. It only applies to remote sales, not intrastate sales, and states must comply with intrastate provisions. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS AND SPECIAL RULES. In this Act, key definitions include \"consolidated provider\" for tax administration, \"locality\" as a political subdivision, \"Member State\" under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, \"person\" as an individual or legal entity, and \"remote sale\" for sales made by remote sellers. The term \"person\" includes individuals, trusts, estates, partnerships, corporations, and governments. A \"remote sale\" is a sale attributed to a state where the seller lacks physical presence. A \"remote seller\" is someone who makes remote sales. A \"single provider\" is certified by a state for tax administration. \"Sourced\" refers to the location where a remote sale is received by the purchaser. The term \"State\" refers to each State, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. A remote sale is sourced to the location where the item is received by the purchaser, based on delivery instructions provided by the buyer. If no delivery location is specified, the sale is sourced to the customer's known address or the seller's address if no other information is available. Compliance with sourcing provisions of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement is required for State granted authority under section 3(a). Authority under section 3(a) must comply with the sourcing provisions of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. The term \"State\" includes various territories and possessions of the United States. The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement is a multi-State agreement adopted in 2002 and amended periodically. SEC. 7. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act and its application will not be affected."
