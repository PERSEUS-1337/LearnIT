The US should fulfill promises made to recruits and ensure high-quality healthcare for all military retirees.

Eligible beneficiaries enrolled in Federal Employees Health Benefit plans can change plans and coverage like other beneficiaries. Government contributions are limited to what would be payable for an employee in the same plan. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management mandates separate risk pools for health benefit plans under chapter 89. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management mandates separate risk pools for health benefit plans under chapter 89 of title 5 to establish premium rates for eligible beneficiaries. The Secretary of Defense will reimburse eligible beneficiaries enrolled in these plans for health care costs not covered by the plan but would have been paid under TRICARE Standard. The amendments for health care coverage through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program will be effective on October 1, 2010. Additionally, reimbursement for TRICARE pharmacy benefits at TRICARE network pharmacy levels will be provided to certain military retirees and dependents in hardship cases. The Secretary will reimburse eligible individuals for pharmacy benefits received from non-TRICARE network pharmacies if certified by a physician that they lack access due to physical or medical constraints. Eligible individuals must have another insurance plan providing primary coverage for health benefits."
