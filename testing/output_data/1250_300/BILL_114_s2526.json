    "content": "The Act titled \"Made in America Manufacturing Communities Act of 2016\" establishes a program to designate and support manufacturing communities. The Act establishes a program to improve US manufacturing competitiveness by designating and supporting manufacturing communities. The Secretary will establish the program and provide support to designated manufacturing communities. The program supports designated manufacturing communities seeking financial or technical assistance from participating agencies like the Department of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, and Education. Preferential consideration may be given if consistent with the economic development strategy and all requirements are met. The program supports designated manufacturing communities seeking assistance from participating agencies like the Department of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Housing, Labor, Transportation, Appalachian Regional Commission, Delta Regional Authority, Environmental Protection Agency, National Science Foundation, and Small Business Administration. Each participating agency identifies applicable programs for the established program. The participating agency identifies applicable programs for the established program, and in cases where multiple consortium members seek the same assistance, the agency can determine preference allocation. The participating agency can determine preference allocation among consortium members seeking financial or technical assistance. Members may need to coordinate with each other in their applications. A report on preferential treatment must be submitted to the Secretary within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The head of each participating agency must submit a report to the Secretary within 90 days detailing how preferential consideration will be given to consortium members. The Secretary can provide technical assistance to designated manufacturing communities. Financial or technical assistance may be awarded to consortium members as deemed appropriate by the agency head. The recipient of financial or technical assistance may use the funds to support investments in infrastructure, access to capital, promotion of exports, and equipment upgrades to enhance the competitiveness of US manufacturing. The Secretary of Commerce coordinates with participating agencies to identify programs for infrastructure, capital access, exports, equipment upgrades, workforce training, energy efficiency, business incubators, site preparation, advanced research, and supply chain development. Inter-agency coordination aims to leverage complementary activities. The Secretary designates eligible consortiums as manufacturing communities through a competitive process. An eligible consortium represents a region and includes at least one institution of higher education. Inter-agency coordination is required to leverage complementary activities and avoid duplication of efforts. An eligible consortium for designation as a manufacturing community must include at least one institution of higher education, a private sector entity, and a government entity. It may also involve private sector partners, government entities, economic development groups, financial institutions, and utilities, with a district organization as the lead applicant. An eligible consortium for designation as a manufacturing community must include a district organization, Indian tribe, State or political subdivision, institution of higher education, or consortium of institutions of higher education. An eligible consortium for designation as a manufacturing community must include a district organization, Indian tribe, State or political subdivision, institution of higher education, or consortium of institutions of higher education. The consortium may define the region it represents, which should be large enough to contain key technologies and small enough to enable collaboration. Each designation under this section has a specified duration. Each designation as a manufacturing community lasts for 2 years and can be renewed for another 2 years upon application. The consortium must be eligible and may include various entities. The region represented should be large enough for key technologies and small enough for close collaboration. The Secretary may renew a designation for an eligible consortium that has changed its composition or submitted a revision to the plan. Evaluation for renewal includes assessing performance and progress of the consortium. The Secretary may renew a designation for an eligible consortium based on performance and progress, including post-designation awards, project-specific metrics, changes in composition, and other relevant criteria. An eligible consortium seeking a designation under paragraph (1) must submit an application to the Secretary with details on regional boundaries, manufacturing concentration, and national competitiveness. The consortium must provide an assessment of its manufacturing concentration and national competitiveness, as well as an integrated assessment of the local industrial ecosystem. Additionally, they must submit an evidence-based plan for developing manufacturing activities in the region. The consortium must provide an evidence-based plan for developing manufacturing activities in the region, including specific investments to address gaps in the ecosystem and make the region uniquely competitive. They must also describe the proposed investments, implementation strategy, outcome-based metrics, benchmarks, and milestones for tracking progress. The consortium must outline outcome-based metrics, benchmarks, and milestones to track progress in improving manufacturing in the region. The Secretary will evaluate applications based on regional cooperation levels and national manufacturing competitiveness. The Secretary may accept transferred funds from other agencies to carry out the proposal. Certain communities previously recognized as manufacturing communities will be deemed designated under this subsection."
