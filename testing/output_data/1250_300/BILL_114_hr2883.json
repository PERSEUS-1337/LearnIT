The Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act expands tax benefits to include renewable thermal energy, waste heat to power, and renewable fuel infrastructure projects. The Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act includes tax benefits for renewable fuel infrastructure, renewable fuels, renewable chemicals, and energy-efficient buildings. The tax benefits under the Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act cover the production of qualifying renewable chemicals, energy-efficient buildings, gasification with sequestration, and carbon capture and sequestration for power generation. The tax benefits under the Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act cover carbon capture and sequestration for power generation facilities. The tax benefits cover carbon capture and sequestration for power generation facilities, with specific requirements for facilities placed in service before and after January 8, 2013. The tax benefits cover carbon capture and sequestration for power generation facilities placed in service before January 9, 2013, capturing 30 percent or more of qualified carbon dioxide and disposing of it in secure geological storage.
