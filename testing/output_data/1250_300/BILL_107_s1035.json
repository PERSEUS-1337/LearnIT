    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Lakes Preservation Act\". It includes findings related to the Great Lakes. Congress finds that the Great Lakes are crucial public natural resources, providing freshwater for millions of people and supporting various economic activities in the region. The Great Lakes Charter of 1985 serves as a framework for managing water diversion proposals in the basin. The Governors of the Great Lakes States and the Premiers of the Great Lakes Provinces base decisions on proposals to withdraw, divert, or use Great Lakes water on conservation and protection of water and natural resources in the basin. Decision-making regarding Great Lakes water should remain with the Governors who manage the resources daily. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the term \"Administrator\" refers to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. \"Bulk fresh water\" is fresh water extracted for transportation without further processing. \"From the Great Lakes basin\" refers to water from specific lakes, interconnecting waterways, or tributaries. \"Great Lake\" includes Lake Erie and Lake Huron. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to the Great Lakes, including Great Lake, Great Lakes Province, Great Lakes State, and Secretary. The prev_chunk introduces terms like Administrator, Bulk fresh water, and Great Lakes basin. The text chunk discusses a moratorium on the export of bulk fresh water from the Great Lakes basin, with a provision for its expiration upon approval of a conservation standard by relevant authorities. Additionally, there is a suggestion for an agreement between the US and Canada to uphold the moratorium. Congress finds that the Great Lakes have played a significant role in the history of the region, with lighthouses serving as crucial navigational aids. Many of these lighthouses hold historical or architectural importance, but their future is at risk due to neglect. A study will be conducted by the Secretary to explore options for preserving these lighthouses within the next 3 years. The Secretary will conduct a study to review programs and consult with various entities to preserve lighthouses in the Great Lakes States. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose."
