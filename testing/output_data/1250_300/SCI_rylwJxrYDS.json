It uses gumbel softmax or online k-means clustering for quantization, enabling the application of NLP algorithms that require discrete inputs. Experiments show BERT pre-training achieves state-of-the-art results on TIMIT phoneme classification and WSJ speech recognition. This approach combines learning discrete speech representations with context prediction, offering a new direction in speech representation research. In this paper, the vq-wav2vec algorithm is introduced to learn discrete representations of speech segments through a context prediction task. It utilizes Gumbel-Softmax and online k-means clustering for quantization, allowing the application of NLP algorithms. The encoder maps raw audio to dense representations, which are then quantized and aggregated into context representations for training acoustic models. This new approach combines discrete speech representations with context prediction, showing promising results in speech recognition tasks. The Gumbel-Softmax approach and online k-means clustering are used to train a Deep Bidirectional Transformer (BERT) on discretized speech data. BERT representations outperform log-mel filterbank inputs and dense wav2vec representations on TIMIT and WSJ benchmarks. Discretization enables the application of NLP algorithms to speech data, such as using a sequence to sequence model for speech recognition. WAV2VEC learns audio representations through a self-supervised context-prediction task. The model is based on two convolutional neural networks where the encoder produces a representation for each time step at a rate of 100 Hz. The aggregator combines multiple encoder time steps into a new representation for each time step. The model is trained to distinguish a sample that is k steps in the future from distractor samples drawn from a distribution, by minimizing the contrastive loss. After training, the representations produced by the context network are input to the acoustic model instead of log-mel filterbank features. BERT is a pre-training approach for NLP tasks that uses a transformer encoder model to build a representation of text. Our approach, vq-wav2vec, learns vector quantized representations of audio data using a future time-step prediction task. It follows the same architectural choices as wav2vec with two convolutional networks for feature extraction and a quantization module to build discrete representations. The vq-wav2vec approach learns vector quantized representations of audio data through feature extraction, quantization, and aggregation using a new quantization module. The quantizer converts dense representations into discrete indices, which are then mapped to a reconstruction of the original representation. Multiple vector quantizations are performed to prevent mode collapse, utilizing techniques like Gumbel-Softmax and online k-means clustering. The vq-wav2vec approach utilizes multiple vector quantizations to prevent mode collapse. Techniques like Gumbel-Softmax and online k-means clustering are employed for this purpose. The Gumbel-Softmax enables selecting discrete codebook variables in a differentiable way, and a linear layer followed by ReLU is applied to the dense representation z. During training, output probabilities for variable selection are determined using uniform samples, while the closest variable to input features z is chosen based on Euclidean distance for codebook variable representation. The vq-wav2vec approach uses techniques like Gumbel-Softmax and online k-means clustering to prevent mode collapse. It selects codebook variables based on Euclidean distance and optimizes a future time step prediction loss instead of a reconstruction loss. The final loss includes terms for future prediction task, moving codebook vectors closer to encoder output, and ensuring encoder outputs are close to a centroid. This approach aims to address mode collapse issues by avoiding using only some codewords. The vq-wav2vec approach prevents mode collapse by using techniques like Gumbel-Softmax and online k-means clustering. It organizes the feature vector into multiple groups and independently quantizes partitions of z to avoid using only some codewords. This strategy results in larger dictionaries and improved downstream performance. The vq-wav2vec model prevents mode collapse by using Gumbel-Softmax and online k-means clustering. It organizes feature vectors into groups and applies two VQ approaches for each group. The codebook can be shared or not shared across groups, with shared codebook variables generally yielding competitive results. Once trained, the model can discretize audio data for algorithms like BERT pre-training, improving speech recognition by using representations from the BERT model. The BERT model is trained to build representations for speech recognition by masking spans of consecutive discretized speech tokens. This method improves accuracy over masking individual tokens. The models are pre-trained on the Librispeech dataset and evaluated on TIMIT and Wall Street Journal benchmarks.

The aggregator consists of 12 layers with 512 channels, introducing skip connections between blocks. Training involves wav2vec context prediction loss for 400k updates, with a batch size of 10 and random cropping of 150,000 frames. A smaller model is used for ablations on the 100h Librispeech subset. Gumbel-Softmax models employ 2 groups and 320 latents per group, projecting features into 640 logits. The model includes an encoder with seven convolutional layers, trained for 40k updates. Gumbel-Softmax models use 2 groups and 320 latents per group, with a linear layer projecting features into 640 logits. The temperature is annealed from 2 to 0.5 over 70% of updates. After training on Librispeech, 13.5k unique codewords combinations are obtained. k-means models use 2 groups and 320 variables per group, yielding 23k unique codewords on full Librispeech.

The BERT base models have 12 layers, model dimension 768, inner dimension 3072, and 12 attention heads. The learning rate is warmed up over the first 10,000 updates to a peak value of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22125, and then linearly decayed over a total of 250k updates. Training is done on 128 GPUs with a batch size of 3072 tokens per GPU. Each token represents 10ms of audio data. For ablations, a smaller setup with model dimension 512, FFN size 2048, 8 attention heads, and dropout 0.05 is used. Models are trained for 250k updates with a batch size of 2 examples per GPU. The acoustic model is wav2letter, trained for 1k epochs on 8 GPUs for both TIMIT and WSJ using the auto segmentation criterion. Decoding on WSJ involves using a lexicon and a separate language model. The curr_chunk discusses training language models on WSJ data and evaluating them on the WSJ speech recognition benchmark. It mentions training a vq-wav2vec model on Librispeech, estimating a BERT model, and training a wav2letter acoustic model on WSJ using different representations. Results show that vq-wav2vec with BERT training achieves a new state of the art of 2.34 WER on nov92.

The large codeword model significantly reduces the gap to the original wav2vec model. Experimenting on TIMIT phoneme recognition, vq-wav2vec and BERT achieve a new state of the art with a 21% error reduction. Training a standard sequence to sequence model on discretized speech also shows promising results. Investigating vq-wav2vec's ability to compress audio data by varying codebook sizes. The study investigates the compression ability of vq-wav2vec by training models with different numbers of groups and variables to vary the codebook size. The experiment explores the tradeoff between bitrate and accuracy on phoneme recognition tasks, comparing vq-wav2vec with other compression algorithms like Codec2, Opus, MP3, and Ogg Vorbis. Algorithms like Codec2, Opus, MP3, and Ogg Vorbis were applied to TIMIT audio data to train wav2vec models. The study showed that vq-wav2vec achieved the best results across various bitrate settings. Masking entire spans of tokens performed better than individual tokens. BERT training on discretized audio data was robust to masking large parts of the input. Vq-wav2vec, a self-supervised algorithm, quantizes unlabeled audio data and improves benchmarks by leveraging BERT pre-training. Future work includes applying other algorithms requiring discrete inputs to audio data and exploring self-supervised pre-training algorithms. In future work, the plan is to explore self-supervised pre-training algorithms for audio data and finetune pre-trained models to output transcriptions. The relationship between variables and groups is investigated, showing that multiple groups are beneficial compared to a single group with many variables.
