    "content": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are defined by the Department of Defense as powered aerial vehicles that do not carry a human operator. They can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, carry a lethal or nonlethal payload, and are not considered ballistic or semiballistic vehicles. UAVs are used in military conflicts and are designed to fly autonomously. They can be a single air vehicle or part of a UAV system consisting of multiple air vehicles, a ground control station, and support equipment. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in military conflicts such as Iraq (2003), Afghanistan (2001), and Kosovo (1999) has highlighted the advantages and disadvantages of UAVs over manned aircraft. UAVs offer advantages such as eliminating the risk to a pilot's life and having aeronautical capabilities not limited by human factors. They are also seen as potentially cheaper to procure and operate. However, the lower procurement cost must be balanced against the higher crash risk, and the safety concerns of unmanned vehicles sharing airspace with manned assets. The growth in UAV employment is attributed to advancements in navigation and communication technology, as well as a shift away from the preference for manned aviation. The employment of UAVs has grown due to advancements in technology and a shift away from the preference for manned aviation. UAVs have a century-old history in aviation, with the Israeli Air Force pioneering several models in the late 1970s and 1980s. The versatility of UAVs was exemplified by the AQM-34 Firebee, which was first flown in the 1970s and later modified to deliver payloads as an armed UAV in 2002. The late 1970s and 1980s saw the integration of UAVs into the United States's inventory, inspired by Israel's successful use of UAVs in Lebanon in 1982. The Reagan Administration's FY1987 budget marked the transition of UAVs from experimental projects to acquisition programs. The Pioneer UAV, acquired from Israel, proved valuable during Operation Desert Storm. The Air Force's Predator quickly added new capabilities and debuted in the Balkans conflict for surveillance missions. Operations in Afghanistan featured the Global Hawk and expanded missions for the Predator UAV. The Predator UAV performed surveillance missions in conflict zones, including monitoring roads for weapons movements and conducting battle damage assessment. The U.S. inventory includes five major UAVs, with increasing investment in unmanned aerial vehicles by Congress. Congress has played a proactive role in UAV program management, directing the formation of joint program offices to ensure commonality between services' UAV programs and expressing concerns about the Pentagon's growing enthusiasm for UAVs. In UAV program management, Congress has directed the formation of joint program offices to ensure commonality between services' programs and expressed concerns about the Pentagon's enthusiasm for UAVs. Congress has advocated for a more aggressive approach to fielding UAVs and predicted that one-third of U.S. military deep strike aircraft will be unmanned within ten years. The pace of UAV development has accelerated, raising questions on cost-efficiency, effectiveness, and interoperability in deploying UAVs. The development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has accelerated in recent years, expanding their missions and applications. Questions arise on cost-efficiency, effectiveness, and interoperability in managing UAV efforts. Congress is assessing if DOD's UAV acquisition plans align with new investment goals. The flexibility and capability of UAVs have led to suggestions that they could take on more missions currently done by manned aircraft. The increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in various roles and applications, not originally intended by their designers, has raised questions about the potential replacement of manned aircraft with unmanned platforms. This shift could have implications for military personnel, recruitment, retention, and the industrial base. The introduction of UAVs on a large scale may lead to concerns about the erosion of skills and technologies needed for manned aircraft design. The potential replacement of manned aircraft with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) raises concerns about the erosion of skills and technologies needed for manned aircraft design. As UAVs are being developed and fielded in growing numbers, questions arise about managing their growth and controlling their proliferation in the international marketplace. Congress may need to balance supporting legitimate U.S. exports with curbing the spread of UAV technologies to dangerous groups or countries. The development and application of UAVs are rapidly increasing, prompting Congress to evaluate their management. UAV programs vary in size and range, from small Micro UAVs to large Global Hawks. The inventory of UAVs has significantly expanded, including second-generation derivatives and non-traditional vehicles. The inventory of unmanned aircraft has grown significantly, with 604 UAVs across five major platforms. This increase is driven by rising demand for UAVs to conduct various missions beyond traditional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance applications. Predator B and modified Predator As now have strike capabilities. The demand for UAVs has increased for a variety of missions beyond traditional ISR applications. Predator B and modified Predator As now have strike capabilities, and the Joint-Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) will target air defenses. DOD's UAV research and development funding has grown significantly, with R&D funding in FY2006 more than double the total procurement funding for UAVs. This suggests that accelerated acquisition of UAVs is likely to continue in the future. Comparing manned aircraft inventories to unmanned inventories may provide useful insights. The pace of UAV acquisition is expected to continue in the future, with UAVs currently representing only 5% of all DoD aircraft. UAVs are seen as complements to manned aircraft rather than replacements. The Defense Science Board recommends accelerating the introduction of UAVs into the force structure. The Air Force plans a significant expansion of UAV operations in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve. The Air Force is planning a significant expansion of UAV operations in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve, with General John Jumper pushing for faster production of UAVs like the Predator. Congress has urged the Department of Defense to speed up UAV acquisition, aiming for one-third of military deep strike aircraft to be unmanned within ten years. In Fiscal Year 2001, the Senate expressed the goal of having one-third of U.S. military deep strike aircraft unmanned within ten years. The House Armed Services Committee supported legislation to weaponize the Predator and Hunter drones, but the Department of Defense opposed it. Some in Congress advocated for increased use of UAVs for non-military roles, while others expressed concerns about the rapid pace of UAV development potentially compromising quality and efficiency. Some in Congress are concerned that an overly ambitious pace in UAV development could compromise quality and efficiency, making congressional oversight difficult. Representative Curt Weldon cautioned against aggressively fielding new vehicles prematurely and highlighted concerns about unauthorized funding and reduced oversight in UAV projects. The Global Hawk's ambitious pace exemplifies this dilemma. The Global Hawk program faces challenges due to an ambitious production schedule and aggressive funding strategy, leading to \"immaturity\" of critical technologies. A Government Accountability Office report suggests a need for a deceleration in pace and management changes to maintain quality and efficiency. Despite arguments for fast production, concerns exist about compromising quality and efficiency in UAV development. The Hunter and Predator aircraft demonstrate the efficiency of a fast pace in producing high-quality aircraft. Congress is concerned about the use of taxpayer dollars in UAV programs and has implemented measures to ensure proper approval for new systems. Congressional scrutiny on DoD's acquisition process has increased due to issues with programs like the Air Force's tanker aircraft lease and the Army's Future Combat System. The 108th and 109th Congresses have focused on the acquisition process of UAVs due to concerns about duplication of effort and cost growth. There are calls for centralization of UAV acquisition authority to prevent wasteful duplication, but some fear it may stifle competition and innovation. The Global Hawk program, for example, is estimated to cost $6.5 billion for 51 aircraft. The Global Hawk program has seen cost growth similar to manned aircraft, with a unit acquisition cost of $128 million per UAV. Factors contributing to cost growth include mission creep and inconsistent management practices, such as adding multiple sensors that increase weight and require larger wings and engines. Originally intended for one primary sensor, the program was changed to be more like the U-2 aircraft. The Global Hawk program has evolved to carry two or more primary sensors, increasing its cost. The Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (JUCAS) has become a large, long-range aircraft with a heavy payload, leading to cost increases. Changes in management and budget cuts have impacted the program, potentially reducing the number of aircraft procured while increasing the cost per aircraft. The frequent realignment of DoD's organizations involved in UAV development highlights the challenges of establishing a comprehensive UAV management system. The management of UAV programs has faced challenges due to frequent organizational changes within the DoD. The Joint Program Office (JPO) and Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office (DARO) were established but faced criticism and were eventually disbanded. Progress in this area has been limited, prompting calls for a comprehensive review by the Secretary of Defense. The Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office (DARO) was created in 1993 to manage DoD's airborne reconnaissance programs, including UAVs. DARO faced criticism, redesigns, and accidents before being disbanded in 1998. Since then, there has been no single procurement focal point for DOD UAV efforts. The Joint UAV Planning Task Force was established in 2001 to increase joint coordination of UAV programs and promote standardization. The Joint UAV Planning Task Force, established in 2001 under the Pentagon's acquisition chief, aims to standardize payload development and promote a common vision for future UAV efforts. Dr. Glenn Lamartin from the OSD emphasized the task force's role in instituting requirements and providing structure to UAV programs. Despite the task force's efforts, Congressional concerns regarding UAV acquisition management and program duplication persisted. In 2002, the House Committee on Armed Services expressed concerns about proper program management for UAV programs. Various management mechanisms were initiated, including the creation of the UAV Interoperability Working Group in 2003. The Joint Requirement Oversight Council established a UAV Special Studies Group to address UAV issues. In 2005, there were reports of potential management restructuring within the OSD. In 2005, the OSD considered appointing a service as the executive agent for UAV programs, but later abandoned the idea in favor of two smaller organizations focusing on interoperability. The Joint UAV Overarching Integrated Product Team addresses major interoperability issues, while the Joint UAV Center of Excellence coordinates to enhance UAV applications through technology examination and training. Management initiatives have aimed to increase system uniformity and interoperability. The establishment of the Joint UAV OIPT and Joint UAV COE by JROC aims to promote joint coordination of production and enhance UAV applications through technology examination and training. The GAO testimony in March 2005 criticized the lack of oversight in UAV development efforts, leading to the creation of these management groups by the OSD. This suggests ongoing organizational changes in UAV management within the DoD. The testimony criticized DoD for the lack of oversight in UAV development efforts, leading to the creation of management groups by the OSD. The GAO envisioned a centralized authority for oversight, while DoD's UAV Center of Excellence serves as a 'one-stop shop' for coordinating UAV development. Questions remain on where final management authority lies, which may require Congress to address in the future. The GAO questions the final management authority for UAVs within DoD and services, suggesting Congress may need to address this issue. The 2005 UAS Roadmap calls for a strategic plan to outline inter-service goals and investment priorities for UAVs. The 2005 UAS Roadmap lacks clearly defined investment priorities for UAVs and does not authorize specific UAS or prioritize requirements. It provides guidance on future technology capabilities but does not establish a definitive plan for UAV development paths. The discrepancy between the DoD's approach and the GAO's vision may lead to significant debate on future UAV management. Congress may revisit GAO recommendations to evaluate the Roadmap's mandate for integrating UAVs. In the wake of the establishment of the Joint UAV OIPT and COE, Congress may revisit GAO recommendations to evaluate the Roadmap mandate for integrating UAVs into future warfighting capabilities. Developing a coordinated DOD-wide UAV investment strategy is crucial to avoid duplication and maximize scarce resources. Congress plays a key role in arbitrating between competing UAV investments and impacting DOD's investment plan. Key questions include quantifying UAV cost, balancing spending between UAVs and manned aircraft, and maximizing UAV capabilities through strategic investments. Quantifying UAV cost is crucial for maximizing capabilities and balancing spending between UAVs and manned aircraft. UAV costs can be measured by flyaway cost and program acquisition unit cost (PAUC). Flyaway cost includes prime mission equipment, systems engineering, program management, and allowances for engineering changes and warranties. PAUC is the total of all acquisition-related appropriations divided by the total quantity of fully configured end items. The difference between Global Hawk's PAUC and flyaway cost highlights the discrepancy in cost descriptions. When comparing UAV costs to manned aircraft, analysts need to consider the supporting elements and operational infrastructure that make up the complete unmanned aviation system. Monitoring UAV costs can be complicated by budgeting conventions, as different services may categorize UAV funding requests differently in their budget documentation. Monitoring UAV costs can be complicated by budgeting conventions, as different services categorize funding requests differently. Establishing a uniform cost comparison mechanism is crucial for Congress to balance spending between UAVs and manned aircraft. The DoD is projected to have spent over $18 billion on UAVs from 2001-2010 if the upward trend in funding continues. If UAV funding continues to rise, the DoD is projected to spend over $18 billion on UAVs from 2001-2010, far exceeding the $3.5 billion spent in the previous decade. Funding for Joint Unmanned Combat Air System is expected to surpass $1 billion by FY2011, indicating a potential shift in DoD's funding priorities. UAV funding is expected to remain under 10% of total military aviation spending from FY2006 to FY2011. The chart shows that UAV funding will remain under 10% of total military aviation spending from FY2006 to FY2011. Cost savings from UAVs are debated, as critics argue that savings from not having a pilot must be applied to ground control operations. UAVs may have a lower acquisition cost than manned aircraft, but the overall system cost is not always cheaper due to training and maintenance expenses. The cost comparison between UAVs and manned aircraft is complex. While UAVs may have a lower acquisition cost, the overall system cost can be higher due to training, maintenance, and reliability issues. Studies have shown that replacing manned aircraft with UAVs may not always result in significant cost savings. The DoD studied comparative costs of manned vs. unmanned aircraft, finding savings in procurement costs. Concerns arise over rising prices of UAVs, including high-tech ones like Global Hawk. Former Air Force Secretary James Roche noted that sensors increase air vehicle costs. The cost of UAVs is increasing due to expensive sensors, with sensor payloads representing a significant portion of the overall cost. This rise in sensor costs is attributed to growing demand and limited competition in the market. Some suggest equipping UAVs with self-protection devices to reflect their non-expendable nature. Two approaches to balancing cost and capability include using smaller, interconnected UAVs or investing in self-protection measures. There are two schools of thought for UAV employment to balance cost with capability. One approach is to use many smaller, less expensive UAVs controlled through a highly interconnected network. Another approach is to use fewer, more expensive UAVs like the Global Hawk, which operates independently. Both approaches have faced delays and funding reductions since 2003. The Army's Future Combat System, Global Hawk, and J-UCAS program have all faced delays and funding cuts since 2003. Interoperability, reliability, force multiplication/autonomy, and engine systems are key areas of investment for maximizing effectiveness of UAVs. Lack of interoperability could lead to the Department of Defense losing interest in UAVs. The Department of Defense emphasizes the importance of interoperability for UAVs to effectively communicate with each other and ground components. Lack of interconnectivity has hindered missions in the past, prompting the need for improved communication systems. OSD is investing in advancing UAV interoperability to enhance situational awareness and overall effectiveness in battlefield operations. Advancing UAV interoperability is a critical part of OSD's investment plans. The DoD aims to establish inter-communication between UAVs to facilitate interoperability in four categories: situational awareness, payload transfer, weapons coordination, and air vehicle control. Despite the framework being in place, technology development has been slow. The House of Representatives has taken steps to encourage inter-platform communication. The House of Representatives version of the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1815) included a clause requiring all tactical unmanned aerial vehicles to be equipped with the Tactical Common Data Link for real-time situational awareness. The 2005 Unmanned Aircraft Systems Roadmap aims to expand this communication system to all large UAVs for improved interoperability. Investment in the Common Data Link system is crucial for achieving the level of interoperability envisioned by the OSD. The OSD envisions achieving interoperability for UAVs through the Common Data Link system, requiring investment for efficient development. Limited bandwidth poses a challenge for expanding UAV applications, with increased demand for bandwidth in modern warfare. The military may not have enough bandwidth to support multiple UAVs downloading data simultaneously, leading to platforms sitting idle due to inadequate bandwidth. In a House Armed Services Committee hearing, Representative Curt Weldon highlighted the issue of inadequate bandwidth hindering the effective use of UAVs. The OSD confirmed that UAVs in Iraq and Afghanistan are unable to operate due to limited information transfer capacity. The Transformation Satellite Communications (TSAT) project aims to address this by providing unlimited communication capabilities, but funding cutbacks may delay deployment until 2015-2016. A more autonomous UAV is suggested as a temporary solution to reduce bandwidth requirements. The multibillion-dollar project, known as \"the internet in the sky\", may face funding cutbacks and is expected to be deployed between 2015 and 2016. One solution to the bandwidth problem is operating UAVs from a manned stand-off aircraft, reducing reliance on satellites for communication and addressing pilot manpower issues. Experimentation is ongoing in controlling UAVs' sensor payload from the air. Investment in reliability upgrades for UAVs is a high priority, as indicated by the Defense Science Board. UAV mishap rates are higher than those of manned aircraft, with ongoing experimentation in controlling sensor payload from the air. The Defense Science Board notes that manned aircraft have improved their mishap rates over the years through system design advancements and reliability upgrades. The Defense Science Board emphasizes the need for reliability upgrades for UAVs to reduce their relatively high mishap rates. The report suggests that investments in system design advancements and weather durability improvements could significantly lower mishap rates. Additionally, it points out that comparing the mishap rates of developmental UAVs with manned aircraft may be unfair, as the latter have undergone decades of modernization and refinement. The 2005 UAS Roadmap proposes investments in emerging technologies like self-repairing \"smart\" flight systems to further improve UAV reliability. The DSB's report suggests that nominal upgrades and investments could reduce UAV mishap rates. The 2005 UAS Roadmap proposes investments in emerging technologies like self-repairing flight control systems and advanced materials to enhance reliability. One technological priority is enabling one ground operator to pilot multiple UAVs simultaneously. The goal for UAV manufacturers and users is to reduce the operator-vehicle ratio to 2:1 and eventually have one operator control multiple vehicles. This advancement would require significant time and investment in control technologies. Investment in control technologies, specifically distributed control technologies, is crucial for advancing UAV autonomy. The Global Hawk and Scan Eagle have automated flight capabilities, but their autonomy levels vary. The OSD quantifies UAV autonomy on a scale of one to ten, with a level of at least eight needed for single-pilot control. Currently, the Global Hawk has an ACL of approximately 2.5, while future plans aim for autonomous flight levels of six for combat UAVs. The Global Hawk currently has an ACL of 2.5, with plans to increase it to six for combat UAVs. The FAA, UAV industry, and Department of Defense are working on \"see and avoid\" technology to increase the standard ACL for UAVs to four. Inter-UAV communication and interoperability are crucial for autonomous flight abilities. The goal is for one operator to control a network of intelligence collecting drones, with advancements already underway allowing one operator to pilot up to four UAVs. The Air Force recently evaluated a Predator upgrade allowing one operator to control four UAVs. The next step is to consolidate tasks into fewer operators. Heavy fuel burning engines are a top priority for UAV investment, urged by the Defense Science Board. Enrique J. Enriguez testified on the military's need for heavy fuel engines. Enrique J. Enriguez, President of Locust USA, Inc., emphasized the military's need for heavy fuel engines for UAVs due to their performance benefits and cost-effectiveness compared to standard engines. Despite some drawbacks, the integration of heavy fuel engines could significantly improve UAVs' capabilities and reduce maintenance costs. The integration of heavy fuel engines in UAVs could improve reliability, reduce costs, and increase efficiency. However, there are challenges in designing engines for lighter UAVs. An alternative being considered is a modified fuel cell that could double efficiency and reduce detection. Air Combat Command is sponsoring the project. Some may question if the DoD has a coherent plan for UAV roles and applications, wondering if they are being applied aggressively enough. Most UAVs are used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, with ISR UAVs projected to dominate until 2014. The Air Combat Command is sponsoring a project to use fuel cells in smaller UAVs to increase efficiency and reduce detection. ISR UAVs are primarily used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. The DoD's major UAV programs have shown a diversification of missions, with a rapid growth in overall programs. Concerns have been raised about potential duplication in production and the difficulty of building joint manned aircraft in the past. The development of ISR UAVs raises concerns about potential duplication in production and the need for joint decision-making on new programs. Congress questions the necessity of different UAVs with similar performance capabilities, such as the Navy's request for a new maritime surveillance UAV instead of purchasing the Global Hawk. Performance specifications show that most ISR-capable UAVs have endurance of 4 to 8 hours, altitude of 10,000-20,000 ft, max speeds between 105 and 125 knots, and radiuses of 100 to 150 nm. The debate over the necessity of different UAVs with similar performance capabilities continues, with critics questioning the need for duplication in production. Proponents argue that the variety of UAVs reflects specific mission needs and user services, taking into account factors such as landing/takeoff capabilities, durability, storage requirements, and overall cost. The role of UAVs in combat missions has increased significantly in recent years. In recent years, the role of UAVs in combat missions has significantly increased. Various UAV models are now equipped with different munitions for offensive applications. Comparisons between manned and unmanned aircraft in terms of cost and effectiveness are crucial in determining the attractiveness of using UAVs for combat operations. Comparisons between manned and unmanned aircraft in terms of cost and effectiveness are crucial in determining the attractiveness of using UAVs for combat operations. The cost per pound of munitions delivered is higher for the Predator B compared to the F-16, which can carry a larger payload and perform more missions. Manned aircraft may generally prove more cost-effective for air-to-ground combat, while UAVs may be more valuable in niche circumstances where manned aircraft are at risk. UAVs are also useful for electronic attack and psychological operations. UAVs are valuable in niche circumstances where manned aircraft are at risk, such as electronic attack and psychological operations. They are also being considered for missions like delivering medical supplies and homeland defense. Congressional support exists for using UAVs for border security. Interest is growing in using UAVs for various domestic purposes. Interest is growing in using UAVs for a variety of domestic roles, including law enforcement surveillance, security monitoring of hazardous cargo trucks, measuring radiation in the atmosphere, and transport during civil unrest. UAVs could also be utilized for forest fire detection in sparsely populated areas and in \"consequence management\" and relief efforts after natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina. UAVs have various potential uses in domestic roles, such as law enforcement surveillance, security monitoring of hazardous cargo trucks, and measuring radiation in the atmosphere. They could also be used for forest fire detection in sparsely populated areas and in \"consequence management\" and relief efforts after natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina. Countries like South Korea and Japan have been using UAVs for agricultural purposes for decades. However, for UAVs to play a role in homeland security, FAA regulations and flight requirements need to align. The FAA has granted the Air Force a certificate of authorization for national airspace operation, signaling progress in reconciling these discrepancies. Upgrading UAVs collision avoidance capabilities is crucial for reaching common ground with airspace regulations. The FAA's certificate of authorization for national airspace operation marks progress in reconciling discrepancies. Upgrading UAVs collision avoidance capabilities is crucial for reaching common ground with airspace regulations. The integration of UAVs into national airspace may face challenges, with NASA's cancellation of funding for Access 5 hindering UAV development. Advocates for UAVs are concerned about the cancellation of funding for Access 5, which could impede UAV development and their global applications. There is potential for large UAVs to take on aerial refueling tasks currently done by manned tanker aircraft. The Global Hawk has already demonstrated capabilities for trans-oceanic flights, indicating potential for UAVs in similar missions. Additionally, there is ongoing experimentation with equipping UAVs for air-to-air combat missions. The United States is exploring the use of UAVs for air-to-air combat missions, with a Predator reportedly engaging in combat with an Iraqi fighter aircraft. This development, though in its early stages, shows potential for UAVs in aggressive missions. Other platforms like manned aircraft, blimps, and space satellites also have their advantages and disadvantages for these roles. The use of UAVs for aggressive missions is being explored, with potential for manned aircraft, blimps, and space satellites as alternative platforms. Defense contractors are developing unmanned blimps for various roles, including border monitoring. These platforms offer advantages such as decreased fuel dependency but lack maneuverability compared to UAVs like the Global Hawk. Major UAV manufacturers aim to have operational systems by 2010 for diverse missions. The drawbacks of lighter-than-air platforms include limited maneuverability and speed compared to UAVs like the Global Hawk. Space satellites offer benefits such as advanced capabilities but can be cumbersome to task and have limited capacity. Some satellites lack loitering capability and high costs of space launches are leading to consideration of UAVs for communication relays. Concerns about mass UAV production replacing manned aircraft are raised, warning of potential degradation of pilot skills and loss of tactical flexibility. The pace of UAV production may lead to a significant replacement of manned aircraft. Critics warn that relying on unmanned vehicles could degrade pilot skills and reduce tactical flexibility in combat operations. The Air Force is working to encourage pilots to see piloting UAVs as a major mission and offer incentives for rated pilots to fly UAVs. There are concerns about recruitment and retention as more UAVs are fielded, with some believing that those inclined to join the military would prefer to fly manned aircraft. The impact of increased UAV use on recruitment and retention in the military is complex. While some believed that more UAVs would deter individuals from joining due to a preference for manned aircraft, the actual situation varies among services. The Air Force and Navy are actively reducing uniformed personnel, while the Army faces recruitment challenges. Qualifications for UAV operators differ across services, with the Air Force requiring pilot-rated officers for certain UAVs. The Air Force requires pilot-rated officers to operate certain UAVs, while other services do not have this requirement. Enlisting in the military to operate UAVs may appeal to individuals who are unable to fly manned aircraft due to physical limitations. Flying armed UAVs may be more attractive to personnel inclined to fly manned aircraft. Additionally, flying UAVs can be seen as a compromise, offering the opportunity to \"fly\" without some of the hardships associated with manned aircraft. The Air Force believes that operating UAVs from control stations in the United States may be appealing to some Reservists and Guardsmen. The Air Force requires pilot-rated officers to operate certain UAVs, which may appeal to individuals unable to fly manned aircraft due to physical limitations. Operating UAVs can be seen as a compromise, offering the opportunity to \"fly\" without some of the hardships associated with manned aircraft. The Air Force believes that flying UAVs from control stations in the United States may attract Reservists and Guardsmen disinclined to experience an active duty lifestyle consistent with flying manned aircraft. Some UAVs, like the Global Hawk, are pre-programmed and operate autonomously, not requiring a pilot. As UAV technology advances, the policy of requiring pilot-rated officers to operate UAVs may be reviewed. Increased UAV deployment could potentially boost enlistment in other specialties if they are perceived as effective in their missions. Increased UAV deployment could potentially boost enlistment in other specialties if they are perceived as effective in their missions. Congress is faced with defense industrial base issues such as foreign dependency, subsidies for competitors, and promoting competition. The DoD's pursuit of UAVs raises concerns about funding for manned aircraft programs. The DoD's pursuit of UAVs raises concerns about funding for manned aircraft programs and the potential erosion of technical expertise in designing manned combat aircraft. Some argue that focusing on UAVs could harm the industrial base, while others believe the industry is naturally evolving towards advanced UAV production. Critics fear that concentrating on unmanned aircraft design could lead to the loss of crucial skills and technologies, potentially weakening U.S. dominance in tactical aircraft design. Some proponents argue that focusing solely on unmanned aircraft design could lead to the loss of crucial skills and technologies needed for manned combat aircraft, potentially weakening U.S. dominance in tactical aircraft design. However, others believe that there is commonality between manned and unmanned combat aircraft, and major defense contractors are already shifting towards unmanned aircraft design to stay competitive. UAVs are playing a significant role in warfare, and the skills and technologies required for building manned aircraft can also be applied to unmanned aviation design. UAVs are becoming increasingly important in warfare, with major defense contractors like Boeing and Northrop Grumman shifting towards unmanned aircraft design. The global UAV market is growing rapidly, with expenditures expected to double by 2014. Maintaining a strong U.S. defense industrial base may depend on how well U.S. firms compete in the global UAV market. The global UAV market is projected to grow rapidly, with expenditures expected to double by 2014. Capturing this new business and nurturing expertise in UAV technology areas would help keep U.S. industry competitive. Concerns about UAV proliferation and export controls have been discussed in Congress. The 108th and 109th Congresses have expressed concern over UAV and cruise missile proliferation due to difficulties in controlling their components, making them accessible to various countries and non-state actors. There are fears that UAVs and cruise missiles could become cost-effective weapons, posing a threat as a \"poor man's air force.\" UAV proliferation is a concern due to their cost-effective nature as potential weapons. The George W. Bush Administration has expressed worry over the military effectiveness of UAVs in the wrong hands, especially in regards to potential attacks with weapons of mass destruction. Foreign companies are gaining access to key technologies that could enhance UAV capabilities, raising concerns about potential exports of advanced technology. Policymakers may need to address issues related to UAV proliferation and consider steps to prevent it. As the use of UAVs increases in the DoD and U.S. companies seek international business opportunities, Congress may need to address policy issues regarding UAV proliferation. Questions arise about preventing the dissemination of critical UAV technologies, balancing military aid to allies with concerns about weapon system proliferation, and revising non-proliferation accords to control UAV spread. Additionally, the effectiveness of UAVs in reducing collateral damage versus the risk of enemy acquisition and use against the U.S. is a key consideration. The section discusses potential acquisition of UAVs by enemy groups and the need to revise non-proliferation accords to control UAV spread. It focuses on the program status and funding of prominent DoD UAV programs, excluding smaller man-portable UAVs with limited range and loiter time. These smaller UAVs are popular with ground forces but are not weaponized. The smaller man-portable UAVs are not weaponized and do not receive detailed cost documentation like major UAV programs. While individually popular with ground forces, they may start competing with larger UAV programs for congressional attention and funding. The MQ-1 Predator, developed by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, is the most recognizable UAV in the Department of Defense, known for its surveillance and armament capabilities. It has led to the development of related UAVs for various missions. The MQ-1 Predator is a medium-altitude, long-endurance UAV used for reconnaissance and target acquisition. It has long, thin wings and operates at 10,000 to 15,000 feet, with the ability to reach 25,000 feet. The Air Force's Predator fleet is operated by multiple squadrons in Nevada, with the CIA also reportedly operating several Predators. The Predator UAV is primarily used for reconnaissance and target acquisition, equipped with surveillance payloads including electro-optical and infrared cameras, a Multi-Spectral Targeting System sensor ball, and synthetic aperture radar. It also has satellite communications for beyond line-of-sight operations and the ability to carry Hellfire missiles since 2001. The MQ-1 Predator UAV, now designated as MQ-1, was upgraded with Hellfire missiles in 2001 for precision attacks. The MQ-9 Predator B, or \"Predator B\", is a follow-on model optimized for surveillance, target acquisition, and armed engagement, with improved capabilities and larger dimensions compared to its predecessor. The Predator B is a medium-to-high altitude, long endurance UAV optimized for surveillance, target acquisition, and armed engagement. It is longer and has a larger wingspan than the A-model, with a more powerful engine allowing for higher altitude, speed, endurance, and range. It can carry up to 16 Hellfire missiles or a mix of other weapons, significantly increasing its ordinance capacity. Additionally, it features an upgraded camera gimbal for extended range surveillance. The Predator B-Extended Range or \"Mariner\" is a hybrid UAV created by General Atomics for the Navy's Broad Area Maritime Surveillance program. It combines the airframe of the Predator B with the wings of NASA's Altair UAV, allowing for altitudes of 50,000 feet and a flight endurance of 49 hours. Partnered with Lockheed Martin, it features an exterior-mounted maritime radar for advanced surveillance capabilities. General Atomic has partnered with Lockheed Martin System and Sensors to integrate a maritime radar on the Mariner UAV, aiming to enhance surveillance capabilities. The Mariner is set to compete with Northrop Grumman's Global Hawk for the BAMS contract, with a target flyaway cost of $19 million per vehicle. Additionally, General Atomics is developing the Predator C, a third-generation UAV with a turbo-jet engine for long-endurance, high-altitude missions. The Predator C will not directly compete with the Global Hawk. The Army currently uses the I-Gnat as a temporary replacement for the RQ-5 Hunter, describing it as a smaller version of the Predator UAV. The Army uses the I-Gnat-ER as a temporary replacement for the RQ-5 Hunter UAV. It is a downsized version of the Predator UAV, with similar system and performance characteristics. The I-Gnat-ER can stay aloft for 30 hours, lacks SAR and BLOS capabilities, and has a shorter flight radius. The Army owns three I-Gnat vehicles, with two more expected to be delivered by the end of 2005.
