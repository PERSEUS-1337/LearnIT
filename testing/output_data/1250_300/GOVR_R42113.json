    "content": "Corporate tax revenues have decreased in importance relative to other revenue sources over time. In the post-World War II era, corporate tax revenue peaked in 1952 at 6.1% of GDP but has since declined to approximately 1.3% of GDP. Federal tax revenues have remained relatively stable, averaging around 17.7% of GDP since 1946. Payroll tax revenue has increased while excise tax revenue has decreased. The corporate tax generated 32.1% of all federal tax revenue in 1952. The corporate tax revenue has decreased in importance over time, from 32.1% of federal revenue in 1952 to 8.9% currently. Factors such as tax rate reductions and changes in the tax base have contributed to this decline. The decline in corporate tax revenues may be due to a reduction in corporate tax rates, a reduction in the corporate tax base, or both. The effective tax rate has decreased from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010, contributing to lower corporate tax revenue. The reduction in the top statutory rate from around 50% in the 1950s to 35% currently has also played a role in the decline. The reduction in corporate tax revenues is driven by three main factors: a decrease in the top statutory rate from around 50% in the 1950s to 35% currently, the availability of investment tax credits between 1962 and 1986, and the Section 199 deductions for certain activities since 2004. These factors have effectively lowered the corporate tax rate below the statutory rate. The reduction in corporate tax revenues is driven by factors such as the decrease in the top statutory rate, availability of investment tax credits, and Section 199 deductions for certain activities. Changes in depreciation rules also contributed to lower effective tax rates, with accelerated depreciation and investment tax credits having a larger impact compared to other factors like inflation and foreign tax credits. The effective corporate tax rate has fluctuated due to factors like accelerated depreciation, investment tax credits, and recession periods. Businesses can offset losses to reduce taxes paid in previous years, but in times of large losses like during a recession, the two-year carryback period may not be sufficient. This results in struggling corporations facing higher taxes and smaller tax refunds. In response to struggling corporations facing higher taxes and smaller refunds during recessions, Congress extended the carryback period from two to five years in 2002 and 2008 to stimulate the economy. The decline in corporate tax revenue is not solely due to lower effective tax rates but also because more business income is generated by partnerships and S corporations, which are not subject to corporate income tax. In 1980, C corporations generated 78% of all business income in the United States, but by 2007, they were responsible for only 44%. Meanwhile, partnerships' share of income rose from 3% to 28%, and S corporations' share rose from 1% to nearly 17%. This shift in income distribution from the corporate sector to the noncorporate sector has led to a smaller corporate tax base and a drop in corporate tax revenues. Additionally, the distribution of businesses changed, with C corporations accounting for 17% of all businesses in 1980, but only 6% by 2007. S corporations, on the other hand, increased in popularity, especially after the Tax Reform Act of 1986. S corporations became more popular after the Tax Reform Act of 1986, with the shareholder limit increasing from 35 to 100. By 2007, S corporations represented 12% of businesses, up from 4% in 1980. Corporate profitability, measured by the profit to asset ratio, has declined since 1966. The profit to asset ratio summarizes corporate sector profitability, which has declined since 1966. Economists attribute this decline to factors such as a shift to more volatile industries and a younger age profile of corporations. The decline in corporate sector profitability since 1966 can be attributed to several factors. These include corporations shifting profits to lower-tax countries, younger firms being less profitable, and a decrease in the average effective corporate tax rate over time. Additionally, discrepancies in income reported for tax purposes versus financial accounting purposes have been documented, leading to a decline in corporate tax revenues over the last six decades. Corporate tax revenues have been declining for the last six decades due to factors such as the decrease in the average effective corporate tax rate, the rise of pass-through business structures, and the fall in corporate sector profitability. Understanding these reasons is crucial for the ongoing tax reform debate, which focuses on reducing statutory rates and broadening the tax base. The ongoing tax reform debate aims to reduce statutory rates and achieve revenue neutrality by broadening the tax base through eliminating deductions, exemptions, and credits. Research suggests that reducing the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 25% would require repealing all corporate tax expenditures and making reforms to business taxation. Other reforms may include changes to the taxation of American multinationals operating overseas to reduce profit shifting. The ongoing tax reform debate aims to reduce statutory rates and achieve revenue neutrality by broadening the tax base through eliminating deductions, exemptions, and credits. Business tax reforms may include changes to the taxation of American multinationals operating overseas, reducing profit shifting. The section provides an overview of the mathematics behind calculating the average effective tax rates. Table A-1 shows data sources and variables for the calculation. The equation for the average effective tax corporate tax rate (AECTR) is presented."
