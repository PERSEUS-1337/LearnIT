    "content": "In enacting the Clean Air Act of 1970, Congress differentiated between existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. Existing sources were given flexibility by states to set emission limits, while new sources had to adhere to strict technology-based standards set by the EPA. The 1977 amendments further strengthened regulations in areas where air quality exceeded national standards. The Clean Air Act of 1970 differentiated between existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. New sources must adhere to strict technology-based standards set by the EPA, including obtaining pre-construction permits with emission limits based on best available control technology or lowest achievable emission rate. The 1977 amendments strengthened regulations in areas where air quality exceeded national standards, requiring new sources to undergo New Source Review (NSR) before construction. The issue of RMRR arises because the CAA applies NSPSs and NSR not only to newly constructed sources but also to modifications of existing sources. The Clean Air Act of 1970 established regulations for new stationary sources of air pollution, requiring adherence to strict standards set by the EPA. The 1977 amendments strengthened regulations in areas with poor air quality, mandating New Source Review (NSR) for new sources and modifications of existing sources. The key issue is determining what changes to a stationary source constitute a \"modification,\" which is defined as any physical change or change in operation that increases emissions or results in new emissions. The definition of a \"modification\" under the Clean Air Act determines which changes in a source trigger NSPSs and NSR. It only applies to changes that increase emissions, leaving many questions unanswered. A \"reconstruction\" is defined as replacing components of a facility to such an extent that the fixed capital cost exceeds 50% of building a new facility. This can trigger NSPSs and NSR, regardless of whether it is a modification or reconstruction. The EPA's definition of \"modification\" under the Clean Air Act includes six exceptions for changes in a stationary source that do not trigger heightened pollution-control requirements. One of the debated exceptions is for maintenance, repair, and replacement (RMRR), which was previously determined on a case-by-case basis. The eligibility for the RMRR exemption was based on factors such as the nature, extent, purpose, frequency, and cost of the proposed work. The EPA's regulations did not specify the activities included as RMRR, eligibility was determined through case-by-case analysis. In the case of WEPCO, the court ruled that the proposed renovations went beyond RMRR due to the substantial and unprecedented extent of the work. The Seventh Circuit ruled in WEPCO that the proposed renovations exceeded RMRR due to the substantial and unprecedented extent of the work. The RMRR exemption has been a focus in recent years, with CAA enforcement actions filed against electric utilities for changes exceeding routine maintenance. President Bush's National Energy Policy directed EPA to review NSR impact on investment and environmental protection, leading to a report in June 2002. The EPA's report in June 2002 highlighted the impact of NSR on investment in new utility and refinery generation capacity, energy efficiency, and environmental protection. In December 2002, the EPA published final regulations affecting how emission increases are calculated for NSR purposes. Additionally, the EPA proposed a rule to clarify the RMRR exception by specifying activity categories that qualify as routine maintenance. The Eleventh Circuit's decision in EPA v. Whitman addressed violations of the CAA by the TVA for projects exceeding RMRR without permits. The TVA violated the CAA through rehabilitation projects at coal-fired power plants without permits. An administrative compliance order (ACO) was issued, but the Eleventh Circuit ruled that EPA must prove violations in court. The RMRR exception was reshaped in October 2003 with a final rule on equipment replacement activities. The October, 2003 final rule reshaped the RMRR exception by declaring certain equipment replacement activities as per se RMRR. This new approach aims to provide greater regulatory certainty without hindering the safe and efficient operation of existing plants. EPA's final action on part of the December, 2002 proposal does not include the proposed annual maintenance, repair, and replacement \"allowance.\" The replacement of components with identical or functional equivalents constitutes RMRR under the new rule. The new rule specifies that replacing components of a process unit with identical or functional equivalents constitutes RMRR if the replacement cost is less than 20% of the current replacement value, does not change the unit's design parameters, and meets emission limitations. This approach allows for more replacements compared to the former case-by-case method, with the latter remaining as an alternative. The rule does not require recordkeeping, relying on existing business records and EPA's inspection authority for enforcement. The new rule on equipment-replacement RMRR specifies criteria for determining when replacements qualify, aiming to reduce the need for case-by-case assessments. It does not impose recordkeeping requirements, relying on existing business records and EPA inspections for enforcement. Legal challenges have been filed against the rule, with a stay granted pending further review. On December 24, 2003, the court granted petitioners' motion to stay the rule pending full review, citing irreparable harm and likelihood of success on the merits. The new rule, set to take effect on December 26, 2003, was suspended, reverting to the old case-by-case approach. The court also declined to consolidate the cases with another group challenging a previous rule but designated the same panel for both sets of cases due to their related nature."
