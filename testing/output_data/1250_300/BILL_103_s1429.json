    "content": "The Act titled \"Women and AIDS Research Initiative Amendments of 1993\" establishes a program for research on women and AIDS. This program is added to the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary shall establish a program for biomedical and behavioral research on HIV cases in women, including prevention research. Research will focus on transmission of HIV to women, prevention measures, and clinical trials on preventing HIV through treating sexually transmitted diseases. Research on prevention measures for HIV in women includes studying sexually transmitted diseases that may facilitate virus transmission, developing rapid and affordable diagnostic tests, single-dose therapy, prevention methods for women, and programs to reduce substance abuse. Additionally, research covers symptoms such as gynecological, breast, hormonal, and menstrual changes resulting from HIV infection. Research on prevention measures for HIV in women includes studying sexually transmitted diseases that may facilitate virus transmission, developing rapid and affordable diagnostic tests, single-dose therapy, prevention methods for women, and programs to reduce substance abuse. Clinical trials for women infected with HIV involve gynecological evaluations to assess their medical status before participation, ensuring appropriate follow-up services. The Secretary conducts clinical trials to analyze the relationship between gynecological conditions and HIV infection, determine the effectiveness of standard treatments for these conditions, and evaluate the effectiveness of treatment protocols approved for men on women with HIV. The Secretary supports clinical trials to determine if treatment protocols approved for men are effective for women with the virus. Support services, including transportation, child care, medical and mental health services, and addressing domestic violence, are provided to women participating in clinical trials. Prevention programs are also implemented. The Secretary supports clinical trials for women with HIV, including training for trial conductors. Prevention programs focus on barrier methods for sexually transmitted diseases, prioritizing research needs identified at NIH meetings. The Institutes of Health sponsored meeting in May 1993 focused on the development of topical microbicides, including research on early infectious processes, formulation of new preparations, clinical testing for safety and efficacy, and studies on the acceptability of microbicides. The Secretary will conduct epidemiological research to determine risk factors for HIV infection in women, including the use of contraceptive methods, tampons, and the relationship with other sexually transmitted diseases. The Secretary is conducting research on various aspects related to HIV infection in women, including the use of contraceptive methods, tampons, the relationship with other sexually transmitted diseases, substance abuse, and sexual activity. Additionally, the Women's Interagency HIV Study aims to monitor the progression of HIV infection in women and ensure the inclusion of at least 5,000 infected women in the study. The Women's Interagency HIV Study includes at least 5,000 women with HIV infection, conducted at multiple sites over 8 years. It focuses on the relationship between CD4 cells and serious illnesses in women, addressing gynecological and other conditions specific to women. For surveillance purposes, the list of conditions arising from HIV infection is maintained by the CDC Director. The term 'human immunodeficiency virus' refers to the agent causing AIDS. Authorizations of appropriations are specified for clinical trials funding in fiscal years 1994-1996. Authorizations of appropriations are specified for prevention programs in fiscal years 1994-1996, with varying amounts allocated for different subsections. Authorizations of appropriations are specified for prevention programs in fiscal years 1994-1996, with $10,000,000 authorized for subsection (d)(2) and $15,000,000 authorized for an interagency study in subsection (e) for each fiscal year."
