Investors and speculators took advantage of the rapidly rising market values, leading to a significant market crash. The Nikkei stock market average peaked in 1989 at 40,000 and dropped by 50% in one year, eventually plummeting by more than 78% by the end of 2002. The burst of the bubbles had a severe impact on Japan's economy, with banks suffering losses from their equity holdings. Japan's Nikkei stock market average peaked in 1989 at 40,000, dropping by 50% in one year and more than 78% by the end of 2002. Japan's banks suffered significant losses as the value of unrealized capital gains on stock holdings decreased from $355 billion in 1989 to about $40 billion in 2002. Commercial land values in major metropolitan areas fell by 80% from their peak in 1991, causing a financial and banking crisis that slowed the overall Japanese economy. Excess capacity, inventories, and lower profits plagued companies as more loans turned sour and real estate had to be sold at bargain prices. In the aftermath of the economic crisis in Japan, companies faced excess capacity, inventories, and lower profits due to non-performing loans and the sale of real estate at discounted prices. Unlike the US, Japanese financial institutions did not heavily rely on derivatives or collateralized debt obligations. Commercial lending in Japan was often based on relationships rather than market factors, leading to many loans turning sour. The bursting of Japan's stock and real estate bubbles in 1989 and 1990 led to an extended L-shaped recession in the 1990s, with economic growth rates falling significantly. Despite a temporary recovery in 1996, the economy fell back into recession in 1998 and 1999 due to fiscal policy tightening and the Asian Financial Crisis. Growth remained weak in the early 2000s, with economic growth rates never fully recovering to pre-crisis levels. The bursting of Japan's stock and real estate bubbles in 1989 and 1990 led to an extended L-shaped recession in the 1990s. The government's initial strategy during the banking crisis was forbearance, protecting depositors and assisting in mergers of failed institutions to prevent major banks from sinking. The government intervened extensively during the banking crisis in Japan to prevent major banks from sinking. They encouraged stronger banks to help weaker ones, leading to the creation of the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Company in 1992 to dispose of non-performing loans. Top banks sold \u00a51.3 trillion in non-performing loans to the CCPC in 1993. The Cooperative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC) in Japan was created in 1992 to handle non-performing loans, similar to the Resolution Trust Corporation in the US. In 1993, top banks sold \u00a51.3 trillion in non-performing loans to the CCPC, which accounted for 54% of all loans written off that year. The CCPC operated by having the selling bank extend credit for the purchase cost of the loan, allowing the bank to claim a capital loss for tax purposes. The CCPC recovered about half of the underlying value of the non-performing loans through asset sales. The government aimed to keep banks afloat by using profits and capital gains from equity holdings to fund bad loan write-offs. Despite the decline in stock prices, banks in Japan were able to fund write-offs of bad loans using profits from operations and capital gains from equity holdings. The Bank of Japan's low interest rate policy allowed banks to generate higher profits, but nonperforming loans continued to increase. Japan's government announced multiple stimulus packages between 1992 and 1995, providing fiscal stimulus to the economy. In 1995, Japan's economy worsened following the bankruptcy of specialized housing loan companies. The government's rescue operation in 1996 to purchase assets from ailing lenders was politically unpopular. By 1995, the burst speculative bubble issue was resolved, but weak fiscal, monetary, and supervision policies led to a prolonged economic downturn. The economic downturn in Japan since 1995 was exacerbated by policy errors, leading to a systemic crisis in the banking sector by 1997. The government responded by providing financial support to banks and taking over the management of financial institutions. In 1998, the government purchased and eventually sold the bankrupt Long-Term Credit Bank and Nippon Credit Bank. The Japanese government provided financial support to banks by injecting billions of dollars to bolster bank balance sheets. By 2005, the banking sector had recovered with 3.5% of total lending reported as non-performing. The government implemented monetary policy, direct intervention, and fiscal stimulus packages to combat the crisis, announcing nine stimulus packages during the 1990s. During the 1990s crisis, the Japanese government implemented monetary policy, direct intervention, and fiscal stimulus packages. These packages, totaling nine, included new spending referred to as \"real water\" (mamizu). Some items were already included in previous budgets, and parts of the packages awaited parliamentary approval. The figures for the percentages of GDP should be considered upper bounds, with some packages not actually funded. During the 1990s crisis, the Japanese government implemented monetary policy, direct intervention, and fiscal stimulus packages. The figures for the percentages of GDP listed in the \"Total\" column should be considered upper bounds. In 1993, 1995, and 1998, there were two stimulus packages announced per year, with combined totals of 4.0%, 3.4%, and 8.4% of GDP respectively. The Deposit Insurance Corporation of Japan (DICJ) administered various bank rescue operations, providing assistance through different means to prevent financial institutions from failing. The DICJ also has ongoing operations related to insuring bank deposits. The DICJ provided financial assistance totaling $399 billion as part of Japan's financial assistance packages. This included grants, asset purchases, capital injections, and other forms of assistance. The grants were funded by DICJ bonds and deposit insurance premiums. Asset purchases of $83 billion included assets from failed financial institutions, with $79 billion recovered. Capital injections of $106 billion came from five rescue packages. The DICJ injected $106 billion in capital into 25 different banks under five rescue packages, including subscriptions to preferred or common stock, purchases of subordinated bonds, and extending subordinated loans. As of March 2007, $31.3 billion of assets were still held by the DICJ in various forms. The Resolution and Collection Corporation (RCC) borrowed funds from the DICJ to purchase and dispose of assets, totaling $34.5 billion as of March 2007. The Resolution and Collection Corporation (RCC), a subsidiary of the DICJ, borrowed funds to purchase assets from financial institutions. By March 2007, RCC had bought $34.5 billion in assets for $3.0 billion and sold them for $5.2 billion, making a 172% profit. The RCC consulted with the Purchase Price Examination Board on asset prices. Japan's government debt rose as the economy stagnated, following a pattern seen in other financial crises worldwide. Japan's central government debt as a percent of GDP rose significantly from 1990 to 2000, reaching 106%. The Ricardian equivalence theorem suggests that government deficits may not stimulate demand as individuals save to pay off future tax increases. Analysis of Japan's experience in the 1990s found that while Ricardian equivalence effects existed, they were not significant for fiscal policy. In the 1990s, Japan experienced a rise in government debt, reaching 106% of GDP. Despite high saving rates and public awareness of debt, fiscal stimulus packages had expected multiplier effects. Tax cuts for the most liquidity constrained had the largest impact. Stimulus was deemed necessary due to limitations on monetary policy, but without addressing non-performing loans or economic deregulation, growth was hindered. Efforts to reduce the budget deficit began in 1996. In the 1990s, Japan faced rising government debt, reaching 106% of GDP. Despite high saving rates and public debt awareness, fiscal stimulus packages had limited impact without addressing non-performing loans or economic deregulation. Efforts to reduce the budget deficit began in 1996, but tightening fiscal policy too soon may have prolonged the recession. By 2003, government debt-to-GDP ratio rose to 141% and the deficit to GDP ratio increased to 5.4%, highlighting the challenge of reducing debt in a stagnant economy. The Japanese government's efforts to reduce the debt burden in a stagnant economy have been challenging. Despite periods of economic growth, the national debt continued to grow, requiring significant expenditures for debt servicing. Interest payments as a percentage of federal government expenditures in Japan declined from 17% in the early 1990s to 11.5% in 2007. The share of interest payments as a percentage of federal government expenditures in Japan and the United States has declined over the years. This decline was mainly due to the drop in interest rates as part of government monetary policies. The question now is whether this trend can continue given the large fiscal deficits being incurred in 2009. Lessons from the Japanese experience include underestimating the seriousness of banking problems and hoping for economic growth to resolve financial issues. Lessons from the Japanese experience include authorities initially underestimating the banking problem's seriousness, delaying resolution by keeping zombie firms alive, and requiring government capital injections for financial firm rescues. Lack of decisive action, transparency in reporting non-performing loans, and the transfer of emergency financial assistance to the Deposit Insurance Corporation of Japan were also key observations. The Japanese government created new institutions to handle emergency financial assistance, later transferring these activities to the Deposit Insurance Corporation of Japan. The DICJ had the authority to assist troubled financial institutions as ordered by the Prime Minister, injecting capital through various means such as buying troubled assets at a discount and providing grants and loans. Despite $495 billion in financial support packages between 1998 and 2003, Japan's banks wrote off $318 billion in non-performing loans. Between 1998 and 2003, Japan's banks wrote off $318 billion in non-performing loans despite $495 billion in financial support packages. Government holdings of corporate shares generated income for the DICJ. Recovery efforts focused on large banks and fewer financial institutions, leading to better coordination. Banks ignored early financial rescue packages, worsening economic conditions. Assistance to failing institutions carried enforced conditions by the DICJ. The bursting of the real estate bubble in Japan worsened economic conditions for banks due to the decline in real estate values affecting collateral on bank lending. Japan's slow response to monetary and fiscal policies, as well as banking sector issues, led to challenges in the recovery process."
