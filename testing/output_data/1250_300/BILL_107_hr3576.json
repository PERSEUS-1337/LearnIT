Congress finds that it is in the national interest for all citizens, including active-duty service members, to be allowed to vote in Federal elections. Since 1977, active-duty service members in American Samoa have been excluded from fully participating in elections due to various factors, including local laws that require in-person registration and limited transportation between the U.S. mainland and American Samoa. American Samoa's law requiring in-person registration for uniformed service voters contradicts the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, which has been in effect for over 15 years. Despite being aware of this discrepancy, American Samoa has not addressed it. American Samoa has not addressed the discrepancy between Federal and territorial law regarding voting rights for uniformed voters. It is necessary to ensure that votes of uniformed voters are counted in Federal elections and that American Samoa complies with the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. Additionally, it is in the national interest for Members of the United States House of Representatives and Delegates to be elected in the first week of November in even-numbered years. Since 1980, there have been instances where the election for the Congressional Delegate from American Samoa required runoff elections for a final resolution. This delay in determining the Delegate may result in a more junior position compared to other Members of Congress.

Primary election required for Congressional Delegate from American Samoa to avoid runoff elections and delays in determining the Delegate's position compared to other Members of Congress. Holding a primary election with more than 2 candidates can increase the chances of a candidate winning the general election. Section 2(a) of the Act is amended to require a primary election in any general election year with 3 or more candidates for the office of Delegate from American Samoa. If no candidate receives over 50% of the votes in the primary election, the top 2 candidates will be on the ballot for the general election. Candidates for the office of Delegate from American Samoa must file their candidacy by the first Tuesday of July each year for the general election.
