    "content": "In February 2002, the Bush Administration proposed the \"Clear Skies\" plan to address emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. The plan involved emission caps on electric utility emissions implemented through a tradeable allowance program. Introduced in the 108th Congress as H.R. 999 and S. 485, a modified version (S. 131) was introduced in the 109th Congress by Senator Inhofe. Debate focused on the cap-and-trade implementation scheme, with the EPA stating it would deliver guaranteed emissions reductions at a lower cost than command and control measures. The EPA proposed the Clear Skies plan to reduce emissions through a cap-and-trade program, aiming to lower costs compared to command and control measures. The plan includes regulations for SO2, NOx, and mercury reductions, with a focus on altering existing Clean Air Act provisions for affected sources. The Clear Skies plan aims to alter existing Clean Air Act provisions for affected sources, eliminating various regulations and combining them into a simplified regulatory process. EPA Administrator Whitman stated that certain CAA provisions, such as New Source Review, regional haze, BART, MACT standards, NOx SIP Call, 126 Rule, and acid rain, could be eliminated under Clear Skies legislation. The potential impact of Clear Skies legislation on the Clean Air Act's structure for electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program is examined. Changes proposed by Clear Skies would mainly affect Title I, with distinctions based on factors like location, facility age, and fuel type. Despite existing regulations for SO2, NOx, and PM, specific requirements differ, including the addition of a cap-and-trade program for SO2 emissions in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. The Clean Air Act's regulatory structure applies to SO2, NOx, and PM with specific requirements for each. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments added a cap-and-trade program for SO2 emissions but did not change the Act's basic structure established in 1970. The Act includes National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to protect air quality. EPA sets primary NAAQS to protect public health. The Clean Air Act establishes National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for pollutants like SO2, NOx, and PM to protect public health. EPA sets NAAQS with specific deadlines for compliance, while states implement standards through State Implementation Plans (SIPs). New sources must use Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology to prevent increased emissions. The Clean Air Act requires new sources to use Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology to prevent increased emissions. Existing sources in nonattainment areas must install Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) are imposed on major new stationary sources of air pollution, including fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities. NSPS for SO2, NOx, and PM 10 are reviewed every eight years. Interstate pollution is addressed through regional commissions. The Clean Air Act establishes mechanisms to address interstate pollution, including regional commissions and state petitions. The NOx SIP Call regulates NOx emissions in 20 states and the District of Columbia. Existing sources in nonattainment areas must meet NAAQS controls, while major new sources are subject to NSPS requirements. EPA encourages states to implement regulations through cap-and-trade programs. The 1977 Clean Air Act introduced the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program, focusing on ambient concentrations of pollutants in clean air areas. It allows for some increase in pollution depending on the area's classification, with Class I areas having strict limits and Class II areas allowing moderate degradation. New sources in PSD areas must undergo preconstruction review. The Clean Air Act introduced the PSD program, allowing for some pollution increase based on area classification. New sources in PSD areas undergo preconstruction review and must install Best Available Control Technology. The regional haze program focuses on visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas, requiring sources built between 1962 and 1977 to install Best Available Retrofit Technology. The Clean Air Act addresses visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas caused by manmade air pollution. Pollutants like sulfates, organic matter, and nitrates affect visibility. The Act requires sources built between 1962 and 1977 to install Best Available Retrofit Technology. The EPA's regional haze program imposes stricter controls on NOx and SO2 emissions. Additionally, the Act establishes a regulatory program for 188 hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, with two phases: MACT standards for major sources in the first phase and potential additional regulations for residual risks in the second phase. The Clean Air Act requires stringent regulations for sources emitting hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), with special treatment for electric utilities. EPA must report to Congress on public health hazards from HAP emissions before issuing MACT standards. EPA initially found MACT necessary for electric generating units but later proposed a cap-and-trade program as a preferred approach. Under current law, states can enforce stricter standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) than federal regulations, with some states already doing so. The Clear Skies proposal would make significant changes to current regulations, including establishing national cap-and-trade programs for NOx and mercury emissions, revising the Title IV program for SO2, removing certain authorities related to mercury emissions, and delaying the implementation of certain provisions. The proposed changes include removing certain authorities related to mercury emissions, modifying provisions such as BART and conformity, and establishing cap-and-trade programs for SO2, NOx, and Hg. Major sources like affected EGUs and opt-in units would no longer be considered major sources, and changes would be made to hazardous air pollutant provisions and Section 126. The proposed changes include removing authorities related to mercury emissions, modifying provisions like BART and conformity, establishing cap-and-trade programs for SO2, NOx, and Hg, and making changes to hazardous air pollutant provisions and Section 126. Major sources like affected EGUs and opt-in units would no longer be considered major sources. The Clear Skies proposal includes replacing Title IV of the Clean Air Act with a multi-pollutant cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Mercury emissions. It sets caps for emissions in two phases and establishes trading programs for flexibility. Phase 1 caps for EGUs are set at 2.19 million tons of NOx in 2008, 4.5 million tons of SO2 in 2010, and 34 tons of mercury in 2010. Phase 2 caps, effective in 2018, are set at 1.79 million tons of NOx. The Clear Skies proposal, known as S. 131, establishes caps for emissions in two phases for EGUs. Phase 1 sets caps for NOx, SO2, and mercury emissions, while Phase 2 caps are more stringent. Allowances are allocated based on historic fuel usage, with adjustments for factors specified in the bill. Additionally, the proposal includes national emission standards for new and reconstructed EGUs for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions. The Clear Skies proposal, S. 131, establishes stricter emissions standards for SO2, NOx, and Hg from new and reconstructed EGUs compared to current NSPS. The standards would be reviewed every eight years, and non-utility sources can opt into the Cap-and-Trade Program. The proposal S. 131 allows non-utility sources to opt into the cap-and-trade program, with alternative methods for determining allowances based on emissions and output. Units would receive allocations for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions, with exemptions from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants in return for participation. The proposal S. 131 allows non-utility sources to opt into the cap-and-trade program, with exemptions from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants under certain regulations. Units would be permanently exempt if EPA accepts their application to opt in and would not be considered major sources for 20 years. Additionally, a new \"transitional area\" category would be established for areas not meeting new ozone and PM 2.5 standards. Establishment of an Optional \"Transitional Area\" Category in Place of Nonattainment Designations under Clear Skies proposal would allow areas to be designated as \"transitional\" instead of \"nonattainment\" for new ozone and PM 2.5 standards if they are projected to meet the standards by December 31, 2015. This change would extend deadlines for reaching attainment and remove statutory requirements for nonattainment areas until after 2017. Additionally, affected units would be exempt from major source requirements under Parts C and D of the Clean Air Act. Affected units under the Clear Skies proposal would not be considered major emitting facilities or major stationary sources of air pollution for 20 years after enactment. This exemption includes NSR, BART, and BACT requirements for the PSD program, except for units near Class I areas. In nonattainment areas, affected units are exempt from NSR, LAER, and offset requirements, limiting additional controls under State Implementation Plans. The Clear Skies proposal exempts affected units from major emitting facility status for 20 years, including NSR, BART, and BACT requirements. In nonattainment areas, affected units are also exempt from NSR, LAER, and offset requirements, limiting additional controls under State Implementation Plans. The proposal also revises Section 112 of the Clean Air Act to preclude regulation of hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utility steam generating units, with exceptions for non-mercury pollutants based on public health concerns. The Clear Skies proposal exempts affected units from major emitting facility status for 20 years, including NSR, BART, and BACT requirements. It also revises Section 112 of the Clean Air Act to preclude regulation of hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utility steam generating units, with exceptions for non-mercury pollutants based on public health concerns. Additionally, the proposal establishes a moratorium on the use of petitions to control interstate air pollution from affected units under Section 126 of the Act. The amendment proposes a moratorium on petitions to control interstate air pollution from affected units under Section 126 of the Act. It also establishes more stringent requirements for acceptance of such petitions after the moratorium, with the Administrator not able to require submission of SIPs subjecting affected units to Section 126 requirements before December 31, 2014. The Administrator must consider emissions reductions required for relevant nonattainment areas when reviewing a petition under Section 126. The Clear Skies proposal would change noncompliance penalties under Title IV of the Clean Air Act, reducing penalties for sulfur dioxide emissions. The penalties would be set at a lower amount than the current law, with adjustments for inflation. The Clear Skies proposal would reduce noncompliance penalties for sulfur dioxide emissions under Title IV of the Clean Air Act. The penalties would be set at $2,000 per ton with no inflation adjustments, cutting the penalty by about one-third initially. The bill also limits states from interfering with the transfer, sale, or purchase of allowances, potentially allowing increased emissions in other jurisdictions. The Clear Skies proposal aims to reduce penalties for sulfur dioxide emissions and limit states from interfering with allowance transfers. It also exempts EGUs from NSR for 20 years but establishes new emission standards for new EGUs. Reconstruction of units is defined as replacing components exceeding 50% of the fixed capital cost of a new unit. The Clear Skies proposal exempts reconstructed units from emission standards unless feasible, eliminates BART requirements for major sources, and exempts EGUs from BART for 20 years. It also addresses construction near Class I PSD areas. The Clear Skies proposal exempts EGUs and opt-in facilities from BART for 20 years after enactment. It addresses construction near Class I and Class II PSD areas, extending deadlines for the Ozone and PM2.5 NAAQS. Clear Skies exempts affected units in Class II areas from offsetting emissions to maintain air quality. It extends deadlines for ozone and PM2.5 NAAQS, creating transitional areas exempt from penalties until 2015 if they can demonstrate attainment through modeling. If standards are not met by 2017, areas will be designated nonattainment and must impose controls to reach attainment by 2022. Ozone transitional areas are exempt from certain statutory requirements until 2017. The Clean Air Act outlines specific requirements for areas classified in different levels of ozone nonattainment, including LAER standards, offset requirements, RACT for existing sources, vehicle inspection programs, vapor recovery, and penalties for non-compliance. Areas failing to meet the ozone standard may qualify as transitional under Clear Skies, exempting them from nonattainment status. Under Clear Skies, areas failing to meet the ozone standard may qualify as transitional, exempting them from nonattainment status and allowing them to roll back statutory requirements. The proposed legislation would eliminate conformity requirements for ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas until 2018. Proposed changes to Title I would affect electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the legislation. Under Clear Skies, proposed legislation would make structural changes to Title I for electric generating units (EGUs) and industrial sources opting in. The most significant change would be the elimination of location as a variable for controlling EGUs, regardless of whether they are in attainment or nonattainment areas. This would also impact emission limitations and the allowance system, allowing trading regardless of location or state restrictions. EGUs would no longer be major sources under Part C and Part D, eliminating states' ability to set stringent rules in nonattainment areas. Under Clear Skies, proposed legislation would eliminate states' ability to set stringent rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas and restrict trading by EGUs within those areas. The state's enforcement mechanism, NSR, would also be eliminated for EGUs covered by Clear Skies. Additionally, states would not be able to restrict allowance trading, potentially creating additional allowances for utilities to sell to upwind utilities not covered by state legislation. Clear Skies aims to establish a new \"transitional\" designation for areas not meeting air quality standards, potentially eliminating the need for additional controls. It also seeks to protect Class I areas by implementing Part C requirements for facilities nearby. Clear Skies aims to protect Class I areas by implementing Part C requirements for facilities within 50 km, but the effectiveness of this measure is debatable. States face challenges in protecting areas not meeting Class I requirements due to limitations on imposing additional controls. Clear Skies addresses the controversy over EGU age by setting up allowance reserves for new sources, with more generous allocation formulas for existing sources. Once the reserve is exhausted, no further allowances are available. The allocation formulas for existing sources under Clear Skies are more generous than for new sources, giving existing units an advantage. Once the reserve for allowances is depleted, no further allowances are available for new sources. Table 4 outlines the regulation of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants under Clear Skies, indicating that unit-specific standards would no longer apply, making it harder to address areas with high concentrations of mercury. Under Clear Skies, unit-specific standards for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants would no longer apply, making it difficult to address \"hot spots\" with high concentrations of mercury. States setting more stringent standards would not have complete control, as allowance trading cannot be restricted. The Administrator would still have authority to address non-mercury pollutants from power plants under strict conditions, with any new standards not taking effect before 2018. Former Administrator Whitman raised concerns about whether Clear Skies' targets are stringent enough to justify relaxing certain Clean Air Act provisions. Former Administrator Whitman has raised concerns about the stringency of Clear Skies' targets in relation to the Clean Air Act. Clear Skies may not meet the NAAQS deadlines for ozone and fine particulate matter, requiring additional controls and time for attainment. The current draft of Clear Skies could limit state options for achieving NAAQS compliance by removing electric utility controls and creating uncertainty with the opt-in provision. The Clear Skies proposal may limit state options for achieving NAAQS compliance by removing electric utility controls and creating uncertainty with the opt-in provision. This could hinder efforts to reduce mercury emissions, especially from electric utilities, and may not meet NAAQS deadlines for ozone and fine particulate matter. The Clear Skies program may limit state options for reducing mercury emissions and meeting air quality standards. While the Administration argues that Clear Skies would achieve reductions sooner and at a lower cost than the Clean Air Act, it could extend compliance deadlines for states by 5 to 15 years. The early reductions in a cap-and-trade program may lead to increased emissions later on, complicating compliance strategies for state and local authorities."
