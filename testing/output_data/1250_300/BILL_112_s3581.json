    "content": "MODIFICATIONS TO CARBON DIOXIDE SEQUESTRATION CREDIT. The amendment to section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code sets limitations on the credit allowed for qualified carbon dioxide captured by carbon capture equipment at a qualified facility. The national limitation is set at 75,000,000 metric tons of qualified carbon dioxide. The amendment to section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code establishes a national limitation of 75,000,000 metric tons of qualified carbon dioxide for the credit. The Secretary will allocate this limitation to projects for carbon capture equipment and certify those projects. The Secretary will allocate a national limitation of 75,000,000 metric tons of qualified carbon dioxide for projects with carbon capture equipment. Applicants must submit applications for allocation, with priority given based on the date of submission. The Secretary will allocate tonnage to applicants based on the amount requested. Priority will be given to applications received before the established procedures, applicants concurrently applying for certification, and projects with earlier construction commencement dates. The Secretary will allocate tonnage to applicants based on the amount requested and the rank of the application. Projects with no or partial allocation will retain their ranking and may receive forfeited tonnage. The Secretary cannot allocate more than the projected carbon dioxide capture amount over a 10-year period to any project. The qualified facility must project the capture of a certain amount of carbon dioxide over a 10-year period, either through disposal contracts, disposal plans, or a minimum of 15,000,000 metric tons. The allocation of tonnage by the Secretary is based on requested amounts and application ranking, with a limit on the total carbon dioxide capture amount for any project. The applicant must dispose of a certain amount of carbon dioxide or capture a minimum of 15,000,000 metric tons. Any prior credits for carbon dioxide captured before August 1, 2013, will reduce the allocation. Projects must be certified before receiving credits for using carbon capture equipment. Each project allocated a portion of the national limitation must submit an application for certification to the Secretary within specific timeframes. The construction start date determines when the application can be submitted. The construction start date is crucial for submitting an application for certification to the Secretary. The term 'construction start date' refers to the first date of significant work on the project or when 5 percent of the total cost has been spent. The Secretary can revoke certification for materially inaccurate representations or failure to timely place equipment in service. The certification for a project can be revoked if carbon capture equipment is not placed in service within a specified timeframe after the allocation was issued. In such cases, reallocation may occur. The Secretary may reallocate the national limitation allocated to a project if certification is revoked or if a taxpayer fails to obtain certification. Public disclosure of allocations, certifications, revocations, and project rankings must be made within 30 days. The Secretary can reallocate the national limitation for a project if certification is revoked or not obtained by a taxpayer. Public disclosure of allocations, certifications, revocations, and project rankings must be made within 30 days.

Amendments to section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code include a 10-year credit limitation for carbon capture equipment placed in service or certified within that period. The definition of carbon capture equipment is expanded to include equipment to capture and pressurize qualified carbon dioxide. The credit is allowed to the taxpayer who captures and disposes of the qualified carbon dioxide. The amendments to section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code include a 10-year credit limitation for carbon capture equipment. The credit is allowed to the taxpayer who captures and disposes of qualified carbon dioxide in compliance with specific requirements. If the taxpayer elects to allow credit to another person for disposing of the carbon dioxide, the credit will not be allowable to the taxpayer who captured it. The amendments to section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code include limitations on carbon capture credits and rules for credit recapture. Regulations issued will apply only to carbon dioxide captured or disposed of after the regulation is filed. The regulation issued will apply to qualified carbon dioxide captured after the regulation is filed with the Federal Register. The amendments made by this section will apply to carbon dioxide captured after July 31, 2013."
