    "content": "The \"HMO Solvency Act of 2000\" ensures the solvency of Medicaid managed care organizations. The \"HMO Solvency Act of 2000\" mandates that Medicaid managed care organizations must submit financial reports regularly to monitor solvency and undergo audits before entering into contracts with states. Before entering into a contract with a state, a Medicaid managed care organization must undergo an on-site audit to evaluate its internal structure, claims processing capability, utilization management, and accounting functions. The audit, required by the Secretary, focuses on key business risks such as regulatory risks, competition, provider network, and pricing. Each Medicaid managed care organization must undergo periodic audits as required by the state audit plan, focusing on key business risks such as regulatory risks, competition, provider network, pricing, claims processing environment, reserves, and information system integrity. Additionally, organizations must maintain a minimum net worth in cash or cash equivalents. Each Medicaid managed care organization must maintain a minimum net worth in cash or cash equivalents as specified by the State, with the option to meet this requirement through a guarantor. Additionally, approval is required for subcontractors providing health care services or carrying out other functions for the organization. Each Medicaid managed care organization must notify the State 90 days before entering into a contract and conduct an independent audit of subcontractors to ensure their ability to provide services satisfactorily. Reporting significant changes in ownership or operations is also required. Each Medicaid managed care organization must report significant changes in ownership or operations to the State to ensure solvency. Additional federal solvency standards may be applied as needed. The amendment made by subsection (a) applies to medicaid managed care organizations owned or controlled by other entities. The effective date will be specified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, with a possible delay for states requiring legislative action. The amendment allows for a possible delay in the effective date for states needing legislative action to meet new Medicaid requirements. Medicaid managed care organizations may also be given additional time to comply with new minimum net worth requirements. SEC. 3. ASSURING THE SOLVENCY OF MEDICARE+CHOICE ORGANIZATIONS. The solvency of Medicare+Choice organizations is ensured by applying requirements similar to those for Medicaid managed care organizations, with recognition of state enforcement. The Secretary will deem a Medicare+Choice organization as meeting requirements if they meet certain criteria. The Secretary will waive requirements if they are duplicative and do not provide greater protection. The same requirements will apply to organizations providing Medicare benefits on a capitated basis. Effective date will be determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Social Security Act amendment applies to organizations receiving capitated payments for services under title XVIII. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will implement the amendment and subsection in a similar manner to other effective dates. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will report to Congress within a year on steps taken by States to protect health care providers in case of insolvency of medicaid managed care or Medicare+Choice organizations, and recommend additional measures for provider protection."
