    "content": "The Act titled \"Facilitating Access to Speedy Transmissions for Networks, E-commerce and Telecommunications (FASTNET) Act\" aims to improve access to fast transmissions for networks and telecommunications. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to promote competition and reduce regulation in telecommunications markets to deploy advanced technologies nationwide. It recognized the unique position of local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, who can accelerate the deployment of advanced services in less populated regions. Existing regulations often burden these carriers, hindering their deployment of advanced telecommunications services. Reducing regulatory burdens on two percent carriers will accelerate the deployment of advanced services and competition in telecommunications, benefiting consumers in less densely populated regions of the Nation. The Act aims to accelerate the deployment of advanced services and competition in the telecommunications industry by reducing regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. This will benefit consumers in all regions of the Nation and allow carriers to redirect resources to increase investment in such initiatives. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to define a 'two percent carrier' as an incumbent local exchange carrier with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. Regulatory relief is provided for these carriers to reduce regulatory requirements and encourage investment in advanced services. The Commission must consider the impact of regulatory requirements on two percent carriers when adopting rules for incumbent local exchange carriers. If the Commission fails to do so, the rule cannot be enforced on two percent carriers until a separate evaluation is conducted. No additional review is needed if the rules do not apply to two percent carriers or if they are exempted. Size-based differentiation among carriers is not prohibited by this section. The section includes a savings clause stating that size-based differentiation among carriers is not prohibited. The effective date of the provisions applies to rules adopted after the enactment of this section. SEC. 282 limits reporting requirements for two percent carriers, exempting them from filing cost allocation manuals or ARMIS reports, except for section 224 compliance. SEC. 283 addresses the integrated operation of two percent carriers. SEC. 283 states that the Commission cannot require a two percent carrier to have a separate affiliate for various services, and they are not obligated to maintain separate personnel, facilities, or operations. The text discusses the ability of a two percent carrier to participate or withdraw from common line tariffs and elect price cap rate regulation for specific study areas. The carrier's election is binding for one year, and they are not obligated to make the same election for other study areas. The Commission does not require a carrier to make the same election for other study areas. A two percent carrier's election is binding for one year. The Commission allows two percent carriers to introduce new interstate telecommunications services with only one day's notice, without needing approval for the rate structure. This includes services that were not previously offered by the carrier, expanding options for customers. Additionally, competing carriers can enter the market under Section 286. Two percent carriers are allowed pricing flexibility to de-average rates and file tariffs with one day's notice upon certification of facilities-based entry by an unaffiliated carrier. Streamlined pricing regulation is also permitted for two percent carriers upon certification of entry by a local exchange carrier or a governmental authority. The Commission will regulate a two percent carrier as non-dominant if a local exchange carrier or a governmental authority is engaged in facilities-based entry in the carrier's service area. The carrier will not be required to tariff its interstate service offerings. Additionally, a two percent carrier meeting certain requirements can participate in the common line tariff by including its study areas. Facilities-based entry involves providing or procuring local telephone exchange switching in the carrier's service area. Facilities-based entry in a two percent carrier's service area involves providing local telephone exchange switching and offering telephone exchange service to at least one unaffiliated customer. A contract-based tariff is a tariff based on a service contract between the carrier and its customers, detailing the contract terms, services provided, volume commitments, prices, and any volume discounts. The term 'service area' in a contract-based tariff refers to the area where local telephone exchange switching is provided to unaffiliated customers. The contract details include service descriptions, volume commitments, prices, volume discounts, and regulations affecting the contract rate. SEC. 287. SAVINGS PROVISIONS: Commission retains authority under sections 201-208. Rural telephone companies' rights preserved. States' authority over intrastate communications service not limited. SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON MERGER REVIEW. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include a deadline for making public interest determinations in mergers involving two percent carriers. The Commission must make determinations within 60 days of receiving an application, or the application will be deemed approved. The Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include a deadline for public interest determinations in mergers involving two percent carriers. If the Commission does not approve or deny an application within the specified period, it will be deemed approved without conditions. Two percent carriers can elect to make a decision regarding local exchange facilities acquired through mergers or acquisitions. These provisions apply to applications submitted after the enactment date of this Act. Applications pending at the enactment date will be subject to these requirements as if filed on that date. SEC. 6. TIME LIMITS FOR ACTION ON PETITIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION OR WAIVER. Amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 requires the Commission to issue an order granting or denying petitions within 90 days. Failure to act within this period results in relief being granted or enforcement of a rule being stayed. The Communications Act of 1934 amendment mandates the Commission to issue a final order on petitions within 90 days. Failure to do so results in relief being granted or enforcement of a rule being stayed. Any pending petitions for reconsideration or waiver will be subject to these requirements if submitted after the enactment date of this Act. SEC. 7. NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EXCEPTIONS.\n\nExceptions to the 60-day and 90-day time periods for petitions or applications under sections 310 and 405 of the Communications Act of 1934 can be made by Executive Branch agencies like the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and the FBI if national security, law enforcement, or public safety concerns are raised."
