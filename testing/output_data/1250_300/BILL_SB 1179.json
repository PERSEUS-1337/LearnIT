    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 9002 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define key terms related to public cemetery districts, including \"active militia,\" \"armed services,\" \"board of trustees,\" \"district,\" and \"domestic partner.\" The curr_chunk defines key terms related to public cemetery districts, including \"domestic partner\" as two adults in a committed relationship, \"family member\" as various relatives, and \"interment right\" as the rights to use a burial plot. The curr_chunk outlines regulations for interment rights within a cemetery district, including control over memorial markers and definitions for terms like \"nonresident\" and \"peace officer.\" Chapter 5.5 is added to the Health and Safety Code, detailing interment rights. Chapter 5.5 of the Health and Safety Code outlines interment rights within a cemetery district. An interment right does not include the right for disinterment of human remains without consent. The chapter allows for the removal of remains under certain circumstances with proper authorization and record-keeping by the cemetery district. The cemetery district must maintain a duplicate copy of an order for removal of remains and retain a record including the date of removal, name and age of the deceased, cemetery and plot information, reinterment details if applicable, and date of reinterment. The person making the removal must provide a complete record to the cemetery district. An interment right grants a transferable property interest to the owner listed in the cemetery district records. The owner can designate who can be interred in the plot and must designate a successor owner at the time of purchase. The owner of an interment right must designate a successor owner at the time of purchase. If the owner dies without a valid disposition, the interment right passes according to intestate succession laws. Relatives can waive their interment rights in favor of other relatives. When transferring ownership rights or making an interment in a public cemetery district based on a sworn affidavit, the district and its employees are not liable unless they had actual knowledge of false information. The successor owner of an interment right must sign an affidavit declaring their entitlement, efforts to find other claimants, and lack of opposition to their claim. Upon the sale of a plot in a cemetery, the district must notify the purchaser of interment rights and the rules governing succession. No reimbursement is required for costs incurred by local agencies due to changes in penalties or definitions of crimes. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for any additional costs mandated by the state."
