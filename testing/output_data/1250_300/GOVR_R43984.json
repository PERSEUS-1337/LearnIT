    "content": "Songwriters and recording artists are entitled to payment for reproductions and performances of their music. However, they do not have total control over their music. For example, Taylor Swift can withdraw her own recorded music from Spotify as a singer who owns the rights to her sound recordings, but she cannot dictate how the service uses other recorded versions of her musical works. Ms. Swift can withdraw her recorded music from Spotify, but cannot control how the service uses other versions of her works. Payment for her music depends on market forces, contracts, and copyright laws. Congress updated laws in the 1990s to address digital music distribution, balancing copyright protection and industry revenue. The evolution of music distribution has blurred traditional lines of exploitation, with streaming services changing the industry landscape. In 1999, recording industry revenues peaked at $21.3 billion, coinciding with the introduction of Napster. Apple's iTunes Music Store launched in 2003, offering legal online song purchases. By 2012, digital downloads surpassed physical media sales in the recording industry. In 2012, digital music downloads surpassed physical media sales in the recording industry, with Apple holding a 65% market share. However, sales declined as streaming services like Spotify gained popularity. To compete, Apple launched Apple Music in 2015. Subscription music services have since dominated music consumption, with digital subscriptions and streaming services accounting for 67% of total U.S. recording industry retail spending in 2017. Consumer spending on music has shifted towards webcasting, satellite digital audio radio services, cable services, and streaming music services, increasing from 9% in 2011 to 67% in 2017. Despite flat spending between 2014 and 2015, there was a 10% growth between 2015 and 2016, and a 14% growth between 2016 and 2017. However, annual spending on music by U.S. consumers, adjusted for inflation, remains significantly below its 1999 peak. These changes impact how performers, songwriters, record companies, and music publishers are compensated for their work under copyright law. The Copyright Act grants exclusive rights to owners of musical works and sound recordings, including the right to reproduce and distribute the work. In music publishing, the combination of reproduction and distribution rights is known as a \"mechanical right,\" dating back to the 1909 Copyright Act. This term originated from the requirement for manufacturers to pay music publishing companies for the right to mechanically reproduce compositions. The term \"mechanical rights\" has persisted despite changes in music reproduction methods. The Copyright Act grants exclusive rights to owners of musical works and sound recordings, including reproduction and distribution rights known as \"mechanical rights.\" Federal copyright protection for sound recordings applies to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972. Owners have the right to perform works publicly through digital audio transmissions, such as webcasting and music streaming services like Pandora and Spotify. Transmission services like webcasting, digital subscription services, and music streaming services pay royalties for sound recording public performance rights under federal copyright laws. Consumers purchase rights to listen to music on CDs privately, while record labels pay music publishers for distribution rights. Radio stations are not required to pay for public performance rights. The Copyright Act does not require broadcast radio stations to pay public performance royalties to record labels and artists, but they must pay music publishers and songwriters. Congress decided in 1995 that the promotional value of broadcast radio airplay outweighs revenue lost by record labels and artists. Digital services must pay record labels and music publishers for public performance rights. Both traditional broadcast radio stations and music streaming services make temporary copies of songs for transmission to listeners. Ephemeral recordings fall under 17 U.S.C. Section 112. Users of interactive music streaming services can listen to songs on demand by downloading digital files to their devices. These conditional downloads require subscribers to remain active, and royalties are paid to music publishers, songwriters, record labels, and artists for the right to reproduce and distribute musical works and sound recordings. The music industry involves songwriters, music publishers, recording artists, record labels, and music licensees. The music industry comprises songwriters, recording artists, music publishers, and licensees who obtain the right to reproduce and distribute music. Songwriters work with publishers to promote songs to record labels and others. Publishers license the intellectual property of their clients and collect royalties. Publishers may pay advances to songwriters in exchange for a portion of the copyright in their compositions. They monitor and generate revenue from music formats requiring mechanical licensing rights. Music publishers play a crucial role in monitoring, promoting, and generating revenue from music in various formats. They work with songwriters to license their compositions and collect royalties. Major publishers like Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group, and Warner Music Group dominate the industry. Songwriters typically share royalty income with publishers, with a standard 50-50 division. Multiple songwriters and publishers can complicate the distribution of money. Music publishers are categorized into four groups: Major Publishers like Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group, and Warner Music Group dominate the industry. Major Affiliates handle songwriting management and affiliate with major publishers for royalty administration. Independent Publishers manage their own music catalogs. Writer-Publishers control their own publishing rights, hiring individuals for royalty administration. Record labels are responsible for finding talent, recording music, and promoting artists. Record labels, known as \"majors,\" distribute physical and electronic copies of sound recordings and handle royalties for artists. They negotiate with streaming services for rights and monitor sales. Recording artists can contract with a label or distribute their own music. Record labels negotiate with streaming services for rights, monitor sales, and finance recordings. Recording artists may contract with a label or distribute their own music. Major record labels like Sony Corporation, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group earn a significant portion of the industry's revenue. Major record labels like Sony Corporation, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group own significant shares in the music industry. Independent artists like Chance the Rapper distribute their music without signing with a label, earning money through tours and merchandise sales. Apple Music paid Chance $500,000 for exclusive rights to his album, Coloring Book. Chance the Rapper earns money through touring and merchandise sales instead of selling his music. Apple Music paid him $500,000 for exclusive rights to his album, Coloring Book, which became the first streaming-only album to rank among the top 10 U.S. albums. Producers are responsible for bringing creative music into tangible form, handling tasks like song selection and studio booking. Recording artists now work with multiple producers, allowing them to control the producer's compensation terms, including royalties. Sound engineers run recording sessions under producer oversight, while mixers work on the output of recording sessions. Producers work with recording artists to bring creative music into tangible form, controlling compensation terms. Sound engineers run recording sessions under producer oversight, while mixers piece together polished finished products. Mixers may receive one-time payments per track or a portion of the artist's royalties. The 1909 Copyright Act recognized the exclusive right of the copyright owner to make mechanical reproductions of music, including player pianos and phonograph records. The 1909 Copyright Act established the first compulsory license in U.S. copyright law to prevent a potential monopoly by a player-piano manufacturer. This allowed for the distribution of sound recordings to the public for private use, with publishers/songwriters required to allow others to make similar use upon payment of a specified royalty. This was exemplified in 2015 when Ryan Adams recorded a cover version of Taylor Swift's album 1989 without needing her permission, but instead paying her the rate. In 2015, Ryan Adams recorded a cover version of Taylor Swift's album 1989 without seeking her permission, instead paying a compulsory mechanical license royalty set by the government. The Copyright Act of 1976 codified the compulsory license as 17 U.S.C. Section 115, specifying that rates are payable for each record made and distributed. Congress has amended the law several times since then. The 1976 Copyright Act established rates payable for each distributed record, defined \"phonorecord\" as audio-only recordings, and set procedures for obtaining mechanical licenses. Licensees must serve a notice of intention to license music on the copyright owner or the Copyright Office within 30 days. If unable to locate owners, licensees set aside money until owners are found. The Act also made it easier for copyright owners to sue for non-compliance with licensing requirements. The 1976 Copyright Act established rates for distributed records and defined \"phonorecord.\" It made it easier for copyright owners to sue for non-compliance with licensing requirements, including removing limitations on liability and the need for a \"notice of use\" to recover against unauthorized record manufacturers. This has led to controversy between rights holders regarding NOIs and the Copyright Office's database of musical works. The 1976 Copyright Act established rates for distributed records and defined \"phonorecord.\" It made it easier for copyright owners to sue for non-compliance with licensing requirements. In contrast to performance rights licenses, reproduction and distribution licenses are not issued on a blanket basis. NOIs and the Copyright Office's database of musical works have led to controversy between rights holders and licensees. Congress created a tribunal in the 1976 Copyright Act to set royalty rates based on established standards. The 1976 Copyright Act established a royalty tribunal to set royalty rates based on Congress's standards. The tribunal considers four policy objectives when determining rates for mechanical licenses. In 1993, the tribunal was replaced by the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel, and in 2004, the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) was established. The CRB, composed of three administrative judges appointed by the Librarian of Congress, sets licensing rates every five years for mechanical and certain other licenses. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) was established by Congress in 2004, composed of three judges appointed by the Librarian of Congress to set licensing rates every five years. The Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 amended U.S.C. Section 115 to cover digital transmission of musical works, prompting a debate on defining \"incidental DPDs.\" In July 2008, the Copyright Office proposed new rules to resolve the debate on \"incidental DPDs\" in order for the music industry to survive in the 21st Century. After seven years of hearings and litigation, a landmark agreement was reached in September 2008 regarding the applicability of mechanical licenses to music streaming, ensuring music publishers receive royalties from streaming services. The agreement reached in 2008 ensured music publishers receive royalties from music streaming services. The CRB adopted regulations for streaming services to pay publishers a percentage of their revenues. In 2012, a new agreement set mechanical royalty rates for various music streaming services, covering rates from 2013 to 2017. In 2018, the CRB issued initial determination of mechanical royalty rates for the 2018-2022 period. The determination of mechanical royalty rates and terms for the 2018-2022 period includes flat rates for physical phonorecord deliveries and permanent digital downloads, as well as rates based on formulas for interactive streaming. Rates are calculated based on music service revenues or total licensing costs, with minimum per-subscriber payments for different categories of services. Free trial periods have a zero royalty rate, and oversight is either by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York or based on marketplace factors. The mechanical royalty rate for Apple Music subscriptions is zero. Public performance royalties are overseen by the U.S. District Court or negotiated between publishers and licensees. Songwriters were granted the exclusive right to publicly perform their works in 1897, leading to the formation of ASCAP in 1914 to address licensing and payment collection for public performances. To address the logistical issue of licensing and collecting payment for public performances, composers formed ASCAP in 1914, a performance rights organization. ASCAP issues public performance licenses on behalf of songwriters and publishers, with licensees typically obtaining a blanket license for a flat fee or percentage of revenues. SESAC, a competing PRO founded in 1930, helps European and U.S. composers collect royalties. SESAC expanded its representation as radio grew in popularity, offsetting declining traditional revenue sources for publishers. In response to the growth of broadcast radio in the United States, ASCAP negotiated a public performance license with radio broadcasters in 1932, establishing rates based on advertising revenues. To counter ASCAP's dominance, broadcasters founded BMI in 1939 to attract new composers and secure copyrights of new songs. ASCAP and BMI initially held exclusive rights to negotiate for their members and offered blanket licenses covering all songs in their catalogs. The dispute between ASCAP and radio stations over royalty rates led to an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for possible antitrust violations. Both ASCAP and BMI entered consent decrees in 1941 to avoid antitrust lawsuits, with similar requirements for nonexclusive licensing rights and granting licenses to any user. The ASCAP and BMI consent decrees have similar features, including nonexclusive licensing rights, granting licenses to any user, and offering alternative licenses. Rates charged by ASCAP and BMI are overseen by federal district court judges, while SESAC and GMR rates are based on marketplace negotiations. Public performance of musical works is not bound by compulsory licensing under the Copyright Act. The rates charged by ASCAP and BMI are overseen by federal district court judges, who must determine if the rates are \"reasonable\" and consider the PROs' power over the market. Current law prohibits judges from considering rates paid by digital services to record labels when setting public performance rates for music publishers and songwriters. This provision was created in 1995 to address concerns about the impact on music performance. The 1995 DPRA addressed concerns about the impact of license fees on music performance royalties. DOJ periodically reviews ASCAP and BMI consent decrees, last amended in 2001 and 1994 respectively. In 2016, DOJ completed a review of the consent decrees, and in 2017, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld BMI's challenge to DOJ's interpretation. Congress enacted copyright laws for sound recordings in 1971 with the Sound Recording Act. The 1971 Sound Recording Act was created to combat unauthorized duplications of sound recordings. It applied to recordings fixed after February 15, 1972, and led to the passage of state antipiracy laws. In 1975, the DOJ recommended excluding pre-1972 recordings from federal copyright laws to preserve existing antipiracy measures. The House Judiciary Committee recommended excluding pre-1972 sound recordings from federal copyright laws to preserve antipiracy measures. Works in the public domain are not under copyright protection and can be used freely. The 1976 Copyright Revision Act preempted state laws equivalent to copyright but exempted pre-1972 works. States can protect pre-1972 recordings until 2067, after which federal law will preempt state protection. In 1998, Congress established a license under Section 112 of the Copyright Act for noninteractive digital services to make temporary reproductions of sound recordings. In 1998, Congress established a license under Section 112 of the Copyright Act for noninteractive digital services to make temporary reproductions of sound recordings. The rules for these licenses are similar to those for incidental reproduction and distribution of musical works. The rates and terms of the Section 112 license are set by the CRB, and copyright owners receive fees through SoundExchange. Record labels and artists used to rely on retail sales for income until the 1990s when public performance rights were not granted to them. The recording industry faced challenges with music piracy with the rise of the internet, leading to amendments to the Copyright Act. In the early 1990s, the recording industry faced challenges with music piracy due to the internet. Amendments to the Copyright Act, such as the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act (DPRA) in 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in 1998, aimed to address this issue. The DPRA granted record labels and artists an exclusive public performance right for their sound recordings, with limitations on certain digital audio services. It also created a compulsory license for licensing sound recordings for specific subscription services. This provision was a compromise between music publishers and record labels to prevent the withholding of licenses from multiple outlets. The DPRA and DMCA were enacted in the 1990s to address music piracy challenges. The DMCA expanded statutory licensing provisions for online music services and established rate-setting standards for the CRB. The compromise between RIAA and Digital Music Association led to the adoption of the DMCA. The CRB sets different rate-setting standards for music services existing before July 31, 1998, and those entering the market after. The Section 801(b)(1) standard aims to minimize disruption in the industry, while newer services negotiate rates representing market conditions. The impact of these standards on copyright royalty rates is unpredictable, as noted in a 2010 Government Accountability Office report. The DPRA enabled owners of sound recording rights to negotiate directly with interactive music streaming services for public performance rights at marketplace-determined rates. Interactive services, defined as those allowing individuals to arrange specific recordings, pose a significant threat to traditional record sales and copyright owners' income. Congress aims to prevent disruption in existing services' operations with the Section 801(b)(1) rate-setting standard. New forms of digital transmission services, particularly interactive services, are seen as the biggest threat to traditional record sales and the livelihoods of those dependent on revenue from record sales. Congress does not mandate public performance licenses for broadcast radio stations, as they play a crucial role in promoting sound recordings and supporting performers. The Senate Judiciary Committee emphasized the importance of maintaining the mutually beneficial relationship between the radio industry and the music industry, ensuring that legislation does not jeopardize their partnership. The CRB sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings involving copyright users, holders, and trade groups. Parties engage in negotiations, submit written statements, and may reach agreements on appropriate rates. The CRB publishes proposed rates for comment and has the option to decline agreements as a basis for setting rates. The CRB sets statutory rates through rate determination proceedings involving copyright users, holders, and trade groups. Parties negotiate and submit proposed rates for comment. The CRB may decline agreements and hold evidentiary hearings to issue determinations. Participants can request rehearings or appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals. SoundExchange, established by RIAA, distributes royalties after deducting costs. The CRB adopts \"per-performance\" rates using the \"willing buyer-willing seller\" standard. SoundExchange, established by RIAA, distributes royalties after deducting costs. The CRB sets rates for public performances of sound recordings, using different standards for online music services and subscription services. Congress passed legislation allowing SoundExchange to negotiate alternative royalty schemes. The most recent agreements expired on December 31, 2015. The CRB set rates for music streaming services based on revenue percentage agreements, with the most recent agreements expiring in 2015. During a rate proceeding, questions arose about the exclusion of Webcaster Settlement Act agreements as evidence. SoundExchange, Pandora Media, and Clear Channel disagreed on the interpretation of this provision. The CRB referred novel legal questions to the Register of Copyrights regarding the exclusion of Webcaster Settlement Act agreements in rate proceedings. The Register ruled that CRB can consider negotiated licenses reflecting provisions from the Act. In December 2015, CRB set rates for 2016-2020, requiring streaming services to pay $0.17 per 100 streams on nonsubscription services. This decision marked a departure from setting rate increases in advance. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) set rates for the 2016-2020 period, with streaming services required to pay $0.17 per 100 streams on nonsubscription services. Annual rate increases from 2017 through 2020 were tied to the Consumer Price Index. Ephemeral royalties fees were set at 5% of total Section 114 royalties. The CRB also issued rate decisions for preexisting digital subscription services and satellite digital audio radio services for the 2018-2022 period. Public performance rates vary based on the type of music service and rate-setting standard used by CRB. Royalties collected under Section 114 are distributed with 50% going to the copyright owner, 45% to the featured recording artist, and 5% to nonfeatured musicians. The Copyright Act specifies the distribution of royalties collected under Section 114: 50% to the copyright owner, 45% to the featured recording artist, and 5% to nonfeatured musicians. Record producers are not included in the statutory split for public performances by noninteractive digital services. Producers can be compensated through SoundExchange if the artist provides a letter of direction. The distinction between interactive and noninteractive services is debated for setting rates for public performance rights. The distinction between interactive and noninteractive services for setting rates for public performance rights is debated. The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) has adopted these distinctions in approving rates for mechanical licenses. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that a music streaming service using user feedback to play personalized songs within a genre is not an \"interactive\" service. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that a music streaming service using user feedback to play personalized songs within a genre is not considered an \"interactive\" service. The court's decision was based on the concern that interactive services could cannibalize record sales by providing predictability in song selection similar to owning the music. Launch Media, Inc.'s LAUNCHcast online radio service, owned by Yahoo! at the time, created unique playlists for each user. The court ruled that LAUNCHcast by Launch Media, Inc. was a noninteractive service, as uniquely created playlists do not ensure predictability. Noninteractive services must limit features like announcing specific songs in advance to be eligible for compulsory licensing under the Copyright Act. The decision affirmed that services like Pandora and iHeartRadio could obtain statutory licenses as noninteractive services for public performances of sound recordings. The Launch Media decision affirmed that personalized music streaming services like Pandora and iHeartRadio can obtain statutory licenses for public performances of sound recordings. The rates established by the CRB do not differentiate between customized services and other radio-style services. Spotify offers on-demand access to specific albums, songs, and artists for free with ads or for a monthly fee for ad-free listening on various devices. Congress provided antitrust exemptions in 1995 for statutory licensees and copyright owners to negotiate royalty rates collectively. The DPRA allows licensees and copyright owners to designate common agents for collective negotiation of royalty rates with SiriusXM and subscription services. Common agents must be nonexclusive to prevent supracompetitive rates. Antitrust exemption is not provided for interactive services, but common agents can be used for clearinghouse functions, not rate-setting. Section 112 of the DMCA addresses ephemeral server reproductions and provides an antitrust exemption for designated common agents. In 1998, Congress added Section 112 to the DMCA to address ephemeral server reproductions and provide an antitrust exemption for designated common agents. Section 112(e)(2) does not specify exclusivity for designations. The CRB, created in 2004, included provisions for licensees to make payments to designated entities. In 2006, the Copyright Royalty Judges designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" to receive royalties on an interim basis. Royalty Logic, a for-profit subsidiary of Music Reports, Inc., later requested recognition as a collective as well. This allowed parties subject to statutory licensing to continue making payments while appealing royalty decisions until final rates were established. The Copyright Royalty Judges designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" to receive royalties on an interim basis in 2006. Royalty Logic, a for-profit subsidiary of Music Reports, Inc., requested recognition as a collective to compete with SoundExchange. The CRB argued that copyright owners and performers are designated agents, and Royalty Logic does not need formal recognition. The CRB found that multiple collectives do not promote competition in statutory licensing. The Copyright Royalty Judges designated SoundExchange as the sole \"collective\" to receive royalties on an interim basis in 2006. The CRB found that having multiple collectives does not promote competition in statutory licensing. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the CRB's decision regarding the selection of a single collective for collecting royalties under statutory licenses. The court rejected Royalty Logic's argument that the CRB could not give a single entity exclusive ability to receive payments. The Copyright Royalty Judges designated SoundExchange as the sole collective to receive royalty payments, fulfilling Congress's expectation for a single entity. SoundExchange was selected as the sole collective for the period 2011-2014, as no party requested multiple collectives. This decision was based on economic and administrative efficiency. In 2015, SoundExchange reached agreements with public radio stations and college. In 2015, SoundExchange was designated as the sole collective for collecting royalties under statutory licenses. The CRB approved agreements with radio stations for webcast sound recordings, making them binding for all copyright owners. SoundExchange was chosen again as the sole collective for managing sound recording royalties from 2016-2020. Congress also granted an antitrust exemption for owners and licensees to designate common agents for negotiating mechanical licenses. In 2004, Congress granted an antitrust exemption for owners and licensees to designate common agents for negotiating mechanical licenses. Music publishers collect mechanical royalties through third-party administrators like the Harry Fox Agency, who distribute royalties to publishers and songwriters. SESAC acquired the Harry Fox Agency in 2015. In 2006, the CRB did not specify an agent for administering mechanical licenses, leading to concerns about competition among agents. Noncash considerations, like equity stakes, can influence the pricing of music access for interactive services. Sony sold part of its stake in Spotify when it went public in 2018. Sony sold a stake in Spotify in 2018, sharing proceeds with artists and independent labels. Rates paid by music publishers are linked to record labels' deals with digital music services. Copyright law prohibits tying rates for public performances of musical works to sound recordings. Organizations representing songwriters and recording artists are concerned about fair payments from digital music services. ASCAP and BMI represent 90% of songs for licensing in the US, while SESAC and Global Music Rights handle a smaller share. Music publishers allege they have not received a fair share of performance royalty revenues from streaming services due to restrictions in negotiating market rates. Publishers have claimed they did not receive a fair share of performance royalty revenues from streaming services due to restrictions in negotiating market rates. In response, ASCAP and BMI amended their rules in 2011 and 2013 to allow music publishers to license their public performance rights for digital streaming services directly at market prices. However, courts ruled that under consent decrees, publishers could not selectively withdraw rights. The ASCAP and BMI rate courts in the Southern District of New York ruled that music publishers cannot selectively withdraw rights under consent decrees. Major music publishers and PROs requested modifications to allow partial grants of rights, expedited arbitration, and bundled licenses. DOJ evaluated the consent decrees in 2014 and solicited comments on \"100% licensing\" versus \"fractional licensing.\" In 2015, the DOJ proposed \"100% licensing\" over \"fractional licensing\" for songs with multiple writers. DOJ argued that this promotes competition and called on Congress to reconsider copyright laws in the music industry. BMI filed a lawsuit challenging DOJ's interpretation, which was ruled against by Judge Louis Stanton in September 2017. The DOJ issued an interpretation allowing fractional licensing, which was challenged by BMI in a lawsuit overseen by Judge Louis Stanton. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld Stanton's decision. Licensees must serve a Notice of Intention (NOI) to the copyright holder before distributing phonorecords, with new procedures allowing bulk electronic filing of NOIs to reduce costs. The Copyright Office introduced bulk electronic filing for Notices of Intention (NOIs) under Section 115, reducing filing costs for licensees. Spotify, Amazon, and Google began filing NOIs in bulk one week after the procedural change. Digital music service companies advocated for digitizing the compulsory licensing process to ensure proper compensation for songwriters and publishers. In 2015, songwriters and publishers sued Spotify for streaming copyrighted works. The Music Modernization Act, passed in 2018, creates a new licensing collective for online music services. It also changes the process for setting royalty rates and assigns judges for infringement cases. The Music Modernization Act creates a new licensing collective for online music services, changes the process for setting royalty rates, and assigns judges for infringement cases. It extends federal copyright protection to sound recordings made before February 15, 1972, and establishes procedures for producers, mixers, and sound engineers to receive royalty payments. Online music services can pay for a broad blanket mechanical license, and new nonprofit entities are designated to oversee licensing and coordination. The Music Modernization Act establishes a new licensing collective for online music services, funded by an assessment from online music services. The Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) would have a 17-member board of directors and be responsible for maintaining a musical works database, offering blanket licenses, and administering voluntary licenses for public performance rights. The MLC would also engage in efforts to identify musical works and locate copyright owners, as well as participate in proceedings before the Copyright Office and the CRB. The Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) would be responsible for collecting and distributing royalties from online music services to rights holders, with songwriters receiving at least 50% of all royalties for unmatched works. The MLC would not negotiate royalty rates or terms, grant licenses for public performances, or engage in government lobbying activities. The digital licensing coordinator would establish governance structure, membership criteria, and dues, enforce notice and payment obligations, and participate in proceedings to establish assessment rates. The digital licensing collective would enforce notice and payment obligations, participate in proceedings to establish assessment rates, and maintain records of its activities. It would be prohibited from engaging in government lobbying activities. Failure to provide monthly usage reports or royalties would result in default of the blanket license for online music services. Disputes could be reviewed in federal district court, and claims could be brought for unresolved issues. Copyright owners would be prohibited from suing online music services with valid blanket licenses for infringement. The Music Modernization Act allows copyright owners to sue online music services for unauthorized reproduction or distribution of musical works. However, if the service complies with specified requirements, the owner can only recover royalties, not damages. The Copyright Royalty Board must use the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard for setting royalty rates. The Music Modernization Act requires the Copyright Royalty Board to use the \"willing buyer/willing seller\" standard for setting royalty rates for musical works. Judges in the Southern District of New York can consider sound recording public performance rates for online services and satellite digital audio services, but not for broadcast radio stations. The system for assigning judges in the Southern District of New York for ASCAP and BMI cases would change to a random process. The district court in the Southern District of New York would change the system for assigning judges to ASCAP and BMI cases to a random process. Judges not involved in the consent decrees would hear rate setting cases. Creators of sound recordings made before February 15, 1972, but after January 1, 1923, would be entitled to payments from digital music services, along with other legal remedies. This entitlement under federal law would be in addition to any state copyright law protections for these recordings. The federal law provides entitlement to payments for pre-1972 sound recordings, along with legal remedies such as damages and injunctions. Rights owners must file information with the Copyright Office to receive statutory damages or attorney's fees. Regulations will be issued for filing sound recording identification and contact information. This protection applies until February 15, 2067. Producers, mixers, and sound engineers can seek royalties through a nonprofit collective designated by the CRB with a letter of direction from a featured artist. Producers, mixers, and sound engineers can seek royalties through a nonprofit collective designated by the CRB with a letter of direction from a featured artist. The entity in charge of distributions must be a nonprofit collective designated by the CRB, as per modifications to 17 U.S.C. \u00a7114(g). Legislators have introduced measures related to the music industry, such as S.Con.Res. 6 and H.Con.Res. 13, Supporting the Local Radio Freedom Act. In January 2017, Senator John Barrasso and Representative Michael Conaway introduced resolutions supporting the Local Radio Freedom Act, stating that Congress should not impose new fees on local radio stations for playing sound recordings. In April 2017, Representative Issa introduced the PROMOTE Act of 2017, which would allow copyright owners to withdraw their music from broadcast radio stations unless royalties are paid at statutory rates set by the CRB. In July 2017, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner introduced the Transparency in Music Licensing and Ownership Act, H.R. 3350, to create a searchable database for musical works and sound recordings. In October 2017, Representative Hakeem Jeffries introduced the Copyright Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement (CASE) Act of 2017, H.R. 3945, to establish a Copyright Claims Board for copyright owners to protect their work. In May 2018, Senator Ron Wyden introduced the Accessibility for Curators, Creators, Educators Act. In May 2018, Senator Ron Wyden introduced the ACCESS to Recordings Act, S. 2933, which aims to provide federal copyright protection for sound recordings made before February 15, 1972. This bill would allow rights holders to receive payments from digital services for publicly performing their works and preempt state copyright protection. Owners of pre-1972 sound recording copyrights would need to provide timely notice of federal copyright registration and infringement to be eligible for statutory damages or attorney's fees within a limited three-year window. Sound recordings made before February 15, 1972 would enter the public domain either 95 years after release or 120 years after recording. Works recorded between 1923 and 1930 would be protected until December 31, 2025 if certain conditions are met."
