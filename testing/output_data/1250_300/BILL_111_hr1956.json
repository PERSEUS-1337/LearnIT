The \"Crime Victim Restitution and Court Fee Intercept Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow for the collection of past-due state judicial debts by reducing overpayments payable to individuals and paying the amount to the state judicial branch or agency. The Act allows for the collection of past-due state judicial debts by reducing overpayments and paying the amount to the state judicial branch or agency. The person making the overpayment is notified of the reduction and the names, taxpayer identification numbers, and addresses of joint filers are included in the notice. The reduction of overpayments is done after any liability for internal revenue tax is addressed. The overpayment shall be reduced for various liabilities including internal revenue tax, past-due support, debts to Federal agencies, State income tax obligations, and covered unemployment compensation debt before being credited to future tax liabilities. If the Secretary receives notice from State agencies. The overpayment by a person will be credited towards debts owed to State agencies or State judicial branches in the order they accrued.
