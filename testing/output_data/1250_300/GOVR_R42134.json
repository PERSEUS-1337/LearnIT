    "content": "Risk adjustment is the process of adjusting payments to health insurance plans based on differences in the risk characteristics of enrollees. This helps level the playing field by ensuring fair payments based on factors like gender, age, geography, health status, and tobacco use. Insurers use sophisticated risk adjustment models to account for factors like gender, age, geography, health status, and tobacco use when enrolling individuals in their plans. However, these models do not fully explain the differences in expected health care spending. The report discusses how CMS pays private health plans under Medicare Advantage, how risk scores for MA enrollees are generated and change over time, and potential issues with risk adjustment and audits. Medicare Advantage offers private plan options for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in both Parts A and B. Advantage provides private plan options, like managed care, for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in both Parts A and B. Health plans agree to provide all required Medicare benefits to enrollees for a capitated monthly payment. Plans are at-risk if costs exceed payments, but can retain savings if costs are less. Payments to MA plans are based on bids compared to a benchmark set by CMS. Bids include administrative costs and profit, reflecting the plan's estimate of covering an average beneficiary. The bids for Medicare Advantage plans reflect the plan's estimate of covering an average beneficiary, including administrative costs and profit. CMS sets a benchmark, and adjusts payments based on the characteristics of enrolled beneficiaries. The MA risk adjustment methodology uses demographic and health factors to adjust payments to plans. CMS determines risk adjustment for MA plan payments based on beneficiary demographic, health, and other factors identifiable in the current year. Health care expenditures vary by age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and disability. Incorporating health status into payments involves using ICD-9-CM codes to diagnose signs, symptoms, injuries, diseases, and conditions. The process of incorporating health status into payments involves using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes, which are mapped into diagnostic groups and condition categories. These categories have a hierarchy imposed on them, where only the most significant manifestation of a disease is coded for payment purposes. For example, Ischemic Heart Disease codes are organized into the Coronary Artery Disease hierarchy, with different condition categories arranged in descending order of clinical severity and cost. The process involves using ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes mapped into condition categories with a hierarchy based on clinical severity and cost. Only the most costly disease dictates reimbursement. 70 HCC codes predict Medicare expenditures, with 87 codes to be included in 2012. Figure 2 illustrates the conversion of ICD-9-CM codes into HCC codes. In 2012, 87 HCC codes will be incorporated into the model, converting ICD-9-CM codes. Figure 2 shows how diagnoses are mapped to HCC codes, with some conditions excluded from the CMS model if they are not chronic or short-term illnesses. The models aim to explain next year's Medicare expenditures. The CMS model excludes some conditions like chest pain and ankle sprain as they are not chronic or good predictors of future expenditures. Risk factors for each condition are estimated and added up to determine the risk-adjusted base payment, which is then multiplied by the MA plan's base rate. This results in a total estimated annual payment based on the beneficiary's risk score. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to MA plans based on the higher or lower costs of enrolling Medicare beneficiaries with certain conditions. Interaction effects between multiple conditions can result in higher costs than just their additive effects. For example, individuals with both diabetes and congestive heart failure incur higher healthcare costs than predicted. Additionally, there are interaction effects between certain diseases and disability, leading to higher costs for individuals with both a disability and diabetes. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to MA plans based on the higher or lower costs of enrolling Medicare beneficiaries with certain conditions, including interactions between diseases and disability. The model uses a linear regression approach with expenditures predicted by diagnoses and demographic variables, with adjustments periodically recalculated using current claims data. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to MA plans based on the costs of enrolling Medicare beneficiaries with certain conditions. Risk scores reflect health status and demographics, allowing for individualized payments that predict average costs. The CMS adjusts payments to Medicare Advantage plans based on the costs of enrolling beneficiaries with specific conditions. Risk scores reflect health status and demographics for individualized payments, predicting average costs. New enrollees without 12 months of Part B eligibility have rates based on age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement. Non-new enrollees include those switching plans or with at least 12 months of Part B eligibility in the previous year. CMS collects data from MA plans for risk adjustment. CMS collects information from Medicare Advantage plans to update the risk score of beneficiaries, using encounter data for diagnostic information. Risk scores are adjusted twice a year on January 1 and July 1, based on data from the previous 12 months. No diagnosis data from the service year is used for payment adjustments. The risk-adjusted payment in Medicare Advantage plans is based on data from a prior 12-month period, with error sources including age, gender, disability status, Medicaid eligibility, and disease. Plans are audited by CMS to ensure accuracy in health status information submitted for payment justification. CMS conducts audits on Medicare Advantage plans to verify the accuracy of risk-adjusted payments claimed, known as RADV audits. Previously, audits only targeted sampled enrollees, but now CMS aims to extrapolate error rates to entire plan contracts for potential savings. The final notice in February 2012 outlined the methodology for extrapolating payment errors for the entire contract. This shift may lead to more aggressive pushback from plans as CMS seeks larger recoveries, posing challenges for some Part C plans. CMS conducts audits on Medicare Advantage plans to verify the accuracy of risk-adjusted payments claimed. The audits are conducted at the contract level, with a three-step process involving sampling, medical record review, and error rate calculation/payment adjustment. CMS uses a sample size of 201 enrollees drawn from eligible Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the contract. Enrollees must meet specific criteria to be included in the sample. Enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans must meet specific criteria to be included in the sample for audits conducted by CMS. These criteria include being enrolled in the same MA contract for 12 months, having non-ESRD status, not being in hospice for more than 12 months, maintaining Medicare Part B coverage, and having at least one risk adjustment diagnosis. Eligible enrollees are divided into three equal groups for sampling, with 67 enrollees randomly selected from each group. The sample for audits conducted by CMS includes 201 eligible enrollees divided into three groups based on risk scores. Each group consists of 67 enrollees randomly selected. Sampling weights are used to ensure representation of each group. Enrollee sampling weights are used to extrapolate sample payment error findings to the population. The MA plan is informed of the audited enrollees and their HCC codes. Enrollee sampling weights are used to scale-up sample payment error findings to the population. MA plans must provide evidence from medical records to substantiate HCC codes they were paid for. Plans have 12 weeks to deliver medical records for audited enrollees. CMS reviews records to determine if diagnosis justifies payment. Plans can appeal findings, with final decision binding unless reviewed by CMS Administrator. The final decision on payment errors for each enrollee is binding unless appealed to the CMS Administrator. Underpayments cannot be supported by submitting additional medical records. Payment errors are calculated based on corrected risk scores from the RADV medical record review. Enrollee-level payment errors can be positive (net overpayment) or negative (net underpayment). The payment error is the difference between the original and corrected payment, either positive (overpayment) or negative (underpayment). It is calculated for each enrollee based on enrollment months in the MA contract. The estimated payment error for each MA contract is determined by summing weighted enrollee payment errors. The payment recovery amount is based on the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval around the payment error estimate, adjusted by a fee-for-service adjuster. The payment error estimate is modified by a fee-for-service adjuster to account for different documentation standards in RADV audits. Figure 4 shows the payment error calculation, with 201 eligible enrollees per contract selected for review. Errors identified during the audit are used to establish the total error in payment for each enrollee, which is then extrapolated to the contract. The estimated plan level error across all enrollees is $1,187.50, with a 99% confidence interval calculated for this estimate. In a hypothetical example, the estimated plan level error across all enrollees is $1,187.50. A 99% confidence interval is then calculated, indicating a certainty that the actual error in payment will fall within the range of $1,037.50 to $1,337.50. If the confidence interval includes $0 or is below $0, the recovery amount would be limited to $0. The results of the RADV audit do not lead to additional payments to MA plans. Recent academic studies and research by MedPAC have raised concerns about risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage. Plans may enroll beneficiaries with below-average costs to receive higher reimbursements, leading to potential financial implications. Recent concerns have been raised about risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage plans. There are worries that some plans may enroll beneficiaries with below-average costs but receive higher reimbursements, leading to potential financial implications. Stakeholders, including the American Academy of Actuaries, have expressed concerns about the audit process and the accuracy of the risk adjustment model. The Medicare fee-for-service data used for risk adjustments may contain errors as it was never validated. The proposed audit process creates inconsistency in applying risk adjustment factors developed with unvalidated data to validated MA data. This discrepancy could lead to inaccuracies in determining payment errors and risk profiles of enrollees. The inconsistency in data validation between Medicare fee-for-service data and MA data could lead to payment errors and risk profile inaccuracies, potentially resulting in systematic underpayment and payment inequities. The Health Practice Council is concerned about data inconsistency in risk adjustment for MA plans, leading to underpayment and payment inequities. The notice of final calculation methodology includes a fee-for-service adjustment to address these concerns. Risk adjustment aims to compensate MA plans for enrolling sicker or healthier Medicare beneficiaries, but plans may be systematically under or overcompensated based on their enrollee profile. The report discusses concerns about the accuracy of using Medicare fee-for-service data for risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage plans. Some plans fear financial risks from RADV audits. The history of Part C risk adjustment payments to private plans is outlined in the appendix. The appendix briefly describes the various risk adjustment models used to adjust Medicare private plan payments, showing the year each model was in use and the percentage of variation in individual expenditures predicted by each model (R2). The models aim to predict beneficiary spending based on their characteristics, with the R2 quantifying how well the model explains the variation in expenditures. The R2 quantifies how well a model explains variation in expenditures, ranging from 0 to 1. The AAPCC model explains 0.77% of the variation, with newer models explaining up to 12.5%. Prior to 2000, private plan payments were adjusted for demographic factors like age, sex, Medicaid enrollment, and employer-sponsored insurance. The AAPCC model demographic variables include age, sex, Medicaid enrollment, institutionalized status, and working aged status. These variables explain less than 1% of Medicare beneficiary expenditure variation. Private plan enrollees were healthier than original Medicare enrollees, leading to higher payments. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required CMS to implement a risk adjustment methodology, leading to the use of the Principal Inpatient Diagnostic Cost Group (PIP-DCG) model from 2000 to 2003. Starting in 2004, Medicare plan payments were adjusted by the CMS-HCC model, which includes information from hospital admissions to determine beneficiary health status. The PIP-DCG model used from 2000 to 2003 had limitations, such as not counting illnesses with high expenditures that did not result in hospital admissions. Legislation maintained a 90% demographic-only method and 10% PIP-DCG method through 2003 to soften the financial impact on M+C organizations. The CMS-HCC model, implemented in 2004, adjusts Medicare plan payments based on beneficiary health status using information from various healthcare settings. It considers illness severity, interactive effects, and multiple diseases to explain 10% of expenditure variation. Updates to the model, like Version 12, account for changes in diagnosis codes annually. Updates to the CMS-HCC model, including Version 12 and Version 21, involve annual adjustments for changes in ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes and recalibration with recent data. Version 21 underwent a major clinical revision in 2009 to account for changes in disease patterns, treatment methods, and coding practices, increasing the model's predictive power to approximately 12.5%. Version 21 is set to be implemented in 2012 for PACE plans."
