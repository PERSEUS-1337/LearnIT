    "content": "The federal parity law aims to ensure that coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical services. It consists of two laws: the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. These laws establish coverage terms that must be equal between mental health services and medical services, including limits, treatment restrictions, financial requirements, and covered benefits. The health reform law of 2010 did not change these parity requirements. The federal parity law, established by the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, ensures that coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services are on par with medical and surgical services. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded the law's applicability to include Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), individual market plans, and certain Medicaid plans. The ACA requires the establishment of Exchanges where individuals and employers can purchase health insurance. Plans offered in the Exchanges, known as QHPs, must comply with federal parity law. QHPs will be provided through both small group and individual markets, and may also be offered outside of an Exchange. Plans offered through the individual market and Medicaid benchmark plans must also comply with federal parity law. Medicaid may be offered through traditional state plan benefits or benchmark-equivalent coverage, including Medicaid managed care plans. The ACA requires Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans to partially comply with federal parity law for mental health and substance use disorder services. Fully insured and self-insured small plans are exempt from federal parity law compliance. Traditional fee-for-service Medicaid and Medicare are also not subject to federal parity law. Federal parity law exempts small group health plans of employers with 2-50 employees, including \"groups of one.\" It does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicare, but Medicare Part B outpatient mental health services must have copayments of 20% by 2014. The federal parity law aims to address disparities in coverage terms between mental health and substance use disorder services and medical services. While the law does not mandate coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services, it requires parity with medical services if they are covered. The ACA introduced broader changes that include requirements for the coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services. The ACA introduced broader changes that include requirements for the coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services through the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) in the Exchanges. The ACA requires the Department of Health and Human Services to define the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) which must include mental health and substance use disorder services. A report by the Department of Labor found that most employer plans cover these services. The specific services included in the EHB will be determined through rulemaking. The ACA mandates the inclusion of mental health and substance use disorder services in Essential Health Benefits (EHB). The specific services to be included will be determined through rulemaking, with states able to define EHB using benchmark health insurance plans. The HHS proposal allows states to choose a benchmark health insurance plan from four options, with services comparable to a typical employer plan. The HHS Secretary requested the Institute of Medicine to study the determination of Essential Health Benefits (EHB), which was released in a report on October 7, 2011. The report does not recommend specific services for inclusion in the EHB. The IOM released a report on Essential Health Benefits, not recommending specific services for inclusion. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services, requiring plans to offer either the EHBP or EHB for certain types of plans. The ACA mandates coverage of Essential Health Benefits (EHB) including mental health and substance use disorder services, with requirements effective by January 1, 2014. Grandfathered and large group plans outside of Exchanges are exempt. The health reform law changes will likely increase access to these services, with plans potentially voluntarily offering them to stay competitive in the market."
