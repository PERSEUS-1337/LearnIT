    "content": "The House and Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, containing provisions affecting military personnel. A conference committee resolved differences between the versions, and the final bill was signed into law on December 23, 2016. This report highlights selected personnel-related issues of high congressional interest. The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 were as follows: Army (480,000), Navy (372,642), Marine Corps (172,600), and Air Force (357,000). Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel strength in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but recent years saw reversals due to U.S. forces withdrawal. In response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel strength. However, recent years have seen reversals due to U.S. forces withdrawal and budget constraints. End-strengths for the Air Force and Navy have been declining since 2001. FY2016 and FY2017 authorized end-strengths are shown in Figure 1. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed lowering end-strengths for all services, with the Senate approving identical levels and the House approving higher levels, particularly for the Army. The House provision adjusted minimum end-strengths for the Navy, which remained higher than the Administration request. The final bill set minimum end-strengths equal to authorized levels for FY2017. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 6% over the past 15 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. The FY2017 authorized end-strengths for the Selected Reserve saw reductions in Navy Reserve strength and modest shifts in other components. The Administration requested a reduction in end-strength for four reserve components, with the House bill proposing increases for the Army National Guard and Army Reserve. This is part of ongoing concerns about military personnel costs and recruitment. The military pay raise for 2017 is set at 2.1% unless Congress or the President specifies otherwise. In the past three years, the President has set the pay raise below the Employment Cost Index. Congress has not specified an increase in basic pay for 2014-2016. The President has set military pay raises below the Employment Cost Index for the past three years. Congress did not specify an increase in basic pay for 2014-2016. The FY2017 budget requested a 1.6% pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.1%. The enacted bill specified a 2.1% pay raise effective January 1, 2017. Under current law, servicemembers receive Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) based on paygrade, geographic location, and dependency status to cover housing costs. BAH rates vary by location but aim to provide comparable housing options for servicemembers of similar rank and family status. The Senate bill proposed changes to how Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is calculated, focusing on geographic location and paygrade rather than dependency status. It would base BAH on actual housing expenditures up to a maximum amount and adjust payments for servicemembers sharing living quarters. The new formula for Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) would apply to certain members of the Armed Forces starting on January 1, 2018. It would limit the allowance for servicemembers sharing housing and require the Secretary of Defense to submit proposed regulations by March 31, 2017. The House bill did not include a similar provision, but the enacted bill mandates a report on transitioning from the current pay system by March 1, 2017. The enacted bill requires DOD to provide a report to the House and Senate Armed Services Committee by March 1, 2017, on transitioning to a new pay structure. This new structure aims to recruit and retain a high-quality All-Volunteer Force by implementing a \"single-salary pay system\" that eliminates Basic Allowance for Housing and Basic Allowance for Subsistence. The conference report acknowledges the evolution of BAH over the past 20 years as a housing benefit for servicemembers in high-cost areas without government-provided quarters. The conference report acknowledges the evolution of Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) as a housing benefit for servicemembers in high-cost areas without government-provided quarters. The Secretary of Defense is directed to plan for a transition to a salary system aligning the payment of the allowance with its use as compensation rather than an allowance. The military retirement system underwent changes in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 to modernize and reduce costs. These changes include reducing the retired pay multiplier, adding a 401k-type defined contribution element, allowing for a partial lump-sum payment of retired pay, and adding continuation pay as a retention incentive. The new system will go into effect on January 1, 2018, for servicemembers entering on or after that date. Concerns have been raised about the impact of reducing the retired pay multiplier on retaining certain occupational specialties at the mid-career point. The FY2016 NDAA authorized DOD to provide continuation pay as a retention incentive at the completion of 12 years of service in return for an additional 4-year commitment to service. A provision (Section 633) allows DOD to pay continuation pay between 8 to 12 years of service for a 3-year commitment, providing more flexibility in managing personnel based on retention trends for specific military specialties. Additionally, the enacted bill amends procedures for calculating continuation pay minimums for active and reserve component members. The enacted bill amends procedures for calculating continuation pay minimums for active and reserve component members, ensuring that reserve component members on active duty receive the same minimum pay as active duty members. The Senate provision for default contributions to the TSP being to a Roth plan was not adopted. Additionally, cadets, midshipmen, and reservists in inactive duty status before January 1, 2018, are allowed a 30-day election period for the new retirement system. The Senate bill amends 10 U.S.C. \u00a71409 to allow cadets, midshipmen, and reservists a 30-day election period for the new retirement system after commissioning or transfer to active duty. Military servicemembers can receive retired pay after 20 years of service, and the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce cases. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA) allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce cases based on 20 qualifying years of service. The law also permits certain former spouses to receive military benefits. The calculation of retired pay is based on pay grade and years of service at the time of divorce court order. Up to 50% of disposable military retired pay can be divided in a divorce case. Proposed changes would use pay grade and years of service at the time of the court order. The bill includes cost-of-living adjustments for spousal payments. The bill authorizes changes in the definition of disposable retired pay and includes cost-of-living adjustments in spousal payments. It will not affect divorce settlements prior to enactment. Military retirees may have a portion of their retired pay withheld for survivor benefits through the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP). The base amount for survivors is usually 55% of the retired basic pay, previously 75% for those who died on active duty. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides a survivor's payment to servicemembers' beneficiaries, usually 55% of the retired basic pay. Previously, those who died on active duty received 75% of their basic pay. Reservists who died during inactive-duty training receive a lower SBP payment based on years of service. Surviving spouses receiving SBP and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) have their SBP payments reduced by the amount of DIC, offset by the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA). The FY2017 NDAA addressed disparate treatment in SBP payments. The enacted bill includes provisions amending the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) for reserve and active component members, allowing DOD to withhold SBP payments from Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC), extending authority to pay Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance (SSIA) until May 31, 2018, and requiring a report on affected individuals. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report on individuals affected by the offset within 90 days of the act's enactment. Nearly 65,000 surviving spouses are estimated to receive the SSIA in FY2018. Section 648 mandates an independent assessment of the SBP and a report with recommendations to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. The report will evaluate the effectiveness of the SBP for survivors of servicemembers, compare benefits with other sectors, and explore alternative survivor benefit options. TRICARE is a health benefits program for active duty servicemembers, retirees, and their families. The FY2017 Budget proposed changes including new enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-pays, replacing Prime, Standard, and Extra options with Select and Preferred options. This also included increased pharmacy co-pays for retirees and military family members. The FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE, including new enrollment fees, deductibles, and co-pays for retirees and military family members. The proposal aims to reduce TRICARE for Life expenditures by increasing pharmacy co-pays and implementing a new TRICARE for Life enrollment fee. The Congressional Budget Office estimates savings of $2.8 billion from pharmacy co-payment increases and $1.4 billion from the new enrollment fee over the period of 2016 to 2026. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that TRICARE proposals in the President's Budget would save DOD $2.8 billion from pharmacy co-payment increases and $1.4 billion from a new TRICARE for Life enrollment fee over 2016-2026. The enacted bill establishes a new TRICARE Select health plan option, sets enrollment fees and deductibles for retirees joining TRICARE after January 1, 2018, and allows for open enrollment periods. The enacted bill establishes a new TRICARE Select health plan option, sets enrollment fees and deductibles for retirees joining TRICARE after January 1, 2018, and allows for open enrollment periods. The bill also limits requirements for pre-authorization for referrals under TRICARE Prime and requires a pilot program on value-based health care methodology in the TRICARE program. In its FY2017 budget request, the Administration proposed changes to TRICARE health plans, including consolidating options, increasing pharmaceutical co-pays, and establishing new enrollment fees. The House-passed bill aimed to consolidate TRICARE Standard and Extra into a new TRICARE Preferred plan, while the Senate-passed bill proposed a new TRICARE Choice plan. The enacted bill includes cost-sharing tables for active-duty family members and retirees under TRICARE Select and Prime, with fixed dollar amounts annually indexed to retirement pay increases. Exceptions are provided for disability retirees, dependents, and survivors, with no changes to cost-sharing for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries. The enacted bill includes cost-sharing tables for active-duty family members and retirees under TRICARE Select and Prime, with fixed dollar amounts annually indexed to retirement pay increases. Exceptions are provided for disability retirees, dependents, and survivors, with no changes to cost-sharing for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries. A \"reserve and young adult\" category will be created for TRICARE Reserve Select and TRICARE Young Adult Program beneficiaries. Premiums for these programs will remain the same, but new cost-sharing provisions will apply. Retired beneficiaries eligible for TRICARE before 2018 will face a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee 90 days after a report is submitted to the armed services committees by the Comptroller General. The report, due by February 1, 2020, will assess changes in health care coverage, appointment access, provider acceptance, and beneficiary satisfaction. TRICARE beneficiaries have access to a pharmacy program for outpatient prescriptions. Active duty family members and retirees under TRICARE Select and Prime will have cost-sharing tables with fixed dollar amounts annually indexed to retirement pay increases. A \"reserve and young adult\" category will be created for TRICARE Reserve Select and TRICARE Young Adult Program beneficiaries. Retired beneficiaries eligible for TRICARE before 2018 will face a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee. TRICARE beneficiaries have access to a pharmacy program that includes military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order pharmacy, and TRICARE retail network pharmacies. Active duty servicemembers have no pharmacy co-payments at military pharmacies. Military pharmacies provide a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free. The 2016 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase to pharmacy co-pays and required maintenance drug prescriptions to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed annual increases in pharmacy co-payments to save $300 million in FY2017 and $2 billion by 2021. The House-passed bill did not include a provision for co-payment increases, but previous legislation had overridden statutory increases. The Senate-passed bill would have allowed beneficiaries to receive drugs at no cost in military medical facilities. The Senate-passed bill, effective February 1, 2015, allowed beneficiaries to receive drugs at no cost in military medical facilities. Section 702 authorized the Secretary of Defense to exclude low-value drugs from coverage and give preferential status to non-generic drugs on the TRICARE formulary. Implementation of Section 702 was estimated to reduce DOD's pharmacy costs by $640 million over 2017-2021 and decrease health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries by $2.7 billion. Implementing Section 702 would have reduced DOD's net discretionary pharmacy costs by about $640 million over the 2017-2021 period and decrease health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries by $2.7 billion over the 2017-2026 period. Additionally, implementing Section 702 would have reduced accrual payments into the MERHCF by about $1.5 billion over the 2018-2021 period. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) was formed in 2013 to support Armed Forces medical services. It manages TRICARE and oversees military treatment facilities. The conference report suggests consolidating all MTF administration under a single agency to improve medical force readiness and lower costs. The conference report proposes consolidating all military treatment facility administration under the Defense Health Agency to improve medical force readiness, lower costs, and streamline decision-making for a more efficient healthcare delivery system. This change aims to enhance beneficiaries' access to care, health outcomes, and overall experience while reducing the total management cost of the military health system. Section 702 of the enacted bill transfers administration of military treatment facilities to the Defense Health Agency, including budget, IT, healthcare management, policy, construction, and other relevant matters. It establishes a professional staff within the agency for oversight and direction. The Surgeons General of each service will advise the Secretary on medical issues and manage their service's medical personnel. The Secretary must develop an implementation plan and submit a preliminary draft to the armed services. Section 702 of the enacted bill transfers administration of military treatment facilities to the Defense Health Agency, including budget, IT, healthcare management, policy, construction, and other relevant matters. It establishes a professional staff within the agency for oversight and direction. The Surgeons General of each service will advise the Secretary on medical issues and manage their service's medical personnel. The Secretary must develop an implementation plan and submit a preliminary draft to the armed services. Additionally, Section 703 adds a new section to the United States Code requiring the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical facilities to support the medical readiness of the armed forces and medical personnel in areas where civilian facilities are unable to meet the needs of the Armed Forces and covered beneficiaries. The provision requires the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical facilities to support the medical readiness of the armed forces and medical personnel in areas where civilian facilities are unable to meet the needs of the Armed Forces and covered beneficiaries. Citizenship requirements for active and reserve component enlistees may be waived under certain circumstances. The Senate bill aimed to amend the citizenship requirements for reserve component enlistees to align with those of the active component, but this provision was not included in the conference bill. The Secretary of Defense announced new policies for maternity and parental leave to attract and retain talent in the Armed Forces. The Department of Defense announced new policies to extend maternity leave to 12 weeks and seek legislative action to extend parental leave to 14 days as part of the \"Force of the Future\" initiative. Parental leave for servicemembers was first authorized in 2009 and is currently for a maximum of 10 days. Additionally, servicemembers who adopt a child are eligible for up to 21 days of leave. The enacted bill allows up to 12 weeks of total leave for the primary caregiver in connection with the birth of a child. Section 521 of the enacted bill authorizes up to 12 weeks of total leave for the primary caregiver in connection with the birth of a child, including 6 weeks of convalescent leave. It also allows 6 weeks of leave for a primary caregiver in the case of an adoption, with secondary caregivers eligible for up to 21 days of leave. The Secretary of Defense must define \"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregivers. Leave must be taken within a year of the event and is for active duty members or those on active duty recall. The provision is in addition to any other earned leave, and the Secretary of Defense may require servicemembers to extend their service obligation. Section 521 of the final bill authorizes up to 12 months of parental leave for the primary caregiver, with additional regulations allowing the Secretary of Defense to adjust service obligations or existing leave. The bill also includes a provision prohibiting unauthorized leave for military servicemembers, aiming to clarify that military leave is established by law. Paid parental leave is supported for its benefits in workforce recruitment and retention, as well as for the well-being of military families. Supporters of paid parental leave in the military argue that it enhances workforce recruitment and retention by making benefits more competitive with the private sector. Opponents fear that extending maternity and parental leave could harm military readiness. Congress has shown interest in improving the Defense Commissary system, with funding authorized in FY2016 and proposed reductions in FY2017. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, veterans, and DOD civilians stationed overseas. The FY2016 NDAA required a report on budget neutrality for the Defense Commissary system, acknowledging that privatization may not replicate current benefits and savings. Critics urge further evaluation before initiating a pilot program. The Comptroller General was directed to assess the DOD's plan. The FY2016 NDAA required a report on budget neutrality for the Defense Commissary system, with critics urging further evaluation before a pilot program. The Comptroller General assessed DOD's plan, highlighting gaps in achieving budget neutrality by October 2018 and lack of specific metrics for benchmarks. The FY2016 NDAA mandated elements for the Defense Commissary system, including privatization, impact of closing commissaries, and pricing options. Sections 661 and 662 allow DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and accept Military Star Card payments. Reforms aim to maintain benefits, savings for patrons, and support MWR activities with congressional oversight. The reforms to the commissary system aim to preserve benefits, ensure savings for patrons, and support MWR activities. This includes implementing common business practices, engaging expert commercial advice, and offering private label products with variable pricing. The changes also involve congressional oversight, allowing DeCA to set prices based on market conditions and accept Military Star Card payments. Additionally, DOD is required to develop a strategy to optimize practices across the DeCA and military exchange network. The enacted bill requires DOD to develop a strategy to optimize practices across the DeCA and military exchange network to reduce reliance on appropriated funds. Commissaries could use flexible product pricing to maintain savings. DOD may convert the commissary agency to a non-appropriated fund entity if savings are maintained. The Defense Secretary must ensure no loss in pay for current DeCA employees. DOD can contract with grocery industry experts to improve the commissary system. Acceptance of the Military Star Card is authorized. The provision allows DOD to contract with grocery industry experts to improve the commissary system and accept the Military Star Card as a form of payment. References include CRS Report R44019 and DODIG Memorandum on fresh produce contracts. In the past few decades, Congress has enacted legislation and appropriated funds for servicemember off-duty education, credentialing programs, and transition services to support servicemembers and veterans in translating military skills into post-service education and employment opportunities. Notable programs include the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), Credentialing Opportunities Online (COOL), and the DOD Skillbridge program (JTEST-AI). Section 561 of the final bill eliminates the requirement for third-party accreditation of credentialing programs. Section 561 of the final bill eliminates the requirement for third-party accreditation of credentialing programs and instead sets quality assurance benchmarks. Sections 567 and 568 require DOD reports on transition initiatives for servicemembers to obtain merchant mariner licenses, assess college credit for military skills, and evaluate the JTEST-AI program. Section 3590 sets deadlines for TWIC applications for separating military servicemembers, and Section 564 requires DOD to provide information and applications for TWIC cards as part of TAP. Sections 562 and 563 mandate notification about recoupment. The final bill includes provisions for separating military servicemembers to obtain identity credentials (TWIC) and receive information and applications for such cards as part of TAP. It also requires DOD to provide notification about recoupment of separation payments and counseling on substance abuse during mandatory TAP training. Additionally, a proposed pilot program for job placement services for reserve component members was not adopted. General and flag officers (GFOs) are high-ranking military positions in the DOD, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and combatant commanders. The ranks range from 1-star to 4-star, with limits set by statute. Congress periodically reviews and revises the number, duties, and compensation of GFOs. Section 910 of the House bill aimed to restrict the rank of service and functional component commanders under combatant commanders. Section 910 of the House bill aimed to restrict the rank of service and functional component commanders under combatant commanders to lieutenant general or vice admiral. It also required a reduction in the total number of active duty generals and admirals by 5. The Senate bill proposed a 25% reduction in authorized active and reserve GFOs, with a focus on higher-ranking GFOs. Additionally, the Senate bill aimed to eliminate certain statutory grade requirements in various military communities. The Senate bill proposes a significant reduction in the number of authorized general and flag officer positions, with a focus on higher-ranking officers. The Secretary of Defense is required to reduce the total number of GFOs on active duty by 110 positions by December 31, 2022. This amounts to an 11% reduction in authorized positions, with reductions in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and an increase in the Marine Corps. The reduction in GFO personnel will be smaller than the reduction in positions. Reductions in authorized positions will be distributed among the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and joint pool. The Secretary of Defense can alter these reductions in the interest of national security, with reporting requirements and a global manpower study to justify GFO positions and identify a 10% reduction in authorized positions. The study results on GFO positions will include a 10% reduction in authorized positions, to be submitted to Congress by April 1, 2017. There has been debate over the qualification requirements for joint qualified officers in recent years. The debate surrounds the qualification requirements for joint qualified officers, focusing on the definition of joint matters and the completion of specific joint professional military education requirements. Becoming a joint qualified officer entails completing a full tour of duty in a joint assignment or other assignments demonstrating mastery of joint matters. Joint duty assignments typically last at least two years for general and flag officers and three years for other officers. The House and Senate bills aimed to modify the criteria for joint duty assignments, standardizing the length at two years for all officers. The definition of joint matters would be expanded to include various areas such as intelligence, fires, movement, protection, and sustainment under unified command. The Secretary of Defense would have the authority to designate other joint matters. Additionally, the requirements for a joint duty assignment would have been modified. The enacted bill adopted the Senate language amending criteria for joint duty assignments and the House language amending the definition of \"joint matters.\" The bills aimed to standardize the length of joint duty assignments at two years and expand the definition of joint matters to include various areas. The Secretary of Defense would have the authority to designate other joint matters. The Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) requires most males between 18 and 26 in the US to register with Selective Service. Women have never been required to register. Failure to register can result in criminal penalties, loss of benefits, and denial of security clearances. Recent DOD policy changes have raised questions about the exemption for women in Selective Service registration. Recent DOD policy changes have opened all military occupational specialties to women, raising questions about the Selective Service registration exemption for women. The Senate bill proposed expanding registration requirements to women turning 18 after January 1, 2018, but this provision was not adopted in the final bill. Some have questioned the need for the Selective Service System and proposed alternative mechanisms for emergency manpower needs. The final bill requires DOD to conduct a detailed review of the Selective Service System and establish a National Commission on Military. The final bill establishes the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service to examine DOD manpower needs in emergencies. The 11-member commission includes appointees by the Administration and senior members of Congress and armed services committees. It will be funded with $15 million over 36 months. The issues of sexual assault and harassment in the military have received significant attention over the past decade. In response, the Department of Defense (DOD) implemented sexual assault policies in 2005 and established the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) as the primary oversight body. DOD released its first Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) strategic plan in 2013, with updates in 2015. Between 2012 and 2016, DOD has implemented strategic initiatives and congressionally mandated actions related to military justice, investigations, prevention, victim services, and accountability. DOD has implemented strategic initiatives and congressionally mandated actions related to military justice, investigations, sexual assault prevention, victim services, and reporting. The FY2015 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military included findings from focus groups and a survey. The estimated cost for preparing the report was $6.9 million. The FY2015 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military cost $6.9 million and included findings from focus groups and a survey. Concerns were raised about retaliation for reporting sexual assault, leading to confusion in investigations. Both House and Senate bills aimed to increase training for investigators, with the enacted bill adopting the Senate provision. The conferees expressed ongoing concern about reports of retaliation against military personnel making protected communications. The conferees are concerned about reports of retaliation against military personnel for making protected communications. The enacted bill includes provisions requiring DOD to develop metrics to prevent and respond to retaliation in connection with reports of military sexual assault. Congress has also raised concerns about the character of discharge for veterans who experienced sexual trauma while serving in the military. The enacted bill includes provisions to expand medical assessments and discharge review board considerations for servicemembers and veterans with PTSD or TBI related to combat or sexual trauma. It also modifies the definition of sexual harassment for investigating complaints by commanding officers. Section 548 of the enacted bill modifies the definition of sexual harassment in 10 U.S.C. 1561(e) for investigating complaints by commanding officers. There were 7,676 confirmed cases of child abuse or neglect in military homes in FY2014, raising concerns despite rates being lower than the general population. In FY2014, there were 7,676 confirmed cases of child abuse or neglect in military homes, a 10% increase from the previous year and a 10-year high. Concerns have been raised about prevention, management, and reporting of abuse in the Armed Forces. The Family Advocacy Program (FAP) implements initiatives for child and domestic abuse prevention, education, and training. DOD personnel are required to notify state child welfare agencies of suspected instances of child abuse and neglect. Annual reports to Congress on the Family Advocacy Program include data on these issues. The enacted bill requires DOD personnel to report child abuse and neglect to state agencies and submit annual reports to Congress on Family Advocacy Program data. The bill aims to improve oversight of abuse in military families. The provision for employee criminal background checks in DOD schools was not included in the final bill, but instead, DOD is encouraged to collaborate with local school districts to share best practices for comprehensive employment. The conference report included language urging DOD to work closely with local school districts educating military family members to develop comprehensive employment screening policies for the safety of military children. DOD is directed to provide a report to Congress within a year on identifying shortfalls in employee screening processes and providing recommendations for improvement. In 2013, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel directed a comprehensive review of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and its implementation through the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM) and service regulations. The Military Justice Review Group (MJRG) was established to focus on reviewing the structure and operation of the UCMJ and MCM, considering recommendations from the Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel. The Military Justice Review Group (MJRG) was established to review the UCMJ and MCM, leading to the submission of the Military Justice Act of 2016 to Congress. The proposed House bill included revisions to various aspects of military justice, such as courts-martial composition, trial procedure, sentencing, and appellate matters. The House bill proposed significant revisions to military justice, including changes to sentencing and the punitive articles. New offenses were introduced, such as prohibited activities with military recruits and fraudulent use of credit cards. The Senate bill also addressed military justice aspects like courts-martial composition and trial procedure. The proposed Senate bill addresses various aspects of military justice, including courts-martial composition, trial procedure, sentencing, and appellate matters. It differs from the House language by requiring military-specific sentencing parameters and criteria, allowing the government to appeal sentences that deviate from these parameters. Additionally, the Senate bill proposes changes to offenses related to rape and sexual assault, adding the use of \"position, rank, or authority to coerce the acquiescence of the other person in the sexual act\" as a prohibited act. The Senate bill proposed changes to offenses related to rape and sexual assault, including adding the use of \"position, rank, or authority to coerce the acquiescence of the other person in the sexual act\" as a punishable act. Differences between the House and Senate bills were resolved in conference, resulting in a comprehensive revision of the UCMJ. However, some provisions, such as interim guidance on sentencing parameters and an increase in minimum punishment for sex-related offenses, were not included in the final bill. The curr_chunk discusses the criticism of the Medal of Honor review process, with concerns about lost records and restrictive criteria for awarding medals. The Department of Defense periodically reviews inquiries and historical records to address these issues. On January 6, 2016, DOD announced the results of its review of military awards and decorations. The Department of Defense periodically reviews inquiries by Members of Congress and reevaluates its historical records. On January 6, 2016, DOD announced the results of its year-long review of military awards and decorations, including the timeliness of the MOH process and review of Service Cross and Silver Star Medal recommendations since September 11, 2001. The results of the review are due to the Secretary of Defense on September 30, 2017. Section 582 of the final bill waives time limitations to authorize the President to award certain valor awards during specific contingency operations. The Secretary of Defense directed a review of valor award nominations on January 7, 2016, resulting in a time waiver for Medal of Honor recipients from specific contingency operations. The waiver expires on December 31, 2019. Section 583 of the final bill authorizes the award of the Medal of Honor to Gary M. Rose and James C. McCloughan for acts of valor during the Vietnam War. Rose's valor was from September 11-14, 1970, while McCloughan's was between May 13-15, 1969. Section 586 of the bill requires a review of service records for Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander veterans of the Korean and Vietnam Wars previously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross, or Air Force Cross. If records support it, the Medal of Honor can be awarded with waived time limitations. The curr_chunk discusses reports and studies related to military personnel issues required by the National Defense Authorization Act. Congressional Budget Office provided a cost estimate for the FY2017 NDAA. Congressional Research Service reports are coordinated by specific authors. Contact information for CRS Point of Contact is provided."
