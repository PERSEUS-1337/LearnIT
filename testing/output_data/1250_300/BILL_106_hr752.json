    "content": "The \"Airline Passenger Fairness Act\" is the short title of the Act. The Act includes findings related to airline passenger rights. The Congress finds that the number of airline passengers on US carriers is expected to grow significantly, while the number of certified large air carriers has decreased. Many communities that had scheduled air service in 1978 no longer have it, and there have been significant fare increases in certain city pairs. The 1998 Department of Transportation study found that major city pairs experienced a 30% fare increase year-over-year, leading to a decrease of 863,500 passengers. Complaints about airline travel rose by over 25%, with complaints against large US air carriers increasing from 6,394 in 1997 to 7,994 in 1998. The National Civil Aviation Review Commission reported worsening flight delays, with a nearly 20% increase in daily aircraft delays of 15 minutes or longer. The 1997 National Civil Aviation Review Commission highlighted a growing issue of flight delays, with a nearly 20% increase in daily aircraft delays of 15 minutes or longer in 1996 compared to 1995. Additionally, the 1998 Department of Transportation study revealed that major US air carriers charge about 60% more for passengers traveling to or from small communities than those traveling between large communities. Congress has mandated the Secretary of Transportation to address unfair and deceptive practices in the airline industry. SEC. 3. FAIR PRACTICES FOR AIRLINE PASSENGERS. Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to include specific practices for certificated air carriers, such as informing passengers about oversold flights, allowing the use of portions of a ticket, timely delivery of checked baggage, and providing full access to all fares. The amended Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code, requires certificated air carriers to provide various consumer protections, including informing passengers about flight delays, cancellations, and diversions, refunding unused tickets within 48 hours of purchase, and disclosing information about frequent flyer programs. The amended Section 41712 of title 49, United States Code requires certificated air carriers to disclose information about frequent flyer programs, including the number of redeemable seats and the success rate of redemptions. The Secretary must report violations in the monthly Air Travel Consumer Report. Confirmed reserved space is defined as a specific date, flight, and class of service requested by a passenger and verified by the carrier."
