The \"Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003\" recognizes the need for specialized services for gifted students from diverse backgrounds, including those with disabilities or English as a second language. It highlights that elementary school gifted students often master a significant portion of the curriculum before the school year begins. Teachers are faced with a diverse range of student traits and needs. Most teachers receive training to meet the needs of diverse students, but often lack training for gifted students.
