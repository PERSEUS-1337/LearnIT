    "content": "A new semi-supervised learning framework is developed using an inversion scheme for deep neural networks, applicable to various systems and problems. The approach introduces a new semi-supervised learning method using residual networks, achieving state-of-the-art results on MNIST and reasonable performances on SVHN and CIFAR10. It is simple, efficient, and requires no changes in network architecture. This approach leverages unlabeled data to improve generalization and has potential for various machine perception tasks. In this paper, a new semi-supervised learning approach for deep neural networks is introduced. The method involves equipping any DNN with an inverse function for input reconstruction and incorporating unlabeled data into the learning process through a new loss function. The key insight is the ease of deriving and computing the inverse function, allowing for error minimization between input signals and estimates. The new semi-supervised learning approach for deep neural networks involves incorporating an inverse function for input reconstruction and utilizing unlabeled data in the learning process. This method allows for error minimization between input signals and estimates without additional cost or model changes, promising advancements in semi-supervised and unsupervised learning. The deep unsupervised model can be transformed into a semi-supervised model by using a denoising autoencoder to output class distribution encoding. However, this method lacks generalizability to other network topologies and requires precise hyper-parameter cross-validation. Another approach involves a probabilistic formulation of deep convolutional nets for semi-supervised learning, but it requires ReLU activation functions and a specific network topology. Temporal Ensembling for Semi-Supervised Learning aims to ensure stability in representations by constraining the latent space despite dropout noise. The paper proposes a technique to ensure stability in representations by using dropout noise in two different models. It also introduces a method for semi-supervised learning by maintaining a stable DNN for unlabeled samples. Additionally, the paper presents a simple way to invert any piecewise differentiable mapping, including DNNs, without changing their structure. The paper introduces a method for inverting piecewise differentiable mappings, including DNNs, without altering their structure. It also presents a new optimization framework for semisupervised learning that improves upon existing methods. The work builds on previous research that interprets DNNs as linear splines, providing a mathematical justification for deep learning techniques. The paper discusses how deep neural networks (DNNs) can be approximated by multivariate linear splines, allowing for the derivation of explicit input-output mapping formulas. It provides examples of input-output mappings for common DNN topologies like deep convolutional neural networks (DCN) and Resnet DNNs. The paper aims to invert piecewise differentiable mappings, including DNNs, without altering their structure, and introduces a new optimization framework for semisupervised learning. The bias term in deep neural networks (DNNs) arises from the accumulation of per-layer biases. For Resnet DNNs, an extra term in the templates provides stability and a linear connection between input and inner representations. Optimal templates for prediction in DNNs are proportional to the input, positively for the correct class and negatively for others, minimizing cross-entropy with softmax nonlinearity. This result is specific to this setting, with optimal templates becoming null for incorrect classes in spherical softmax. The optimal templates for prediction in DNNs are proportional to the input, minimizing cross-entropy with softmax nonlinearity. In the case of spherical softmax, optimal templates become null for incorrect classes. Reconstruction is implied by the analytical optimal DNN solution, leveraging the closest input hyperplane for representation. This method provides a reconstruction based on the DNN representation of the input, distinct from exact input reconstruction. Bias correction in ReLU based nonlinearities has insightful implications compared to known frameworks. The bias correction in ReLU based nonlinearities has insightful implications compared to known frameworks. This scheme can be assimilated to a composition of soft-thresholding denoising technique. The inversion strategy is applied to a given task with an arbitrary DNN, supporting semi-supervised learning by adding extra terms to the objective training function. The efficiency of the inversion scheme lies in rewriting any deep network as a linear mapping, simplifying the derivation of a network inverse. The efficiency of the inversion scheme is derived from rewriting deep networks as linear mappings, simplifying the derivation of a network inverse. This enables efficient computation of the matrix on any deep network via differentiation. The reconstruction error represents the reconstruction loss for various common frameworks, and it is incorporated into semi-supervised and unsupervised learning through a defined reconstruction loss function. The reconstruction loss R is defined as the mean squared error or cosine similarity, and a \"specialization\" loss is introduced as the Shannon entropy of class belonging probability prediction. This loss complements the reconstruction loss for semi-supervised learning by clustering unlabeled examples towards learned clusters. The complete loss function combines cross entropy loss for labeled data, reconstruction loss, and entropy loss with parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 controlling the ratio between supervised and unsupervised losses. The parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 control the ratio between supervised and unsupervised losses in a convex combination. Results of the approach on a semi-supervised task on the MNIST dataset are presented, achieving reasonable performances with different topologies. The case with N L = 50 labeled samples from the training set is highlighted, with a search conducted over different combinations of (\u03b1, \u03b2). Four different topologies are tested, including mean and max pooling, and inhibitor DNN (IDNN) as proposed in BID1 for stabilizing training. The study focuses on entropy loss minimization and explores different combinations of (\u03b1, \u03b2) values. Various topologies, including wide Resnet, are tested, with the best performance achieved. Results on MNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN datasets are presented, showing improved accuracy with semi-supervised learning using fewer labeled data. The study utilizes Theano and Lasagne libraries, detailing learning procedures and network topologies in the appendix.

The authors propose a method to compute energy function using an auto-encoder, which can be replaced with their proposed method for reconstructing input data. This approach allows for unsupervised tasks like clustering, with the possibility of producing low-entropy representations or optimal reconstructions. The framework differs from a deep-autoencoder as it considers only the final output in the reconstruction loss and emphasizes parameter sharing.
