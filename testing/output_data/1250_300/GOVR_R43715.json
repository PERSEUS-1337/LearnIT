It is essential for airlines to have this insurance for aircraft loan agreements and to meet requirements of some foreign countries. After 9/11, the U.S. government expanded the federal Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to ensure coverage for U.S. air carriers when the commercial market was unstable. Now, many airlines are purchasing war risk coverage from private insurers. Private insurance coverage for aviation war risk has become more common as the commercial insurance market has stabilized. A 2012 EU study found that coverage for passenger and aircraft hull damage is readily available, but coverage for third-party damage is limited. Airlines typically combine liability and hull risk coverage in a single policy. The cost of airline insurance is relatively small compared to total operating costs, with airlines paying around $2.3 billion in 2011. Insurance prices vary based on factors such as airline location, size, fleet age, safety record, network spread, and deductible levels. The study concluded that the private market has sufficient capacity for aviation risk. The aviation insurance market varies depending on factors like airline location, size, fleet age, safety record, and deductible levels. Commercial insurers provide war risk coverage to most airlines, with availability and lower prices in recent years. A series of airliner losses in 2014, including Malaysia Airlines flights 370 and 17, may lead to increased insurance premiums. The aviation risk environment has been unsettled by recent events such as the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 and the shooting down of flight 17. Insurers predict a potential 50% increase in insurance premiums and a tripling of war risk insurance premiums. The industry faces uncertainty regarding price rises and availability of coverage, which could impact U.S. air carriers flying to the EU. The EU Regulation 785/2004 requires all air carriers flying within, into, out of, or over EU territory to have insurance for aviation-specific liabilities, including war- and terrorism-related risks. This regulation has made war risk insurance mandatory for non-EU carriers operating to and from the EU, impacting U.S. air carriers flying to EU destinations. EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates war risk insurance for non-EU carriers operating to and from the EU. The federal government provided war risk insurance to the merchant fleet in World War I and II. Aviation war risk insurance was commercially available before 1951 but had cancellation clauses. A 1951 law gave the Secretary of Commerce authority to provide war risk insurance for air commerce interests. Coverage could include aircraft, cargo, personal effects, and crew baggage. The Secretary of Commerce had the authority to provide war risk insurance for air commerce interests, including aircraft, cargo, personal effects, and crew baggage. The insurance coverage could be extended to U.S.- and foreign-flag aircraft operating in the interest of national defense or economy. Premium rates were set by the Secretary of Commerce, and a revolving fund was established within the Treasury to fund the program. Any disputes regarding claims could be adjudicated in federal district court. The program was continued under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. The war risk insurance program for aviation was continued under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and later delegated to the FAA under the Department of Transportation. International terrorism began with hijackings in 1968 and 1969 by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) attempted to hijack four airliners on September 6, 1970, successfully taking three to Dawson's Field in Jordan where they were destroyed. The fate of the Pan Am 747 hijacked in this incident is relevant to insurance coverage for terrorist acts, as it was destroyed in Cairo after the hijackers diverted it from landing at Dawson's Field. Following the Dawson Field hijackings, the government expanded federal aviation war risk insurance coverage due to growing concerns over terrorist hijackings. The new insurance was offered at a rate of 20 cents per $100 of insurance, which was twice the price charged for commercial insurance prior to the hijackings. The government increased federal aviation war risk insurance coverage after the Dawson Field hijackings, offering insurance at a rate of 20 cents per $100 of insurance. This was in response to the ongoing Middle East crisis and a federal court decision that clarified coverage for hijacking and terrorist risks. The court ruling redefined the definition of war to require combatants to have significant attributes of sovereignty. Insurers offering \"all risk\" policies were held liable for the claim on the destroyed aircraft, as federally provided aviation war risk insurance was primarily issued without premiums prior to the 9/11 attacks. Premium war risk insurance was only available when the President determined travel to specific foreign locations was necessary for U.S. operations. During the first Gulf War in 1990 and 1991, premium war risk insurance was issued without premiums for DOD charter flights to move troops, cargo, and relief supplies overseas. Air carriers began cancelling flights to the Middle East due to soaring commercial war risk insurance rates, with premiums increasing twentyfold for flights to and from Israel. Carriers suspended flights to high-risk locations like Athens, Istanbul, and Karachi. World Airlines and Pan Am suspended flights to high-risk locations in the Middle East, including Athens, Istanbul, and Karachi. Tower Air continued operating flights from Israel under a government-issued war risk policy. FAA did not insure Tower Air's flights from New York to Tel Aviv after Iraqi Scud missiles were fired into Israel. In response to 9/11, commercial insurers cancelled war risk coverage for airlines, leading to increased premiums. Congress passed the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 to address these issues. The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-42) expanded the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to include acts of terrorism. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296) extended the program, which has been renewed multiple times, most recently in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76). The program authority under this act expires on September 30, 2014. FAA also expanded the scope of policies to include coverage for losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew at limits comparable to existing commercial insurance policies. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program was expanded to include acts of terrorism by the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 further extended the program, capping rates and ensuring coverage for losses from the first dollar of any covered loss incurred. Additionally, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 was passed in response to the 9/11 attacks to address the expensive or unavailable coverage for terrorism damage in the insurance market. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) was created in response to the 9/11 attacks to provide a broader reinsurance program for terrorism losses in the commercial property/casualty insurance market. It covers terrorism losses for most lines of commercial insurance and can still apply if airlines purchase commercial insurance instead of being in the FAA program. TRIA has been extended multiple times and was set to expire in December 2014. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, on the other hand, provided coverage to 44 U.S. air carriers with total maximum per occurrence coverage of $68 billion as of January 2014. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program provided coverage to 44 U.S. air carriers with total maximum per occurrence coverage of $68 billion as of January 2014. However, between April and August 2014, 17 U.S. air carriers cancelled their FAA war risk insurance policies in favor of commercial coverage. Currently, the FAA insures 27 air carriers estimated to cover approximately 4% of total RPMs flown by U.S. airlines, with total maximum per occurrence exposure of all premium insurance currently in force at $31 billion, a 55% reduction from January 2014. The FAA has reduced its estimate of premiums for the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, with current per occurrence exposure of all premium insurance at $31 billion, a 55% reduction from January 2014. Premium collections for FY2015 are estimated at $18 million, with coverage including hull insurance, comprehensive liability insurance, and third-party war risk liability. The program covers various risks beyond war or terrorist attacks. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program covers risks beyond war or terrorist attacks, including war, invasion, acts of foreign enemies, strikes, riots, civil commotions, malicious acts, confiscation, and more. Payments for ransom or extortion demands are not covered under this policy. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program excludes coverage for acts such as confiscation, nationalization, hijacking, and detonation of weapons on covered aircraft. Premiums are based on risk assumed by the program, with limitations set by statute. The FAA Premium War Risk Insurance Program limits premiums to no more than twice the amount paid to the Department of Transportation for third party policy. The program has paid over $10 million for claims related to specific incidents since 9/11, including an attempted bombing in 2009 and the seizure of a SkyWest aircraft in 2012. Transportation faced \"war risk occurrences\": In December 2009, there was an attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253. Claims were filed with FAA in FY2010, totaling $205,600 paid to date. In July 2012, an unattended SkyWest aircraft was seized by a fugitive airline employee, resulting in a total loss of the aircraft and damage to airport facilities and vehicles, with $9.6 million paid in claims. In April 2014, FAA paid $256,890 for repairs to a Boeing 767-223 aircraft damaged by gunfire over Afghanistan in 2012. The Secretary of Transportation proposed legislative reforms for the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to Congress on March 31, 2014. The Secretary of Transportation proposed legislative reforms for the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to Congress in 2014. The proposal aims to permanently authorize the program with reduced scope, providing war risk coverage for airline losses involving NBCR weapons and in case of private insurance market disruption. The President's FY2014 budget also suggested changes to allow collaboration with commercial insurers for shared-risk coverage. The President's FY2014 budget proposed changes to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, allowing commercial insurers to take on 80% of the risk by FY2018. The airline industry has opposed these changes, arguing that commercial war risk insurance would be too costly. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program changes proposed in the FY2014 budget are opposed by the airline industry, citing prohibitively costly commercial insurance. Airlines for America recommends maintaining the current program for three years to avoid potential economic harm. The Secretary of Transportation's March 2014 proposal argues against extending the program due to budgetary concerns, suggesting alternative ways to reduce costs. The current Administration proposal aims to reduce budgetary costs for the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, which has a budget cost of over $1 billion over 10 years. Two approaches to achieve savings include increasing premiums or reducing assumed risk to lower eventual payouts. Increasing statutory caps on premiums could potentially eliminate implicit subsidies and increase program revenue. The Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, currently over $2 billion, is invested in U.S. Treasury securities, with returns near historical lows. Private insurers invest in a wider range of instruments with higher returns. Total net investment income for private insurers was approximately $67.6 billion on $1.48 trillion in cash. Private insurers invest in a variety of instruments with higher returns than U.S. Treasury securities. In 2013, private property/casualty insurers earned $67.6 billion on $1.48 trillion in investments. Private insurance policies involve risk-sharing mechanisms like deductibles and co-insurance to mitigate moral hazard. Government coverage for airlines since 2002 has no deductibles or co-insurance, covering losses up to maximum limits. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program offers coverage for losses beyond typical \"war risks,\" including vandalism and labor disturbances. Private insurers often share risks among multiple insurers to spread risk and achieve significant savings. Reinsurance is commonly used to spread risk among insurers for large risks. Reinsurance is used to spread risk among insurers, with multiple insurers covering portions of possible loss. Loss sharing in insurance contracts can be tailored to achieve desired risk sharing. Private insurers enter into reinsurance or other loss-sharing arrangements for reasons beyond financial risk, such as leveraging expertise or capacity in specific areas of insurance operations. Loss-sharing arrangements in insurance can benefit insurers with different expertise and capital levels. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act established a program with loss sharing based on the level of loss and a percentage of the loss. Initially, the government covered 85% of losses once they reached 20% of an insurer's premiums, but the program has been reauthorized with a gradual decrease in government share. Improved guidance for risk decisions in conflict zones could stabilize private market war risk insurance premiums. Improved international guidance for making informed risk decisions regarding flights in conflict zones could stabilize private market war risk insurance premiums and coverage terms. Insurance providers are considering withdrawing coverage for flights in certain conflict zones due to concerns about inconsistent risk assessment by airlines. Airlines have been overflying conflict zones to minimize costs until formal restrictions were imposed. Insurers are concerned about airlines' inconsistent risk assessment, especially regarding overflying conflict zones. The International Civil Aviation Organization has established guidelines for identifying and avoiding conflict zones, but countries do not always share information or take necessary precautions. This has led to discussions on improving collaboration to assess conflict zone risks more effectively. In practice, countries may not always share conflict risk information with civil aviation or take adequate precautions to mitigate risks to civil aircraft. Aviation authorities like FAA may issue warnings or restrict overseas flight operations, leading to differing views on risk among regulators, airlines, and insurers. For example, FAA imposed restrictions on flights to and from Israel during an armed conflict, prompting international air carriers to resume flights after Israeli authorities argued that risks had been mitigated. The suspension of service to Israel by foreign airlines prompted Israeli authorities to request the resumption of flights, highlighting the challenges of disseminating warnings in conflict zones. Improved processes for assessing hazards and issuing warnings could reduce uncertainties in risk assessment for civil aviation. EU Regulation 785/2004 requires air carriers to be insured for aviation-specific liabilities, including acts of war and terrorism. Principle of Insurance Article 4 mandates insurance for air carriers and aircraft operators for aviation-specific liabilities, including passenger, baggage, cargo, and third-party coverage. Minimum insurance requirements are higher than those prescribed by the Montreal Convention, with varying amounts based on the type of operation and aircraft MTOM. Third-party liability coverage is also specified based on the MTOM of the operated aircraft. The minimum insurance coverage for aircraft operations is outlined in Article 7, with varying amounts based on the aircraft's MTOM. Sanctions for regulation infringement are required to be effective, proportional, and dissuasive, including potential license withdrawal for EU carriers. The federal government provides insurance programs, such as the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, created after 9/11, provided federal coverage for losses from terrorist attacks when the private sector was unwilling. Initially authorized for three years, it was extended multiple times due to the insurance industry's reluctance to cover terrorism risk. Several bills have been introduced to further extend the program as the 2014 expiration date approached. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) was reauthorized for two years in 2005 and then seven years in 2007. With the 2014 expiration date approaching, several bills have been introduced to extend the program further. The insurance industry supports the extension of TRIA, which provides government reinsurance for private insurers offering terrorism coverage. Unlike the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, TRIA does not directly cover businesses at risk of terrorism losses but reimburses private insurers for some of their losses under certain conditions. There is no provision for premiums to be paid for government coverage under TRIA. TRIA does not have a \"TRIA Fund\" like the Aviation War Risk Insurance Fund. Losses covered by TRIA are paid from the government's general fund, with no upfront premiums. A post-event recoupment fee on commercial insurance policies is used to recover costs. TRIA coverage is limited and operates through private insurers, with limits and deductibles from private policies applying. A minimum of $100 million in insured losses from a terrorist act is required before federal funds flow under TRIA. TRIA coverage is more limited than aviation war risk insurance. $100 million in insured losses from a terrorist act is required before federal funds flow. Private insurers must offer coverage under the same terms as insurance against other causes, but can charge a separate premium. Terrorism premiums may be limited under state laws regulating insurance."
