    "content": "The Act titled \"Red River Private Property Protection Act\" disclaims the Secretary's right to land south of the Red River's South Bank boundary line. Previous surveys by the Bureau of Land Management will not determine the current boundary line. The Act requires a new survey to identify the South Bank boundary line, conducted by Licensed State Land Surveyors chosen by the Texas General Land Office. The survey must adhere to the gradient boundary survey method and be completed within 2 years. Property owners can appeal public domain claims to an Administrative Law Judge within 1 year of survey approval. Not later than 1 year after the survey is completed, a private property owner may appeal public domain claims to an Administrative Law Judge. The Secretary must ensure no parcels are treated as Federal land until the survey is approved. The Act does not affect States' or Indian tribes' sovereignty rights over lands north of the Red River boundary line. After completing the survey and ensuring no further appeals, the Secretary will sell identified Federal lands through competitive sales at fair market value. Existing tribal, State, and local rights will be respected. Sale proceeds will offset Act-related costs. A report on identified Federal lands sales must be submitted to relevant committees within 5 years of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will submit a report to relevant committees listing any Federal lands not sold and reasons for non-sale, within 5 years of the Act's enactment. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"affected area\" as lands along the Red River, \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of the Interior, \"South Bank\" as the elevation along the Red River, and \"South Bank boundary line\" as the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma. The term \"South Bank boundary line\" refers to the boundary between Texas and Oklahoma identified through the gradient boundary survey method, as specified in a decree from March 12, 1923. The gradient boundary survey method is the measurement technique used to locate this boundary line, recognizing changes due to erosion and accretion along the Red River."
