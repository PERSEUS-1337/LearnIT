    "content": "The \"Medicare HMO Protection Act of 1998\" allows for the evaluation and alteration of termination decisions. The Social Security Act allows the Secretary to delay the termination of a Medicare+Choice plan if it poses a serious health risk, reduces plan availability, or if the terminating organization is offering coverage. The Secretary may delay the termination of a Medicare+Choice plan if it poses a serious health risk, reduces plan availability, or if the terminating organization is offering coverage in close proximity without suffering financial losses. The Secretary can audit and inspect the organization's books and records to make this determination. The Secretary can end a delay in terminating a Medicare+Choice plan if an adequate provider network is established, providing equal insurance coverage. If termination is delayed, the Secretary and the organization can negotiate a new contract during this period. The Medicare+Choice organization can negotiate a new contract with the Secretary to continue coverage without adversely affecting beneficiaries. SEC. 3. Extension of initial Medicare+Choice contract period to 3 years. Amends the Social Security Act to require contracts to have a term of at least 3 years. Effective for contracts entered into after the date of enactment. SEC. 4. Notice of termination.

The amendment applies to termination notices given after the enactment of this Act."
