    "content": "The 1999 Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVIA) builds on the 1988 Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA) to enhance consumer access to television signals via satellite dishes. Major companies like EchoStar and DirecTV offer satellite TV services through their DBS systems. Other companies like Rainbow DBS provide a smaller selection of channels. SHVIA allows for the rebroadcast of local network signals in addition to distant network signals for consumers living outside the broadcast network affiliate stations' \"Grade B contour.\" The 1999 SHVIA law allows satellite companies to rebroadcast local network signals in addition to distant network signals, but it is not mandatory. Local signals are received within a network affiliate's local area, while distant signals are from elsewhere in the country. The original law used the \"Grade B\" contour to determine eligibility for receiving distant network signals via satellite. The 1999 SHVIA law used the \"Grade B\" contour to determine eligibility for receiving distant network signals via satellite. Consumers inside the Grade B contour were not allowed to receive such signals, leading to court challenges. Over 2 million consumers reportedly had their distant network signals terminated by satellite companies. Congress \"grandfathered\" illegal consumers as long as they could not receive a Grade A signal. New subscribers must not be able to receive a Grade B signal to receive distant network signals. The SHVIA law requires new subscribers to not receive a Grade B signal to access distant network signals via satellite. Consumers can request a waiver if they believe they are not receiving the required signal intensity, with a 30-day decision period by the local affiliate. If the waiver is granted or no action is taken, consumers can then receive distant network signals. The local affiliate has 30 days to decide on granting a waiver for consumers to receive distant network signals from the satellite company. If the waiver is denied, consumers can request a signal intensity test, with costs covered by the \"loser\" (either the satellite company or affiliate). Exceptions apply for recreational vehicles, commercial trucks, and consumers using large \"C-band\" satellite dishes. These consumers may receive distant network signals until December 31, 2004. Consumers may receive distant network signals until December 31, 2004 if they do not receive a Grade B signal from the local affiliate, have a satellite dish on an RV or commercial truck, or had been receiving illegal signals. \"Local-into-local\" service is permitted under SHVIA for DBS companies in designated market areas. There is confusion regarding the \"must carry\" provision. The law allows DBS companies to provide \"local-into-local\" service in designated market areas, but it does not require them to do so. Under the \"must carry\" provision, DBS companies must carry all local broadcast stations in a market if they choose to provide any local station in that market. Cable companies were already subject to similar rules. The must carry provisions for DBS went into effect on January 1, 2002, and the DBS companies opposed this requirement. The DBS companies, EchoStar and DirecTV, offer local-into-local service in various markets. EchoStar covers 152 markets while DirecTV covers 106 markets, with plans to expand. There are 210 designated market areas in the US, with differences in size affecting coverage percentages. EchoStar reported 83% coverage after 100 DMAs, while DirecTV aims for 92% coverage in 130 DMAs by 2004. The LOCAL Act was passed in 2000 to ensure access to local TV in small and rural areas without local-into-local service from DBS providers. The LOCAL Act was passed in 2000 to ensure access to local TV in small and rural areas without local-into-local service from DBS providers. Satellite carriers were given a compulsory copyright license for retransmitting distant network and superstation signals under the 1988 and 1999 laws. The 1999 law extended the compulsory license for distant network signals until December 31, 2004, and the 108th Congress is considering further extensions and changes to pricing. The 108th Congress is considering extending the compulsory copyright license for satellite companies to retransmit local signals. The SHVIA provisions allow satellite companies to offer local-into-local television service and make must-carry requirements effective for satellites. Additionally, syndicated exclusivity, sports blackout, and network nonduplication rules apply to satellite retransmission of nationally distributed superstations. Subscribers affected by the 1998 Miami court rulings can have their distant network signals restored or continued until December 31, 2004. The SHVIA provisions allow satellite companies to offer local-into-local television service and extend the compulsory copyright license for satellite companies. Subscribers affected by the 1998 Miami court rulings can have their distant network signals restored or continued until December 31, 2004. The legislation also establishes criteria for receiving distant network signals and allows for waivers from local affiliates if signal strength is in doubt. C-band satellite customers can continue receiving distant network signals indefinitely. The SHVIA provisions, as of October 31, 1999, extend the satellite copyright compulsory license for distant network and superstation signals until December 31, 2004. It also creates a new compulsory license for local network signals with no sunset date. The legislation reduces copyright royalty payments for satellite companies by 45% for distant network signals and 30% for superstation signals. Additionally, it eliminates the 90-day waiting period for cable subscribers and allows satellite companies to offer a national PBS feed until January 1, 2002. After that, local PBS stations must be carried in markets where local-into-local service is provided. The conference version of H.R. 1554 in 1999 included a loan guarantee program to ensure subscribers in small and rural markets benefit from local-into-local provisions, but this provision was deleted before final passage. Congress later passed the \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act\" (LOCAL). The \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act\" (LOCAL) was passed by Congress to provide loan guarantees for up to $1.25 billion in loans to build systems for receiving local television signals. The act aims to serve \"nonserved\" or \"underserved\" areas and provide high-speed Internet access, without specifying the transmission media. The act created a four-person board to select recipients of the loan guarantees. The LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program, administered by the Rural Utilities Service, received funding from the Agriculture appropriations act. The program faced delays and criticism from the GAO for slow progress. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act allocated $80 million for the LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program until December 31, 2006. The GAO criticized the slow progress of the program and stressed the need for accurate reporting of administrative costs. The \"Northpoint Provision\" required the FCC to conduct tests to determine interference with DBS systems by terrestrial systems operating in the same frequency band. Northpoint Technology seeks to operate a terrestrial wireless system offering TV programming and data services. Northpoint Technology, through its Broadwave subsidiary, aims to offer TV programming and data services via a terrestrial wireless system called MVDDS. The FCC conducted interference tests in 2001, concluding that MVDDS could co-exist with DBS systems with mitigating techniques. Despite objections from Northpoint, the FCC decided to auction frequencies for MVDDS, raising $118.7 million in January 2004. Northpoint objected to the FCC's decision to auction frequencies for MVDDS, choosing not to participate in the auction. The auction raised $118.7 million in January 2004. Legislation was proposed to eliminate the auction requirement for fixed terrestrial services in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band."
