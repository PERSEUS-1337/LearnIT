The Congress finds that increasing the blending limit of ethanol into gasoline for vehicles requires ensuring it won't harm emission control devices or engine performance, as concerns exist about potential negative effects on engines and interstate commerce. The Federal Trade Commission has proposed labeling requirements for fuels with ethanol blends exceeding current limits to warn consumers of potential harm to vehicles. Federal testing is ongoing to assess the impact of higher ethanol blends on newer vehicles, but data is lacking for older vehicles and nonroad engines. Despite this, the executive branch has the authority to increase the blending limit of ethanol into gasoline.
