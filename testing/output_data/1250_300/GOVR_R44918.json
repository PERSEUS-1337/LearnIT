    "content": "Federal financial regulation is complex, with diverse markets, participants, and regulators. The regulatory structure has evolved in response to financial crises, such as the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. Congress is currently considering proposals to modify the regulatory system, including the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017. The Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 proposes changes to the regulatory structure, including modifying the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Federal Insurance Office, altering the relationship between the Financial Stability Oversight Council and regulators, eliminating the Office of Financial Research, and making changes to how financial regulators create rules and are funded. The report provides an overview of U.S. financial regulation frameworks, federal regulators, and other entities involved in financial regulation. The financial system matches funds of savers and investors with borrowers. Financial firms act as intermediaries or agents in this process, linking savers and borrowers together. Regulators oversee the products, instruments, and markets used in this matching process. Financial activities can be separated into distinct markets such as banking and insurance. Financial regulators oversee a complex system of financial activities, including banking, insurance, securities, derivatives, and financial market infrastructure. These activities can be formally defined by regulation or functionally defined based on their purpose. Financial regulation involves formal and functional definitions of activities, with a focus on regulators and their authority. The regulatory system is seen as fragmented, with overlapping and duplicative authority. Evolution of financial regulation adds new authority in response to market failures and trims back during booms. Shadow banking involves economically similar activities to formal banks but occurs in securities markets. Financial regulation has evolved over time in response to market failures, with regulators implementing policy using their powers. Powers include Licensing, Chartering, or Registration, which govern the activities that firms, individuals, or markets can undertake. Regulatory systems vary across markets and regulators, but common themes exist in the goals and approaches of regulators. The regulatory system requires firms, individuals, or markets to obtain proper credentials from state or federal regulators to engage in financial activities. Licenses, charters, or registrations dictate the permitted activities, with conditions such as regulatory oversight and adherence to standards. Failure to comply can result in penalties or revocation. Regulators issue rules to implement statutory mandates. Regulators enforce rules through oversight, supervision, and enforcement powers, which can lead to fines, penalties, or criminal charges for non-compliance. Enforcement includes active monitoring, investigations, and issuing supervisory letters to ensure market participants follow regulations. Financial regulators enforce rules through oversight, supervision, and enforcement powers, including issuing fines and penalties. They can compel firms to modify behavior through enforcement actions such as cease and desist orders, legal actions, and license revocation. Some regulators have the authority to resolve failing firms through conservatorship or receivership. The primary goal of financial regulation is to achieve market efficiency and policy outcomes. Financial regulation aims to achieve market efficiency and integrity by ensuring transparent activities, enforceable contracts, and fair rules. Regulators also focus on consumer and investor protection to prevent fraud, discrimination, manipulation, and theft. They address market failures like principal-agent problems and moral hazard to enhance market efficiency. Regulators aim to protect consumers and investors from fraud, discrimination, and exploitation. They ensure access to credit and capital for firms and consumers, promote economic growth, and prevent illicit activities in the financial system. Regulators ensure access to capital for all worthy borrowers regardless of personal characteristics, prevent illicit activities like money laundering and terrorism financing, and protect taxpayers from financial market failures resulting in government payouts. In times of financial crisis, government may provide funds to restore stability, as seen in the 2008 bailouts. Financial regulation aims to maintain stability by mitigating systemic risk and preventing market freezes and failures. The 2007-2009 financial crisis highlighted the importance of addressing instability beyond just banking concerns. The recent financial crisis of 2007-2009 showed the potential for systemic risk in the financial system beyond just banking concerns. Regulatory goals can sometimes conflict, balancing consumer protections with market efficiency and capital formation. Regulators aim to find a middle ground with minimal burden and maximum benefits, considering diverse types of regulations for market participants. Regulators aim to balance tradeoffs between goals by applying diverse types of regulations to market participants. Prudential regulation focuses on safety and soundness, with examples like capital requirements for banks. Disclosure and reporting requirements ensure accurate financial information is available to the public and regulators for informed decision-making and monitoring activities. Regulators ensure that all relevant financial information is accurate and available to the public and regulators for well-informed decision-making and monitoring activities. Standard setting involves prescribing standards for products, markets, and professional conduct to achieve policy goals such as market integrity, taxpayer protection, consumer protection, and suitability. Regulators also oversee competition to prevent firms from exercising undue monopoly power or engaging in collusion. Regulators oversee competition in financial markets to prevent monopoly power, collusion, and price fixing. They also set price and rate regulations to ensure consumer and investor protection, with examples like the Durbin Amendment and state usury laws. Policymakers justify these regulations for market efficiency and integrity. At the federal level, the Durbin Amendment caps debit interchange fees for large banks. State-level regulations include usury laws that cap interest rates and insurance rate regulation. Price and rate regulations are justified by policymakers for consumer and investor protections. Prudential regulation in banking contrasts with disclosure regulation in securities, highlighting different regulatory goals. Financial stability and taxpayer protection are central to banking regulation due to potential contagion and taxpayer exposure. Securities regulation focuses on disclosure rather than preventing failures or losses. Financial regulation focuses on proper disclosure to inform investors about risks. Regulators oversee different types of financial institutions based on their charters. The scope of regulation varies across markets and historical evolution. Regulatory goals differ between prudential regulation in banking and disclosure regulation in securities. Regulatory measures aim to ensure financial stability and protect taxpayers from potential contagion and losses. Regulators oversee different types of financial institutions based on their charters, which can regulate a single class of institution or a particular market. For example, depository institutions like banks choose their regulator based on their charter, while the Federal Housing Finance Authority regulates government-sponsored enterprises. In some markets, all activities are subject to regulation, with codes of conduct issued by the market itself. Regulators may require specific activities to be conducted only within a regulated market. Regulators may require specific activities to be conducted only within a regulated market, with codes of conduct issued by the market itself. In some cases, regulators have different authority in primary and secondary markets. Another approach is to regulate a particular type or set of transactions, regardless of where they occur or which entities are involved. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB to oversee financial products offered to consumers by various firms. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB to regulate financial products offered to consumers by various firms. Different regulatory approaches are necessary to address risks from firms, markets, or products, with overlapping jurisdiction between agencies. The federal financial regulatory structure includes regulators in banking, securities, insurance, consumer protection, and specific financial markets. Jurisdictional disputes often arise between agencies and Congress and the courts are tasked with resolving them. The financial regulatory structure includes regulators for banking, securities, insurance, consumer protection, and specific financial markets. Financial firms may be overseen by multiple regulators due to engaging in various activities. Holding companies with separate legal subsidiaries allow for a wider range of activities. The financial regulatory structure allows holding companies to have separate legal subsidiaries engaging in a variety of activities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 permits conglomerates to have different legal subsidiaries within the same financial holding company, each with a primary regulator. This setup allows for a broader array of financially related activities within the same organization. The financial regulatory structure permits holding companies to have separate legal subsidiaries engaging in various activities. A special type of bank holding company, known as a financial holding company, is regulated by the Fed at the holding company level. The national bank within the financial holding company is regulated by the OCC, its securities subsidiary by the SEC, and its loan company possibly by the CFPB. Regulation of depository institutions in the US involves multiple regulators with overlapping jurisdictions in a dual banking system. Each depository institution, whether state or federally chartered, is subject to regulation by at least one federal primary regulator. There are three broad types of charters for depository institutions: commercial banks, thrifts, and credit unions, each with its own primary regulator. National banks and thrifts are regulated by the OCC, state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System are regulated by the Federal Reserve, and state-chartered thrifts and banks not in the Federal Reserve System are regulated by the FDIC. Foreign banks operating in the US are regulated by the Fed or OCC, and federally chartered or insured credit unions are regulated by the National Credit Union Administration. The primary regulators for banks in the United States are the Fed, OCC, and NCUA for credit unions. Banks are subject to FDIC regulatory authority due to deposit insurance. Banks are crucial to the financial system and are regulated for safety and soundness at the federal level. Banks are subject to safety and soundness regulation at the federal level, which evaluates each loan, the balance sheet of each institution, and overall risks in the financial system. They must keep capital reserves and be liquid to meet unexpected funding outflows. Regulators consider compensating assets, risk-based capital requirements, asset quality, and internal controls when examining banks' balance sheets for excessive risks or unsafe practices. The federal banking agencies, including the OCC, have powerful tools to reduce risks in banks by requiring them to adjust lending practices, dispose of assets, and restore balance sheets. Banks must comply with regulators' directives to avoid consequences like losing deposit insurance or being seized. Additionally, banks are subject to CFPB regulation for consumer protection and SEC and CFTC regulation for securities and derivatives activities. The OCC, established in 1863, regulates federally chartered banks and has examination powers to ensure their safety. It can issue cease and desist orders and revoke bank charters. The FDIC, created in 1933, insures deposits up to $250,000, examines financial institutions, and manages receiverships. The FDIC, established in 1933, insures deposits up to $250,000, examines and supervises financial institutions, and manages receiverships. It is the primary federal regulator of state banks and state-chartered thrift institutions, with broad jurisdiction over nearly all banks and thrifts carrying FDIC insurance. The FDIC also manages the DIF fund, funded by risk-based assessments, to resolve failed institutions and enforce safety and soundness regulations. It has powers to resolve troubled banks under \"prompt corrective action\" and \"least cost resolution\" principles. The FDIC and the Federal Reserve System play key roles in monitoring and enforcing safety and soundness in the banking sector. The FDIC resolves troubled banks under \"prompt corrective action\" and \"least cost resolution\" principles, while the Federal Reserve regulates the largest financial firms in the US. Membership in the Federal Reserve System is mandatory for national banks and optional for state banks. The Federal Reserve System regulates financial firms in the US, including banks that are members. Membership is mandatory for national banks and optional for state banks. The Fed also serves as the umbrella regulator for financial holding companies under the GLBA and is the primary regulator for nonbank financial firms designated as systemically significant. Additionally, the Fed conducts monetary policy and acts as a lender of last resort through the discount window. The Federal Reserve System regulates financial firms in the US, including banks that are members and financial holding companies. It conducts monetary policy by targeting short-term interest rates and acts as a lender of last resort through the discount window. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is the safety and soundness regulator for federal credit unions and administers a Central Liquidity Facility and the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. Credit unions are member-owned financial cooperatives. The NCUA insures credit union deposits and resolves failed credit unions. Credit unions are member-owned financial cooperatives. The CFPB, created by the Dodd-Frank Act, enhances consumer protection by regulating depository and nondepository financial institutions. The bureau sets disclosure and suitability standards and bans abusive practices. The CFPB, established by the Dodd-Frank Act, oversees consumer financial protection for various institutions, including depository institutions with over $10 billion in assets. Regulatory authority varies based on institution size and type, with exemptions for certain entities and activities. The CFPB supervises consumer compliance for institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. The Dodd-Frank Act exempts certain entities from the bureau's authority, including merchants, retailers, and insurance companies. The FTC and state regulators also have consumer protection roles. Securities markets are divided into derivatives and other securities, regulated by the CFTC or SEC respectively. Self-regulatory organizations play a key role in securities regulation. The SEC was created in 1934 to enforce federal securities laws, overseeing participants in securities markets, issuers, asset managers, intermediaries, and experts. The New York Stock Exchange dates back to 1793, with banking regulators also overseeing securities activities of banks. Securities markets are divided into derivatives and other securities, regulated by the CFTC or SEC respectively. Standard-setting bodies and self-regulatory organizations play a role in securities regulation. The SEC oversees participants in securities markets, including issuers, asset managers, intermediaries, and experts. It is focused on protecting investors, maintaining fair markets, and facilitating capital formation. Firms selling securities must register with the SEC, but the SEC does not ensure the safety of firms or limit their risks. The SEC requires firms selling securities to register and disclose detailed information, but does not have direct regulatory control over publicly traded firms like bank regulators do. Registration with the SEC does not guarantee safety or limit risks taken by securities firms. The SEC requires registration and disclosure of information for securities firms, but lacks direct regulatory control like bank regulators. Registration with the SEC does not ensure safety or limit risks. Various securities market participants must also register with the SEC or industry SROs, such as stock exchanges, brokerages, mutual funds, auditors, and investment advisers. Compliance with rules is necessary to protect investors, prevent fraud, and maintain fair markets. Investor protection levels vary based on sophistication, with only accredited investors able to invest in riskier funds. De minimis exemptions initially allowed for the growth of the hedge fund industry. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, private advisers like hedge funds and private equity funds with over $150 million in assets must register with the SEC. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) guarantees customer accounts up to $500,000 for losses from brokerage failure or fraud. SIPC does not protect against market losses or regulate broker-dealers. Some securities markets, like foreign exchange, are exempt from certain securities regulations. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) protects customer accounts up to $500,000 for losses from brokerage failure or fraud, but does not cover market losses or regulate broker-dealers. Certain securities markets, such as foreign exchange and Treasury securities, are exempt from some securities regulations. The Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993 required brokers and dealers to register as government securities dealers, extended antifraud provisions to government securities brokers, and gave the U.S. Treasury authority to regulate transactions. The government securities market is less regulated than the corporate securities markets, with regulatory jurisdiction fragmented across multiple regulators. Municipal securities were initially exempt from SEC regulation. The SEC has no jurisdiction over the primary market for municipal securities, but the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board was created in 1975 for regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act required municipal advisors to register with the SEC, while issuers of municipal securities remain exempt from SEC oversight due to federalism issues. Private securities are not subject to registration and disclosure requirements like public securities, but are subject to antifraud provisions. Private placements are limited to accredited investors and have restrictions on resale. The private placement market is limited to accredited investors with restrictions on resale. Venture capitalists and private equity firms play important roles in corporate finance. The CFTC was created in 1974 to regulate commodities futures and options markets. The CFTC was given exclusive jurisdiction over contracts based on financial variables like interest rates and stock indexes, to be traded on regulated exchanges. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 exempted swaps from CFTC regulation, but this was repealed by the Dodd-Frank Act after the financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the CFTC's jurisdiction by requiring registration of swap dealers, clearing organizations, and data repositories, with reporting and business conduct standards. Entities like swap execution facilities and swap data repositories must register with the CFTC, following reporting requirements and business conduct standards. The CFTC's mission is to prevent speculation, manipulation, and fraud in commodity markets. It oversees futures exchanges, the National Futures Association, and various industry firms and personnel. SROs, including national securities exchanges, may register with the SEC or CFTC for oversight. The Dodd-Frank Act regulates swap dealers and major swap participants, with national securities exchanges and clearing systems able to register as SROs with the SEC or CFTC for oversight. SROs must establish rules for member discipline, market integrity, and investor protection. Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act grants additional regulatory authority to the SEC and CFTC over designated clearing and settlement systems. Standard-setting bodies play a crucial role in setting professional standards for securities and futures market participants, with FINRA being one of the key bodies responsible for rule-making and enforcement for brokers and dealers. The SEC and CFTC delegate responsibility for professional standards to standard-setting bodies like FINRA, MSRB, NFA, FASB, and PCAOB. These bodies establish rules, conduct exams, and provide guidance for compliance and enforcement in the securities and futures markets. The Standards Board and PCAOB oversee financial accounting standards for companies. GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are regulated by FHFA created in 2008 during the housing crisis. The FHFA was created in 2008 during the housing crisis to regulate GSEs like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. It succeeded OFHEO and FHFB, transferring authority to set affordable housing goals to the FHFA. Concerns about systemic risk led to the creation of the FHFA, giving it enhanced safety and soundness powers. The FHFA was established in 2008 during the housing crisis to oversee GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It was granted enhanced safety and soundness powers to set capital standards, replace management, and prevent financial instability. Fannie and Freddie were placed in conservatorship by the FHFA to avoid failure, with the Treasury providing capital to ensure solvency. The government received warrants for a 79.9% equity ownership in the firms in exchange for the financial support. The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) was created in 1933 during a farming crisis to oversee the Farm Credit System, which includes cooperatively owned Farm Credit Banks, Agricultural Credit Banks, the Funding Corporation, and Farmer Mac. Unlike housing GSEs, the Farm Credit System operates in both primary and secondary agricultural credit markets. The FCA regulates these institutions for safety and soundness through capital requirements and coordinates with other regulators through interagency task forces. The need for coordination among regulators has led to the formation of interagency task forces to study market episodes. Regulatory failure played a part in the financial crisis, with gaps in oversight and insufficient risk constraints identified as key problems by then-Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner in 2009. The financial crisis was caused by regulatory failures, gaps in oversight, and insufficient risk constraints. Systemic risk occurs when individual firms manage risk but collectively create instability. The Federal Reserve lacked authority to prevent crises, leading to the creation of the FSOC to detect systemic stress before a crisis occurs. The Dodd-Frank Act created the FSOC to detect systemic stress before a crisis occurs. FSOC is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and includes heads of various regulatory agencies as voting members. Its duties include identifying risks to financial stability and promoting market discipline. The FSOC is responsible for identifying risks to financial stability, promoting market discipline, collecting information on financial firms, monitoring the financial system for systemic risks, proposing regulatory changes to Congress, facilitating information sharing among regulators, making regulatory recommendations, identifying gaps in regulation, reviewing accounting standards, resolving disputes among council members, and providing annual reports and testimony to Congress. The Dodd-Frank Act did not give the FSOC the authority to impose resolutions on disagreeing members. The FSOC plays a key role in financial regulation by designating systemically important firms and utilities, recommending regulatory changes, and providing advice on new powers under the Dodd-Frank Act. While it cannot impose resolutions on disagreeing members, it can make regulatory recommendations to member agencies or Congress. Regulatory gaps are identified, and disputes among council members are resolved. Annual reports and testimony to Congress are required. The FFIEC, created in 1979, coordinates federal regulation of lending institutions and issues reporting forms for covered institutions. It includes the Fed, OCC, FDIC, CFPB, NCUA, and State Liaison Committee, who enforce safety and soundness regulations. Examiners evaluate risks and use handbooks to monitor lenders for safety and soundness concerns. The FFIEC agencies use handbooks to monitor lenders for safety and soundness concerns, including indicators like capital adequacy, asset quality, liquidity, and market risk. Insurance companies have been regulated by states for 150 years, with no federal regulators like the SEC or OCC. Federal regulation of insurance was limited due to Supreme Court decisions and the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which preserved states' authority to regulate and tax insurance. In 1945, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, preserving states' authority to regulate and tax insurance. Each state has a department regulating insurance companies and products. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners sets national standards through model laws, but states must enact them for legal effect. States also have guaranty funds to protect policyholders in case of insolvency. Federal regulation of insurance is limited compared to banking and securities. The federal government's role in regulating insurance is relatively limited compared to banking and securities. However, its role has increased over time, with various court cases narrowing the definition of the business of insurance and Congress expanding federal oversight through laws like GLBA and the Dodd-Frank Act. The Federal Reserve has regulatory authority over bank holding companies with insurance operations and insurers designated as systemically important. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the FIO to monitor the insurance industry and represent the US in international insurance matters. Various federal laws have exempted aspects of state insurance regulation, such as state insurer licensing laws in the Liability Risk Retention Act and state insurance producer licensing laws in the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act. State insurance regulation includes state insurer licensing laws and state insurance producer licensing laws. State regulators also oversee banking and securities markets. While federal oversight has expanded, state-chartered banks and thrifts still have state regulators as their primary regulators. Federal regulators also play a role in regulating state-chartered banks. In the securities markets, federal securities acts allow for concurrent state regulation under blue sky laws to protect investors against fraud. State securities acts focus on disclosure, qualification, and antifraud provisions. State banks not in the Federal Reserve System are supervised by the FDIC, while nonmember Fed banks must meet reserve requirements. Blue sky laws protect investors against fraud, with state securities acts focusing on disclosure, qualification, and antifraud provisions. States oversee investment advisers exempt from SEC registration based on size, while broker-dealers are subject to both state and federal regulation. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 reduced overlap between state and federal regulation. States also enforce regulations, especially in financial industry hubs like New York. Federal regulation determines the scope of state regulation through preemption and \"wild card\" laws. Financial regulation is influenced by federal preemption laws and state \"wild card\" laws, which determine the extent of state regulation. SEC registration exempts firms, products, and professionals from state registration. Regulators must consider the global nature of financial markets, including foreign firms operating in the U.S. and vice versa. Consensus and consistency across jurisdictions are maintained through international cooperation between U.S. regulators, the Treasury Department, and foreign regulators. The U.S. plays a significant role in setting international financial regulatory standards through participation in international fora with foreign regulators. These standards, though not legally binding, are generally implemented by U.S. regulators through rulemaking or legislation. Various international standard-setting bodies oversee different areas of financial regulation, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). The G-20, which includes the U.S. and other major economies, also plays a role in setting international financial standards. The U.S. participates in international financial regulatory standards through various bodies like the Basel Committee, IOSCO, and IAIS. The G-20 leads international coordination of regulatory reform, creating the FSB to implement agreements. The Dodd-Frank Act established new federal entities for financial regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act created new federal entities for financial regulation, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, Office of Financial Research, Federal Insurance Office, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Act also transferred authority to the CFPB from other regulators and eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision. Additionally, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 established the Federal Housing Finance Agency and eliminated the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight and Federal Housing Finance Board. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 created the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and eliminated the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) and Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB), granting FHFA new authority and transferring limited authority from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)."
