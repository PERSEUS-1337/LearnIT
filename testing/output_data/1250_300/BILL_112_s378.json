Congress finds that there is a decline in experienced teachers in classrooms, with the average years of teaching experience decreasing significantly. Research shows that more years of teaching positively impact student achievement. Rural school districts face financial challenges, leading to lower salaries for teachers. The transportation costs faced by rural school districts result in less money for instructional costs and salaries. Data from the Department of Education shows that rural schools have the lowest base salaries for teachers, leading to challenges in all states. A 2009 study by the Education Trust found that high poverty schools are more likely to have uncertified teachers and higher rates of first-year teachers, with rural schools having rates above the national average. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards was established in 1987 to address teacher quality issues highlighted in the 1983 report \"A Nation at Risk\". The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, founded in 1987 as a response to the 1983 report \"A Nation at Risk\", aims to set high standards for accomplished teachers. Over 91,000 teachers nationwide have completed certification through the rigorous assessment process. Research has shown that students taught by National Board certified teachers achieve higher gains on tests compared to those taught by uncertified teachers. Additionally, a recent study by the Economic Policy Institute revealed that public school teachers earn less than other college graduates. The Economic Policy Institute study found that public school teachers earn 77 percent less than other college graduates, with the gap increasing. The Act aims to incentivize teachers to work in rural or high-poverty schools and provide tax credits for National Board certification to attract and retain qualified teachers. The Act introduces a tax credit for individuals teaching in high poverty or rural schools and certified teachers. A tax credit is introduced for eligible teachers in high poverty or rural schools, allowing a credit against the tax imposed for the taxable year. The applicable amount is $1,000 for teachers in these schools where at least 75% of students receive free or reduced-cost lunches. The tax credit for eligible teachers in high poverty or rural schools is $1,000 if at least 75% of students receive free or reduced-cost lunches. For certified teachers in these schools, the amount increases to $2,000. Eligible teachers are defined as kindergarten through grade 12 classroom teachers or instructors. The tax credit for eligible teachers in high poverty or rural schools is $2,000. An eligible teacher is defined as a kindergarten through grade 12 classroom teacher in a public school on a full-time basis. Additional definitions include terms like elementary and secondary schools as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Eligible academic year refers to any academic year ending in a taxable year after December 31, 2011. Conforming amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a new item, section 36D, after section 36C. Section 36D introduces a tax credit for teachers in high poverty or rural schools. Effective for academic years after December 31, 2011."
