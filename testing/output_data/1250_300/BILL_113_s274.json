They should also periodically monitor schools' efforts in enhancing nutrition education among students. The local educational agency must consult various stakeholders to develop and implement programs promoting healthy eating and nutrition education, including families, students, school officials, and community organizations with nutrition expertise. The local educational agency consults stakeholders to develop and implement programs promoting healthy eating and nutrition education, including working with government authorities and school wellness councils.
