    "content": "This report analyzes annual appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for FY2020, comparing enacted FY2019 appropriations, the Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request, and the enacted appropriations measures. It provides additional informational resources on DHS appropriations and lists CRS policy experts for consultation. The suite of CRS reports on homeland security appropriations tracks legislative action and issues related to DHS appropriations, focusing on discretionary funding amounts. The reports do not cover mandatory funding issues or other legislation related to DHS programs. The Appendix explains specialized budgetary concepts. The curr_chunk discusses appropriations legislation related to DHS programs, explaining specialized budgetary concepts. It references CRS Report R42388 for a more detailed discussion on the appropriations process. Amounts in CRS reports on homeland security appropriations represent budget authority, with calculations using unrounded data for precision. The curr_chunk provides detailed information on appropriations for FY2019 and FY2020 related to the Department of Homeland Security. Data is sourced from specific legislative acts, including the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, and two supplemental appropriations acts. The House Appropriations Committee and Senate Appropriations data are also referenced for FY2020. The curr_chunk provides data on appropriations for FY2020 related to the Department of Homeland Security, sourced from specific legislative acts. The scoring methodology is consistent and relies on data provided by the Appropriations Committees developed with Congressional Budget Office methodology. Previous CRS reports on DHS appropriations used OMB data for consistency. The Trump Administration released a detailed budget request for FY2020 for the Department of Homeland Security, requesting $51.68 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. This was part of an overall budget estimated to be $92.08 billion, including fees, trust funds, and other funding not annually appropriated. The budget proposal was delayed due to a lapse in FY2019 annual appropriations. The Trump Administration requested $51.68 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority for DHS for FY2020, part of a $92.08 billion overall budget. This included a $2.27 billion increase from FY2019 appropriations. Additional funding was requested for FEMA and the Coast Guard. The House Appropriations Committee marked up H.R. 3931, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2020, which included $52.80 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority. This was $1.12 billion above the Administration's request and $3.39 billion above the enacted level for FY2019. The bill also included $14.08 billion in disaster relief-designated funding and OCO funding for the Coast Guard. Amendments adopted in full committee markup resulted in a CBO scoring exceeding the subcommittee allocation by more than $3 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee marked up S. 2582, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2020, with $53.18 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, exceeding the Administration's request by $1.50 billion. The bill included $5 billion for border barrier construction, an increase from the previous year. Both the House and Senate committees allocated more funding for the Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, and FEMA than requested by the Administration. The Senate committee also included $17.35 billion for disaster relief, surpassing the Administration's request by $3.28 billion. The Senate committee bill included $17.35 billion for disaster relief, surpassing the Administration's request by $3.28 billion. Congress passed a continuing resolution (CR) to extend funding at the FY2019 rate for operations through November 21, subsequently extended through December 20. The CR included provisions addressing needs of DHS under a CR, such as special apportionment of funds for Secret Service expenses related to the FY2020 presidential campaign. The Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is extended to ensure funded programs can continue, the National Flood Insurance Program authorization is extended, and funds are allocated for DHS management restructuring. The FY2020 DHS annual appropriations measure includes $50.47 billion in adjusted net discretionary budget authority, with $17.35 billion allocated for FEMA disaster relief funding. The FY2020 DHS annual appropriations measure included $1.22 billion below the Administration's request and $1.06 billion above the FY2019 enacted level. It allocated $17.35 billion for FEMA disaster relief funding and $190 million for Overseas Contingency Operations designated funding to the Coast Guard. The bill was passed by the House and Senate and signed into law on December 20, 2019. The DHS budget includes disaster relief spending and funding for OCO. The budget is funded through fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending. DHS appropriations have historically been organized into five titles, with the fifth providing general direction to the department. In 2014, DHS began working on a new Common Appropriations Structure to standardize appropriations format across components. The DHS budget includes disaster relief spending and funding for OCO, funded through fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending. DHS appropriations were restructured into a four-category Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) in FY2017 to improve transparency and streamline spending decisions. Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, Research and Development, and Federal Assistance are the new categories under CAS. The DHS budget includes various appropriations for component missions, including Operations and Support, Procurement, Construction, and Improvements, Research and Development, and Federal Assistance. Some appropriations, like the Federal Protective Service and USCG's Retired Pay, have unique funding structures within DHS. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) account funds can be used for its mission without impacting total discretionary spending. The US Coast Guard's Retired Pay appropriation covers retired personnel entitlements and medical care, classified as mandatory spending. The FEMA Disaster Relief Fund receives a separate appropriation for disaster assistance under the Stafford Act, ensuring transparency in spending. The Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act allows for consistent tracking of FEMA's disaster assistance spending and transparency into fund availability. The National Flood Insurance Program's costs are covered by a mix of mandatory and discretionary appropriations, including operating expenses, commissions, interest on borrowings, and flood mitigation actions. Appropriations language directs how resources can be spent, ensuring effective use of budget authority. The FY2017 act grouped provisions within appropriations and general provisions as \"administrative provisions\" at the ends of titles where components are funded. This report tracks changes in these provisions compared to the prior year's measure, noting additions, modifications, and dropped provisions for various reasons such as relevance, time passage, or chamber priorities. The report discusses appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security, grouping its components into Law Enforcement Operational Components, Incident Response and Recovery Operational Components, Support Components, and Headquarters Components.

The Office of the Secretary and Executive Management (OSEM) provides central leadership and oversight for all DHS components. The Departmental Management Directorate (DM) offers mission support services. Analysis and Operations (A&O) includes the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) for intelligence sharing and the Office of Operations Coordination (OPS) for operations coordination. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits and investigations to ensure DHS efficiency and prevent fraud. Budgetary resources for these components are detailed in Table 8. The budgetary resources for DHS components controlled through appropriations legislation are detailed in a breakdown. Separate lines show resources provided solely within Title I and outside the title, with a total annual appropriation for the components.

Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and determines the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than enacted by Congress. Budget authority may be indefinite, available on a one-year, multiyear, or no-year basis. Unobligated funds at the end of a fiscal year are no longer available. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It can be available on a one-year, multiyear, or no-year basis, with obligations incurred when agencies enter into contracts or receive services. Outlays represent the actual funds spent during the fiscal year, which may not always match the budget authority enacted. Additionally, budget authority can be obligated in one fiscal year but spent in a future fiscal year. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary funds appropriated yearly by Congress and mandatory funds provided in laws other than appropriations acts. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, is typically not appropriated each year. Within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offsetting collections are funds collected by the federal government through business-type transactions, such as fees, which are not considered federal revenue but as negative outlays. DHS net discretionary budget authority is the total funds appropriated by Congress each year, composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. Some collections offset agency discretionary budget authority, while others offset mandatory spending, typically entitlement programs. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Some entitlements are funded by permanent appropriations, while others are funded annually. The budget also contains offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress but are included in the gross budget authority calculation. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget, which are then allocated among congressional committees through 302(a) allocations. These allocations form the basis for enforcing budget discipline, with any bill exceeding the ceiling subject to a point of order. The 302(b) allocations are key figures in the appropriations process, ensuring that total spending does not exceed the discretionary allocation. Adjustments can be made by the appropriations committee as bills progress. In FY2020, the DHS appropriations bill faced amendments that exceeded its 302(b) allocation, but these provisions were not included in the final appropriations act. The Budget Control Act established enforceable discretionary limits for defense and nondefense spending. Adjustments can be made for emergency spending, overseas contingency operations, and disaster relief. DHS's appropriations process has been influenced by these adjustments. The Budget Control Act allows for adjustments to discretionary budget authority for emergency spending, overseas contingency operations, and disaster relief. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the formula for disaster relief adjustments, increasing the allowable size and extending the availability of unused adjustment capacity indefinitely. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the formula for disaster relief adjustments, increasing the allowable size and extending the availability of unused adjustment capacity indefinitely. In August 2019, OMB released a sequestration preview report for FY2020 estimating the allowable adjustment for disaster relief at $17.5 billion, the second-largest in history. This estimate includes the 10-year average, emergency-designated Stafford Act spending since 2012, and carryover from the previous year. The final FY2020 adjustment may still vary from this estimate."
