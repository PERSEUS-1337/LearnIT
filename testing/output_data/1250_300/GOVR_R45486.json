    "content": "Child nutrition programs, including the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program, provide food to children in institutional settings. Other programs like the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program and Special Milk Program operate in schools. The Child and Adult Care Food Program offers meals in child care settings, and the Summer Food Service Program provides food during summer months. These programs were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 reauthorized child nutrition programs, but some authorities expired in 2015. Efforts for child nutrition reauthorization in the 114th Congress did not pass, and there were no significant efforts in the 115th Congress. Some provisions related to child nutrition programs were included in the 2018 farm bill. The 2018 farm bill included provisions related to child nutrition programs, raising issues for future reauthorization efforts. These issues involve the nutritional quality of foods served in schools, access to meals, and stakeholders such as school food authorities and advocacy organizations. This report provides an overview of current issues in child nutrition programs, including concerns raised by Congress and stakeholders. It references CRS reports for more detailed information and analysis on specific issues. The 114th Congress is considering child nutrition reauthorization proposals, with updated nutrition standards required for school meals and competitive foods under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Increased federal subsidies and funding for technical assistance are provided for schools meeting the new requirements. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) increased federal subsidies for schools meeting new nutrition standards. The regulations were championed by various organizations and stakeholders, with final rules published by USDA-FNS in 2012 and 2016. The standards were based on Dietary Guidelines and Institute of Medicine recommendations, focusing on increasing fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while limiting calories, sodium, and proteins in school meals. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act implemented new nutrition standards for school meals, including limits on calories, sodium, whole grains, and proteins. The regulations also applied to competitive foods sold during the school day, with some exceptions for fundraisers. Implementation challenges included difficulty obtaining compliant products, student acceptance issues, reduced participation, increased costs, and food waste. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act implemented new nutrition standards for school meals, including limits on calories, sodium, whole grains, and proteins. Some schools faced challenges with implementation, such as difficulty obtaining compliant products, student acceptance issues, reduced participation, increased costs, and food waste. The School Nutrition Association (SNA) and studies by the U.S. Government Accountability Office and USDA confirmed these issues in the first two years of implementation. Changes were made to the standards in subsequent years, with USDA removing weekly limits on grains and protein in January 2014, and Congress enacting provisions to loosen milk, whole grain, and sodium requirements from SY2015-2016 through SY2017-2018. In FY2017, Congress enacted provisions loosening milk, whole grain, and sodium requirements for school meals. USDA implemented similar changes for SY2018-2019. In December 2018, USDA published a final rule indefinitely changing these standards for SY2019-2020. The rule allows flavored, low-fat milk, requires 50% whole grain-rich foods, and maintains sodium limits. Target 2 limits start in SY2024-2025. Table 2 shows the timeline of modifications to these requirements. The 2018 final rule modified milk, whole grain, and sodium requirements for school meals. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress aimed to revise nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods, but these were not included in the enacted bill. Child nutrition reauthorization proposals in the 114th Congress aimed to alter nutrition standards for school meals. The House committee's proposal would have required USDA to review school meal standards every three years and revise them as needed. The Senate committee's proposal would have required revisions to whole grain and sodium requirements within 90 days of enactment. These proposals did not make it into the enacted bill. Negotiations between Senate committee, White House, USDA, and School Nutrition Association resulted in agreement to reduce whole grain-rich requirement to 80% and delay Target 2 sodium requirement. Fresh fruit and vegetable snacks in FFVP must be in natural state without additives. Advocacy for inclusion of frozen, dried, canned fruits and vegetables in program. 2014 farm bill funded pilot project in limited states with difficulty obtaining fresh produce. In a pilot project funded by the 2014 farm bill, schools in four states faced challenges in obtaining fresh fruits and vegetables for the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP). The pilot allowed schools to incorporate dried and canned fruits, leading to decreased vegetable offerings and increased fruit offerings. However, there was no significant impact on students' vegetable consumption, and fruit consumption declined on FFVP snack days. Student satisfaction with FFVP slightly decreased, while parents' responses were mixed. Legislative proposals have been considered to allow dried and pur\u00e9ed forms of fruits and vegetables in FFVP on a more permanent basis. In the 115th Congress, legislative proposals were considered to change FFVP offerings, including allowing CDF and pur\u00e9ed forms of fruits and vegetables. The House version of H.R. 2 proposed removing \"fresh\" from the program name, but this provision was not included in the enacted bill. In the 114th Congress, H.R. 5003 included a similar proposal to allow schools to serve \"all forms\" of fruits and vegetables. The Senate committee's proposal, S. 3136, would have provided temporary hardship exemptions for schools with limited access to fresh produce in FFVP. Schools participating in NSLP and SBP must comply with federal requirements related to sourcing foods domestically. Schools participating in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and/or School Breakfast Program (SBP) must comply with federal Buy American requirements, which mandate purchasing domestic commodities or products to the maximum extent practicable. The definition of \"domestic commodities or products\" includes items produced and processed substantially in the United States, with over 51% domestically grown ingredients. USDA guidance outlines how SFAs and state agencies should implement these requirements. USDA guidance instructs SFAs to integrate Buy American requirements into procurement processes, monitoring the USDA catalog for suitable products and including Buy American language in solicitations. Exceptions can be made when U.S. products are not available in sufficient quantities or are significantly more expensive. SFAs must document any exceptions made and may request waivers. The 2018 farm bill requires USDA to enforce Buy American requirements, ensuring full compliance and understanding of responsibilities by SFAs and states. It clarifies that domestic products are those processed in the U.S. and contain agricultural commodities produced in the country. Compliance must be reported to Congress within 180 days of enactment. The provision in the enacted bill clarifies that domestic products are those processed in the U.S. and contain agricultural commodities produced in the country. Proponents argue for stricter requirements citing economic and food safety reasons, while others advocate for maintaining schools' discretion in food procurement. Summer meals are provided through the Summer Food Service Program and the National School Lunch Program's Summer Seamless Option. In summer, meals are typically provided in group settings through the Summer Food Service Program and the National School Lunch Program's Summer Seamless Option. Policymakers have explored alternatives to congregate meals, especially in rural areas where access to summer meals is challenging. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act allocated funds for demonstration projects like the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC) to improve food access for children in urban and rural areas during the summer months. The Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC) project provides electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals during the summer months. Participants receive $30 or $60 per month on an EBT card for SNAP-eligible foods. An evaluation from FY2011 to FY2013 showed a decrease in very low food security among participants. The Summer EBT project, conducted from FY2011 to FY2013, found a significant decrease in very low food security among participants. Improvements were seen in children's consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Funding for Summer EBT projects has been provided by Congress, with $28 million allocated in the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Awardees for summer 2017 and 2018 included various states and tribal nations. USDA announced a new strategy for grant recipients in FY2019, prioritizing new states, statewide projects, and projects that can operate efficiently. In October 2018, USDA-FNS announced a new strategy for determining grant recipients in FY2019 for Summer EBT, prioritizing new states, statewide projects, and projects operating in summers 2019-2021. There were proposals in Congress to expand Summer EBT, including funding recommendations from the Obama Administration and freestanding bills in the 114th and 115th Congresses. Funding from the 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act was used for demonstration projects like the Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) in eight states from 2010-2012. The Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) was a demonstration project funded by the 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act in eight states from 2010-2012. It included initiatives to increase summer meal participation rates, such as incentives for sites to operate longer, adding recreational or educational activities, meal delivery for children in rural areas, and providing food backpacks for weekends and holidays. Evaluations showed positive results, but caution is advised due to small sample size and lack of comparison groups. Another demonstration project provided exemptions from congregate feeding requirements for outdoor meal sites. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act funded the eSFSP demonstration project in eight states from 2010-2012 to increase summer meal participation rates. Evaluations showed positive results, but caution is advised due to small sample size, lack of comparison groups, and potential confounding factors. Another project provided exemptions from congregate feeding requirements for outdoor meal sites experiencing excessive heat since 2015. Other proposals in recent years aimed to enable rural meal sites to provide SFSP meals for offsite consumption. The HHFKA created the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) to provide free meals to students in schools with high proportions of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Participation in CEP has increased since its inception in SY2014-2015, with over 20,700 schools participating as of SY2016-2017. CEP has been supported for improving meal access and reducing stigma. According to data from the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), approximately 22% of NSLP schools participate in the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP). CEP has received support for improving meal access, reducing stigma, and lowering administrative costs in schools. However, there have been efforts to restrict schools' eligibility for CEP, citing the need to target resources more effectively. Additionally, CEP has caused data issues for other federal and state programs that rely on free and reduced-price lunch data for eligibility and funding allocations. The Title I-A program uses free and reduced-price lunch data to determine funding allocations for schools. Students may qualify for free, reduced-price, or full-price meals. Schools have different responses to unpaid meal costs, including \"lunch shaming\" practices like providing alternative meals or restricting participation in school events until debts are repaid. Lunch shaming practices involve taking away hot meals from students and providing cold alternatives or implementing measures like barring participation in school events until meal debts are repaid. School districts face financial burdens due to unpaid meal costs, which are a significant revenue source for school food programs. Federal regulations require schools to cover unpaid meal funds as \"bad debt\" if not recovered. Congress and USDA have taken actions since 2010 to address the issue of unpaid meal costs. Starting in 2010, Congress and USDA have addressed the issue of unpaid meal costs by requiring USDA to examine states' and school districts' policies on unpaid meal charges. The subsequent Report to Congress in June 2016 did not recommend national standards but suggested updating policy guidance and distributing best practices. USDA-FNS then mandated SFAs to establish a written meal charge policy by July 1, 2017. USDA-FNS required SFAs to implement a written meal charge policy by July 1, 2017, providing guidance through webinars and a best practice guide. Findings from a study and Request for Information showed meal charge policies were mainly determined at the school level, with varying levels of formality and enforcement. School officials preferred local control over national standards. In the 115th Congress, discussions on meal charge policies ranged in formality and enforcement. School officials preferred local control, while national advocacy groups favored national standards. Legislative proposals included the Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017. Unpaid meal costs and lunch shaming were also active topics at the state level, with several states enacting legislation to address these issues. In recent years, states have enacted legislation to address unpaid meal costs and lunch shaming in schools. For example, Illinois passed a law in 2018 requiring schools to serve regular meals to students who cannot pay and allowing districts to request state assistance for debts over $500. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) established requirements for schools to review and potentially increase the prices of paid lunches to ensure children receiving free and reduced-price lunches receive the full value of federal funds. The Senate committee report on the HHFKA highlighted the need to ensure that children receiving free and reduced-price lunches get the full value of federal funds. Prior to the paid lunch equity requirements, federal subsidies for free and reduced-price lunches were cross-subsidizing other aspects of the meals programs. The paid lunch equity formula requires the price per paid lunch to eventually match or exceed the difference between federal reimbursements for free and paid lunches. If schools do not meet this requirement, they must gradually increase the price of a paid lunch until they close the gap. The HHFKA required schools to gradually increase the price of paid lunches if they were not charging at least $3.00 per paid lunch to match federal reimbursements. Revenue from nonprogram foods had to accrue to the school food authority and equal or exceed the costs of obtaining those foods. USDA provided exemptions for schools in strong financial standing from SY2013-2014 to SY2017-2018. The USDA implemented requirements for school meal programs starting in SY2011-2012, with exemptions for schools in strong financial standing from SY2013-2014 to SY2017-2018. The FY2018 appropriation expanded exemptions, potentially requiring SFAs with a negative balance to raise prices for paid meals. Legislative proposals in Congress considered eliminating or replacing the paid lunch equity requirements.
