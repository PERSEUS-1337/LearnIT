    "content": "Most deep learning for NLP uses single-mode word embeddings, but this new approach introduces multi-mode codebook embeddings for phrases and sentences. These codebook embeddings capture different semantic facets and outperform strong baselines on various NLP tasks. The curr_chunk discusses the use of various NLP models like word2vec, GloVe, skip-thoughts, ELMo, and BERT for unsupervised tasks. It highlights the limitations of single embeddings for words and phrases, leading to the development of word sense induction methods and multi-mode word embeddings. The curr_chunk discusses multi-mode word embeddings, which represent target words as multiple points in a semantic space by clustering neighboring words. This approach differs from topic modeling like LDA as it requires solving distinct clustering problems for each target word. Extending these representations to phrases or sentences faces efficiency challenges due to the large number of unique sequences in a corpus. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of clustering unique sequences like phrases or sentences efficiently due to the large number of parameters required. It introduces a compositional model that predicts cluster centers' embeddings from the sequence of words in the target phrase to overcome sparseness in co-occurring statistics. The curr_chunk introduces a neural encoder and decoder approach to predict cluster centers for target sequences efficiently, overcoming the challenge of sparseness in co-occurring statistics. This method learns a mapping between the target sequence and cluster centers during training, allowing for direct prediction of cluster centers using a single forward pass of the neural network during testing. The proposed model uses a nonnegative and sparse coefficient matrix to match predicted cluster centers with observed word embeddings during training. Gradients are back-propagated to update cluster centers, decoder and encoder weights, allowing for joint end-to-end training. The model outperforms baseline methods in capturing compositional word meanings and can measure asymmetric relations like hypernymy without supervision. Multimode representation is shown to be superior to single-mode alternatives, especially in sentence representation tasks. The proposed model utilizes nonnegative and sparse coefficient matrix to match predicted cluster centers with observed word embeddings during training. It outperforms baseline methods in capturing compositional word meanings and can measure asymmetric relations like hypernymy without supervision. Multimode representation is superior to single-mode alternatives, particularly in sentence representation tasks. The training setup, objective function, and architecture of the prediction mode are detailed in Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, respectively. The model represents each sentence as multiple codebook embeddings predicted by a sequence to embeddings model, encouraging the generation of codebook embeddings that can reconstruct co-occurring words while avoiding predicting common topics. The model aims to reconstruct neighboring words of a target sequence by clustering words that could potentially occur beside it, rather than the actual co-occurring words. Different training signals are used for sentences and phrases, requiring separate models for each representation. The goal is to capture the hidden co-occurring distribution instead of specific words in the training corpus. Our goal is to cluster words that could potentially occur beside a target sequence, focusing on semantics rather than syntax. The model considers word order in the input sequence but ignores the order of co-occurring words. The distribution of co-occurring words is modeled in a pre-trained word embedding space, with embeddings arranged into a matrix. The normalization of embeddings facilitates distance calculations between words. Predicted cluster centers of the input are also considered. The dimension of pre-trained word embedding is normalized for distance calculations. Predicted cluster centers of the input sequence are represented in a matrix. The number of clusters is fixed to simplify the prediction model design. The reconstruction loss in k-means clustering is discussed, along with the use of Non-negative sparse coding for neural architectures. In this work, Non-negative sparse coding (NNSC) is used to generate diverse cluster centers for neural architectures, unlike kmeans loss which collapses to fewer modes. The NNSC loss is smoother and easier to optimize, with a hyper-parameter \u03bb controlling sparsity. Coefficients are constrained to be \u2264 1 to avoid instability. Multiple outputs and permutation estimation between prediction and ground truth words are common challenges. The proposed method efficiently minimizes L2 distance in a pre-trained embedding space, using convex optimization to estimate M Ot. The loss function prevents the neural network from predicting the same global topics, and the method is a generalization of Word2Vec that encodes compositional meaning of words. Our method is a generalization of Word2Vec that encodes compositional meaning of words and can decode multiple embeddings. The neural network architecture is similar to a transformation-based seq2seq model. The encoder maps sentences with similar co-occurring word distribution closer together. The decoder outputs a sequence of embeddings instead of words, allowing for predicting all codebook embeddings in a single pass. The method treats the embedding of <eos> as the sentence representation and ensures different codebook embeddings capture different aspects.

It treats the embedding of <eos> as the sentence representation and ensures different codebook embeddings capture different aspects. The attention on contextualized word embeddings from the encoder significantly affects sentence representation but not phrase representation. The framework is flexible, allowing for different architectures and input features. The framework is flexible, allowing for different architectures and input features. The model uses pre-trained GloVe embeddings for sentence and phrase representation. It is trained on Wikipedia 2016 with stop words removed. In experiments, codebook embeddings improve unsupervised semantic tasks. Noun phrases are considered in phrase experiments. Our model utilizes pre-trained GloVe embeddings for sentence and phrase representation, trained on Wikipedia 2016 with stop words removed. Noun phrases are considered in experiments, with boundaries extracted using regular expression rules. The models do not require additional resources like PPDB or multi-lingual resources, making them practical for domains with limited resources. The transformers have a dimension size of 300, trained on a single GPU within a week. The models tend to underfit the data due to their small size, making comparisons with BERT challenging. Our models, trained on a single GPU within a week, tend to underfit the data due to their small size, making comparisons with BERT challenging. BERT, with more parameters and computational resources, uses a word piece model to alleviate the out-of-vocabulary problem. Semeval 2013 task 5(a) English and Turney 2012 are standard benchmarks for evaluating phrase similarity, while BiRD and WikiSRS provide ground truth phrase similarities. The Semeval 2013 task aims to distinguish similar phrase pairs from dissimilar ones. Turney (2012) and BiRD/WikiSRS provide benchmarks for evaluating phrase similarity. Our model evaluates phrase similarity using two scoring functions, one based on contextualized word embeddings and the other on reconstruction error of codebook embeddings. Our model, labeled as Ours Emb, computes the similarity between two phrase embeddings by calculating the reconstruction error from normalized codebook embeddings. When ranking for similar phrases, negative distance is used to represent similarity. Performance comparison with 5 baselines, including GloVe Avg, Word2Vec Avg, BERT CLS, BERT Avg, and FCT LM Emb, shows that our models significantly outperform all baselines in 4 datasets, especially in Turney. Our models significantly outperform baselines in 4 datasets, especially in Turney, showcasing the effectiveness of non-linearly composing word embeddings. The performance of Ours (K=1) is usually slightly better than Ours (K=10), indicating that the similarity performance is not sensitive to the number of clusters. STS benchmark is a widely used sentence similarity task. Our models outperform baselines in 4 datasets, especially in Turney, showcasing the effectiveness of non-linearly composing word embeddings. The similarity performance is not sensitive to the number of clusters, as shown by Ours (K=10). STS benchmark involves predicting semantic similarity scores between sentence pairs, compared using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Additionally, comparisons are made with word mover's distance (WMD) and cosine similarity between skip-thought embeddings (ST Cos). The curr_chunk discusses the use of skip-thought embeddings in sentence similarity measurement, proposing a method to weight words in sentences and remove principal components for improved performance. It also highlights the importance of considering word embeddings in addition to sentence embeddings for accurate similarity measurement. The multi-facet embeddings allow for estimating word similarities effectively. The multi-facet embeddings enable effective estimation of word importance in sentences by computing cosine similarity with predicted codebook embeddings. This importance weighting is then used to enhance sentence representations in various models, outperforming existing methods like WMD and BERT Avg in sentence similarity tasks. Our SC model outperforms WMD and BERT Avg in sentence similarity tasks, especially in STSB Low. The benefits of multi-mode representation are demonstrated by significantly better scores with K=10 compared to K=1. Attention weighting boosts performance, particularly in STSB Low, without relying on generalization assumptions. A variant using bi-LSTM as encoder and LSTM as decoder performs worse than the transformer alternative. The variant outperforms ST Cos, supporting the approach of ignoring word order in NNSC loss. The model is applied to HypeNet for unsupervised hypernymy detection. The variant of the model significantly outperforms ST Cos in decoding sequences. The approach of ignoring word order in NNSC loss is justified. The model is applied to HypeNet for unsupervised hypernymy detection, showing better performance compared to baselines. The asymmetric scoring function is defined based on the assumption that co-occurring words of a phrase are less related to some of its hyponyms. Our methods outperform symmetric similarity measurements, with Ours (K=1) performing similarly to Ours (K=10). Our model outperforms baselines in decoding sequences and unsupervised hypernymy detection. The extractive summarization method helps evaluate sentence embeddings, generating multiple codebook embeddings to represent different aspects of each sentence. Comparisons with other approaches are made to optimize the summarization process. Our model generates multiple codebook embeddings to represent different aspects of sentences, outperforming baselines in decoding sequences and unsupervised hypernymy detection. Comparisons with other approaches are made to optimize the summarization process. The comparison of different summarization methods using F1 of ROUGE is discussed in Table 5. Unsupervised methods like Lead-3 are strong baselines, while supervised methods like RL show state-of-the-art performance. Larger cluster numbers lead to better results, with K=100 performing the best. Our method allows for setting a large cluster number K to improve performance. Topic modeling has been widely studied and applied for its interpretability and flexibility. Neural networks can be used to discover coherent topics. Sparse coding and parameterizing word embeddings are utilized for modeling word aspects and testing hypotheses efficiently. The challenges of extending methods for word embeddings and modeling longer sequences are not addressed in previous studies. Designing a neural decoder for sets, rather than sequences, requires matching steps and computing distance loss. Various loss options, such as Chamfer distance, are used to measure distances between ground truth and predicted sets. The focus is on symmetric distances between sets of equal size. In contrast to previous studies on word embeddings and sequence modeling, this work focuses on efficiently predicting clustering centers to reconstruct observed instances. The approach involves using a neural encoder to capture the target sequence's meaning and a neural decoder to predict a set of clustering centers. The goal is to overcome computational challenges in learning multi-mode representations for long sequences like phrases or sentences. In this work, a neural encoder is used to model the compositional meaning of target sequences, while a neural decoder predicts codebook embeddings as representations of sentences or phrases. A non-negative sparse coefficient matrix is employed during training to match predicted embeddings to observed words. The proposed models outperform BERT, skip-thoughts, and GloVe-based approaches in unsupervised benchmarks, showing that multi-facet embeddings excel with complex input sequences. The study focuses on the performance of multi-facet embeddings in complex input sequences. Future plans include training a single model for generating multi-facet embeddings for both phrases and sentences, applying the method to unsupervised learning tasks, and keeping the model simple due to computational constraints. The study focuses on the performance of multi-facet embeddings in complex input sequences. The transformer hyperparameters are similar to BERT, with specific settings such as sparsity penalty weight, sentence size, co-occurring words limit, and dimensions. Different numbers of transformer layers and dropout rates are used for sentence and phrase representation. The code will be released for more details on hyperparameter settings, determined by validation loss. The hyperparameters for the models are determined by validation loss, with the number of codebook embeddings being the only exception. The performance is not sensitive to the number of embeddings as long as it is large enough. The hidden embedding for skip-thoughts is set to 600, and the model has fewer parameters and requires less computational resources compared to BERT base. The study also compares the performance of BERT Large in unsupervised semantic tasks. In comparison to BERT base, BERT Large performs better in similarity tasks but worse in hypernym detection. Despite the performance gains of BERT in similarity tasks, the method being compared is still superior, especially in phrase similarity tasks. The hypothesis is that BERT's training method may not be as effective for short sequences like phrases. In Section 3.4, the comparison of different unsupervised summarization methods is done based on sentence length. The performance of W Emb (*) methods is affected by selecting shorter sentences. Ours (K=100) outperforms W Emb (GloVe) and Sent Emb (GloVe) when summaries have similar length. W Emb (*) usually outperforms Sent Emb (*) with similar length summaries, but this comparison may not be fair as W Emb (*) can select more sentences. Choosing longer sentences may be preferable for fluency in extractive summarization. In extractive summarization, choosing the best method depends on the summary length. Ours (K=100) is optimal for shorter summaries, while W Emb (BERT) is better for longer summaries. Combining our method with BERT could improve performance. Visualizing predicted embeddings from sentences in the validation set shows the effectiveness of the approach."
