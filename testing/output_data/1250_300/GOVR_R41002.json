    "content": "Increasing pressures on water supplies are leading to changes in operations at Corps facilities to meet municipal and industrial demands. Corps reallocations at Lake Lanier are causing conflict between Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The agency is considering reallocating storage for M&I use at dams in various states, with more requests expected. Reallocation involves tradeoffs, shifting storage from current purposes like hydropower or navigation. The federal role in M&I water supply development is limited, with states and local entities playing a key role according to the Water Supply Act of 1958. The Water Supply Act of 1958 emphasizes the primary responsibilities of states and local interests in developing water supplies for various purposes. The federal government participates in projects related to flood control, navigation, irrigation, and multipurpose dams. Major projects are carried out by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. Reclamation under the Reclamation Act of 1902 and subsequent project authorizations known as Reclamation Law, and by the Department of Defense's Army Corps of Engineers through various legislation. Construction of federal dams has slowed since the 1960s due to cost, ecological impacts, and site availability. Reservoir planning now focuses on operating existing reservoirs and managing for new objectives. Congress authorizes the Corps to construct dams and water infrastructure, operated to meet authorized purposes and federal laws. Each project's principal purposes are outlined in project authorization language and subsequent legislation. The Army Corps of Engineers is authorized by Congress to construct dams and water infrastructure for specific purposes outlined in project authorization language and subsequent legislation. Approximately 91 Corps reservoirs have municipal and industrial (M&I) storage as an authorized purpose. The Corps has limited authority to provide M&I water supply under the 1958 WSA and Section 6 of the Flood Control Act of 1944. The focus of this report is on the Corps' ability to provide surplus water for M&I use on a temporary basis, rather than permanent reallocation for M&I purposes. The report focuses on the implementation of the 1958 Water Supply Act by the Corps, detailing the reallocation of storage in 44 Corps reservoirs. Congress granted the Corps M&I water supply authority in the 1958 WSA, limiting their decision-making without congressional approval. The 1958 Water Supply Act granted the Corps authority for M&I water supply, limiting their decision-making without congressional approval for modifications of reservoir projects affecting the authorized purposes. Congress did not define what constitutes a serious effect or major change, leading the Corps to develop guidance for implementation. The 1958 Water Supply Act granted the Corps authority for M&I water supply, limiting their decision-making without congressional approval for modifications of reservoir projects affecting the authorized purposes. Modifications of reservoir projects to allocate storage for domestic, municipal, or industrial water supply purposes are considered insignificant if the total reallocation does not exceed 15% of total storage capacity or 50,000 acre feet. Questions have arisen regarding the Corps' discretionary authority and reservoir storage reallocations following a federal court decision related to operations at Lake Lanier. Numerous lawsuits related to Lake Lanier were consolidated in 2007, with a court order in 2009 addressing whether the Corps violated the 1958 WSA by not seeking congressional approval for changes made. The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida addressed whether the Corps violated the 1958 Water Supply Act by reallocating storage in Lake Lanier for municipal and industrial water supply without congressional approval. The court found that the Corps had reallocated over 21% of Lake Lanier's storage capacity since the mid-1970s, exceeding the allowed limit. This reallocation began with operational changes shifting storage from hydropower to water supply, and the Corps later contracted with water providers for withdrawals directly from the lake. The U.S. District Court found that the Corps exceeded its authority by reallocating storage in Lake Lanier for municipal and industrial water supply without congressional approval. This has raised concerns about the Corps' reallocation of water at its other facilities, with 135 reservoirs having storage designated for M&I water. Lake Texoma stands out with over 50,000 AF of reallocated storage space for M&I use. The Corps has reallocated over 50,000 AF of storage space for municipal and industrial use at Lake Texoma. Reallocations at Lake Texoma have been made with discretionary authority, including a 84,099 AF transfer from hydropower to M&I use approved in 1985. The Corps found that the reallocation would not significantly harm the lake's authorized purposes and could be done under the 1958 WSA without congressional approval. The reallocated water supply at Cowanesque Lake represents almost 30% of storage, exceeding the 15% criterion. The Corps reallocated storage space for municipal and industrial use at Lake Texoma without congressional approval, transferring 84,099 AF from hydropower in 1985. The reallocation at Cowanesque Lake, exceeding the 15% criterion, was made under the Corps' discretionary authority and mentioned in P.L. 99-88. The 1958 WSA requires evaluation of potential effects on authorized purposes and operational changes before recommending a reallocation. The 2009 court order raised concerns about Corps evaluations related to Lake Lanier operations and the sufficiency of reallocation analyses. Unauthorized withdrawals for M&I uses at various Corps facilities, including Lake Cumberland, have not been addressed. The Corps' operation of Lake Lanier for M&I water supply has been controversial, with the court order questioning the agency's actions. The Corps' operation of Lake Lanier for M&I water supply has been controversial, with concerns raised about reallocation analyses and unauthorized withdrawals at other Corps facilities. Most reallocations have occurred without national attention or litigation, but the issue of multiple reallocations in a single basin remains unresolved. Congress's stance on the Corps' discretionary authority for reallocation at federal facilities is becoming increasingly relevant. The increasing relevance of authority in M&I reallocation at federal facilities raises questions about multiple reallocations in a basin, agency discretion in agreements with stakeholders, unauthorized withdrawals, transition processes, charging for storage space, and crediting return flows. These issues reflect complex decisions and tradeoffs that may need reexamination as more reallocations are requested, posing broader water policy questions for Congress. The federal government faces questions regarding the appropriate role in municipal water supply, especially in cases where existing water supply is affected by climate change. Challenges arise in determining the national interest and enacting changes to federal facilities due to differing opinions and stakeholder interests."
