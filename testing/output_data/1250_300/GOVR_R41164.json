    "content": "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $7.2 billion for broadband programs administered by NTIA/DOC and RUS/USDA. NTIA received $4.35 billion for a competitive grant program called BTOP, while RUS received $2.5 billion for broadband grants, loans, and combinations, with a focus on rural areas. The Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) under the RUS broadband grant and loan program distributed ARRA broadband funding through two rounds. The first round was announced in July 2009, and the second round in January 2010. All ARRA broadband funds were awarded by October 1, 2010, with a focus on areas outside cities with populations over 20,000 or urbanized areas near cities with populations over 50,000. The breakdown of ARRA broadband funding applications and awards data as of October 1, 2010 included various project categories such as last mile, middle mile, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption for BTOP projects, and last mile remote area for BIP projects. The NTIA and RUS released data on applications for ARRA broadband funding, with over 2,200 applications requesting nearly $28 billion in funding. The total federal funding requested was seven times the available amount in the first round. $4.8 billion was made available in the second and final round, with breakdowns for different project categories. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, $4.8 billion was available, with $2.6 billion for BTOP and $2.2 billion for BIP. NTIA and RUS streamlined the application process based on feedback, with NTIA focusing on middle mile projects and RUS on last mile projects. BTOP shifted towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure grants, while BIP eliminated the \"Remote Last Mile\" project. Each agency had its own NOFA, and applicants could only apply to either BTOP or BIP, not both. The BIP infrastructure program shifted towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure grants, supporting middle mile projects for anchor institutions. The program eliminated the \"Remote Last Mile\" category and offered a standard grant/loan combination. Requirements for eligible infrastructure projects were revised in the second round, focusing on rural areas without High Speed Access broadband service. BIP also introduced three new grant programs: Satellite Projects, Rural Library Broadband, and Technical Assistance. In the second round of funding evaluation, BIP considered factors like unserved areas, remoteness, and speed. Three new grant programs were added: Satellite Projects, Rural Library Broadband, and Technical Assistance. NTIA received 867 applications totaling $11 billion, while RUS received 776 applications requesting nearly $11.2 billion. Combined, NTIA and RUS received 1643 applications in the second round, totaling $22.2 billion in federal funds, 26% less than the first round. In the second round of funding evaluation, NTIA and RUS received a total of 1643 applications requesting $22.2 billion in federal funds, which is 26% less than the first round. NTIA and RUS announced awards for 553 projects, totaling $7.5 billion in federal funding, with $6.2 billion in grant funding and $1.3 billion in loan funding. Awards data include project categories, broadband technology deployed, and state-by-state distribution of funding. Awards data from NTIA and RUS include project categories, broadband technology deployed, and state-by-state distribution of funding. 51% of funding went to middle mile projects, while 49% went to last mile projects. 93% of loan funding was awarded to last mile projects. 56% of infrastructure projects funded were fiber projects. Table 4 shows that 56% of infrastructure projects funded are fiber projects, with most projects involving a deployment of both fiber and wireless technologies. Of last mile project technologies, 47% are fiber, 23% are DSL, 17% are wireless, 6% are multiple, 3% are cable modem, and 1% are satellite. State-by-state breakdown of funding is shown in Table A-1, with per capita funding in Table A-2. NTIA and RUS are now monitoring funded projects post-awards process. In the aftermath of the broadband awards process, NTIA and RUS are now overseeing the progress of funded projects. Projects must be completed within two to three years. NTIA requested $23.7 million in its FY2011 budget for grant management. A $20 million addition for BTOP oversight was included in the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extension Act, 2011. NTIA awarded a $5 million contract to ASR Analytics to measure the impact of BTOP grants. The 112th Congress is expected to provide oversight on NTIA and RUS efforts. The 112th Congress is likely to provide oversight on NTIA and RUS efforts to monitor funded projects. The FCC's National Broadband Plan recommends expanding federal funding for broadband deployment in unserved areas. Insights from previous funding patterns and project outcomes could inform decisions on whether to continue, modify, reduce, expand, or eliminate broadband grant and loan programs."
