    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Science Education Incentive Act of 2005\". The Congress emphasizes the importance of maintaining the US's position in science and technology for advancing human understanding and improving lives. Over half of the country's economic growth is attributed to research and development in these fields, with basic research exploring the universe and applied research addressing everyday problems. The United States' economic growth relies on intellectual capital and innovation, which are fostered through education. The education system should cater to scientists, engineers, technologically proficient workers, and scientifically literate individuals to support research, development, and informed decision-making in a high-tech society. The United States needs proficient workers comfortable with science and technology demands, scientifically literate voters, and improved K-12 education in math and science to compete globally. Science is a process of inquiry leading to understanding the universe through logically derived concepts and theories. Science is a process of inquiry based on observations and data, leading to an understanding of the universe through concepts and theories. Students should learn science by doing experiments and focusing on concepts. Teachers play a crucial role in connecting students with the content. It is essential to start science education early and continue throughout school. Incentives are needed to retain high-quality teachers in the field. Teachers must be recruited with incentives to stay in the classroom, improve their practice, and receive essential training. They should be knowledgeable in their content area, curriculum, up-to-date research, and effective teaching techniques to connect with students. SEC. 3. Refundable credit for portion of tuition paid for undergraduate education of certain teachers. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section for tuition assistance for teachers. The new section allows eligible teachers to claim a tax credit of 10% of qualified undergraduate tuition paid, up to $1,000 per year. Teachers in high-needs school districts can claim up to $1,500. The credit is available for the first 10 years of teaching. Eligibility criteria are defined in the section. The tax credit for eligible teachers is only allowed for up to 10 years. An eligible teacher is defined as a full-time teacher in grades K-12 who teaches math, science, engineering, or technology courses. The tax credit for eligible teachers is limited to 10 years. An eligible teacher must be a full-time teacher in grades K-12 who teaches math, science, engineering, or technology courses and holds a relevant degree. School administrative functions can also qualify as teaching courses if they are related to these subjects. Qualified undergraduate tuition refers to expenses for enrollment at an institution of higher education. The text chunk discusses higher education expenses for enrollment at an institution of higher education, as defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Secretary is authorized to prescribe regulations for this purpose. Conforming amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code. The text chunk introduces amendments related to tuition for undergraduate education of certain teachers and overpayments of tax. It also discusses credits for contributions benefiting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education at the elementary and secondary school level. The effective date for these amendments is specified. The text introduces a credit for STEM contributions at the elementary and secondary school level, including school contributions, teacher externship expenses, and teacher training expenses. STEM school contributions consist of property and service contributions. Contributions' refer to the deductible amount for charitable contributions of STEM inventory property to elementary or secondary schools in the US. The property must be used for educational purposes related to the school's function, with the original use starting at the school, fitting into the education plan, and not exchanged for money or other property. The deductible amount for charitable contributions of STEM inventory property to elementary or secondary schools in the US is determined as if the limitation under section 170(e)(3)(B) applied to all STEM inventory property. STEM service contributions are payments for services provided on a commercial basis for the exclusive benefit of students at qualifying schools, with no charge imposed for the services. The term 'STEM inventory property' refers to property needed by schools for education in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. 'STEM services' are services needed by schools for education in these areas, including teaching courses in K-12 grades. The term 'STEM teacher externship expenses' refers to amounts paid for a STEM externship program for eligible teachers. The program must be established by a taxpayer engaged in a trade. The STEM externship program provides training for eligible STEM teachers to enhance their teaching skills in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. Eligible STEM teachers are K-12 educators at educational organizations in the US or on US military bases, teaching courses in STEM subjects. The term 'STEM teacher training expenses' refers to costs incurred by a taxpayer in a STEM field for training eligible STEM teachers. These teachers must be K-12 educators at educational organizations in the US or on US military bases, teaching STEM subjects. No double benefit is allowed for deductions or credits under this section. The amendment adds a new paragraph to Section 38(b) of the Code for the STEM contributions credit. The amendment adds a new paragraph to Section 38(b) of the Code for the STEM contributions credit. It pertains to contributions benefiting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education at the elementary and secondary school level. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act. Additionally, the Act ensures continued local control over educational institutions and school systems, prohibiting any federal direction, supervision, or control over curriculum, instruction, administration, or personnel."
