    "content": "The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program offers private health insurance to federal employees, retirees, and their dependents, with over $40 billion in annual benefits. Participation is voluntary, with 85% of employees and 90% of retirees enrolled. Coverage options include individual, family, and self plus one plans in fee-for-service or health maintenance organizations. Premiums are shared between the government and participants, with basic services like hospital and physician care covered. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program, established in 1959, offers private health insurance to federal employees, retirees, and their dependents. Premiums are shared between the government and participants, with coverage including basic services like hospital and physician care. Prior to FEHB, federal employees had to purchase health insurance on their own or through union plans. President Truman's Commission recommended federal health insurance coverage in 1951, leading to the passage of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established parameters for eligibility, coverage options, types of health plans, and government's share of premiums. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) manages FEHB and contracts with insurers. The general model of FEHB remains the same, with enrollees choosing coverage from private insurers. Premium cost-sharing between employees, retirees, and the government has always been a part of the program. Many aspects of FEHB have been modified over time, including changes to the government's share of premiums. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 established eligibility, coverage options, and premium cost-sharing between employees, retirees, and the government. Over time, aspects of the program have been modified, such as changes to the government's share of premiums. Researchers have shown interest in FEHB as a model for health insurance programs and for expanding coverage to certain individuals. The FEHB model allows enrollees to choose coverage from competing insurers with minimal intervention from OPM, which is seen as successful in giving enrollees cost-conscious choices and controlling overall program costs. The FEHB model has been viewed as successful in allowing enrollees to make cost-conscious choices and controlling program costs. Researchers have considered exporting aspects of FEHB to other health care programs, expanding access to FEHB, or creating new programs modeled after FEHB. Some policymakers have introduced legislation to create new programs or expand FEHB eligibility. Lessons learned from FEHB may have been instructive for establishing health insurance exchanges under the ACA. Congressional interest in FEHB extends beyond its potential applicability as a model for other health care programs. The report provides information on how Congress has interacted with the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program in the past, including changes such as conditioning the use of federal funds, modifying premium share formulas, eligibility criteria, and policies affecting the relationship between Medicare and FEHB. Changes have been made to the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, including modifications to the government's share of premiums, eligibility criteria, and policies related to Medicare. Congress has enacted laws placing conditions on the use of federal funds for FEHB, such as restrictions on funding for abortions except in cases of danger to the woman's life, rape, or incest. The government's share of premiums in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program has evolved over the years. Initially set at 50%, it changed to a formula based on the average premiums of six health plans in 1971. This formula was adjusted in 1997 by the Balanced Budget Act, with the government now contributing 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans, not exceeding 75% for any one plan. The government's share of premiums in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program was set at 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans, not exceeding 75% for any one plan. Eligibility for FEHB has been extended to more categories of federal employees, retirees, and their family members over the years. In 1988, Congress authorized temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) in FEHB for separating employees and their dependents for up to 18 months. TCC enrollees must pay the entire FEHB premium and a 2% administrative fee. Children aging out of their parents' plans can have 36 months of coverage. FEHB was established before Medicare, but in 1982, federal workers became eligible for Medicare due to the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (P.L. 86-382) established the FEHB program for federal workers, including eligibility, benefits, premiums, and OPM's role. Eligible participants were current employees, retirees with at least 12 years of service, and their family members. OPM was responsible for overseeing the program. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 established the FEHB program for federal workers, retirees with at least 12 years of service, and their family members. OPM was responsible for overseeing the program and approving different types of health benefit plans to participate in FEHB. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 established the FEHB program for federal workers, retirees with at least 12 years of service, and their family members. Employee organization plans are available to employees, retirees, and their families. The government's share of premiums in FEHB plans depended on the type of plan and enrollee, with specific biweekly government shares for different coverage types. The Postal Employees Salary Increase Act of 1960 (P.L. 86-568) authorized FEHB coverage for employees of county committees under the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act and their dependents. Government's share of premiums in FEHB plans varied based on coverage type and enrollee, with specific biweekly shares outlined. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 was amended by P.L. 88-59 in 1963 to extend the deadline for applications from qualified employee organizations to participate in FEHB. P.L. 88-284 in 1964 broadened FEHB coverage to include employees with work-related injuries, foster children, and unmarried children up to age 21. P.L. 88-284, enacted on March 17, 1964, expanded FEHB coverage to include employees with work-related injuries, foster children, and unmarried children up to age 21. It also allowed retirees to continue their FEHB coverage if enrolled by December 31, 1964. Additionally, the act granted OPM discretionary authority to terminate contracts with carriers not meeting enrollment requirements and equalized the government's share of premiums for all enrollees. P.L. 88-531 and P.L. 88-631 authorized FEHB coverage for certain United States commissioners, their dependents, and teachers in the District of Columbia, respectively. The government's share of the premium was 50% for both individual and family plans. P.L. 89-379 extended FEHB coverage to congressional employees with certain staff fellowships, while P.L. 89-504 amended FEHB to adjust government share of premiums and extended coverage for dependent children up to age 22. The government's share of premiums for family enrollment in all plan types was set at $3.94 biweekly, not exceeding 50% of the total premium. FEHB coverage was extended to dependent children up to age 22. Various acts in the late 1960s and early 1970s expanded FEHB coverage to National Guard technicians, United States magistrates, and federal employees transferring to international organizations. P.L. 91-418 in 1970 altered the determination of the government's share of premiums. P.L. 91-418 in 1970 changed how the government's share of health benefit insurance premiums was determined. It introduced the \"big six\" formula, which calculated the government's contribution based on the average of six benefit plans. The government's share was set at 40% of the average premium. Additionally, the act allowed family members of deceased employees or retirees to continue enrollment in an FEHB plan. The government's share of health benefit insurance premiums was set at 40% of the average premium under P.L. 91-418 in 1970. Family members of deceased employees could continue enrollment in an FEHB plan. P.L. 91-648 in 1971 extended FEHB coverage to federal employees assigned to state or local governments.

P.L. 93-246 increased the government's share of FEHB plan premium from 40% to 50% in 1974, with a provision to increase to 60% in 1975. The government's share was capped at 75% of the total premium amount for any health plan. Health insurance plans in FEHB had to comply with OPM decisions on health benefit entitlement. P.L. 93-363 and P.L. 94-310 provided direct access to optometrists and clinical psychologists for FEHB enrollees without referral and granted court leave to federal employees as witnesses in certain judicial proceedings. The amendments in P.L. 94-310 allowed the government to use annual appropriations for retirees' health plan premiums until expended. P.L. 94-342 restored health benefits coverage eligibility for surviving spouses whose annuities were restored after termination due to remarriage. P.L. 95-368 established uniformity in Federal Employee Health Benefits by preempting inconsistent state or local laws. P.L. 95-368, enacted on September 17, 1978, aimed to ensure uniformity in benefits and coverage under FEHB by preempting state and local laws inconsistent with FEHB contracts. It provided protections for medically underserved populations and allowed employee organizations to sponsor health benefit plans. P.L. 95-437, passed on October 10, 1978, granted part-time career employees and their dependents access to FEHB coverage. The Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-437) allowed part-time career employees and their dependents to access FEHB coverage for a 16-32 hour work week. Another act (P.L. 95-583) reduced the required creditable service for FEHB coverage in retirement from 12 years to 5 years. Employees must be enrolled in an FEHB plan for at least five years before retirement to continue coverage. Various amendments and acts redefined employee eligibility for FEHB coverage, excluding certain individuals based on citizenship and duty station. The amendments in P.L. 96-179 and the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 impacted federal employees' eligibility for FEHB coverage, including removing the \"lives with\" requirement for natural children and requiring payment of the Medicare Hospital Insurance tax for entitlement to premium-free benefits under Medicare Part A. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 affected federal employees' eligibility for premium-free Medicare Part A based on previous private sector employment. It also made Medicare payments secondary for employees aged 65 to 69 covered under certain employer group health plans. Additionally, P.L. 97-346 required OPM to adjust government contributions to FEHB plans for 1983. The government paid the difference into contingency reserves of FEHB plans for 1983 based on enrollee numbers. P.L. 98-151 prohibited funds for abortions or administrative expenses for FEHB plans, except in life-threatening situations. P.L. 98-615 extended FEHB coverage to former spouses of federal employees, requiring them to pay premiums.

P.L. 99-53 authorized additional employee organization plans in FEHB if applied within 90 days of enactment, with specified conditions for approval. P.L. 99-251 allowed a new comprehensive medical plan, mixed model prepayment plan, to participate in FEHB. The Federal Employees Benefits Improvement Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-251) introduced a new type of comprehensive medical plan, called a mixed model prepayment plan, to participate in FEHB. It eliminated the requirement for group practice prepayment plans to include physicians from three major specialties and mandated studies on extending FEHB contracting authority to health practitioners like nurse midwives and chiropractors. The act also emphasized adequate treatment for mental illness, alcoholism, and drug addiction for FEHB enrollees. The Federal Employees Benefits Improvement Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-251) allowed health plans to require referral by a psychiatrist for reimbursement and emphasized adequate treatment for mental illness, alcoholism, and drug addiction for FEHB enrollees. It also gave OPM authority to waive the five-year service requirement for FEHB coverage in retirement under exceptional circumstances and allowed enrollees to change or cancel their enrollment within a three-week period. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) required OPM to determine minimum financial reserves for carriers and set provisions for refunds. The Federal Employees Benefits Improvement Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-251) allowed health plans to require referrals for reimbursement and emphasized mental health treatment for FEHB enrollees. The Act also granted OPM authority to waive the five-year service requirement for FEHB coverage in retirement under exceptional circumstances. Additionally, it allowed enrollees to change or cancel their enrollment within a three-week period. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1987 (P.L. 99-569) provided health benefits for former spouses of CIA employees. The Joint Resolution of 1988 (P.L. 100-202) added clinical social workers to non-physician providers for FEHB enrollees. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-203) specified USPS contributions to the Employee Health Benefits Fund. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-204) extended FEHB coverage to former spouses of Foreign Service employees. The Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (P.L. 100-204) provided FEHB coverage for certain former spouses of employees or former employees of the Foreign Service. The Making Technical Corrections Relating to the Federal Employees' Retirement System, and for Other Purposes (P.L. 100-238) declared that certain nonfederal employees eligible for FEHB benefits were no longer entitled to such benefits after October 1, 1988. The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-360) included provisions affecting FEHB that were later repealed by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Repeal Act of 1989 (P.L. 101-234). The Federal Employees Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-654) would have required OPM to reduce rates for retirees in FEHB who were Medicare eligible, submit reports to Congress on incorporating health benefit plans for Medicare-eligible individuals, and assess the feasibility of adopting NAIC standards for Medicare supplemental health benefit plans under FEHB. The Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-654) allowed OPM to impose sanctions on health care providers convicted of illegal activities, set time limits for debarment proceedings, prohibited providers without a valid license from participating in FEHB, authorized fines for false charges, and created Temporary Continuation of FEHB Coverage (TCC) for separating federal employees and their families to maintain coverage for up to 18 months by paying full premiums. The Temporary Continuation of FEHB Coverage (TCC) allows separated federal employees to maintain health benefits for up to 18 months by paying full premiums. TCC is available to employees not separated for gross misconduct or no longer meeting unmarried dependent child requirements. Additionally, certain employees on the office staff of former Presidents or Vice Presidents are eligible for FEHB coverage. The Health Benefits Program for 1990 or 1991 was adjusted in response to Aetna's withdrawal from FEHB. The government's share of FEHB plans for those years would be calculated based on the Aetna high option premium and the average percentage change in the remaining five plans. The provisions of this act would not apply if comprehensive reform legislation is enacted. Additionally, the USPS was required to pay the employer's share of FEHB premiums for survivors of postal employees who retired or died after October 1, 1986. Former spouses were also authorized FEHB coverage under certain conditions. P.L. 101-246 and P.L. 101-303 authorized FEHB coverage for specific groups, including postal employees who retired after October 1, 1986, and former spouses of Foreign Service employees. P.L. 101-303 allowed federal retirees to pay health benefits premiums through direct payments if their annuity was insufficient. P.L. 101-508, enacted on November 5, 1990, included various FEHB-related reforms such as hospitalization cost-containment measures, improved cash management, exemption of FEHB plans from state premium taxes, and extension of the restructured big six formula through plan year 1993. It also required coordination between FEHB and Medicare to identify individuals entitled to Medicare benefits and applied Medicare payment limits to services covered under Part A. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1991 (P.L. 101-513) improved coordination between FEHB and Medicare, applied Medicare payment limits to services covered under Part A for retired FEHB enrollees aged 65 and older, and required the USPS to pay the government's share of FEHB premiums for annuitants who retired from employment with the USPS on or after July 1, 1971. Additionally, it entitled U.S. hostages in Iraq, Kuwait, and Lebanon, and their family members, to FEHB benefits while in hostage status and for 12 months thereafter if they did not have other health insurance. The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1991 (P.L. 101-513) provided FEHB benefits to U.S. hostages in Iraq, Kuwait, and Lebanon, and their family members, for 12 months after hostage status. P.L. 101-530 allowed National Guard technicians to be eligible for FEHB benefits without post-1968 service requirement. P.L. 102-88 amended the Central Intelligence Agency Act to allow former spouses of certain CIA employees to enroll in FEHB plans despite remarriage before age 55. P.L. 102-88, enacted on August 14, 1991, restored FEHB eligibility for former spouses of certain CIA employees who remarried before age 55. P.L. 102-90 allowed Senate Employee Child Care Center employees to enroll in FEHB coverage. P.L. 102-393, passed on October 6, 1992, prohibited changes to FEHB that would impact Medicare beneficiaries. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (P.L. 102-484) imposed restrictions on changes to FEHB that would affect Medicare beneficiaries. It prevented OPM from requiring retired FEHB enrollees eligible for Medicare benefits to pay out-of-pocket differences with nonparticipating Medicare providers and from eliminating the waiver of FEHB plan coinsurance for prescription drugs used by Medicare-covered FEHB enrollees. Additionally, the act provided for the continuation of FEHB benefits for individuals involuntarily separated from the Department of Defense due to a reduction in force. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66) directed the Secretary of Defense to review FEHB for efficiency. It also required most FEHB plans to apply Medicare Part B limitations on payments for physician services to retired FEHB enrollees aged 65 or older. The Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-123) extended and modified the Medicare Part B limitations on payments for physician services to retired FEHB enrollees aged 65 or older. It also required physicians and suppliers accepting Medicare payments to accept equivalent payment and cost sharing from FEHB. Additionally, the act temporarily extended and modified the restructured big six formula for plan years 1990 through 1998.

The Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997 (P.L. 104-208) required OPM to allow surviving children whose annuity was terminated due to marriage to enroll in FEHB if they were covered before. It also mandated a report on a demonstration program for beneficiaries of Department of Defense health programs and Medicare Part A to enroll in FEHB. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) modified the formula for determining the government's share of FEHB premiums. It required OPM to calculate the weighted average premium of all plans in FEHB annually by October 1st. The biweekly government share of an FEHB plan for an employee or retiree is 72% of the weighted average premium, with a cap of 75% of any given plan's premium. The government's share of an FEHB plan for an employee or retiree is 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans, with a cap of 75% of any given plan's premium. Individuals enrolled in FEHB cannot enroll in a Medicare Medical Savings Account plan until OPM certifies to HHS. P.L. 105-261 directed a demonstration project allowing certain individuals eligible for Department of Defense health benefits to enroll in FEHB plans voluntarily. The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-266) allowed Department of Defense health beneficiaries to enroll in FEHB plans voluntarily. The project ran for three contract years, with enrollment open for the year 2000 and ending on December 31, 2002. Reports on costs, effectiveness, and feasibility were required to be submitted to Congress. The act also made administrative changes to FEHB, including debarring fraudulent healthcare providers and modifying the definition of a carrier. The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-266) modified the definition of a carrier under FEHB and revised preemption provisions related to health insurance. It required OPM to encourage carriers to obtain discounts from healthcare providers and established rules for the readmission of certain plans in FEHB. The Federal Employees Health Care Protection Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-266) established rules for readmission of certain plans in FEHB and clarified that plans can provide direct access, payment, and reimbursement to licensed health care providers not specified in statute. It also allowed individuals enrolled in FDIC or Federal Reserve health plans to enroll in FEHB plans when those plans terminate. The District of Columbia Courts and Justice Technical Corrections Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-274) treated Public Defender Service employees as federal employees for health insurance eligibility under FEHB.

P.L. 110-422, on October 15, 2008, outlined FEHB requirements for NASA employees affected by the Space Shuttle Program's termination or other job changes. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires NASA to pay the remaining share of the premium for FEHB coverage for employees affected by job changes. FEHB plans must comply with ACA provisions, some of which may impose new requirements on the plans. The ACA requires FEHB plans to comply with various provisions regarding health insurance coverage. Some provisions have no impact on FEHB plans, while others introduce new requirements. OPM has provided guidance to FEHB plans on implementing ACA provisions, including extending dependent coverage to age 26 and offering preventive care and screening. The ACA requires FEHB plans to comply with various provisions, including extending dependent coverage to age 26 for disabled children. Plans must offer preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs, but cost sharing may apply for out-of-network providers. Plans must provide a summary of benefits and coverage to help consumers understand their health insurance. The ACA required FEHB plans to eliminate lifetime limits on certain health benefits and establish restricted annual limits before January 1, 2014. Plans were also required to comply with coverage requirements for clinical trials and prohibited preexisting condition exclusions. The ACA required FEHB plans to comply with coverage requirements for clinical trials and prohibited preexisting condition exclusions. Plans must report a medical loss ratio and issue rebates if the ratio falls below 85%. Rebates are deposited into the health plan's contingency reserve. The ACA requires FEHB plans to issue rebates if the health quality costs fall below 85%. Carriers must rebate directly to OPM, and the rebate can reduce the following year's premiums. The act modified qualified medical expenses for FSAs, HSAs, and HRAs, restricting coverage of OTC medicines without a prescription. The penalty for nonqualified HSA withdrawals was raised to 20% for those under 65. The maximum annual contribution to HCFSA was lowered to $2,500 in 2013. Eligible Indian tribes have been included since May 1, 2012. The ACA imposed administrative requirements on employers, including providing the aggregate cost of employer-sponsored coverage on W-2 forms. Starting in 2014, insurers, self-insuring employers, and government agencies had to report minimum essential coverage details. Eligible Indian tribes could purchase FEHB for tribal employees, with the tribe paying the government's share of the premium. The ACA imposed administrative requirements on employers, including providing the aggregate cost of employer-sponsored coverage on W-2 forms. Starting in 2014, insurers, self-insuring employers, and government agencies had to report minimum essential coverage details. Members of Congress and designated staff were restricted to health plans created under the ACA or offered through an exchange. They could no longer purchase FEHB plans as active employees but could enroll in a health plan through a SHOP exchange with an employer contribution. Upon retirement, they could enroll in an FEHB plan. The ACA imposed various fees on health insurance plans, including an annual fee based on market share, a PCORI fee, and a 40% excise tax on coverage exceeding certain thresholds. These provisions may impact FEHB plans. Members of Congress and designated staff eligible for retirement can enroll in an FEHB plan. For more details, refer to CRS Report R43194. The excise tax under the ACA applies to employer and employee premium payments for health insurance, dental and vision coverage premiums, and payments to health-related accounts. Thresholds are $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage, indexed to inflation. The excess amount over these thresholds is subject to a 40% excise tax. The ACA mandates the offering of at least two multistate plans through each exchange, separate from FEHB, with no reduction in resources for FEHB administration. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-67) allows FEHB enrollees to choose \"self plus one\" coverage. The government's share of premiums for this option is determined based on the weighted average premium of all plans in FEHB. OPM can establish separate units to administer MSPs without affecting FEHB. FEHB plans are not required to offer an MSP. OPM determines the government's share of premiums for \"self plus one\" coverage based on the weighted average premium of all plans in FEHB. The payment is either 72% of the average premium or 75% of a specific plan's premium, whichever is lower. In the first year of offering the self plus one option, OPM will calculate the weighted average premium for this coverage through actuarial analysis."
