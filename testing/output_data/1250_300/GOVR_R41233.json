    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from annual appropriations by Congress to address housing problems for low-income households. Rental assistance programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and project-based assistance make up a majority of the funding. Block grant programs like HOME and CDBG help finance housing and community development activities for low-income families. FHA insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. HUD's funding primarily comes from Congress through annual appropriations to address housing issues for low-income households. This includes rental assistance programs like Public Housing and Section 8 Vouchers, as well as block grant programs like HOME and CDBG. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. Surplus FHA funds have been used to offset HUD's budget costs, with recent years seeing significant emergency supplemental funding, including assistance for Hurricane Katrina recovery and economic stimulus legislation providing over $13 billion to HUD programs. Regular HUD funding has increased by 57% in the past nine years, with a growing rate of growth in recent years. HUD's regular funding has increased by 57% in the past nine years, with a growing rate of growth in recent years. Adjusting for inflation, the growth in \"real\" funding has been less robust, growing by about 17% over the nine-year period. Most of the growth over the previous nine years has come in the last two years. HUD's funding is made up of several components, including regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets. Annual funding for HUD's programs is primarily funded through regular annual appropriations, also known as discretionary appropriations. Congress may also provide emergency appropriations in response to disasters, in addition to regular annual appropriations. Congressional appropriators are limited in the amount of new non-emergency discretionary funding they can provide each year, leading them to either provide less in regular annual appropriations or find offsets. Rescissions, or cancellations of unobligated funds, are one way to offset the cost of regular annual appropriations. The cost of HUD's regular annual appropriations acts is offset through rescissions and offsetting receipts. The total net budget authority for HUD is determined by the interaction between new appropriations and offsets. Net budget authority is the estimated cost of the HUD budget. Declining or increasing net budget authority does not necessarily mean declining or increasing regular appropriations. The net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased 57% between FY2002 and FY2010, from over $29 billion to over $46 billion. However, this increase is not solely due to increased appropriations for HUD programs. Regular annual appropriations grew by only 37% during this period, while offsetting receipts and collections declined by more than 70% and rescinded amounts decreased by 96%. The net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased 57% from FY2002 to FY2010, with regular appropriations growing by 37%. The growth in regular appropriations is mainly due to the increase in HUD's Section 8 voucher and project-based rental assistance programs, which account for a significant portion of the HUD budget. Funding for the Section 8 programs grew by over 70%, while funding for all other HUD programs only grew by 8% during this period. The net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased 57% from FY2002 to FY2010, with regular appropriations growing by 37%. Section 8 funding grew while other HUD programs declined, but in FY2009 and FY2010, funding for other programs began to grow as well. The decline in offsetting receipts is largely due to decreases in receipts from FHA mortgage insurance programs. The appropriations process starts with the President's budget request, followed by hearings and crafting of appropriations legislation by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Legislation must be enacted before September 30 to avoid a government funding lapse. The federal fiscal year ends on September 30 and the new one begins on October 1, requiring appropriations legislation to be enacted before September 30 to avoid a government funding lapse. In years when Congress does not complete appropriations action before the end of the fiscal year, short-term continuing resolutions are enacted to continue funding at prior levels. The FY2011 appropriations process began with the President's budget release on February 1, 2010, and ended with P.L. 112-10 signed into law on April 15, 2011. The President's FY2011 budget requested about $45.6 billion for HUD, a 1% decrease from FY2010. The President's FY2011 budget request for HUD, released in February 2010, proposed $45.6 billion in net new budget authority, a 1% decrease from FY2010. Despite the decrease, there was a 3% increase in appropriations for HUD programs overall. The budget prioritized funding for Section 8 programs, homeless programs, and research needs, while decreasing funding for programs for the elderly, disabled, and public housing repairs. No new funding was requested for the brownfields redevelopment program. The President's budget for FY2011 requested decreased funding for housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing repairs, and the brownfields redevelopment program. The House and Senate bills proposed about $1 billion more for HUD than requested, rejecting the President's cuts and proposed initiatives. The bills would have provided a 1% increase in budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a FY2011 HUD funding bill that would have provided about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President. The bill included a 1% increase in budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. It rejected the President's proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly and disabled, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program, while also providing funding for the Transforming Rental Assistance initiative. Unlike the House bill, the Senate committee bill funded the President's Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. No FY2011 appropriations legislation was enacted before the end of the 111th Congress, leading to a series of continuing resolutions to maintain funding at FY2010 levels. The 111th Congress did not enact the bill before its end, leading to a series of continuing resolutions to maintain funding at FY2010 levels, including for HUD programs. The last CR approved before adjournment was set to expire in March 2011, leaving funding for the rest of FY2011 to the 112th Congress. Additionally, it extended FHA mortgage limit increases through FY2011. The House later approved a year-long continuing resolution, H.R. 1, to fund the government through the end of FY2011. The House approved a year-long continuing resolution, H.R. 1, to fund the federal government through the end of FY2011. H.R. 1 would have provided about $5 billion less in aggregate appropriations for HUD programs compared to FY2010. The Senate considered, but failed to pass, both H.R. 1 and a Senate Amendment that would have increased funding for HUD by nearly $6 billion. The Senate failed to pass H.R. 1 and a Senate Amendment that would have increased funding for HUD by nearly $6 billion. The Senate Amendment would have reduced net budget authority from FY2010 by over $1 billion, but increased aggregate appropriations by about $900 million compared to FY2010. A short-term CR was approved to fund the government through March 18, 2011, with most accounts funded at FY2010 levels, except for the Community Development Fund which was reduced. The funding for HUD was reduced below FY2010 levels, with only the Community Development Fund (CDF) account being affected. The CDF was funded approximately $195 million lower than FY2010, equivalent to the amount previously allocated for congressional earmarks. Subsequent short-term CRs maintained most HUD accounts at FY2010 levels but continued the reduction for the CDF. Additionally, no funding was provided for HUD's Brownfields Redevelopment account, previously funded at $17 million in FY2010. In FY2010, a short-term CR (P.L. 112-8) extended funding until April 15, 2011, while work on a final FY2011 funding bill was completed. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-10) provided year-long appropriations for various government agencies, including HUD. Funding for HUD programs was mostly maintained at FY2010 levels, with some reductions and increases in specific programs. The law included an across-the-board 0.2% rescission from non-defense discretionary accounts, resulting in a decrease of about 11% in net new budget authority for HUD. The law provided $41.1 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a decrease of 11% from FY2010. The decrease in budget authority would only represent a 4% decrease in appropriations for HUD programs due to an increase in offsetting collections from FHA mortgage insurance programs. FHA insures mortgage loans to make credit more widely available at a lower cost. FHA programs are administered through two accounts in the HUD budget. The HUD budget includes the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI) and the General Insurance Fund (GI). The MMI Fund is the largest FHA insurance fund, covering single-family home loans and the HECM program. The GI Fund provides insurance for riskier mortgages and special-purpose loans. The focus is on single-family loans under the MMI Fund. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) determines the cost of federal loan insurance by calculating the net present value of expected cash flows from insured loans. Cash inflows come from insurance premiums, while outflows are payments for loan defaults. The subsidy rate, expressed as a percentage of insured loan volume, shows whether cash inflows exceed outflows (negative subsidy rate) or vice versa (positive subsidy rate). The subsidy rate is a negative number when cash outflows exceed inflows, and a positive number when the opposite occurs. It is applied to the expected loan volume to determine the credit subsidy needed for federal credit programs. Agencies must revise initial subsidy estimates based on actual loan experience. The MMI Fund historically has a negative subsidy rate, generating money for the government by making more in fees than paying out in claims. This has allowed it to offset funding needs in the HUD budget without requiring an appropriation from Congress. The MMI Fund historically has a negative subsidy rate, making money for the government by collecting more fees than paying out in claims. It does not typically need funding from Congress to operate, but receives appropriations for administrative expenses. The Fund is divided into two risk categories, with the Purchase and Refinance category estimated to have a negative subsidy rate of -2.59% for FY2011, generating about $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy. This increase is partly due to proposed FHA reforms by HUD. The estimated increase in negative credit subsidy for the MMI Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category is projected to be around $1.9 billion, with $960 million without proposed changes and an additional $902 million with HUD-proposed reforms. Despite lower projections compared to the Administration's, CBO still expects this category to generate more revenue than losses in FY2011, eliminating the need for a positive credit subsidy. The differences between the President's budget request and CBO's re-estimate are detailed in Table 3. In FY2011, FHA's estimates of negative credit subsidy increased due to a rise in annual premiums. This led to an increase in offsetting receipts for the Purchase and Refinance risk category to nearly $10 billion by FY2012 budget release, up from $5.8 billion in the FY2011 budget. CBO also raised its estimate of FHA receipts by over $1 billion during the FY2011 appropriations process. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the HECM program into the MMI fund, with the MMI HECM risk category requiring a positive credit subsidy of $250 million. HUD proposed changes to the HECM program in FY2011, including increasing annual insurance premiums and adjusting the loan size formula. HUD proposed increasing HECM borrowers' annual insurance premiums from 0.5% to 1.25% of the loan balance and adjusting the formula for initial loan sizes. Legislation aimed to reduce credit subsidies, with H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 offering $140 million and $150 million respectively, less than the Administration's estimate. FY2012 appropriations law aimed for a zero credit subsidy for the HECM program. FHA-insured mortgages have seen increased demand due to tightening private market lending standards. The demand for FHA-insured mortgages has been increasing in recent years, with FHA insuring 18.7% of new single-family mortgages in FY2009. The average credit score on FHA-insured loans has improved, but the default rate on past loans is rising, putting strain on the MMI Fund. Congress mandated a capital reserve ratio of at least 2% for the MMI Fund, which was only at 0.53% in FY2009. During FY2009, FHA's capital reserve ratio fell below 2% for the first time, prompting proposed changes to its single-family mortgage insurance programs. These changes include increasing the annual mortgage insurance premium, with a maximum set by Congress at 1.5% for borrowers with downpayments greater than 5% and 1.55% for those with downpayments of 5% or less. After the enactment of P.L. 111-229, FHA raised its annual mortgage insurance premiums to 0.9% of the loan. After P.L. 111-229 was enacted, FHA increased annual mortgage insurance premiums to 0.9% for loans with a loan-to-value ratio of 95% or higher, and 0.85% for loans with a ratio below 95%. Subsequently, on April 18, 2011, FHA raised premiums to 1.15% for downpayments of 5% or less, and 1.10% for downpayments greater than 5%. The upfront premium was also raised to 2.25% for loans endorsed on or after April 5, 2010, under the statutory cap of 3%. After P.L. 111-229 was enacted, FHA raised the annual mortgage insurance premium and lowered the upfront premium to 1% for loans endorsed on or after October 1, 2010. FHA also proposed changes to downpayment and credit score requirements, including a minimum 10% downpayment for credit scores between 500 and 579, and reducing seller concessions from 6% to 3%. These changes were published for comments in a Federal Register notice on July 15, 2010. FHA is proposing to reduce the maximum limit on seller concessions from 6% to 3%. They also plan to increase oversight of FHA-approved lenders, with potential enforcement actions requiring Congress approval. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 5072) aimed to grant FHA broader authority to terminate lenders with excessive defaults and claims. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 aimed to give FHA more authority to terminate lenders with high default rates and claims, establish a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Risk Management, and allow FHA to contract with outside credit risk analysis sources. Appropriations were authorized for staff to review lender performance, and HUD provides grants for housing programs for the elderly and persons with disabilities. The Section 202 and Section 811 programs provide capital grants and rental assistance to nonprofit developers for building or rehabilitating housing units for elderly and residents with disabilities. Supportive services are optional for Section 202 housing but mandatory for Section 811 housing. HUD has funded over 106,000 units of Section 202 housing and 30,000 units of Section 811 housing. The President's proposal for FY2011 suggested no new funding for these programs to allow for redesign. Funding would have been reduced to $274 million for Section 202 and related programs, and $90 million for Section 811, compared to $825 million and $300 million in FY2010, respectively. The President's proposal for FY2011 suggested significant funding cuts for Section 202 and Section 811 programs. The proposed funding for Section 202 would be reduced to $274 million from $825 million in FY2010, while Section 811 would receive $90 million compared to $300 million in the previous year. Both the House-passed appropriations bill (H.R. 5850) and the Senate committee-passed bill (S. 3644) did not follow the President's recommendations to redesign the programs or stop producing new units. The difference in proposed funding levels was mainly due to the treatment of Section 811 vouchers, with H.R. 5850 providing $300 million and S. 3644 providing $200 million. In FY2011, funding for Section 811 vouchers was moved to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account, resulting in a decrease in funding for the Section 811 program. Congress appropriated $150 million for Section 811, with $67 million allocated for voucher renewals split between the Section 811 and Section 8 accounts. This was $20 million less than the previous year's funding for voucher renewals. In FY2011, funding for Section 811 vouchers was moved to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account, resulting in a decrease in funding for the Section 811 program. Congress appropriated $150 million for Section 811, with $67 million allocated for voucher renewals split between the Section 811 and Section 8 accounts. This is $20 million less than the previous year's funding for voucher renewals. Additionally, within the funds appropriated for Section 202, approximately $89 million was provided for Service Coordinators and another $39 million for the Assisted Living Conversion program. Since FY2004, funding for voucher renewals has been a key debate in the HUD appropriations process. Congress allocated over $16 billion in FY2010 for voucher renewals, directing HUD to distribute funds to PHAs based on prior year costs and utilization. The goal is to efficiently allocate funding to serve as many families as possible while containing future costs. In FY2010, Congress allocated $16 billion for voucher renewals to PHAs based on prior year costs and utilization. HUD adjusted costs for inflation and other factors to determine funding eligibility. However, only PHAs using vouchers in FY2009 received funding in FY2010, leading to decreased utilization for some PHAs. The President's FY2011 budget requested $17 billion for voucher renewals to fund all vouchers in use. The President's FY2011 budget requested $17 billion for voucher renewals, with funding allocated based on prior year costs and utilization. The budget also proposed giving the Secretary authority to reallocate funding to PHAs with lower reserves, potentially allowing them to serve more families. Additionally, the budget requested Congress to lift the ban on \"over-leasing\" to facilitate increased leasing. The President's FY2011 budget requested $17 billion for voucher renewals, with funding allocated based on prior year costs and utilization. The House bill included about $150 million less for renewals than the amount requested in the President's budget. The committee report indicated that the amount included in H.R. 5850 would be sufficient to meet the renewal needs of the program and reiterated the committee's support for funding all vouchers in use. The formula for allocating renewal funding largely followed the President's request, but did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President. The House bill, H.R. 5850, followed the President's formula for allocating renewal funding but did not include the reallocation authority requested. The committee believed the program needed major authorization changes outside of their jurisdiction. The bill aimed to base PHA funding on prior calendar year spending to better reflect the program's needs. Similarly, S. 3644 funded renewals below the President's request, using the same formula as H.R. 5850 but adjusting it to use calendar year spending. Both bills did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President. The Senate bill, like the House bill, allocated funding for PHAs based on calendar year spending. However, it did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President. Concerns were raised about potential cost increases and financial management in the program. The final FY2011 appropriations law did not make changes to the funding allocation formula from FY2010. The President's budget requested funding renewal of mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities in the Section 8 account. HUD requested $114 million for this purpose. The President's budget requested Congress to fund the renewal of mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities in the Section 8 account with $114 million in FY2011. The final FY2011 appropriations law appropriated less than requested for Section 811 renewals, directing funds to renew vouchers issued since 2007. PHAs have contracts with HUD for authorized vouchers, totaling around 2.3 million. Additional vouchers, including tenant protection vouchers, are sometimes created by Congress. In recent years, Congress has allocated around 2.3 million authorized vouchers to Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). Additional vouchers, such as tenant protection vouchers for displaced families, are sometimes created. Congress has also provided funding for new vouchers for special populations, such as families in the child welfare system and homeless veterans. The President's budget and bills from the 111th Congress have allocated funds for various voucher programs, including supportive housing for at-risk individuals and families. The Senate bill from the 111th Congress allocated $75 million for the Veteran's Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) program, $66 million for families displaced by hurricanes, and $16 million for the Family Unification Program (FUP) providing vouchers to families in the child welfare system. The final FY2011 appropriations law provided about $50 million for VASH vouchers. The project-based rental assistance account funds existing Section 8 contracts between HUD and property owners to subsidize low-income families' rent. No new contracts have been made since the early 1980s. HUD provides subsidies to owners for low-income families living in subsidized units. Contracts for 20- to 40-year periods were funded by Congress in the early 1980s, but new annual appropriations are now needed for renewals. In FY2011, over $9 billion was requested for project-based rental assistance, a 10% increase from the previous year. This funding is intended to cover all contracts requiring funding and renew expiring contracts. HUD requested over $9 billion for project-based rental assistance in FY2011, a 10% increase from the previous year. The funding was intended to cover all contracts requiring funding and renew expiring contracts. The President's FY2011 budget also included $350 million for a new \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative. The President's FY2011 budget requested $350 million for a new \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative aimed at streamlining HUD's rental assistance programs and increasing residential mobility options for HUD-assisted tenants. This initiative would transfer HUD-assisted housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility, similar to the Section 8 program. The goal is to transfer 300,000 units, including public housing properties. The President's budget aims to transfer 300,000 housing units to a new form of project-based rental assistance with tenant mobility. Three categories of properties are targeted for transfer: public housing properties owned by local PHAs, public and multifamily housing properties owned by PHAs willing to combine administrative activities, and multifamily properties with old forms of rental assistance. Most of the funding requested would cover the cost difference between current subsidy streams and the new, presumably higher, subsidy level. The President's budget requests $360 million for a new project-based rental assistance program. The funding would cover the cost difference between current subsidy streams and the new subsidy level. Legislation called the Preservation, Enhancement, and Transformation of Rental Assistance Act has been proposed, but funding for the initiative was not included in the final FY2011 appropriations law. Committees expressed concerns about the proposal's unknown future costs. The public housing program, established in 1937, provides rental units for low-income families. Congress funds over 3,100 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) that maintain 1.2 million units. HUD offers operating funds to cover maintenance costs and capital funds for large projects. HOPE VI grants support the redevelopment of distressed public housing, aiming to create mixed-income communities. Funding for the Transforming Rental Assistance initiative was not included in the final FY2011 appropriations law. HUD provides funding to PHAs for capital projects and modernization needs. HOPE VI grant program helps redevelop distressed public housing to create mixed-income communities. The President's FY2011 budget requested increased funding for the Public Housing operating fund and decreased funding for the capital fund. The decrease in capital funding accounts for previous capital funding received and aims to allow more capital funds to be spent on capital needs. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed funding the operating fund at the President's request. The Administration aims to allocate up to 20% of capital funding for operating expenses to prioritize capital needs. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed funding the operating fund at the President's request, with additional funds for the capital fund. The Senate bill included a set-aside for early childhood education in public housing, while H.R. 1 proposed cuts to both the capital and operating funds. The final FY2011 funding law funded the capital fund higher than H.R. 1 but lower than FY2010, and the operating fund slightly less than H.R. 1. PHAs may offset reduced operating fund appropriations with program reserves. The FY2011 appropriations law funded the capital fund higher than H.R. 1 but less than FY2010, and the operating fund at about $10 million less than H.R. 1. The President's budget proposed no new funding for HOPE VI, instead requesting $250 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, which aims to revitalize distressed neighborhoods. Funding is open to PHAs, local governments, nonprofits, and for-profit developers for the transformation of HUD public and assisted housing. The funding for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative is open to various organizations for the transformation of HUD public and assisted housing. In FY2010, $200 million was provided for the HOPE VI account, with $65 million set aside for Choice Neighborhoods. In FY2011, different funding allocations were proposed by the House and Senate, with H.R. 5850 allocating $200 million for HOPE VI and S. 3644 allocating $250 million for Choice Neighborhoods. The House Financial Services Committee authorized the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative in the Public Housing Reinvestment and Tenant Protection Act of 2010. In March 2010, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing on the topic. The Public Housing Reinvestment and Tenant Protection Act of 2010 (H.R. 5814) was ordered reported on July 27, 2010, which included authorization for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. However, H.R. 1 proposed no funding for either HOPE VI or Choice Neighborhoods. The final FY2011 funding law (P.L. 112-10) provided just under $100 million for HOPE VI, with a $65 million set-aside from FY2010. The majority of HOPE VI funding may be used for Choice Neighborhoods in FY2011. The Housing Trust Fund, created in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-289), aims to provide a permanent source of funding for affordable housing, with contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as the dedicated funding source. The Housing Trust Fund, established in P.L. 110-289, aimed to provide affordable housing grants funded by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. However, their contributions were suspended in 2008, leaving the fund without funding. The President's FY2011 budget requested $1 billion for the Housing Trust Fund, but no source was identified. Congress did not provide funding in FY2010 either. The Housing Trust Fund was not funded in the FY2010 and FY2011 appropriations laws, despite proposals in the 111th Congress. The Transformation Initiative, aimed at strengthening HUD's research and technology capacities, was first proposed in President Obama's FY2010 budget request. The Transformation Initiative aims to strengthen HUD's research and technology capacities through funding for research, program demonstrations, technical assistance, and information technology. In FY2010, $20 million was appropriated for addressing mortgage fraud, with the authority to transfer up to 1% from HUD's budget to the transformation fund. In FY2011, a $20 million appropriation was requested again for combating mortgage fraud, with a potential transfer authority of almost $470 million. The Transformation Initiative received a $20 million appropriation for combating mortgage fraud and a 1% transfer authority. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included the $20 million for fraud prevention but limited the transfer authority. The House and Senate bills proposed limits on fund allocation, focusing on core department needs. The Transformation Initiative is seen as more than just budget flexibility, with a focus on core department needs. The Committee limited the use of Transformation Initiative funds to core Department needs and emphasized oversight. The final FY2011 appropriations law included $71 million for modernizing FHA's systems and Section 8 voucher programs. HUD was granted transfer authority under the initiative but from a limited number of accounts. The FY2011 appropriations law included $71 million for modernizing FHA's systems and Section 8 voucher programs, with limited transfer authority granted to HUD under the transformation initiative. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed various community development initiatives, including restructuring the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program and eliminating funding for certain earmarked programs. Additionally, new initiatives such as Catalytic Competition Grants and the Sustainable Communities Initiative were introduced. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed reducing funding for Community Development Fund activities, defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants to fund Sustainable Communities Initiative and University Community Fund. A new initiative, Catalytic Investments Competition Grants, was introduced to support economic development projects in distressed communities. No new funding was requested for the Brownfields Economic Development Initiative Account. The President's budget for FY2011 proposed reducing funding for Community Development Fund activities, defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants to fund Sustainable Communities Initiative and University Community Fund. A new initiative, Catalytic Investments Competition Grants, was introduced to support economic development projects in distressed communities. The House bill recommended a $4.382 billion appropriation for CDF activities, including $89.3 million for congressional earmarked funds for EDI and NI projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill recommended a $4.450 billion appropriation for CDF activities, with funding for EDI and NI congressional earmarked projects. Both bills recommended continued funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and University Community Fund. The final FY2011 appropriations law, P.L. 112-10, appropriated $3.501 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF) account, which is a reduction from previous years. Funding for various initiatives such as the Sustainable Communities Initiative and University Community Fund remained at FY2010 levels, while a new proposed initiative, Catalytic Investments Competition Grants, did not receive funding. The CDF account supports activities through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. The FY2011 appropriations law reduced funding for the Community Development Fund (CDF) account by 33%. The CDF supports activities through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, which is a significant federal financial assistance source for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development. CDBG formula funds were awarded to various entities in 2010, and can be used for activities benefiting low- and moderate-income individuals, eliminating slums or blight, or achieving other national objectives. The CDBG assistance program may be used to fund activities benefiting low- and moderate-income individuals, eliminating slums or blight, or addressing public health and safety threats. The FY2011 budget proposed freezing funding at over $3.9 billion, with additional funding for Sustainable Communities Initiatives, Catalytic Competition Grants, and Indian tribes. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed modestly higher funding levels for the CDBG program compared to the President's request. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing the CDF account by 66.3% below FY2010 funding levels. The bill prohibited funds for earmarks and the Sustainable Communities Initiative. Allocation instructions for the CDBG program were not included in the bill. The final FY2011 appropriations law allocated $3.508 billion for activities in the CDF account, with $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. A 0.2% mandatory cut reduced the CDF account to $3.501 billion, and a 1% discretionary transfer moved $35 million to HUD's Transformation Initiative. The Administration requested $148.5 million for a new economic development initiative in distressed areas. The Administration requested $148.5 million for a new initiative supporting economic development projects in distressed areas through the Catalytic Competition Grants Program. Unlike CDBG funds, the CCG program would award funds competitively for various projects including green infrastructure, economic recovery, transit-oriented development, and support for small businesses. Neither the House-passed nor the Senate Committee-passed bills included funding for this initiative. The Administration requested $148.5 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to fund economic activities supporting transit-oriented development, assist small- and medium-sized businesses in targeted neighborhoods, and cover administrative costs. The SCI appropriations are to be used for Regional Integrated Planning Grants in collaboration with various federal agencies. Neither H.R. 1 nor the final FY2011 appropriations law appropriated funds for this proposal. The Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) collaborates with federal agencies to award grants for sustainable development in metropolitan areas. Grants range from $500,000 to $3 million for housing, transportation, energy, and land use planning. Community Challenge Grants (CCGs) aim to reform building codes and zoning ordinances with grants not exceeding $2 million. Housing-Transportation Integration Research is also funded under SCI. The Administration proposed various initiatives under the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI), including Community Challenge Grants (CCGs) not to exceed $2 million. Funding was requested for Housing-Transportation Integration Research and Capacity Building Program. Congress appropriated $40 million for CCGs in FY2010 and $10 million for research efforts. The Administration proposed initiatives under the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to improve technical capacity. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 recommended continued funding at $148.5 million. $25 million was set aside for Regional Integrated Planning Grants for metropolitan areas under 500,000 population. Both bills also suggested $25 million for the Rural Innovation Fund to assist in addressing housing and poverty-related issues, with $5 million set aside for rural Indian tribes. The bills proposed funding for housing and poverty-related issues, including $5 million for rural Indian tribes. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows states and communities to use their CDBG allocations as collateral for redevelopment activities. Funding for SCI activities in FY2011 was reduced by 33% compared to FY2010. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows CDBG entitlement communities and states to borrow up to five times their annual CDBG allocations for qualifying activities, with future allocations pledged as security. The Administration proposed doubling the loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2011 to help finance large-scale projects. Additionally, a fee-based assessment was suggested to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. The Administration proposed doubling the loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2011 for the Section 108 loan guarantee program. Congress rejected this proposal and maintained the program as currently structured. H.R. 5850 recommended a loan commitment ceiling of $427 million with a credit subsidy of $10 million, while S. 3644 recommended a ceiling of $275 million with a subsidy of $6.4 million. P.L. 112-10 continued the program at the FY2011 commitment level of $275 million with a credit subsidy of $5.988 million. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposed redesigning the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program. The capacity building program would provide technical assistance and funds to housing and community development organizations through national intermediaries. The Administration's budget request aimed to increase funding by $10 million to $60 million and establish the program as a stand-alone account. Grant funds would be competitively awarded to intermediaries with expertise in the field. The Administration's proposal aimed to establish a capacity building program as a stand-alone account, with grant funds competitively awarded to national and regional intermediaries with expertise in housing and community development. The intermediaries would provide technical and financial assistance to CDCs, CHDOs, and local governments for training, education, loans, grants, market research, and organizational assessments. Successful grantees would need to meet a 3:1 match from private sector sources. The proposed capacity building program aimed to provide grant funds to national and regional intermediaries for technical and financial assistance to CDCs, CHDOs, and local governments. Grantees were required to meet a 3:1 match from private sector sources. The House-passed and Senate Committee-passed bills did not include funding for this initiative, but recommended continuing funding for capacity building activities through existing programs like SHOP. HUD provides grants through the SHOP program to organizations experienced in self-help homeownership. Prospective homebuyers contribute \"sweat equity\" with volunteer assistance. The program also funds capacity building for community development and the Housing Assistance Council, supporting rural housing needs. The President's FY2011 budget did not allocate funds to SHOP, suggesting the use of HOME Investment Partnerships Program grants instead. The FY2011 budget did not include funding for the SHOP account, suggesting the use of HOME Investment Partnerships Program grants instead. However, $82 million was allocated for SHOP in H.R. 5850 and S. 3644, including $27 million for SHOP itself, $50 million for capacity building, and $5 million for HAC. Funding for these activities in FY2011 was $81.8 million, maintaining the FY2010 levels. In FY2011, funding for account activities remained at FY2010 levels, totaling $81.8 million. This included $26.9 million for SHOP, $49.9 million for Section 4 Capacity Building, and $4.9 million for the Housing Assistance Council. HUD also planned to transfer $818,360 to the Transformation Initiative account. Through the Housing Counseling Assistance Program, HUD provides grants to approved agencies for various counseling services. Congress has increased funding for this program annually. The Housing Counseling Assistance Program provides various counseling services, including pre-purchase homeownership counseling, post-purchase homeownership counseling, mortgage delinquency counseling, and counseling for renters, the homeless, or seniors seeking reverse mortgages. Funding for the program has increased in recent years due to concerns about mortgage default and foreclosure rates. In FY2011, the President's budget requested $88 million for the program, and Congress proposed $100 million in S. 3644, an increase from previous years. In FY2011, Congress proposed $100 million for HUD housing counseling assistance, an increase of $12 million over the President's budget. However, the final appropriations law eliminated funding for this program, leading to a significant decrease from previous years. Critics argue that HUD housing counseling funding overlaps with the NeighborWorks National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program, but HUD funding offers a wider range of counseling services. Additionally, there have been concerns about the slow distribution of housing counseling grants by HUD. Congress has appropriated separate funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling to NeighborWorks America instead of HUD since FY2008. NeighborWorks, an independent nonprofit corporation, received $180 million in FY2008 for mortgage foreclosure counseling activities, in addition to its regular annual appropriation of just under $120 million. NeighborWorks received $180 million in FY2008 for mortgage foreclosure counseling activities, in addition to its regular annual appropriation. Funding for the NFMCP has varied over the years, with the President's budget requesting $113 million in FY2011. S. 3644 included $125 million for the NFMCP, $12 million more than the President's request. The final FY2011 appropriations law did not make any changes to the funding. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) maintained funding for the NFMCP at $65 million, with housing counseling agencies supporting foreclosure prevention initiatives like HAMP. Recipients of NFMCP funding can use up to 30% of their grants to counsel borrowers with high debt-to-income ratios eligible for HAMP. The NFMCP provides funding for housing counseling agencies to support foreclosure prevention initiatives like HAMP. Recipients can use up to 30% of their grants to counsel borrowers eligible for HAMP. Additionally, NAHBGs are formula-based grants for Indian tribes to provide housing assistance to low-income American Indian and Alaskan Native households, with set-asides for technical assistance and loan guarantees. In FY2010, Congress allocated $700 million for the NAHBG account, including funds for general technical assistance, training, and loan guarantees. In FY2010, $700 million was allocated for the NAHBG account, including funds for general technical assistance, training, and loan guarantees. The President's FY2011 budget requested $580 million for Native American Housing Block Grants, with no set-asides for technical assistance or the National American Indian Housing Council. The final FY2011 appropriations law provided nearly $650 million to this account, over $50 million below the FY2010 enacted level but nearly $70 million higher than the President's FY2011 budget request. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) allocated nearly $650 million to the NAHBG account, which was over $50 million below the FY2010 level but almost $70 million higher than the President's FY2011 request. The law also maintained set-asides at FY2010 levels, excluding a 0.2% rescission. The FY2011 Budget Resolution established spending and revenue parameters for Congress to consider legislation, providing allocations to House and Senate committees for the 12 regular appropriations bills. The House and Senate budget committees began considering the FY2011 budget resolution, receiving input from various sources. The Senate Budget Committee reported a budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 60) but no further action was taken. The House adopted a budget enforcement resolution (H.Res. 1493) to establish spending levels for the House Appropriations Committee. The Senate did not agree on enforceable spending allocations for its committee. In 2010, the House adopted a budget enforcement resolution (H.Res. 1493) to set spending levels for the House Appropriations Committee. The Senate did not agree on enforceable spending allocations for its committee but released \"subcommittee spending guidance\" for FY2011 regular appropriations bills. The Dodd-Frank Act included $1 billion in mandatory funding for the Community Development Fund for a third round of Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) grants, with funds becoming available on October 1, 2010. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 provided $100 million for CDBG disaster relief funding for areas affected by severe storms and flooding from March 2010 through May 2010. HUD was authorized to provide up to $1 billion in mortgage assistance for homeowners at risk of foreclosure due to income decrease. The Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-212) allocated $100 million for CDBG disaster relief funding for areas affected by severe storms and flooding from March to May 2010. This emergency funding was provided in FY2010 for areas declared major disasters under the Stafford Act. For more information on CDBG disaster recovery assistance, refer to CRS Report RL33330."
