    "content": "During the Vietnam War, Operation Ranch Hand sprayed millions of gallons of herbicides, including Agent Orange, over southern Vietnam. The herbicides contained TCDD, a toxic carcinogen. Dioxin \"hot spots\" have been identified in areas like Bien Hoa, Danang, and the A Luoi Valley. The environmental damage and health issues caused by Agent Orange have prompted a response from the U.S. The A Luoi Valley was heavily sprayed with herbicides during the Vietnam War. The U.S. is addressing the environmental damage and health problems caused by Agent Orange in Vietnam, which has helped improve bilateral relations. President Obama pledged to assist in removing unexploded landmines, bombs, and dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa Air Base. The joint effort with Vietnam to clean up dioxin at Danang Airport is nearly complete. The United States has successfully completed the first phase of dioxin remediation at Danang International Airport, with the final phase ongoing. They are committed to partnering with Vietnam to clean up dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa Air Base. The Trump Administration continues to provide assistance to address the Agent Orange/dioxin issue. Both countries are working together on war legacy issues, including dioxin remediation, and have made progress at Da Nang Airport. A Memorandum of Intent was signed in January 2018 to begin dioxin decontamination at Bien Hoa. The completion of environmental remediation at Danang Airport was celebrated by Shannon and Senior Lieutenant General Nguyen Phuong Nam. A Memorandum of Intent was signed in January 2018 to start dioxin decontamination at Bien Hoa. Congress has allocated $254.8 million for Agent Orange/dioxin remediation and health programs in Vietnam. The legislation has separate funds for remediation and health programs, with more allocated for remediation. The actual amount available for assistance may be less due to provisions in the Foreign Assistance Act. The 115th Congress authorized the transfer of funds for the Bien Hoa dioxin cleanup in Vietnam. Funds are taken from the Department of Defense's account and allocated under the State Department's Economic Support Fund and Development Assistance accounts. The State Department has delegated responsibility for the funds to USAID for administration and obligation. The State Department has delegated funds for environmental remediation efforts in Vietnam to USAID. Cleanup at Danang airport has been completed, with plans for joint dioxin removal at Bien Hoa airbase. Discussions are ongoing regarding health and disability issues related to dioxin exposure. Programs are administered by State Department, USAID, and Vietnamese government agencies. Vietnam's central government established Office 33 to address Agent Orange/Dioxin consequences. The State Department and USAID, along with various Vietnamese government ministries and agencies, work together on Agent Orange and dioxin issues. Office 33, an interministerial body, oversees Vietnam's policy on these matters. Congressional interest focuses on allocating funds for environmental remediation and health programs in affected areas, as well as overseeing the effectiveness of State Department and USAID actions. The State Department and USAID, in collaboration with Vietnamese government agencies, address Agent Orange and dioxin issues. Congressional attention is on funding for environmental remediation and health programs in affected areas, as well as oversight of fund allocation and expenditure. The 110th Congress allocated $3 million for dioxin remediation and health programs in Vietnam, with USAID handling the administration of funds. The State Department, in collaboration with USAID, allocated a total of $18 million for dioxin cleanup and health services in Vietnam. The 111th Congress passed multiple pieces of legislation to provide funding, including $3 million in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, $3 million in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, and $12 million in the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010. Additionally, $1.9 million was allocated for environmental remediation at Danang airport in FY2010. The 113th Congress continued to appropriate funds for environmental remediation of Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam and related health services, with allocations in various Acts such as P.L. 113-6 and P.L. 113-46. USAID was directed to develop a comprehensive plan for Agent Orange-related activities in Vietnam within 180 days after the enactment of the law. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76) allocated funds for environmental remediation and health programs in areas affected by Agent Orange in Vietnam. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) specified funds for dioxin contaminated sites and health/disability activities in Vietnam. Funds allocated under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 for environmental remediation and health programs in Vietnam, including areas affected by Agent Orange. Specifically, funds are provided for health/disability activities in areas sprayed with Agent Orange or contaminated with dioxin, with allocations for environmental remediation and health programs in Vietnam. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 allocated funds for environmental remediation and health programs in Vietnam, focusing on areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin contamination. Specifically, funds were designated for addressing the needs of individuals with severe mobility impairments and cognitive disabilities. The Committee emphasized the importance of implementing health/disability funds through Vietnamese organizations to maximize impact. Additionally, a portion of the funds were earmarked for dioxin remediation activities in Vietnam. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 allocated funds for environmental remediation and health programs in Vietnam, focusing on areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin contamination. Specifically, funds were designated for addressing the needs of individuals with severe mobility impairments and cognitive disabilities. The Act provided not less than $20 million for activities related to the remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and health and disability programs in affected areas. In March 2018, the 115th Congress allocated funds for remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and health programs for individuals with disabilities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided not less than $20 million for these activities and assistance for the Government of Vietnam. In February 2019, the 116th Congress continued funding with not less than $20 million for remediation efforts and $12.5 million for health programs in affected areas. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 and the 116th Congress allocated funds for remediation of dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and health programs for individuals with disabilities. USAID has obligated a significant portion of the appropriated funds for environmental remediation and health- and disability-related services in Vietnam. The manner in which USAID has obligated the funds has been a concern for Congress. Since FY2007, USAID has obligated $20.3 million for environmental remediation and health- and disability-related services in Vietnam. Congress has raised concerns about the pace of utilization and types of programs funded, particularly for health and disability services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas. Appropriations have been designated for these specific activities since FY2007. Since FY2007, USAID has allocated $20.3 million for environmental remediation and health- and disability-related services in Vietnam. Congress has expressed concerns about the utilization and types of programs funded, especially for health and disability services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas. Appropriations have been designated for these activities since FY2007, with specific amounts allocated in various fiscal years. Since FY2007, USAID has allocated funds for health and disability programs in Vietnam, with a shift to smaller direct program funding starting in FY2014. The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport has been a key focus since 2008. The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport in Vietnam, funded by congressional appropriations related to Agent Orange/dioxin, experienced delays, increased material for decontamination, and rising costs. The project, initiated in 2008, aimed to complete by October 2013 but was finished in August 2017, with costs escalating from $33.7 million to over $110 million. Soil at the airport had high levels of \"TCDD toxic equivalents,\" reaching 365 parts per billion. The joint military/civilian airport in Danang had high levels of \"TCDD toxic equivalents\" in the soil, exceeding international standards. A project initiated in 2009 aimed at environmental health and remediation programs, with USAID and Office 33 as implementing agencies. The project included a grant for dioxin containment design at Danang airport. USAID completed an Environmental Assessment in 2010 recommending thermal desorption for remediation. In June 2010, USAID completed an Environmental Assessment of Danang airport recommending thermal desorption for decontamination of contaminated material. The project aimed to remediate 61,700 m3 of material in six hotspots at the airport, with an estimated cost of $33.7 million. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a Memorandum of Intent in December 2010 to start the project in 2011 and complete it by October 2013. USAID awarded contracts for the environmental remediation in July 2012 to CDM Smith. In April 2011, MND approved the project. USAID issued an RFP in May 2011 and awarded contracts in July 2012 to CDM Smith and Tetra Tech for the environmental remediation of Danang airport. The project officially started on August 20, 2012. An internal audit in November 2014 revealed six contracts awarded for the project, including thermal desorption of contaminated soil in two phases. The thermal desorption of contaminated soil at Danang airport was done in two phases, with Phase 1 starting in April 2014 and Phase 2 in January 2015. The project was delayed due to weather and additional soil testing revealing more contamination than estimated. The excavation and construction progress at Danang airport was hindered by weather conditions from September to December. More soil and sediment than expected needed decontamination after drainage of small lakes. The secondary treatment facility was closed in July 2014 for a filter system change. Raising the soil temperature to 335\u00b0C took longer than planned. An audit by USAID's Office of Inspector General in November 2014 highlighted risks like inclement weather and soil cooling delays. The audit recommended implementing a formal risk management plan, providing accurate performance data, fulfilling training obligations, and improving data documentation. The completion of the Danang Airport environmental remediation project took longer and cost more than initially projected by USAID due to underestimating contamination. USAID utilized funds for health/disability activities in areas contaminated with dioxin as part of its program. The dioxin contamination in Danang was deeper than expected, leading to delays and increased costs in the remediation project. USAID has provided over $60 million in assistance to disabled Vietnamese, including funds for health services near contaminated sites. State Department and USAID utilized funds for grants to improve the quality of life for persons with disabilities in Danang between FY2007 and FY2010. In 2012, USAID approved a three-year nationwide Persons with Disability Support Program (PDSP) to be jointly implemented with Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) and Vietnam Assistance for the Handicapped (VNAH) in Danang and other high-need areas. The program aimed to build on previous accomplishments and included public health activities. Funding for PDSP was initially set at $9 million. The PDSP program, funded at $9 million, aimed to assist persons with disabilities in high-need areas like Bien Hoa and Phu Cat. DAI awarded grants for health services, therapy, training, and awareness. USAID supported VNAH in addressing disability policy needs in Vietnam. The program expanded to provinces heavily affected by Agent Orange, not just identified \"hot spots.\" According to the Aspen Institute, three provinces heavily sprayed with Agent Orange during the Vietnam War - Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, and Thua Thien-Hue - have not been identified as \"hot spots.\" USAID awarded nearly US$900,000 in grants to local partners and organizations. In June 2014, USAID adopted a new approach to assisting persons with disabilities in Vietnam, aiming to improve health, independence, and participation in economic and social life. This includes providing therapies and training to practitioners in target areas. USAID will finance therapies for persons with disabilities in high-prevalence, high-poverty areas in Vietnam. The provinces of Binh Dinh, Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, Thai Binh, and Thua Thien-Hue are targeted. USAID is working with Vietnamese agencies to administer the program. A cleanup of the dioxin \"hot spot\" at Bien Hoa airbase is being explored after the completion of the Danang airport cleanup. Soil samples from Bien Hoa show high levels of dioxin contamination. The Bien Hoa airbase in Vietnam, a site of extensive herbicide storage and use during the war, has high levels of dioxin contamination. Mitigation measures have been taken, including the creation of a passive landfill for contaminated soil. However, other dioxin \"hot spots\" remain unaddressed, with contaminated soil spreading into nearby water bodies. The United Nations Development Programme is working on a master plan for dioxin remediation at the airbase. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been working with Office 33 and MONRE for five years to map out dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa airbase. An estimated 408,500 to 495,300 m3 of contaminated soils and sediments are located on or nearby the airbase, requiring treatment. Five different treatment methods were considered, with costs ranging from $137 million to $794 million. The estimated costs for environmental remediation at Bien Hoa Airbase range from $137 million to $794 million, with potential variations of 40% less to 75% more. Over $3.7 million has been allocated for assessment, and construction work with a budget of $11.8 million has begun for dioxin decontamination. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence have signed a memorandum of intent to start the decontamination process. On January 23, 2018, USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum of intent to decontaminate Bien Hoa airport. The agreement commits the two nations to work together on a remediation program for the airport, with a five-year, $183 million aid agreement signed in May 2018. The project is estimated to take 10 years and decontaminate 500,000 cubic meters of soil. In September 2018, a memorandum of understanding was signed with the Japanese contractor, Shimizu Corporation, to construct a decontamination factory at the airport. The Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum with Shimizu Corporation to build a decontamination factory at Bien Hoa airport. The factory will use a new technique to decontaminate soil and is expected to be more cost-effective than previous methods. U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited the airport and expressed America's commitment to remediate past issues. Congressional interest in providing assistance for environmental damage and health effects of dioxin contamination in Vietnam remains a focus. Congressional interest in Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam has focused on providing assistance for environmental damage and health effects, oversight of State Department and USAID utilization of funds, and funding for decontamination projects. The State Department regularly requests funding for decontamination of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam, with Congress generally appropriating funds for health and disability services in affected areas. Programs for persons with disabilities have been conducted near known Agent Orange \"hot spots.\" The State Department and USAID have utilized funds for programs for persons with disabilities near Agent Orange \"hot spots.\" President Obama's budget did not include specific funding for health and disability assistance in contaminated areas. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 designates funds for health and disability services in areas sprayed with Agent Orange/dioxin. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 provides assistance for individuals with severe mobility impairment or cognitive disabilities. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 (H.R. 326) aims to provide assistance for individuals affected by exposure to Agent Orange, including Vietnamese residents with health issues related to their exposure between 1961 and 1975. The Act directs the Secretary of State to offer health care services, vocational training, and housing assistance to those impacted by Agent Orange. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 aims to provide assistance for individuals affected by exposure to Agent Orange between 1961 and 1975. The Act directs the Secretary of State to offer health care services, vocational training, and housing assistance to those impacted by Agent Orange, including repairing substandard homes in Vietnam and supporting research on health issues related to Agent Orange exposure. Section 8 of the Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 requires quarterly reports from the Secretaries of State, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs on the implementation of the Act. Congressional oversight focuses on funding for environmental remediation and health services in Agent Orange-contaminated areas in Vietnam, including concerns about the cost of cleanup at Danang airport and the pace of health service provision by USAID. The estimated total cost of environmental remediation at Danang airport increased from $33.7 million in 2010 to $116 million, with concerns about cost overruns. USAID has faced challenges in utilizing funds for health services in Agent Orange-contaminated areas, with only 63.5% of funds from FY2011 to FY2017 being obligated. USAID has faced challenges in utilizing funds for health services in Agent Orange-contaminated areas. Observers question the effectiveness of the funds and whether they align with congressional priorities. Congress has included language in legislation indicating appropriations for environmental remediation and health services in Vietnam, with specific amounts often detailed in accompanying reports or statements. Funds for environmental remediation and health services in Vietnam are appropriated with specific amounts detailed in accompanying reports or statements."
