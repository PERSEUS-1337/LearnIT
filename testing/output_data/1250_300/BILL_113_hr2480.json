The Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2013 aims to address the high number of musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare workers, particularly nurses and nursing assistants, caused by patient lifting and transferring. These injuries lead to chronic back pain and high rates of nurses leaving the profession, impacting both employee health and patient safety. The development of assistive patient handling technology has significantly reduced injuries among healthcare workers, leading to positive results in health care facilities. This technology has made manual patient handling outdated and unnecessary, improving patient safety during lifting, transferring, and repositioning. Incorporated patient handling technology and practices have led to a significant decrease in injuries among nursing staff and healthcare workers. Implementing safe patient handling technology, equipment, devices, and practices has resulted in a decline in lost work days due to injury and staff turnover. Studies show that assistive patient handling technology reduces workers' compensation costs for musculoskeletal disorders. Several states have adopted safe patient handling standards, demonstrating the success and feasibility of such programs. Establishing a standard for safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention is crucial for protecting healthcare workers' health and safety, addressing the nursing shortage, and enhancing patient safety. Implementing safe patient handling technology is crucial for protecting the health and safety of nurses and other healthcare workers, addressing the nursing shortage, and increasing patient safety. The text chunk discusses the Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard. It outlines the application of this standard to facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The Secretary of Labor must establish an interim final standard on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The standard aims to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for healthcare workers, with a final standard to be issued within 2 years. It mandates the use of engineering controls and technology to minimize manual patient handling injuries. The standard on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention requires healthcare employers to develop a program using mechanical technology and devices to minimize manual handling injuries. It includes hazard identification, risk assessments, and control measures within 6 months of the final standard's promulgation. The final standard on safe patient handling requires healthcare employers to implement a program including hazard identification, risk assessments, and control measures. It also mandates the purchase and management of safe patient handling equipment within 2 years, and involves health care worker participation in program development. The safe patient handling program requires healthcare employers to purchase technology and equipment for injury prevention. Employers must establish a data tracking and review program to analyze implementation and make findings available upon request. Additionally, employers must consider incorporating technology into facilities. The safe patient handling program mandates healthcare employers to train workers on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, technology, equipment, and devices. Training should be conducted initially and annually, preparing workers to identify and control musculoskeletal hazards. The safe patient handling program requires healthcare employers to provide training on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention. Training must be conducted by knowledgeable individuals in an interactive simulated format reflecting the specific demands of healthcare workers' duties. Employers must also post a notice explaining safe patient handling standards, policies, training, reporting procedures for injuries, and healthcare workers' rights under the Act. Additionally, employers are required to conduct an annual written evaluation. The annual evaluation of the safe patient handling program includes assessing handling procedures, technology, equipment, injuries, and new technology. Health care employers must involve nurses, other workers, and their representatives in the evaluation process. Workers have the right to refuse unsafe assignments. The Secretary of Labor conducts unscheduled inspections to ensure compliance with safe patient handling standards, including the right for healthcare workers to refuse unsafe assignments if they pose a risk to their health or safety. The Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard applies to facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The Social Security Act is amended to include safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards in healthcare facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The amendments will apply one year after the final standard is issued. SEC. 4. NONPREEMPTION. This Act does not preempt state laws unless they conflict with this Act. It also does not diminish state authority to enact laws protecting employees. Rights of health care workers under federal and state laws are retained. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"direct-care registered nurse,\" \"employee,\" \"employment,\" \"handling,\" and \"health care employer.\" The term \"health care worker\" refers to individuals assigned by a health care employer to engage in patient handling, including direct-care registered nurses and other health care workers with specialized training in safe patient handling practices. The term \"lift team\" refers to health care workers with specialized training in safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention practices and technology."
