The Premier Certified Lenders Program (PCLP) has been successful in helping small businesses expand. Increasing the number of premier certified lenders will provide more resources to small businesses. Requiring lenders to maintain large loss reserve accounts is inefficient and limits their ability to serve more businesses. Lenders should maintain loss reserve accounts based on the risk associated with the loan portfolio. Premier certified lenders in the PCLP should maintain loss reserve accounts based on the risk of loss associated with their loan portfolio. This change will protect taxpayers and enhance the program's support for small businesses in economic development. SEC. 3. ALTERNATIVE LOSS RESERVE FOR CERTAIN PREMIER CERTIFIED LENDERS. SEC. 3 amends Section 508(c) of the Small Business Investment Act to allow qualified high loss reserve PCLs to elect an alternative loss reserve in lieu of certain requirements. Contributions to the loss reserve are not required for companies making this election. The amendment allows qualified high loss reserve PCLs to elect an alternative loss reserve to protect the Federal Government from the risk of loss associated with their portfolio of PCLP loans. The company must ensure the loss reserve is at least $25,000 and sufficient as determined by a third-party auditor. The term 'qualified high loss reserve PCL' refers to a premier certified lender with a loss reserve of at least $25,000, a risk analysis process for PCLP loans, and third-party auditor certification. A qualified high loss reserve PCL must have a certified auditor confirm the adequacy of its loss reserve to protect the Federal Government from potential loan losses. This requirement applies to premier certified lenders with a loss reserve of at least $25,000 and a risk analysis process for PCLP loans. The text discusses the definition of a PCLP loan and the meaning of a calendar quarter for loan purposes. Additionally, a conforming amendment is made to the Small Business Investment Act of 1958."
