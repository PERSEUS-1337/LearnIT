    "content": "Predicting structured outputs like semantic segmentation requires expensive per-pixel annotations for training convolutional neural networks. To address the challenge of generalizing to new domains without annotations, a domain adaptation method is proposed. This method involves learning discriminative feature representations of patches based on label histograms in the source domain and using an adversarial learning scheme to align feature distributions between source and target patches. The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation and is validated through experiments on various benchmark datasets. Recent deep learning-based methods have shown significant progress in vision tasks like object recognition and semantic segmentation. Domain adaptation methods have been developed to bridge the gap between annotated training data and unlabelled target domains. While there have been advancements in domain adaptation for image classification, there is still room for improvement in pixel-level prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation. Annotating ground truth for pixel-level predictions is costly, making domain adaptation crucial for tasks like road-scene image analysis in different cities with varying appearance distributions. Domain adaptation is essential for pixel-level predictions due to the high cost of annotating ground truth. Existing methods align distributions between source and target domains using adversarial learning, but global statistics may differ significantly. Instead of global alignment, matching patches shared across domains regardless of location can reduce misalignment bias during adaptation. The text discusses the importance of domain adaptation for pixel-level predictions and proposes a method to align patch distributions across domains using adversarial learning. This approach aims to reduce misalignment bias by focusing on shared patches rather than global statistics.

The proposed framework validates global and patch-level alignments, showing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and visual quality. It is noted to be general and applicable to other structured outputs like depth. Contributions include a domain adaptation framework utilizing adversarial learning modules, discriminative representations guided by label histograms, and outperforming baselines on semantic segmentation tasks. Discussions on domain adaptation methods and learning disentangled representations are also included. In this work, domain adaptation methods for image classification and pixel-level prediction tasks are discussed. Various algorithms for learning disentangled representations are also explored. Domain adaptation for image classification involves aligning feature distributions between domains using hand-crafted or deep features. Adversarial learning and Maximum Mean Discrepancy are common techniques used. For structured pixel-level predictions, domain adaptation has been less studied, with some approaches focusing on semantic segmentation for road-scene images. Domain adaptation for structured pixel-level predictions, specifically semantic segmentation for road-scene images, has not been widely studied compared to image classification tasks. Different methods have been proposed, such as using adversarial networks to align global feature representations and applying SVM classifiers to capture label distributions on superpixels. Class-wise domain adversarial alignment and object priors from Google Street View are also utilized for alignment. These methods focus on global distribution alignment and class-specific adaptation. Our proposed domain adaptation method for structured pixel-level predictions in semantic segmentation focuses on learning discriminative representations for patches to aid in patch-level alignment. Unlike existing methods that use global distribution alignment and class-specific priors, our approach preserves structured information at the patch level. Additionally, our framework does not require additional priors or annotations and can be trained end-to-end. This approach differs from output space adaptation methods by emphasizing patch-level representations for alignment. Representation. Learning a latent disentangled space has led to a better understanding for tasks like facial recognition, image generation, and view synthesis. Various approaches use pre-defined factors to learn interpretable representations of images.

The proposed method focuses on learning discriminative patch representations for domain adaptation by clustering patches from the source domain to construct prototypical patch patterns. This involves using ground truth segmentation labels to create a semantically disentangled space of patch representations, guiding patches from the target domain to select the closest cluster regardless of spatial location via an adversarial objective. The method focuses on constructing a semantically disentangled space of patch representations by using label histograms and K-means clustering. A classification module is added to the network to learn discriminative representations, denoted as F_s, for each patch in the input image. The method constructs a clustered space of patch representations using label histograms and K-means clustering. The goal is to align target patches to this space through an adversarial loss, reshaping the data for alignment regardless of spatial location. The method aligns target patches to a clustered space of patch representations using an adversarial loss. This involves reshaping the data for alignment without considering spatial location. The process includes updating the discriminator Dg to distinguish between source and target distributions, updating the discriminator Dl to classify feature representations, and updating the network G and H to push towards the target. The binary cross-entropy loss is used to update the Discriminator Dl to classify feature representations from the source or target domain. The Network G and H are updated to push the target distribution closer to the source distribution. The minimization problem involves supervised and adversarial loss functions, with G being required only during testing. The discriminator Dg uses fully-convolutional layers for classification. The discriminator Dg uses fully-convolutional layers with a spatial map O as input, containing 5 convolution layers with kernel size 4 \u00d7 4, stride 2, and channel numbers {64, 128, 256, 512, 1}. The discriminator Dl utilizes 3 fully-connected layers with leaky ReLU activation and channel numbers {256, 512, 1}. The generator consists of network G with a categorization module H, following the DeepLab-v2 framework with ResNet-101 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet. The proposed architecture uses adaptive average pooling to generate a spatial map with desired receptive fields, followed by two convolution layers to produce a feature map F.

The study involves adapting datasets from different domains and cities for semantic segmentation. Various datasets like GTA5, Cityscapes, SYNTHIA, and Oxford RobotCar are used in the experiments. The evaluation metric used is the intersection-over-union (IoU) ratio. In an ablation study on GTA5-to-Cityscapes scenario, different loss functions and design choices are evaluated using IoU ratio as the metric. Adding disentanglement without alignments improves performance, while combining global and patch-level alignments achieves the highest IoU at 43.2%. Both losses, Ld and Lladv, are necessary for patch-level alignment, as removing either results in a performance loss. In experiments validating patch-level alignment effectiveness, both losses, Ld and Lladv, are crucial. Removing either results in a performance drop of 1.9% and 1.5% respectively. Reshaping features in the clustered space is essential for effective alignment, as shown by a 2.4% drop in IoU without it.
