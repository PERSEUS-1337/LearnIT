    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tar Creek Restoration Act\". It includes findings related to the restoration project. The Tar Creek Superfund Site in Oklahoma was a lead and zinc mining area that operated from the early 1900s to the 1970s. Mining created large amounts of waste tailings and was on Indian land. During World War I, the site supplied a significant portion of the nation's lead and zinc needs. The Tar Creek Superfund Site in Oklahoma supplied over 45% of the Nation's wartime lead and zinc needs. Mining operations created millions of tons of waste tailings, which were recommended to be stockpiled aboveground for later reprocessing. As mining declined in the 1970s, underground mine workings began to fill with water, leading to the formation of acid mine water that started discharging at the surface in 1979. In 1979, acid mine water started discharging at the surface from several locations at the Tar Creek Superfund Site in Oklahoma. The Environmental Protection Agency began remediation efforts in 1984 but concluded in 1994 that it was essentially impossible to remediate the acid mine water due to the presence of open mine shafts and boreholes. The site is scarred with millions of tons of chat laced with toxic heavy metals like lead, contributing to flood problems. The stockpiled chat at the Site is contaminated with heavy metals, including lead, contributing to flood problems and storing water that recharges underground mine workings. It has been used in construction, leading to residential areas being contaminated with heavy metals. The Environmental Protection Agency remediated residential yards with unsafe lead levels in 1994, and studies show elevated blood lead levels in children at the Site. The Site has unsafe lead levels in residential yards, causing elevated blood lead levels in children with associated health issues. Dust from stockpiled chat poses a health risk, and underground cavities lead to cave-ins. No government agency has remediated the chat or subsidence dangers, and the Site cannot be made safe for human habitation. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will provide assistance to residents in the Tar Creek Superfund site area in Oklahoma, including the communities of Picher and Cardin. The EPA will work towards a comprehensive resolution for the environmental and health problems at the site, while maintaining responsibility for cleanup efforts."
