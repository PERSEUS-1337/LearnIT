    "content": "The renewable electricity PTC is a tax credit for electricity generated using qualified energy resources, sold to an unrelated person. The credit can be claimed for 10 years once a qualifying facility is in service. The maximum credit amount varies by year and technology, with wind, closed-loop biomass, and geothermal energy qualifying for the highest amount. Other technologies receive a reduced credit. Construction start dates determine eligibility for the credit. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for renewable electricity is available for facilities that began construction before specific dates. The credit amount varies based on the construction start date, with reductions for later start dates. The PTC is set to phase out once market prices of electricity exceed threshold levels, but this has not happened yet. Before 2018, the PTC was also subject to limitations by the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT). The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for renewable electricity was subject to limitations by the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) before 2018, but this was eliminated in the 2017 tax revision. Taxpayers had the option of claiming the 30% energy investment tax credit (ITC) or an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Section 1603 grant in lieu of tax benefits from 2009 through 2017. Additionally, there are production tax credits for Indian coal and refined coal. The ARRA Section 1603 grant in lieu of tax benefits is available for Indian coal and refined coal production facilities. Indian coal facilities must have been in service before January 1, 2009, to receive credits for coal produced before January 1, 2016. There is no placed-in-service limitation for coal produced and sold after December 31, 2015. The base rate for Indian coal is $2.00 per ton, with an inflation-adjusted credit of $2.4 in 2017. Refined coal facilities must have been in service before January 1, 2012, to qualify for credits, with a base credit amount of $4.375 per ton, and an inflation-adjusted credit of $7.307 per ton in 2018. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was first enacted in 1992 and has been extended 11 times since then. Initially available for wind and closed-loop biomass systems, it was later expanded to include poultry waste and other qualifying technologies. The PTC has been extended through various acts, with modifications made to include new qualifying resources like geothermal energy, solar energy, and municipal solid waste. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) modified the Production Tax Credit (PTC) by adding new qualifying resources such as open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, solar energy, small irrigation power, and municipal solid waste. These new resources were limited to a five-year PTC period, with reduced credit amounts for some facilities. The AJCA also introduced a PTC for refined coal. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended the PTC for most facilities for two years, adding hydropower and Indian coal as qualifying resources. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for most facilities for two years, adding hydropower and Indian coal as qualifying resources. Indian coal could qualify for a credit over a seven-year period, with the credit amount set at $1.50 per ton for the first four years, and $2.00 per ton for the last three years, adjusted for inflation. The PTC was further extended and modified by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, adding new qualifying resources like marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through 2010 for various renewable energy sources, including biomass, geothermal energy, and small irrigation power. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 further extended the PTC for wind through 2012 and other renewable energy technologies through 2013. Additionally, a new credit for steel industry fuel was introduced, with a set amount of $2.00 per barrel-of-oil equivalent. The Act also allowed PTC-eligible taxpayers to opt for a 30% investment tax credit (ITC) instead of the PTC. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind through 2012 and other renewable energy technologies through 2013. It also introduced the Section 1603 grant program, allowing taxpayers to receive a one-time payment in lieu of tax credits. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the Section 1603 grant program through 2011. The PTC for wind was extended through 2013 by the American Taxpayer Relief Act, which also changed the credit expiration date to a construction start date for all qualifying technologies. The PTC and ITC options were retroactively extended through 2014 by the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) were extended through 2014 and 2016 for various renewable energy technologies. The PTC for wind was further extended through 2019, with decreasing credits for facilities starting construction in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Indian coal facilities also received extensions and placed-in-service limitations were removed. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind energy was extended through 2019, with decreasing credits for facilities starting construction in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The PTC for nonwind technologies and Indian coal was also extended for tax year 2017 but will not be available for facilities starting construction after December 31, 2017. Estimated revenue losses associated with the PTC between 2018 and 2022 are $25.8 billion, with most of the losses attributed to wind energy. Between 2018 and 2022, estimated revenue losses associated with the PTC are $25.8 billion, with most of the losses attributed to wind energy. Other PTCs for geothermal, biomass, municipal solid waste, and hydropower also contribute to the revenue losses. Additionally, production credits for refined coal and Indian coal account for $0.1 billion each over the same period. In 2013, 230 corporate taxpayers claimed PTCs totaling $2.8 billion, mainly for renewable electricity production. In 2013, 230 corporate taxpayers claimed PTCs totaling $2.8 billion for renewable electricity production. Taxpayers can carry forward unused credits to offset tax liability in future years. Policy actions in response to the economic downturn affected renewable energy tax credit claims, with fewer taxpayers claiming the PTC after 2009 due to the availability of Section 1603 grants. $15.5 billion in grants was claimed for technologies that would have been PTC-eligible. The economic downturn led to fewer taxpayers claiming the PTC, with $15.5 billion in Section 1603 grants claimed for technologies that could have been PTC-eligible. Tax credit carry forwards doubled during the downturn, indicating less net income to offset with credits. The CBO estimates a permanent PTC for nonwind technologies would reduce revenues by $1.4 billion between 2019 and 2028. The CBO estimates that extending the PTC for nonwind technologies would reduce revenues by $1.4 billion between 2019 and 2028. Extending the Indian Coal Production Credit would reduce revenues by $0.4 billion between 2019 and 2028. Extending the wind construction start date beyond 2019 would reduce federal revenues by an estimated $6.9 billion between 2018 and 2027. The PTC was enacted in 1992 to promote renewable energy sources, and recent extensions reflect a belief that tax incentives drive renewable energy infrastructure development. The PTC tax incentives support renewable energy infrastructure development, driving investment and growth in the wind industry. Further extensions may lead to more investment, but short-term extensions have limitations. Retroactive extensions provide windfall benefits to taxpayers. While the PTC increases the use of renewable electricity, its impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is mixed. Studies show that removing tax credits would result in a small increase in emissions, but recent extensions contribute to emission reductions, especially with low natural gas prices. The recent extensions of tax credits for wind and solar contribute to reduced emissions, especially with low natural gas prices. Government intervention in energy markets is justified due to externalities and market failures caused by pollution. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources are one policy option, but they may not be the most efficient way to address inefficiencies. Subsidies can counter energy conservation efforts and offset emissions reductions. Failures in the energy sector are highlighted, with subsidies being deemed inefficient for achieving policy objectives. They reduce energy costs, counter conservation efforts, and may not incentivize all emissions reduction alternatives equally. Tax subsidies also decrease tax revenues and economic efficiency. A more direct and efficient approach would be a carbon tax, generating revenue to offset other taxes and promote technology neutrality. Tax incentives are not the most efficient way to support renewable energy developers. A carbon tax approach would be more efficient than tax incentives for supporting renewable energy developers. Tax incentives often require outside investors to monetize benefits, reducing direct federal support to the sector. Production-based incentives are more effective in promoting renewable electricity. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) interacts with state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) policies, reducing compliance costs. Without legislative action, the PTC is at risk. More than half of U.S. states have renewable portfolio standards (RPS) in place, with federal subsidies like the Production Tax Credit (PTC) reducing compliance costs. The PTC is set to expire for nonwind projects after 2017 and wind projects after 2019. Options include letting the PTC expire as scheduled or providing a temporary extension with adjusted construction start dates. Congress may extend the PTC for nonwind technologies retroactively for 2018, applying a phaseout similar to wind projects. Congress may choose to extend the PTC for nonwind technologies, potentially retroactively for 2018. Options include applying a phaseout similar to wind projects or removing the phaseout for wind, making all PTC-eligible technologies qualify at the same rate. Chairman Dave Camp proposed a PTC phaseout in 2014, reducing the value of the PTC for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh and fully repealing it after 2024. In 2014, Chairman Camp proposed a phaseout of the PTC, reducing its value to 1.5 cents per kWh for existing facilities. The proposal aimed to raise $9.6 billion in additional federal revenues between 2014 and 2023. President Obama's FY2017 budget suggested making the PTC permanent, adding solar facilities as qualifying property, and allowing renewable electricity consumed by the producer to qualify for tax credits. The ITC for renewable energy would also be made permanent under the proposal. The PTC and ITC for renewable energy would be made permanent under President Obama's FY2017 budget, costing $19.8 billion between 2016 and 2026."
