    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Electricity and Environmental Technology Research and Development Act.\" It includes findings related to the act. Congress finds that reliable, affordable, increasingly clean electricity is crucial for the growing US economy. The increasing use of electrotechnologies, environmental concerns, competitive electricity market, and reliance on coal as the most abundant fossil energy resource are highlighted. Investments in emissions control technology have reduced pollutants from coal-based generating facilities by 21% over the past 30 years. Investments in emissions control technology have reduced pollutants from coal-based generating facilities by 21% over the past 30 years. Continuous improvement in efficiency and environmental performance from electricity generating facilities would allow continued use of coal and preserve energy resources for other uses. New technologies for converting coal into electricity can eliminate health-threatening emissions and improve efficiency by up to 50%. Continued research towards near-zero emissions in coal-based generation is important. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"cost and performance goals\" refers to those established under section 4. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary will assess cost and performance goals for coal technologies in 2007, 2015, and 2020, consulting various stakeholders. The Secretary will establish draft cost and performance goals for advanced coal technologies within 120 days of the Act's enactment, with final goals submitted to Congress within 180 days. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary, in cooperation with other agencies, must report to Congress every 2 years on technologies and costs related to achieving specific goals. Recommendations for technology development programs and additional authorities will also be included in the report. The Secretary, in cooperation with industry, develops technologies to achieve cost and performance goals. Expert advice from representatives of relevant entities is considered. Recommendations for additional authorities are made to achieve goals. The Secretary will conduct a research and development program on coal-based technologies under various Acts to achieve cost and performance goals. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. Authorization of $100,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2012 for sections 4, 5, and 6, with no cap on Department of Energy fossil energy research and development. Additionally, the Clean Coal Power Commercial Applications Initiative is established. The Secretary will establish a clean coal power commercial applications initiative to demonstrate advanced coal-based technologies for new or existing power plants. The technologies must significantly improve efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness. Within 120 days of enactment, a plan outlining program elements, management structure, and technical milestones must be submitted to Congress. The plan must include program elements, management structure, technical milestones for advanced coal-based technologies, and demonstration activities at facilities serving coal-based electric generation units with at least 50 megawatts rating. The activities aim to improve design efficiency by at least 3 percent and enhance environmental performance for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, or mercury control. The plan must include new technologies for enhancing environmental performance related to sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, or mercury control, recycling coal combustion wastes, and capturing carbon dioxide at a lower cost than current technologies. SEC. 9. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. The Secretary must solicit proposals for projects at new or existing facilities to achieve specified performance levels within 180 days of transmitting the plan to Congress. Proposals may include demonstrating efficiency improvements and emission reductions without increasing pollutants. The Secretary must solicit proposals for projects at new or existing facilities to achieve specified performance levels within 180 days of transmitting the plan to Congress. Proposals may include demonstrating efficiency improvements and emission reductions without increasing pollutants. Regarding emissions standards, for coal with high sulfur content, 5% of potential sulfur dioxide emissions are allowed, while for coal with lower sulfur content, 15% of potential emissions are permitted. For nitrogen oxide emissions, different limits apply based on the type of boiler used. The emission levels for pollutants in advanced coal-based technology must meet specified performance levels or new source performance standards under the Clean Air Act. Additionally, coal combustion byproducts produced must have economic value significantly greater than current byproducts without increasing sulfur dioxide emissions. The Secretary will provide financial assistance to projects that reduce coal utilization costs, enhance coal competitiveness for energy diversity, meet specified criteria, and apply to 25% of coal-based electricity facilities. The Secretary will provide financial assistance for projects that demonstrate technologies applicable to 25% of coal-based electricity facilities. The Federal share of project costs shall not exceed 50%. $100,000,000 is authorized annually for fiscal years 2002 through 2012, with alternative funding sources available."
