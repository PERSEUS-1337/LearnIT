    "content": "The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 mandates that federally funded research should be shared and disseminated to advance science and benefit society. The Act defines a \"Federal agency\" as an Executive agency under title 5, United States Code. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 requires Federal agencies with over $100,000,000 in research expenditures to develop a policy for public access to research papers. This policy includes submitting final manuscripts of research papers to the agency, incorporating peer review changes, and providing free online access to the final published version. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 mandates Federal agencies to ensure free online public access to final peer-reviewed manuscripts or published versions within 6 months of publication. It also requires the creation of an online bibliography linking to full-text papers and the long-term preservation of research findings in digital repositories. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 requires Federal agencies to provide free public access to research works meeting specific conditions, including interoperability and long-term preservation. The policy applies to researchers employed or funded by the agency, ensuring public domain works are marked as such and made immediately available. Exclusions include laboratory notes and preliminary data analyses. The Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006 mandates free public access to research works for Federal purposes, excluding certain materials like laboratory notes and classified research. The policy does not apply to works generating revenue for authors or those not submitted to journals. Additionally, it does not affect rights under patent or copyright law. Federal agencies must report on their public access policy annually to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Each Federal agency must submit a report on the effectiveness of the Federal research public access policy to the Senate and House committees, including a list of research papers funded by the agency and made available online. The Federal agency must provide a report on the effectiveness of the research public access policy, including a list of papers available online and the time between publication in a journal and in the agency's online repository, which must be made public on the agency's website."
