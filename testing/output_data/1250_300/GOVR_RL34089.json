    "content": "Both chambers of Congress have passed legislation to reauthorize expiring programs at the FDA and expand its authority. The bills are S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, renewing FDA's authority for key user fee programs. FDA urged Congress to complete reauthorization efforts before August 1, 2007, to avoid layoffs. The agency has used reserve funds to prevent layoffs. The FDA has used reserve funds to avoid layoffs due to funding uncertainty, causing a hiring freeze. The bills reauthorize key user fee programs and address issues related to pediatric pharmaceuticals. FDA regulates the safety of human foods, animal feeds, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, medical devices, and animal drugs. The FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of human foods, animal feeds, cosmetics, drugs, biologics, medical devices, and animal drugs. Products requiring premarket approval must be reviewed and approved by the FDA before being placed in commerce. The agency has the authority to withdraw unsafe products from the market. Congressional attention has been drawn to FDA's performance and funding for its statutory responsibilities. The 110th Congress is focusing on balancing the need for the agency to expedite regulated products. The 110th Congress is focusing on balancing the need for the FDA to expedite regulated products while ensuring safety and effectiveness. Efforts are underway to reauthorize user fee authorities to bring revenue into the FDA for this purpose. Some question the agency's reliance on fees from regulated companies, calling for increased appropriations instead. Efforts are underway to reauthorize user fee authorities (PDUFA and MDUFMA) to bring revenue into the FDA for expediting regulated products. PDUFA and MDUFMA generate the largest proportion of FDA's user fee revenue, accounting for 87% and 19% of its total program level budget in FY2008. PDUFA, enacted in 1992, allows FDA to collect fees from companies producing certain human drugs and biological products for new product application reviews. MDUFMA, established in 2002, set user fees for FDA's operations. The FDA collects user fees from companies to expedite the review of new product applications for human drugs and biological products. MDUFMA, enacted in 2002, established user fees for medical device applications and set performance goals for premarket device reviews. MDUFMA also allowed third-parties to conduct establishment inspections and added regulatory requirements for reprocessed single-use devices. The expiring authorities within MDUFMA are related to user fees and performance goals. In 1997, Congress passed BPCA to encourage pediatric drug research by offering extended marketing exclusivity in exchange for trials investigating pediatric medication use. In 1997, Congress passed BPCA to encourage pediatric drug research by offering extended marketing exclusivity in exchange for trials investigating pediatric medication use. BPCA and PREA provide marketing exclusivity incentives and requirements for studying pediatric use of both on- and off-patent drugs, addressing the critical need for pediatric medical devices. The need for pediatric medical devices is critical due to differences in children's physical attributes and environmental influences compared to adults. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 offer incentives for manufacturers to create pediatric devices and give FDA authority to require postmarket studies for continued safety and efficacy. Adverse effects of medical products may not be apparent until a product is on the market, requiring a large population to use a drug before rare effects are recognized. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 focus on strengthening FDA's data collection system for identifying drug-related issues and granting new authorities to enforce actions by manufacturers. Negative trial results of biomedical products have raised concerns about public access to information. The FDA-approved biomedical products raised questions about safety and effectiveness due to undisclosed negative trial results. Public access to trial results became a significant issue addressed in both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900. FDA advisory committees, while providing independent advice, are criticized for potential conflicts of interest among expert members. Media reports in 2006 and 2007 highlighted bias towards drug approval and conflicts of interest within these committees. Both bills include provisions to address these concerns. The FDA is seeking advice on conflicts of interest within advisory committees. Reports in 2006 and 2007 highlighted bias towards drug approval and conflicts of interest among committee members. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose revisions to address these concerns. The year 2000 marked a slowdown in new drug submissions globally. FDA investigated the decline in innovative medical products and called for modernizing scientific tools. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose creating a nonprofit corporation to support FDA in these efforts. The creation of a Reagan-Udall Foundation is proposed to support the FDA in evaluating and predicting the safety, effectiveness, and manufacturability of medical products. Lawmakers are exploring ways to allow access to lower-priced medications from foreign sources while ensuring safety regulations. S. 1082 includes a title to regulate importation of prescription drugs, with an amendment requiring the Secretary of HHS to certify the safety of the program. The FDA has had responsibility for regulating food safety since 1906, with its authority evolving over time. Recent outbreaks of foodborne illness have raised concerns about both domestic and imported food products. Provisions in S. 1082 address some food safety reform issues, with two FDA reauthorization bills covering similar topics. The FDA reauthorization bills in S. 1082 address key food safety reform issues, including prescription drug user fees, medical device user fees, drug safety, importation of prescription drugs, and more. The bills aim to supplement FDA's funding through user fees paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was first enacted in 1992 to provide FDA with additional revenue from pharmaceutical manufacturers to expedite the review process for new products. PDUFA has been reauthorized multiple times, with a focus on improving postmarket drug safety activities. Discussions for the 2007 reauthorization (PDUFA IV) have emphasized the importance of postmarket drug safety. The 2007 PDUFA IV reauthorization focuses on postmarket drug safety activities. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments, reauthorizing fees for application, establishment, and product fees for prescription and nonprescription drugs. They would enhance adverse event data collection systems and reporting requirements to the HHS Secretary and the public, with fee revenues set at $393 million annually. The Senate and House bills propose fee revenues of $393 million annually for postmarket drug safety activities. They include adjustments for inflation, workload, and rent costs, as well as new fees for drug advertisement reviews. The House bill exempts orphan drugs marketed by small companies from certain fees. Manufacturer requests for advertisement reviews would be voluntary, with FDA responses being advisory. The Senate bill would codify core elements of the prescription drug user fee program. The Senate bill proposes new fees for drug safety activities, including advisory review and operating reserve fees. It would codify core elements of the prescription drug user fee program, requiring annual reports to Congress and consultation for PDUFA reauthorization. Public hearings and reviews would be required for setting performance goals, with a summary of public comments included in the submission to Congress. The House bill includes similar requirements but exempts orphan drugs from certain fees. The House bill, like the Senate bill, proposes new fees for drug safety activities and codifies core elements of the prescription drug user fee program. It requires annual reports to Congress, consultation for reauthorization, and public hearings for setting performance goals. The House bill also mandates the Secretary to make negotiation minutes publicly available before presenting recommendations to Congress. The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 introduced user fees for premarket device reviews, allowed third-party inspections, and imposed new requirements for reprocessed single-use devices. FDA's authority to collect user fees will expire on October 1, 2007, unless reauthorized by Congress. The FDA's authority to collect user fees for medical devices will expire on October 1, 2007, unless reauthorized by Congress. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose reauthorization through FY2012, with provisions for fee amounts, fee types, and exceptions for government entities. The bills propose lower fee amounts for FY2008, followed by an 8.5% annual increase through FY2012, and introduce new types of fees. Government entities, including Indian tribes under H.R. 2900, would be exempt from establishment fees. The Secretary could increase fees in FY2010 by an additional 8.5% if fewer than 12,250 establishments paid in FY2009. Both bills extend the requirement for medical device-related appropriations from FY2007 to FY2012 to assess fees. Fees collected between FY2008 and FY2011 would be considered in aggregate, with a reduction in fees in the final year if the total collected exceeds the authorized amount. H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 propose lower fee amounts for FY2008, with an 8.5% annual increase through FY2012. They introduce new fees and exempt government entities from establishment fees. Both bills allow for a reduction in fees in the final year if the total collected exceeds the authorized amount. Additionally, they specify a new refund policy for modular applications withdrawn before final FDA action. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 propose lower fees for small business qualification and introduce a new refund policy for modular applications withdrawn before final FDA action. The bills require the Secretary to file annual reports through FY2012, with H.R. 2900 including information on postmarket safety activities and S. 1082 requiring information on previous cohorts of medical device applications. Both bills mandate FDA to consult with various groups in developing performance goal recommendations, publish them in the Federal Register, allow for public comments, and hold a public meeting. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose amendments to medical device regulation, including lower fees for small businesses, a new refund policy for withdrawn applications, and extending third-party review authority. The bills require public comment periods, revisions based on feedback, transmittal to Congress, and consultation with various groups. H.R. 2900's user fee provisions take effect upon enactment, while S. 1082's provisions become effective on October 1, 2007, with a savings clause for fee collection continuity. Additionally, H.R. 2900 mandates a study on nosocomial infections, while both bills revise inspection requirements by accredited third parties. The bills propose amendments to medical device regulation, including lower fees for small businesses, extending third-party review authority, and revising inspection requirements by accredited third parties. They aim to streamline administrative requirements, expand program participation, and allow device companies to submit reports by third parties assessing conformance with international quality standards. Registration requirements would be restricted to between October 1 and December 31 of each year, with electronic filing as the default. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies to ensure safe and effective use in children. Off-label prescribing of adult-approved products for children can lead to ineffective treatment or inappropriate dosages due to unique side effects and variations in drug metabolism in children. The Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) incentivizes drug manufacturers to conduct pediatric studies by providing market exclusivity incentives. The act also mandates pediatric testing data submission through the Pediatric Rule. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) reauthorized exclusivity provisions for five years, set to expire in 2007. FDA mandated pediatric testing data submission through the Pediatric Rule in 1998, later invalidated in 2002. The Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA) gave FDA authority for pediatric assessments. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would reauthorize BPCA for five years, encouraging research on off-patent products and strengthening labeling requirements based on pediatric studies. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would reauthorize BPCA for another five years, encourage research on off-patent products, strengthen labeling requirements based on pediatric studies, and expand FDA's authority under PREA. A key difference is the period of exclusivity, with S. 1082 reducing it to three months for drugs with over $1 billion in annual gross U.S. sales. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to reauthorize BPCA and PREA, with S. 1082 maintaining the connection between the two authorities while H.R. 2900 eliminates it. They also include legislation to incentivize medical device manufacturers to develop pediatric products, such as amending the humanitarian device exemption to encourage the development of devices for small patient populations with rare diseases. The legislation in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aims to exempt certain manufacturers of pediatric devices from selling them above cost, with varying inspection authorities and reporting requirements. Both bills extend the exemption, require funding for pediatric device research, and establish a demonstration project to promote development. Both S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to establish a demonstration project to promote pediatric device development. The bills focus on connecting innovators with manufacturers, managing device development, providing business assistance, and coordinating with NIH and FDA. They authorize $6 million for FY2008 through FY2012 and expand the focus of the Office of Pediatric Therapeutics to include pediatric medical devices. Postmarket surveillance measures would also be incorporated. The bills, S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, aim to expand pediatric medical device research and development by amending the FFDCA to include postmarket surveillance measures. They would give the Secretary authority to require postmarket studies for pediatric medical devices, with a focus on safety controls for devices indicated for pediatric populations. H.R. 2900 also includes a dispute resolution provision for manufacturers seeking a review before a device is deemed misbranded. Since the 1938 passage of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA requires drug manufacturers to demonstrate safety and effectiveness before approval. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 maintains focus on premarket review, but FDA acknowledges that no drug is completely safe. Recent research has shown some widely used drugs to be more dangerous than expected, raising concerns about industry transparency and regulatory oversight. In response to concerns about drug safety, the FDA asked the Institute of Medicine to examine its handling of postmarket safety concerns. The IOM's 2006 report addressed organizational culture, science, regulation, communication, and resources. Legislation such as S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to enhance FDA's ability to identify and correct postmarket drug safety problems. The Senate and House bills propose new authorities for the FDA to address postmarket drug safety concerns, including establishing public-private partnerships for risk identification and analysis. They aim to strengthen FDA's postmarket safety activities through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), requiring sponsors to submit proposed REMS. The House and Senate bills propose new authorities for the FDA to address postmarket drug safety concerns through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). The bills differ on the criteria for requiring a REMS, with the House bill focusing on pre-approval benefits outweighing risks and the Senate bill focusing on serious risks needing assessment or mitigation. Both bills require all REMS to include core elements and timeframes determined by the Secretary. The Senate and House bills propose new authorities for the FDA to address postmarket drug safety concerns through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Both bills call for REMS to include core elements, timeframes, instructions to patients and clinicians, and restrictions on distribution or use. They also allow waivers for certain medical countermeasures during public health emergencies. The Senate bill includes a mechanism for access to drugs with REMS for off-label use, while both bills require reviews of approved REMS at specified times and lay out procedures for review and modifications. Both Senate and House bills propose new authorities for the FDA to address postmarket drug safety concerns through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). They require reviews of approved REMS at specified times and establish a Drug Safety Oversight Board to resolve disputes. The bills also authorize the Secretary to require postapproval studies or clinical trials. The Senate and House bills propose new authorities for the FDA to address postmarket drug safety concerns through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). The Senate bill requires routine active surveillance and assessment of serious risks, while the House bill authorizes postapproval studies to assess known or unexpected serious risks. Both bills require sponsors and the Secretary to notify each other of new safety information for labeling changes, with a multi-level process in place for dispute resolution. The House and Senate bills propose new authorities for the FDA to address postmarket drug safety concerns through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Both bills include time limits for sponsor and Secretary involvement, a dispute resolution procedure for labeling changes, and the authorization for the Secretary to require submission of certain advertisements for review before dissemination. Additionally, both bills would allow the Secretary to impose civil monetary penalties for violations of certain requirements, providing FDA with a new enforcement tool. Both the House and Senate bills propose new enforcement tools for the FDA to address postmarket drug safety concerns through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Violations of REMS could result in fines of up to $250,000 per violation, with additional penalties for ongoing violations and threats to public health. The bills also allow the Secretary to consider non-compliant drugs as misbranded and prohibit marketing of products with REMS that are not in compliance. Additionally, there is separate civil penalty authority for false or misleading direct-to-consumer ads for prescription drugs. The House bill prohibits marketing products with REMS if not in compliance, with fines up to $250,000 for first violation and $500,000 for subsequent violations. The Senate bill allows fines up to $150,000 for first violation and $300,000 for subsequent violations. Both bills authorize increased appropriations for drug safety provisions, with the Senate bill increasing PDUFA revenue by $225 million and the House bill authorizing $125 million over five years. The House bill authorizes $125 million over five years for drug safety activities, including guidance for clinical trials of antibiotic drugs and grants for orphan drug development. The Senate bill considers antibiotics as orphan products and authorizes $35 million annually for them, with provisions for antibiotic access and innovation. It also requires standardized numerical identifiers and counterfeit-resistant technologies on prescription drug packaging. The House bill and Senate bill both focus on drug safety measures, including standardized numerical identifiers and counterfeit-resistant technologies on prescription drug packaging. The House bill also includes requirements for DTC ads to encourage reporting adverse effects to the FDA, while the Senate bill includes provisions for establishing an Advisory Committee on Risk Communication and providing extensive drug safety information on a website. The Senate bill proposes requiring state-legalized medical marijuana to adhere to FDA regulations, awarding priority review vouchers for neglected or tropical disease products, creating a list of authorized generic drugs, and preventing certain citizen petitions from delaying agency decisions. Additionally, federal registration requirements for clinical trials were established by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997. The current registry for clinical trials, established by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, requires registration for trials of drugs treating serious or life-threatening conditions. Proposals in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 aim to expand the types of trials and information in the registry, including the publication of trial results. These bills would require registration for most clinical trials involving drugs, devices, and biologics, including international trials seeking FDA approval. H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 aim to expand the clinical trial registry to include trials for life-threatening conditions and international trials seeking FDA approval. H.R. 2900 would delay the public release of medical device information until FDA approval, while S. 1082 would exempt pediatric postmarket surveillance trials from registry requirements. Both bills require compliance from the responsible party and expand the type of information included in the registry. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 aim to expand the clinical trial registry by including more information and making it searchable in specific ways. H.R. 2900 requires the principal investigator to have control over data and the right to publish trial results to serve as the responsible party. It also includes elements not required by S. 1082, such as disclosing agreements restricting non-employees from discussing trial results. S. 1082 specifies additional criteria for searchability, like the age group studied in the trial, and sets a timeline for updates to be submitted to the registry. Both H.R. 2900 and S. 1082 have provisions for a public database of clinical trial results. H.R. 2900 provides specific instructions for the database creation, while S. 1082 requires the Secretary to create it based on NIH Director recommendations. H.R. 2900 specifies searchable categories, submission timing, and truthfulness of information. A requirement for non-promotional results summaries was replaced with a study by the Comptroller General in H.R. 2900. The bill H.R. 2900 includes provisions for a public database of clinical trial results, with specific instructions for creation and submission timing. A requirement for non-promotional results summaries was replaced with a study by the Comptroller General. Timing provisions may result in clinical trial information being made public before FDA action is concluded. The bill H.R. 2900 includes provisions for a public database of clinical trial results, with specific instructions for creation and submission timing. A parallel provision allows for a posting delay of up to two years for new drug or device uses. Compliance and enforcement provisions differ between H.R. 2900 and S. 1082, with H.R. 2900 including enforcement of results database requirements and coordination between registry and results database. One controversial provision dropped from H.R. 2900 specified legal effect on state law causes of action. The bill H.R. 2900 includes provisions for a public database of clinical trial results and enforcement mechanisms for compliance. It specifies penalties for noncompliance, with penalties of $10,000 per day and capping at $15,000 for individuals and nonprofits. S. 1082 would amend relevant FFDCA sections, allowing penalties of $10,000 for a first violation and up to $20,000 for subsequent violations. Both bills contain provisions affecting FDA's treatment of conflicts of interest in advisory committees. The FDA's current approach to conflicts of interest in advisory committees requires disclosure and possible abstention from voting. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 propose changes to the recruitment process and conflict-of-interest waiver granting. These changes would expand requirements to all advisory committees, not just drug and biologic ones. The new provisions in S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would expand conflict-of-interest requirements to all advisory committees, not just drug and biologic ones. These changes include defining advisory committees as FACA-covered entities providing advice to the FDA Secretary and defining financial interests under 18 U.S.C. 208(a). The bills also address advisory committee member recruitment mechanisms. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would expand conflict-of-interest requirements to all advisory committees, not just drug and biologic ones. They focus on advisory committee member recruitment mechanisms and require full financial disclosure prior to meetings on related matters. Voting by members with conflicts of interest would be precluded unless exempted by the Office of Government Ethics, with a waiver allowed for essential expertise. Public disclosures for conflict-of-interest determinations, certifications, and waivers would be required. The bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 would establish a nonprofit corporation to advance FDA's mission, with a Board of Directors including key officials selecting members from a candidate list provided by the National Academy of Sciences. The Foundation would coordinate with federal agencies to address unmet needs in product development, innovation, and safety. The Foundation, established by bills S. 1082 and H.R. 2900, would have a diverse board and work with federal programs to address unmet needs. The bills also propose creating an Office of the Chief Scientist within the FDA and allowing importation of prescription drugs. S. 1082 (Title VIII, the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of 2007) would allow importation of prescription drugs by commercial and personal use. The provision includes detailed procedures for safety, cost savings, and program administration. A second-degree amendment added by the Senate requires certification from the HHS Secretary for implementation. The topic of food safety is also addressed in S. 1082. Title VI of S. 1082 addresses food safety by establishing regulations for pet food processing and ingredient standards, creating an early warning system for adulteration and disease outbreaks, and requiring the Secretary to coordinate food safety programs for fresh and processed produce. The Secretary would also be responsible for collecting and disseminating recall information during food recalls. Title VI of S. 1082 directs the Secretary to coordinate food safety programs for fresh and processed produce, establish a registry for adulterated food, and issue alerts to the public for food associated with outbreaks or adulteration. The responsible party of adulterated food must maintain records and report to the FDA. Deliberate adulteration incidents must also be reported to the Department. The Secretary must maintain records and report to the FDA for adulterated food incidents. Deliberate adulteration cases must also be reported to the Department of Homeland Security. Regulations and standards for reporting suspected food adulteration must be established. Annual reports to Congress on food imports, inspectors, violations, and enforcement actions are required. Certain provisions in S. 1082 Title V mandate reports on food issues such as pesticide residue monitoring and health hazards from substances used to preserve fresh meat appearance. Title V of S. 1082 requires reports on various food issues, including pesticide residue monitoring, health hazards from substances used in fresh meat, color additive certification, environmental risks of genetically engineered seafood, and more. It also includes provisions for prohibiting imports from foreign food facilities that deny access to U.S. inspectors and enhancing FDA inspection regimes for aquaculture and seafood. Additionally, S. 1082 allows for the sale of pet turtles under specific sanitization and disclosure requirements. S. 1082 includes provisions for the sale of pet turtles under specific sanitization and disclosure requirements, an Institute of Medicine report on genetic test safety, an FDA report on indoor tanning device labeling and skin cancer risks, and provisions expressing the Senate's sense on FDA regulation flexibility and intellectual property rights protection. The House bill addresses public-private partnerships for medical product innovation, requiring collaboration with educational or tax-exempt organizations. It authorizes funding for collaborative projects to accelerate medical product development and enhance safety."
