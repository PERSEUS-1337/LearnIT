    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Care Quality Incentive Act of 2001\". The findings of Congress highlight the importance of quality early care and education for children's cognitive abilities and long-term success. Despite the high cost of child care, limited federal assistance makes it difficult for many families to afford. Full-day child care costs $4,000 to $10,000 per year. Federal assistance is limited, making it hard for many families to afford child care. Low payment rates affect the quality of care children receive, leading to cut corners and reduced staff and services. The purpose of this Act is to improve the quality of child care by increasing payment rates, which can lead to better staff retention, training, and educational materials. Low-quality child care can result in delayed skills and increased aggression in children. Incentive grants are provided to improve the quality of child care. Funding for grants to improve the quality of child care is authorized under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act. $500,000,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2002, with additional funds for subsequent years. Block grant funds can be used for this purpose, with specific allocations from section 658B(a). The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 is amended to specify funding sources for grants to improve child care quality, with a new section 658H excluded from certain provisions. \"Section 658H grants aim to enhance the quality of child care.\" The Secretary will use funds to make grants to eligible States for child care services based on market rates surveys conducted within 2 years. States must submit an application to receive the grant. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State must submit an application detailing the methodology and results of a market rates survey, outlining a plan to increase payment rates, and explaining how rates will be adjusted according to survey results. The Secretary may provide annual payments to eligible States for child care services. The Secretary may make annual payments to eligible States if they show progress in maintaining increased payment rates and conduct a survey update every two years. States must also provide matching funds of at least 25% of the costs for activities under this section. The State must contribute at least 25% of the costs for activities under this section in cash. Federal funds cannot be included in determining State contributions. Funds appropriated for a fiscal year will be allotted to eligible States based on a specified formula. States receiving grants must increase payment rates for child care assistance up to the 100th percentile of the market rate survey. Additional uses of funds can be approved by the Secretary if a State demonstrates achievement of the payment rate. The eligible State can use funds from the grant for activities that enhance child care services if it achieves the 100th percentile of the market rate survey. The funds should supplement, not supplant, other funds provided by Federal, State, or local sources. States must submit evaluations to the Secretary on efforts to increase payment rates and their impact on child care quality and accessibility. The Secretary requires information on State efforts to increase payment rates for child care and their impact on quality and accessibility. Biennial reports to Congress will include data on payment rates. Payment rate refers to reimbursement rates for subsidized child care. Amendments are made to sections regarding payments and allotment of funds. Amendments are made to section 658O of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990, including changes to subsections (a), (b), and (e) to specify the use of funds appropriated under section 658B(a)."
