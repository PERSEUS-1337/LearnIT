    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Amendments of 1993\". Between 10,000,000 and 15,000,000 people in the United States have been infected with tuberculosis, with nearly 26,000 new cases reported each year and over 1,700 deaths annually. The number of reported cases has been increasing, with drug-resistant strains costing over $150,000 to treat and resulting in a high mortality rate. In 1992, tuberculosis cases were reported in all 50 states, with drug-resistant cases reported in at least 36 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. In 1992, 27 percent of tuberculosis cases occurred in foreign-born persons, and one third of the world's population harbors tuberculosis. Tuberculosis remains the number one killer among infectious diseases worldwide, with an estimated 8,000,000 new cases and 2,900,000 deaths each year. SEC. 3. PROGRAMS OF CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. The amendment to the Public Health Service Act allocates funding for tuberculosis prevention, control, and elimination for fiscal years 1994 through 1997. States applying for grants must submit a plan demonstrating targeted services for high-risk populations or areas with high infection rates. Collaboration with funded entities is required for effective implementation. The amendment to the Public Health Service Act requires states to submit plans for tuberculosis prevention and control, targeting high-risk populations or areas with high infection rates. Collaboration with funded entities and use of grant funds for effective interventions are essential. The amendment to the Public Health Service Act authorizes funding for research, training, and interventions related to tuberculosis prevention and control. $26,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1994, with additional funding for subsequent years. Technical amendments are also made to streamline the process. The amendment to the Public Health Service Act authorizes funding for research and training on tuberculosis through the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The Director of the Institute shall conduct or support research on tuberculosis, with authorized appropriations of $46,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 and additional funding for subsequent years. The Food and Drug Administration will implement a tuberculosis drug and device research program with a $5,000,000 annual budget. This program includes assisting other agencies in developing tuberculosis protocols, reviewing medical devices for tuberculosis diagnosis, and conducting research on drugs and devices for tuberculosis control."
