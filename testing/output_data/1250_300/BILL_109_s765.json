    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Math and Science Incentive Act of 2005\". The United States needs to prioritize science and mathematics education to produce more scientists and engineers, as current performance lags behind international peers. The country must recommit to leadership in these fields, especially with advancements like nanotechnology. The United States must prioritize science, mathematics, and engineering education to maintain technological leadership, including loan forgiveness programs to attract students to these fields. Establishment of program. The Secretary will implement a program to cover interest payments on loans for eligible borrowers who are teachers in STEM fields or professionals in STEM disciplines. Eligibility criteria include being a new borrower and having obtained loans as an undergraduate student. The program covers interest payments on loans for eligible STEM teachers or professionals who agree to 5 years of service. The Secretary will not pay interest that accrues before the repayment period or before signing the agreement. Participants are selected based on eligibility criteria. The Secretary selects participants for the program based on national security needs, academic record, and likelihood of completing the 5-year service obligation. Other factors may also be considered for eligibility. The Secretary may choose eligible applicants based on their likelihood to complete the 5-year service obligation, stay in science, mathematics, or engineering, or other relevant criteria. Loan interest payments are subject to appropriations, with priority given to previous recipients if funds are insufficient. The Secretary can establish necessary regulations for this program. The Secretary can prescribe regulations for interest payments on behalf of student borrowers selected under specific criteria. The period for interest payments begins after the service obligation is completed and ends based on loan repayment, a total payment limit, or if the borrower fails to fulfill the obligation. The Secretary can prescribe regulations for interest payments on behalf of student borrowers selected under specific criteria. Repayment to eligible lenders is made for the interest accrued on loans of selected borrowers. Eligible individuals must submit an application for loan interest payment to the Secretary.

However, borrowers cannot receive benefits from both this section and certain loan forgiveness programs. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
