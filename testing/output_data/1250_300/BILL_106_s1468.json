    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States Capitol Visitor Center Commemorative Coin Act of 1999\". Congress finds that the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. is a symbol of democracy, with millions of visitors annually. Security is provided by the Capitol Police, and funds have been allocated for a Visitor Center to enhance the visitor experience. Coins are authorized to commemorate this initiative. Congress wants to allow voluntary fundraising for the Capitol Visitor Center and authorize coins to commemorate the first Congress meeting in the Capitol building, with proceeds going towards its preservation. The Capitol Visitor Center fundraising will involve issuing commemorative coins with specific specifications. The Secretary of the Treasury will mint and issue various coins, including bimetallic $10 coins, $1 silver coins, and half dollar coins. If bimetallic coins are not feasible, $5 gold coins may be minted instead. The Secretary of the Treasury may mint and issue up to 100,000 $5 gold coins if bimetallic coins are not feasible. These coins will weigh 8.359 grams, have a diameter of 0.850 inches, and contain 90% gold and 10% alloy. The mintage levels specified in the Act may be waived, and the coins will be legal tender. SEC. 4. The Secretary will obtain platinum and gold for minting coins from available sources, and may obtain silver from stockpiles and other sources. SEC. 5. Design of coins. The design of coins minted under this Act shall symbolize the first meeting of the United States Congress in the Capitol Building. Each coin will feature the coin's value, the year \"2000\", and inscriptions of \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\". The design will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with the United States Capitol Preservation Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, and reviewed by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. The coins minted under this Act will be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities, with only one facility of the United States Mint used for each denomination and quality combination. These coins will be the first commemorative coins of the United States to bear the year \"2000\" inscription. The Secretary will consult with the Commission for promotion and marketing, and may enter into a contract for these purposes. SEC. 7. SALE OF COINS.\n\nThe coins minted under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the face value of the coins, plus a surcharge, and the cost of designing and issuing the coins. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a reasonable discount. Surcharges for the coins will be set by the Secretary at specified amounts. SEC. 8. DISTRIBUTION OF SURCHARGES.\n\nSurcharges from coin sales will go to the Capitol Preservation Fund for the Capitol Visitor Center's construction and maintenance."
