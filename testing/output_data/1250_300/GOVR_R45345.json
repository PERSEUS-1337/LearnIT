    "content": "Whistleblowing in the Intelligence Community (IC) involves reporting violations of law, mismanagement, waste of resources, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. Protections for IC whistleblowers are in place to safeguard classified information and encourage ethical behavior. Whistleblowing can lead to cost savings, a safe work environment, and prompt corrective actions. However, these protections only apply to lawful disclosures and not unauthorized leaks to the media or foreign entities. The whistleblower protections in the Intelligence Community (IC) only apply to lawful disclosures that conform to reporting procedures to protect classified information. They do not cover unauthorized leaks to the media or foreign governments. Protections do not extend to differences of opinion on policy or adverse personnel decisions unless there are concerns over legality. Procedures for IC whistleblowers are defined by Congress and the executive branch to ensure security of classified information. The Intelligence Community (IC) whistleblower protections have evolved over time, with differing opinions on the transparency of internal processes and adequacy of protections for IC contractors. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 established a process for complaints but lacked specific protections. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 included general provisions for IC whistleblowers, while Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-19 in 2012 provided the first specific protections in response to concerns about reprisals against whistleblowers. The evolution of Intelligence Community (IC) whistleblower protections includes PPD-19 in 2012, ICD-120, 10 U.S.C. \u00a71034 for Armed Forces, DOD Directive 7050.06, and P.L. 115-118 in 2018 addressing gaps for IC contractors. ICWPA of 1998 assists IC whistleblowers excluded from the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA) was created to assist whistleblowers in the Intelligence Community who are not covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. It allows IC government employees or contractors to report complaints to the Inspector General of their agency, who must then report credible complaints to the Director of the CIA and congressional intelligence committees within 14 days. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA) requires the Inspector General to report credible complaints to the Director of the CIA and congressional intelligence committees within 14 days. If the IG fails to report or does so inaccurately, the employee or contractor can submit the complaint directly to Congress. The ICWPA does not provide specific provisions for protecting whistleblowers from reprisal or punishment. The IAA for FY2010 established the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (OIGIC) to provide protection for whistleblowers. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA) requires the Inspector General to report credible complaints to the Director of the CIA and congressional intelligence committees within 14 days. The IAA for FY2010 included provisions for protection of whistleblowers by establishing the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (OIGIC), allowing lawful disclosures to the IGIC for investigation of violations or dangers. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA) mandates the Inspector General to handle complaints regarding misuse of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. The Inspector General must protect the identity of the employee unless disclosure is necessary for the investigation or to the Department of Justice. Reprisals against whistleblowers are prohibited unless the complaint was knowingly false. The Act also covers contractors, granting the Inspector General access to employees for investigations. The Inspector General of the intelligence community has access to employees and contractors for investigations. Protections against reprisals for whistleblowers were clarified in the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 and further expanded by PPD-19 in 2012. Obama on October 10, 2012, established protections for IC whistleblowers through PPD-19, safeguarding employees with access to classified information from reprisals for lawful disclosures of violations of laws or regulations, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health or safety. These protections include reporting to supervisors, agency inspectors general, the Director of National Intelligence, or designated officials without fear of retaliation affecting their security clearance or facing personnel actions. PPD-19 protects IC whistleblowers from reprisals for lawful disclosures of violations, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health or safety. It prohibits reprisals that could impact security clearance or result in personnel actions. IC elements must have a process for employees to seek review of alleged reprisals, with the IG determining if a violation occurred and making recommendations for corrective action. Agency heads are required to consider IG findings but are not obligated to follow recommendations. Agencies must certify to the DNI that they have a review process for employees to appeal actions affecting access to classified information. The agency head is not required to accept an IG's recommendations for corrective action. IC agencies must certify to the DNI that they have a review process for employees to appeal actions related to access to classified information. PPD-19 allows whistleblowers to request an external review by an IG panel if they have exhausted the agency review process. The IGIC must report annually to congressional intelligence committees on determinations and recommendations. Training on whistleblower protections for employees with access to classified information is required by PPD-19. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA codified provisions of PPD-19. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA codified provisions of PPD-19, providing statutory protections for IC whistleblowers against retaliation for lawful disclosures. IC whistleblowers are protected from personnel actions made in reprisal for disclosures to specified entities. Contractors are not specifically mentioned in the legislation. Section 601 of Title VI of the FY2014 IAA defines lawful disclosure for IC employee whistleblowers, while Section 602 provides protections against retaliatory actions, including revocation of security clearance. The legislation allows for appeal policies and procedures for whistleblowers alleging reprisal. Contractors are not mentioned in the provisions. ICD-120, Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection, provides guidance for PPD-19, including protections against reprisal for IC employees making protected disclosures. It allows for appeals for security clearance decisions and maintains employment status during the process. Contractors and members of the Armed Forces are included in these provisions. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection guidance, ICD-120, includes provisions for appeals on security clearance decisions and maintaining employment status during the process. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code provides protections for members of the Armed Forces against retaliation for protected communications, allowing communication with various entities including Congress, Inspector General, and court-martial proceedings. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code protects members of the Armed Forces from retaliation for making protected communications, allowing communication with Congress, Inspector General, and court-martial proceedings. It specifies prohibited personnel actions in reprisal for protected communications and enables the DOD to mitigate hardship for service members. The DOD Inspector General is required to provide updates during investigations and prescribe standards for investigating prohibited personnel actions. The IC whistleblower protection legislation covers contractors inconsistently. Efforts have been made in Congress to address this gap, including the passage of P.L. 115-118 in 2018. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 2002 to provide protections for IC employees, but no further action was taken. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 2002 on October 24, 2017 to provide protections for IC employees from retaliation for making protected disclosures. The bill included provisions for a complaint process. Additionally, on March 18, 2015, Senator McCaskill introduced S. 794 to extend protections for contractor employees on contracts with IC elements. Congress later passed P.L. 115-118 in 2018 to amend the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act and provide protections for IC contractor employees. Congress passed P.L. 115-118 on January 19, 2018, amending the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act to provide protections for IC contractor whistleblowers. Section 110 of the amendment allows IC contractors to make lawful disclosures to specified authorities without fear of retaliatory personnel actions. These protections mirror those already in place for IC employees under previous legislation. Section 110 of P.L. 115-118 amended the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act to protect IC contractor whistleblowers from retaliatory personnel actions for making lawful disclosures. This includes complaints related to violations of federal laws, gross mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. Contractors of the FBI, including the Intelligence Branch, are covered by these protections similar to IC employees under Title 50, U.S. Code. H.Amdt. 894, 113th Congress, amended Title 50, U.S. Code to protect IC contractors making lawful whistleblower disclosures. It redirected $2 million to fund the IC Whistleblower and Source Protection Directorate within the OIGIC, enhancing investigative capabilities for fraud, waste, and abuse."
