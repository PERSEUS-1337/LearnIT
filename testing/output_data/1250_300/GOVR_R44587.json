    "content": "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was established in 1967 under the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to investigate civil aviation accidents and other transportation incidents. In 1974, it became independent from DOT, allowing unbiased investigations and safety recommendations. The NTSB determines accident causes, suggests safety improvements, assists victims' families in disasters, and serves as an appeals board for transportation regulations. It lacks authority to enforce its recommendations or oversee safety practices. The NTSB, established in 1967 under DOT, investigates transportation incidents, provides safety recommendations, and serves as an appeals board. It consists of a five-member board and approximately 420 staff, with regional offices in four locations. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 requires the agency to maintain at least one full-time employee in states located more than 1,000 miles from the nearest regional office. The NTSB, established in 1967 under DOT, investigates transportation incidents and provides safety recommendations. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 requires the agency to maintain at least one full-time employee in states located more than 1,000 miles from the nearest regional office, impacting Hawaii where the NTSB does not have a field office. The agency's five Safety Board members serve five-year terms and may continue until replacement members are appointed. Investigative and support staff are organized by transportation mode, with the office of research and engineering supporting all modal offices. The NTSB also serves as a court of appeals for airmen and mariners facing administrative actions by the FAA or Coast Guard. The NTSB is organized by transportation mode, with the office of research and engineering supporting all modal offices. It also serves as a court of appeals for airmen and mariners facing administrative actions by the FAA or Coast Guard. The NTSB investigates transportation-related accidents and safety issues, including civil aircraft accidents, highway and railroad grade crossing accidents, and pipeline accidents. The NTSB investigates transportation-related accidents involving aircraft, highway and railroad grade crossings, and pipelines in the United States and its territories. It also looks into major marine casualties and other catastrophic accidents. The NTSB relies on the expertise of manufacturers, transportation providers, and regulatory agencies through the \"party process\" during investigations. The NTSB utilizes the \"party process\" to involve manufacturers, transportation providers, and regulatory agencies in investigations. Safeguards are in place to prevent external influence on NTSB findings. Interested parties can provide technical expertise but NTSB bases conclusions solely on its own analysis. Sanctions can be imposed on parties not fulfilling duties or complying with rules. The Safety Board must meet publicly on most matters under the Government in the Sunshine Act. The NTSB utilizes the \"party process\" to involve manufacturers, transportation providers, and regulatory agencies in investigations. Safeguards are in place to prevent external influence on NTSB findings. Parties can be sanctioned or lose their party status if they do not fulfill assigned duties and comply with rules of conduct. Despite safeguards, the potential for parties to influence the NTSB process still exists, which could diminish the agency's credibility. Balancing parties' unique data and technical expertise with preventing them from swaying the investigative process is a significant challenge for the NTSB. The NTSB participates in foreign aviation accident investigations as per international treaties and ICAO standards. They may assist other countries even without a vested interest, and can be reimbursed for costs. The NTSB can be reimbursed for costs incurred in overseas investigations from outside entities like foreign governments. Prior to legislative changes, only NTSB Academy-related reimbursements were credited as offsetting collections. The NTSB has recovered costs through the Safe Skies for Africa program, with annual costs for international investigations ranging from under $1 million to almost $2.4 million. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to effect change in transportation safety regulations and practices. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to influence transportation safety regulations and practices. Since 1967, over 14,300 recommendations have been issued to more than 2,300 recipients across all modes of transportation. About 82% of recommendations have led to safety improvements. DOT agencies must respond to each recommendation within 90 days, detailing their implementation plans. While not mandatory, the NTSB advocates for the adoption of its recommendations to enhance transportation safety. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to influence transportation safety regulations and practices. While agencies and organizations are not required to adopt NTSB recommendations, the NTSB advocates for their implementation to improve transportation safety. Implementation of recommendations may be delayed due to various factors, and the NTSB does not consider cost-benefit analysis when developing recommendations. Key safety recommendations are highlighted on the \"Most Wanted\" list for safety improvements. The NTSB advocates for safety improvements in transportation, including reducing fatigue-related accidents, improving safety oversight, promoting collision avoidance technologies, strengthening occupant protection, minimizing distractions, preventing loss of control in flight, and ensuring operators are medically fit for duty. These recommendations influence regulatory agendas and congressional decisions, leading to changes such as requiring positive train control systems and addressing pilot fatigue. The NTSB has a significant impact on congressional decisions regarding transportation safety issues, leading to legislation and regulations such as positive train control systems, airline pilot training modifications, and improved safety standards for various modes of transportation. For example, the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 includes provisions based on NTSB investigations and recommendations to enhance airline pilot skills in monitoring automated systems and controlling aircraft flightpaths. The NTSB raised concerns about pilot understanding of automated systems and erosion of flying skills after the Asiana Airlines crash in 2013. The act directs FAA to assess mental health screening for pilots. International focus on pilot mental health increased after the Germanwings crash in 2015. FAA is required to evaluate and update crash-resistant helicopter fuel system standards. The FAA is mandated to address a 2015 NTSB safety recommendation for crash-resistant fuel systems in newly manufactured helicopters. The Pipeline Safety Act of 2011 included provisions to enhance pipeline safety, while the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 requires positive train control on certain railroads. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (RSIA08; P.L. 110-432) mandates positive train control on railroads carrying passengers or high-volume freight with hazardous materials. Positive train control is a technology to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher errors, reducing speed-related incidents and engineer failure to obey signals. The NTSB also prioritizes minimizing operator distractions to improve transportation safety, leading to a distracted driving incentive grant program in 2012. States must prohibit texting for all drivers and cell-phone use for drivers under 18 to qualify for grants. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandates positive train control on railroads carrying passengers or high-volume freight with hazardous materials. The NTSB prioritizes minimizing operator distractions, leading to a distracted driving incentive grant program in 2012. States must prohibit texting for all drivers and cell-phone use for drivers under 18 to qualify for grants. Only one state qualified for a grant in FY2014 and FY2015, but a provision in the FAST Act in December 2015 removed the requirement for increased fines for repeat offenders, allowing more states to qualify for grants. Funding for the NTSB includes a base authorization, emergency fund, and supplemental appropriations for large investigations. The NTSB's funding structure includes a base authorization, emergency fund for unforeseen accident costs, and supplemental appropriations for complex investigations. The agency has not needed to use its emergency fund or seek additional funding in over a decade. The Government Accountability Office is responsible for evaluating the NTSB's operations and activities. The NTSB has been responsive to GAO findings and has fully implemented recommendations. GAO found improvements in NTSB management practices but highlighted areas for further enhancement, including training center utilization, safety recommendation close-out processes, interagency communications, financial management, and workforce diversity. GAO recommended developing a specific strategy for maximizing the utility of the NTSB's cost accounting system. Current issues include staffing resources and NTSB management in proposed legislation reauthorizing the agency. The NTSB is addressing staffing resources and management issues in proposed legislation. Safety concerns include data privacy and recorder data usage. NTSB requested a 22% staff increase in 2008 but only saw a 12% increase. A five-year human capital plan aims to fill mission-critical gaps. The NTSB has increased staffing by 12% since FY2007 and developed a five-year strategic human capital plan to address mission-critical competencies. Limited resources have led to delays in accident investigations, including some pipeline and railroad accidents. Congress may need to consider additional staffing to meet statutory requirements for investigating fatal railroad accidents. The NTSB has concerns about staffing shortages and skill gaps in critical fields, particularly in the Office of Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials. The NTSB has the authority to enter agreements for training and technical services, with a training center at George Washington University completed in 2003. The NTSB Training Center at George Washington University, completed in 2003, has not achieved financial self-sufficiency as required by P.L. 109-443. Despite its primary purpose of training NTSB staff and transportation industry personnel, revenues from fees have been insufficient to cover costs, leading to increased reliance on leases and rentals for non-related purposes. The NTSB Training Center at George Washington University has struggled to achieve financial self-sufficiency due to inadequate revenues from training and transportation safety-related meetings. The GAO identified issues with NTSB finances and business practices, including a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act related to leasing the facility. Remedies suggested by the GAO include renegotiating the lease, obtaining deficiency appropriations, or terminating the lease. The NTSB Training Center at George Washington University has financial challenges due to low revenues. The GAO suggested remedies such as renegotiating the lease or obtaining deficiency appropriations. GAO found improved utilization of the training center, resulting in better cost recovery. Congressional oversight is needed to weigh the costs and benefits of maintaining the center. The NTSB Training Center at George Washington University has financial challenges due to low revenues, but improved utilization and lease revenue have led to better cost recovery. The annual operating deficit decreased from $6.3 million in FY2004 to $2 million-$2.5 million in FY2013-FY2015. However, the facility still does not fully recoup its operating costs. Congressional oversight is necessary to address the center's financial situation. Data recorders are crucial investigative tools in aviation, with challenges in promptly recovering recorders after accidents and concerns about privacy and public disclosures. The NTSB issued safety recommendations urging for improved technology to transmit data from recorders on impact location and underwater location for overwater flights. Challenges in recovering recorders after accidents were highlighted, with examples such as Air France flight 447 and EgyptAir flight 804. Malaysia Airlines flight 370 remains missing with unrecovered recorders. Harmonization of technologies and regulations with foreign aviation authorities was recommended. The NTSB urged FAA to harmonize technologies and regulations for transmitting flight data from accident aircraft. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 would require large passenger aircraft to have continuous tracking technology for timely recovery of flight data. The sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo vessel El Faro raised concerns about locating maritime voyage data recorders. The sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo vessel El Faro in October 2015 raised concerns about locating and recovering maritime voyage data recorders. Under SOLAS regulations, certain vessels are required to carry data recorders, which can be fixed-mount or float-free units. New regulations implemented in 2014 require new ships to have both types of recorders with enhanced capabilities, but older ships are not required to upgrade. The NTSB has not made specific recommendations regarding the recovery or survivability of data recorders. New regulations in 2014 require new ships to have enhanced data recorders, but older ships are not mandated to upgrade. Concerns over data recovery from vessels lost in deep water may prompt congressional interest in assisting investigators. Event recorders are aiding accident investigations in various transportation modes, raising privacy concerns about the use of recorded data. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 aims to restrict access to data from event data recorders in passenger vehicles. The bill aims to regulate the use of data recorders in passenger vehicles, requiring consent for specific purposes such as diagnostics or emergency response. It also calls for a study on the appropriate data capture time for crash investigations. The NTSB lacks resources to investigate all required railroad accidents, prompting interest in safety recommendations. The Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer Protection Act of 2015 specifies funding for NTSB railroad accident investigations and addresses safety recommendations, including the development of positive train control systems. The bill addresses NTSB railroad safety recommendations by requiring specific plans for positive train control systems, establishing authority for grants, and directing a study on the effectiveness of these systems in reducing highway-rail grade crossing accidents. Funding for NTSB railroad accident investigations is specified in the Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer Protection Act of 2015."
