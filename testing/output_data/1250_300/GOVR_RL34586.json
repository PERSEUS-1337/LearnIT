    "content": "This report focuses on USAID's global health programs for child survival and maternal health from FY2001 to FY2008. UNICEF reported a 60% decrease in under-five mortality since 1960, but still, 26,000 children die each day. Most childhood deaths occur before age five, with 37% in the neonatal period, totaling about 4 million newborn deaths annually. 26,000 children die each day, with 90% of childhood deaths occurring before age five. About 4 million newborn deaths happen annually, with the majority in developing countries, especially in Africa. Neonatal infections and five infectious diseases are responsible for nearly 90% of child deaths. Undernutrition is a significant underlying cause of these deaths. Maternal and child health are crucial indicators of overall health conditions, with Millennium Development Goals aiming for a two-thirds reduction in child and maternal mortality. The interconnected nature of health and development is demonstrated through Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 and 5, which aim to reduce child and maternal mortality rates. Progress in other MDGs, such as undernourishment (MDG 1) and lack of clean water access (MDG 7), can impact maternal and child health outcomes. UNICEF reports that 62 countries are not progressing towards the MDG on child survival, with a majority in Africa. Maternal mortality remains high in developing countries, with over 500,000 women dying annually from pregnancy-related causes. Maternal mortality rates are significantly higher in developing countries, with over 500,000 women dying annually from pregnancy-related causes. The United Nations emphasizes the importance of access to adequate diets, safe water, literacy, and health services during pregnancy and childbirth to prevent these deaths. Complications such as hemorrhage, sepsis, eclampsia, prolonged labor, and unsafe abortions contribute to maternal mortality, with younger mothers facing higher risks of pregnancy and delivery complications. Young mothers under 20 face higher risks of pregnancy complications, leading to increased maternal and infant mortality rates. Adolescents are more likely to die from childbirth compared to older women. Hemorrhage is a significant cause of maternal death in Africa and Asia. Industrialized nations and Latin America also experience maternal deaths due to hemorrhage. The United Nations data shows that regions with fewer skilled health attendants at birth have higher maternal mortality rates. In sub-Saharan Africa, 43% of women give birth with skilled attendants, compared to 65% in south Asia and 99% in industrialized nations. Health systems in many countries lack the capacity to reduce maternal mortality, with 80% of priority countries having low health workforce densities. Among 68 priority countries with high maternal and child mortality rates, 80% have insufficient health workforce densities. South Africa and Swaziland are the only sub-Saharan African countries meeting the minimum standard. Adequate health workers are crucial for child and maternal survival, along with access to clean water, immunizations, and nutritious food. Southeast Asia faces the largest absolute shortage of health workers, while sub-Saharan Africa has the greatest proportional shortage. WHO estimates a global need for 4.3 million additional health workers, with African countries needing a 140% increase on average. Shortages of health care workers are a global issue, with Africa facing a significant deficit. The U.S. Agency for International Development plays a key role in improving child survival worldwide, having committed over $6 billion in the past 20 years. USAID focuses on addressing six major health problems that contribute to 90% of child deaths in developing countries. USAID allocates a significant proportion of its child survival funds to address six major health problems that cause 90% of child deaths in developing countries, including acute respiratory infections, diarrhea, malaria, HIV/AIDS, measles, and neonatal complications. Undernutrition contributes to half of these deaths, with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization stating that hunger and malnutrition weaken children's immune systems, leading to nearly 10 million child deaths annually. WHO-supported studies show that malnourished children are at a higher risk of death from infectious diseases, measles, and severe diarrhea. Good nutrition plays a crucial role in improving child health. Children who are malnourished are at a higher risk of death from infectious diseases like measles and severe diarrhea. Good nutrition is crucial for child health and development. USAID's nutrition programs focus on micronutrient supplementation, fortification, and infant and young child feeding. Micronutrient programs supported by USAID add essential nutrients like zinc, vitamin A, iron, and iodine to processed foods. Research on biofortified crops is also funded to enhance the nutrient content of basic foods. USAID funds research on biofortified crops to improve the nutrient content of basic foods like maize, beans, and sweet potatoes. Nutrition programs are integrated with interventions like safe water and hygiene. USAID emphasizes the importance of exclusive breastfeeding for infants, as it reduces the risk of childhood diseases and mortality. USAID supports exclusive breastfeeding for infants to reduce childhood diseases and mortality. They also integrate safe infant feeding practices with HIV/AIDS prevention programs. USAID spends $30 million annually on nutrition programs, including Vitamin A, iodine, food fortification, anemia packages, and zinc. UNICEF recommends minimizing indoor pollution, adequate nourishment, exclusive breastfeeding, and Vitamin A and zinc supplements to prevent pneumonia. International health organizations advocate for full immunizations to prevent pneumonia. International health organizations advocate for expanding access to vaccines that protect against infections causing pneumonia, such as Hib and pertussis. USAID has supported immunizations for nearly 500 million children and treated over 375 million cases of child pneumonia since 2002. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness strategy integrates interventions for various childhood illnesses, including pneumonia. Approximately 40% of the world's population, mainly in the poorest countries, are at risk of malaria, with over 500 million people severely ill each year. Every year, over 500 million people, mostly in the world's poorest countries, are at risk of malaria. The disease is particularly deadly for children, with at least 1 million infants and children under age five in sub-Saharan Africa dying each year from malaria. USAID has been involved in malaria eradication efforts since the 1950s, including the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) to reduce malaria deaths by 50% in targeted countries by 2010. In its first year, PMI reached over 6 million people and within two years, reached more than 25 million. Activities included indoor residual spraying, distributing insecticide-treated nets, training health workers, and purchasing anti-malarial tablets to reduce the impact of malaria in pregnancy. HIV/AIDS is preventable and treatable, but not curable. Most children who acquired HIV in 2007 got it from their infected mothers during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Successful interventions can reduce the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission. In pregnancy, HIV/AIDS is preventable and treatable, but not curable. Most children who acquired HIV in 2007 got it from their infected mothers during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Successful interventions can reduce the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission to 2%. About 33% of HIV-positive pregnant women in resource-limited countries receive drugs for prevention. Nevirapine, a widely used drug for prevention, costs $0.29 to $0.40 per dose. Early diagnosis and antiretroviral therapy (ART) are crucial for children as HIV infection progresses faster in them. The cost of ART for children is higher than for adults, with an annual supply of generic ARTs costing about $260 per child. The cost of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for children is significantly higher than for adults, with a one-year supply of a standard three-drug regimen costing $2,000 per child. The Clinton Foundation negotiated lower prices for pediatric ARTs, charging about $0.16 per day. Other treatments like Cotrimoxazole for pneumonia can also improve child survival among HIV-positive children, costing about $0.03 per day. Only 10% of the 4 million HIV-positive children have access to these treatments. Cotrimoxazole, a drug used to treat pneumonia in HIV-positive children, reduces mortality by 30% at a cost of $0.03 per day or $10 per year. USAID has spent $6 billion on HIV/AIDS interventions since 1986. PEPFAR has provided $289.2 million for care and support to 2.7 million orphans and vulnerable children, including food and nutrition programs for 332,000 OVC. PEPFAR's child-focus programs provide training, promote technology use, support income-generating activities, and connect families to health care. Support for people living with HIV/AIDS receiving treatment is crucial for children's well-being. PEPFAR has committed $1.5 billion for HIV/AIDS care and support programs, with $191.5 million dedicated to pediatric treatment. PMTCT services have prevented an estimated 157,000 infant HIV infections. Since FY2007, PEPFAR-implementing agencies have supported PMTCT services for women during over 10 million pregnancies, providing ART to HIV-positive women in over 827,000 pregnancies and preventing an estimated 157,000 infant HIV infections. USAID has provided over $1.5 billion for the treatment of nearly 5 billion episodes of child diarrhea with ORS, focusing on training health workers, promoting breastfeeding, and improving hygiene practices to reduce diarrhea prevalence among children by 42% to 46%. Handwashing with soap is crucial in reducing diarrhea prevalence among children, with USAID estimating a 42% to 46% decrease. However, it is not common in poorer communities where soap is mainly used for bathing or washing clothes. Public-private partnerships supported by USAID promote handwashing with soap and other hygienic practices, which can reduce diarrhea prevalence by 30% to 40%. WHO emphasizes the cost-effectiveness of measles immunization, saving more lives per unit cost than any other health intervention at less than $1 per dose. The measles vaccine is highly cost-effective, saving more lives per unit cost than any other health intervention. The vaccine, injection equipment, and operational costs amount to less than $1 per dose. The vaccine has been available for over 40 years and costs about $0.33 per bundled dose if bought through UNICEF. In many countries, the measles vaccine is often combined with rubella and/or mumps vaccines as a combined, live-attenuated vaccine. Immunization coverage rates for measles vaccination vary by region, with about 80% of all children vaccinated in 2006. In 2006, 80% of children were vaccinated, up from 72% in 2000. 478 million children received measles vaccinations from 2000 to 2006 in priority countries, leading to a 68% decrease in global measles mortality. USAID supports immunization programs globally, partnering with organizations like GAVI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. USAID collaborates with organizations like GAVI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to enhance countries' vaccine administration capabilities. Their maternal health programs focus on ensuring healthy pregnancy outcomes through various interventions, including nutritional supplementation, immunizations, and treatment for diseases like malaria and syphilis. USAID promotes skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care for home deliveries, training birth attendants to prevent infant deaths and promote immediate breastfeeding. Community-based interventions educate families on recognizing birth complications and accessing emergency care. USAID addresses key causes of maternal mortality by focusing on preventing postpartum hemorrhage, which accounts for 32% of maternal deaths. They train birth attendants to manage the third stage of labor, administer drugs to stop bleeding, and provide life-saving techniques. This includes controlled traction of the umbilical cord, uterine massage, and the use of oxytocin. USAID-supported programs train birth attendants to actively manage the third stage of labor to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. They use controlled traction of the umbilical cord, uterine massage, and oxytocin to slow blood flow, preventing 60% of hemorrhages. Additionally, unhygienic delivery practices contribute to sepsis, with unclean hands, herbs, or cloths being introduced into the vagina. USAID supports efforts to distribute delivery kits, ensure trained attendants are present at each birth, and train them to identify signs of infection and use antibiotics when necessary. USAID trains birth attendants to prevent sepsis in mothers and babies during childbirth. They also educate healthcare providers on recognizing and treating hypertensive disorders, pre-eclampsia, and eclampsia. Delivery complications like prolonged or obstructed labor can lead to obstetric fistula in low-resource settings. Obstetric fistula is a common consequence of prolonged or obstructed labor in low-resource settings, especially among undernourished young girls and women without access to obstetric care. In Kenya, 45% of fistula cases are among adolescents. Prevention includes delaying pregnancy until pelvic development, ensuring access to emergency obstetric care, and performing caesarean surgeries when necessary. USAID has supported fistula prevention and repair programs since 1989 and 2005, respectively, integrating them with other maternal health initiatives. Key activities involve increasing access to emergency obstetrical care, promoting the postponement of child marriage, and training healthcare providers to identify labor complications. Key activities to address maternal death and disability include increasing access to emergency obstetrical care, postponing child marriage, training healthcare providers to identify labor complications, and reducing stigma around obstetric fistula. Complications from unsafe abortions contribute to 13% of maternal deaths globally, with regional variations. USAID's international family planning programs have helped prevent an estimated 4 million maternal deaths in the last 20 years. Appropriations to USAID's global health programs, including HIV/AIDS, grew significantly from FY2001 to FY2003. From FY2001 to FY2003, appropriations to USAID's CS/MH programs grew by 8%, and overall support for global health programs increased by 28%. Majority of the growth came from HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, with funds directed to tuberculosis and malaria programs. Congress showed strong support for the Global Fund. Support for global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs dominated discussions from FY2004 to FY2008, with focus on PEPFAR. During discussions about USAID's health programs, Congress questioned the Administration's focus on HIV/AIDS funding through PEPFAR, urging better integration with other health programs like TB and nutrition. Appropriations for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria far exceeded support for child survival, maternal health, family planning, and reproductive health initiatives. Congress provided $19.7 billion for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs from FY2004 to FY2008, compared to $4.6 billion for other health programs. Congress has consistently increased funding for USAID's global health programs, particularly for specific diseases like HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria. However, funding for child survival, maternal health, and family planning initiatives has remained relatively unchanged, with concerns raised about underfunding in these areas, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Many are concerned that while the U.S. focuses on combating diseases like HIV/AIDS, other critical health programs for women and children in sub-Saharan Africa are being overlooked and underfunded. Suggestions include increasing funding for child survival and maternal health programs, as well as promoting voluntary family planning to improve overall health outcomes. Family planning can improve the health of children by spacing pregnancies, prevent HIV/AIDS with counseling and access to condoms, reduce abortions, and protect the environment by stabilizing population growth. Some oppose funding family planning due to concerns about abortions and coercive practices. Research shows that adolescent girls are at higher risk of complications and mortality during pregnancy and childbirth. Delaying pregnancy can prevent obstetric fistula, a condition prevalent among young girls in developing countries. Young girls and women in their twenties are at higher risk of complications and mortality during pregnancy and childbirth, with adolescents accounting for 45% of fistula cases in Kenya. Obstetric fistula can be prevented by delaying pregnancy until pelvic development is complete and providing necessary surgical interventions. However, the cost of repair is prohibitive for many in affected countries. Advocates suggest increasing health system spending to address maternal and child mortality by improving access to essential interventions and strengthening health systems with donor support. Improvements in safe drinking water and basic sanitation are crucial for public health. UNICEF emphasizes the need for donor support to strengthen health systems and deliver essential interventions like vaccinations effectively. Advocates urge Congress to coordinate health assistance with other donors and health ministries to improve efficiency. The International Health Partnership promotes creating compacts between donors and countries to ensure long-term financing for national health plans. The International Health Partnership promotes compacts between donors and countries to ensure long-term financing for national health plans. Critics highlight the importance of political will in health spending by developing countries. According to the IMF, lack of political will is a significant reason for unspent health funds. According to the IMF, lack of political will is a significant reason for unspent health funds. Health practitioners cite political will as the main reason for unspent health funds, with only 1% blaming IMF or World Bank restrictions. African leaders have pledged to increase spending on health, with the Abuja Declaration calling for at least 15% of national budgets to be allocated to healthcare. By 2004, 33% of AU States had allocated 10% or more of their national budgets to the health sector. Only Botswana reported spending at least 15% on health, while 33% of AU States allocated 10% or more of their national budgets to healthcare by 2004. Some argue that structural adjustment programs and conditional lending practices have hindered African governments' ability to increase investments in public health. This has led to a decline in the quality of education for medical students, shortages of health supplies, medicine, and vaccines, and a brain drain of African health workers. The International Development Research Center found that discussions on the impact of structural adjustment, conditional lending, and health reform on public health infrastructures are often biased. Results of these measures were mixed, with no clear consensus on the erosion of public expenditure on health. Bills introduced in the 110th Congress aimed to improve maternal and child health, including increased support by $5 million for FY2008. The Appropriations Act of 2008 increased support for maternal and child health by $5 million for FY2008, incorporated into P.L. 110-161. H.R. 5501 and S. 2731 authorized $50 billion and $48 billion for international HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria interventions, with a focus on providing maternal and child services. The House version emphasized linkages to NGOs for HIV/AIDS education and testing in family planning and maternal health programs. The Senate version of the bill did not include language on family planning. The Senate passed H.R. 5501 and S. 2731, focusing on global poverty reduction and maternal and child health. The House version emphasized family planning in HIV/AIDS education and testing programs. H.R. 2266 and S. 1418 aimed to improve the health of newborns, children, and mothers in developing countries. The House and Senate introduced bills focusing on global poverty reduction and maternal and child health. H.R. 1225 aims to improve voluntary family planning programs in developing countries. H.R. 2114 provides a U.S. contribution to the United Nations Population Fund for obstetric fistula prevention. H.R. 2604 supports the United Nations Population Fund in activities to save women's lives and promote family planning. The bill provides financial support to the United Nations Population Fund for activities to save women's lives, limit unsafe abortions, promote family planning, and improve lives in developing countries. It was referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Another bill authorizes funds to reduce child marriage. A resolution calls for reducing nuclear weapons and preventing their proliferation. The resolution aims to reduce nuclear weapons and prevent their proliferation, with estimated savings of up to $13 million annually. It directs a portion of these savings towards child survival, hunger, and universal education. Additionally, the House affirms its commitment to promoting maternal health and child survival through international investment and participation."
