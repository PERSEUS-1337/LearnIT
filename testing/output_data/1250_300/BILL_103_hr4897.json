When property forfeited by an individual is sold by the State, the proceeds are used to cover costs and pay off other claimants. Any remaining proceeds or owed amount for child support arrears are then paid to the State agency for distribution. Payment is suspended until confirmation of arrears, and the amount withheld is paid to the agency if arrears exist.
