The proposed Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC) algorithm integrates dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering in an unsupervised manner. It utilizes an autoencoder for initial cluster estimates and a novel temporal clustering layer for cluster assignment. The algorithm optimizes both clustering and dimensionality reduction objectives, with customizable temporal similarity metrics. A visualization method generates heat maps to understand learned features. DTC outperforms traditional methods on diverse timeseries data, showcasing its effectiveness in various domains. The algorithm outperforms traditional methods by integrating temporal dimensionality reduction and clustering criteria for unsupervised learning of time series data. While deep learning is dominant for supervised learning, unsupervised techniques are crucial for inferring from unlabeled data. Clustering approaches organize similar objects into clusters, but their extension to time series data remains a challenge. This gap in technology hinders accurate unsupervised learning of complex structures in time series data. The text discusses the challenges of applying clustering techniques to time series data and introduces a novel algorithm called deep temporal clustering (DTC) to address these issues. DTC transforms time series data into a low dimensional latent space using a deep autoencoder network integrated with a temporal clustering layer. The proposed deep temporal clustering (DTC) algorithm utilizes a deep autoencoder network integrated with a temporal clustering layer to transform time series data into a low dimensional latent space. The algorithm consists of three levels: a CNN to learn short-time-scale waveforms, a BI-LSTM to learn temporal connections across all time scales, and non-parametric clustering to identify spatio-temporal dimensions for data classification. The DTC algorithm utilizes deep autoencoder network with temporal clustering to transform time series data into a low dimensional latent space. It includes three levels: CNN for short-time-scale waveforms, BI-LSTM for temporal connections, and non-parametric clustering for data classification. The approach achieves high performance on various datasets without parameter adjustment and allows visualization of cluster-assignment activations across time. This is the first work on deep learning in temporal clustering, providing an end-to-end algorithm for meaningful temporal clustering. The study introduces an end-to-end deep learning algorithm for temporal clustering, focusing on effective latent representation and similarity metrics. The algorithm outperforms existing methods on real-world time series datasets, showcasing superior performance in both reconstruction and clustering losses. Previous research in temporal clustering has mainly addressed dimensionality reduction and similarity metric selection, with some solutions utilizing application-dependent reduction to filter out noise. The study focuses on addressing core issues in clustering methods, such as effective dimensionality reduction and choosing a suitable similarity metric. Two classes of solutions are discussed: one using application-dependent dimensionality reduction and the other creating a suitable similarity measure between time series. The latter approach incorporates features like complexity, correlation, and time warping into traditional clustering algorithms. Recent research has shown that selecting the right similarity measure is crucial for clustering time series data effectively. While various similarity metrics like complexity, correlation, and time warping have been studied, the choice of metric significantly impacts clustering results. However, simply having a good similarity measure may not be enough without proper dimensionality reduction due to the high-dimensional nature of time series data. Transforming time series data into a low-dimensional latent space has been found to be beneficial for temporal clustering, but there is a lack of a general methodology for selecting an effective latent space. To improve clustering results, it is essential to ensure that the similarity metric aligns with the temporal feature space. Recent advancements in clustering methods for static data have shown promising results by jointly optimizing dimensionality reduction using a stacked autoencoder and clustering with a k-means objective. Recent research has shown the importance of selecting the right similarity measure for clustering time series data effectively. Transforming time series data into a low-dimensional latent space is beneficial for temporal clustering. A proposed method involves using a temporal autoencoder (TAE) for generating cluster assignments based on latent high-level features. Effective latent representation is crucial for temporal clustering. The text discusses the use of a temporal autoencoder (TAE) to generate cluster assignments for time series data. The network architecture includes a 1D convolution layer followed by a max pooling layer and Bidirectional LSTM to obtain a compact latent representation. This representation is then used for clustering the input sequences. The text describes the use of a temporal autoencoder (TAE) to compress input sequences into a smaller latent space and assign them to clusters based on high-level features. The network architecture includes a 1D CNN and BI-LSTM for dimensionality reduction and clustering, driven by two cost functions: mean square error for sequence reconstruction and clustering metric for separating sequences into distinct clusters. The text discusses optimizing a network using a temporal autoencoder to cluster input sequences based on spatio-temporal behavior. By adjusting weights in the BI-LSTM and CNN, high-level features efficiently separate sequences into clusters, disentangling the dynamics. Unlike traditional methods focusing on reconstruction or clustering alone, end-to-end optimization improves unsupervised categorization by extracting spatio-temporal features that enhance data separability. The approach discussed involves end-to-end optimization using a temporal autoencoder to extract informative features from spatio-temporal data for clustering. By utilizing the temporal continuity of the data, the BI-LSTM network encodes features on all time scales, improving unsupervised categorization. The method initializes cluster centroids using latent signals obtained from the input data and performs hierarchical clustering to obtain clusters. The approach involves using a temporal autoencoder to extract features for clustering. Cluster centroids are initialized using latent signals, and hierarchical clustering is performed to obtain clusters. The centroids are updated using a loss function to maximize high confidence assignments. Probability assignments are computed using a similarity metric and normalized into probabilities using a Student's t distribution kernel. In the clustering layer, distances from centroids are computed using a similarity metric and normalized into probability assignments. The probability of input belonging to a cluster is determined using a Student's t distribution kernel. Various similarity metrics are experimented with, including Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) based on euclidean distance. In this study, various similarity metrics are experimented with, including Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) based on euclidean distance and Correlation based Similarity (COR) using pearson's correlation. The study explores different similarity metrics, such as Complexity Invariant Similarity (CID) based on euclidean distance and Correlation based Similarity (COR) using pearson's correlation. The Auto Correlation based Similarity (ACF) in BID7 calculates similarity using autocorrelation coefficients and weighted euclidean distance. The objective is to minimize KL divergence loss between q ij and target distribution p ij to train the temporal clustering layer iteratively. The text discusses the optimization of clustering and autoencoder by minimizing KL divergence loss and mean squared error loss. It emphasizes the importance of initializing cluster centroids effectively to reflect the latent representation of the data. Pretraining the autoencoder parameters and initializing cluster centers using hierarchical clustering are key steps in the process. The weights and cluster centers are updated using backpropagation mini-batch SGD, with the target distribution also being updated during each iteration. The text discusses updating autoencoder weights and cluster centers using gradients and backpropagation mini-batch SGD. It mentions the importance of identifying main data features and localizing them using a heatmap-generating network. This network is trained using cluster labels from a DTC network to classify inputs and generate heatmaps showing relevant parts of the inputs. The text discusses training a new hierarchical convolutional network using cluster labels from a DTC network to classify inputs and generate heatmaps showing relevant parts of the inputs. The network was implemented using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras on an Nvidia GTX 1080Ti graphics processor. The performance of the DTC algorithm was evaluated on various real-world datasets, including publicly available UCR Time Series Classification Archive datasets. The study utilizes publicly available UCR Time Series Classification Archive datasets and spacecraft magnetometer data from the NASA MMS Mission to detect flux transfer events. The DTC algorithm is compared against hierarchical clustering and k-Shape clustering methods. The study compares the DTC algorithm with hierarchical clustering and k-Shape clustering methods using four similarity metrics. Expert labels are used for evaluation, but the training pipeline is unsupervised. Evaluation metrics include ROC and AUC, with ROC curves averaged over 5 trials. Parameter optimization is avoided, and common parameters are used for DTC. The study uses ROC curves averaged over 5 trials. Parameter optimization is not feasible in unsupervised clustering, so common parameters are used for DTC. The network architecture includes 50 filters in the convolution layer, Bi-LSTM filters of 50 and 1, and a pooling size chosen for faster experimentation. Weights are initialized with a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. The autoencoder network is pre-trained using the Adam optimizer over 10 epochs. Temporal clustering centroids are initialized using hierarchical clustering. The deep architecture is jointly trained for clustering and autoencoder loss until convergence. Mini-batch size is 64 with a starting learning rate of 0.1, held constant across all experiments. The study uses common parameters for DTC, with a mini-batch size of 64 and a starting learning rate of 0.1. Results from the MMS dataset show that the joint training of reconstruction and clustering loss leads to superior performance compared to disjointed training. The algorithm accurately identifies events in time series data, with activation maps correlating well with event locations. The paper demonstrates that joint training of reconstruction and clustering loss in DTC outperforms disjoint training on the MMS dataset, with an average AUC of 0.93 vs. 0.88. Results show DTC improves baseline performance across various datasets and metrics, outperforming k-Shape. ROC comparisons further support DTC's effectiveness. In this work, DTC outperforms k-Shape on various datasets and metrics, showing robustness and superior performance. Results indicate high agreement between unsupervised clustering and human-labeled categories, promising utility in real-world applications. The approach converts complex temporal structures into a few-dimensional space spanned by cluster centroids, showing promise for real-world applications. Generalization to multichannel spatio-temporal input is straightforward and has been explored in detail in a separate paper."
