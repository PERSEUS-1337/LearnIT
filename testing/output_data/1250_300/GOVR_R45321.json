The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for DOT, while the Senate passed a bill providing $86.6 billion. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for FY2019, while the Senate bill proposed $86.6 billion. Most of DOT's funding comes from mandatory budget authority from trust funds, with only a small portion being discretionary authority. The Department of Transportation (DOT) receives funding primarily from trust funds, with around one-third to one-fourth being discretionary authority. The Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund typically provide around 90% of DOT's annual funding. In FY2018, there was a significant increase in discretionary funding. Approximately 80% of DOT's funding is distributed as grants to states, local authorities, and Amtrak. The Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for air traffic control, has the largest budget and employs 83% of DOT's employees. The Department of Transportation (DOT) primarily receives funding from trust funds, with a portion being discretionary authority. Most of the funding is distributed as grants, with the Federal Aviation Administration having the largest budget and employing 83% of DOT's employees. The highway, transit, and rail programs are authorized through FY2020, while the federal aviation programs face reauthorization in 2018. DOT's nonemergency annual funding has increased in recent years, but inflation-adjusted funding peaked in FY2010 and declined until FY2015 before rising again in FY2016. The Department of Transportation's funding has fluctuated over the years, reaching $86 billion in FY2018. Adjusting for inflation, funding peaked in FY2010 at $87.5 billion and declined until FY2015 before rising again in FY2016. Most federal highway and transit funding comes from the Highway Trust Fund, which has faced revenue shortfalls leading to transfers from the general fund of the Treasury. The Highway Trust Fund is facing a shortfall in revenue, with authorized outlays projected to be $54 billion while only $41 billion is expected to be available. To keep the fund solvent, Congress has transferred $143 billion from the general fund of the Treasury between FY2008-FY2016. The federal gas tax, unchanged since 1993, contributes to the shortfall as it is a fixed amount per gallon of fuel sold. Inflation and increasing fuel efficiency have reduced the tax's purchasing power, with the Congressional Budget Office forecasting flat gasoline consumption through 2024 due to improved vehicle efficiency offsetting increased miles driven. The Congressional Budget Office projects flat gasoline consumption through 2024 due to increased fuel efficiency offsetting more miles driven. Highway Trust Fund revenues are expected to be $39-41 billion annually, falling short of projected expenditures. Congress allocated $1.5 billion for national infrastructure grants in FY2018, with the Senate proposing $1 billion and the House recommending $750 million. The Senate Committee on Appropriations noted concerns about the Department of Transportation's selection criteria for grant recipients. The TIGER grant program, originally called \"national infrastructure investment,\" aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding. The program prohibits the Department of Transportation from using an applicant's willingness to create new nonfederal revenue sources as a selection criterion. It originated in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and aims to fund projects with national or regional impacts. The federal transportation funding system faces challenges in funding projects with national or regional impacts that disproportionately burden one or two states. The Amtrak Gateway Program exemplifies this issue, with the replacement of a deteriorating tunnel under the Hudson River requiring significant funding from New York and New Jersey. The BUILD program offers grants for projects of national significance in various modes on a competitive basis. The BUILD program provides grants for projects of national, regional, or metropolitan-area significance in various modes on a competitive basis, with funding going more towards regional and metropolitan-area projects. Congress has set low minimum grant thresholds and continues to support the program through annual DOT appropriations, although it is heavily oversubscribed. Critics have argued that TIGER grants disproportionately favor urban areas, leading Congress to direct at least 20% of funding to rural projects. In recent years, TIGER grants have faced criticism for favoring urban areas, leading Congress to allocate a portion of funding to rural projects. The House Appropriations Committee recommended that 33% of funding should go to rural areas in FY2019, with an additional 33% for projects around major seaports and the remaining 33% for urban areas over 200,000 in population. The grant appropriation process has shown a pattern of the Obama Administration requesting more funding than Congress provides, with the House proposing cuts and the Senate maintaining levels. The BUILD/TIGER grant appropriation process has followed a pattern in recent years, with the Obama Administration requesting more funding than Congress provides. In FY2018, the Trump Administration requested no funding, but Congress funded the program. The Essential Air Service program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority, with a mandatory annual authorization estimated at $140 million for FY2019. The Essential Air Service program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority. The Trump Administration requested $93 million in discretionary funding for the program in FY2019, $62 million less than FY2018. The House committee bill recommended $175 million, $20 million more than FY2018. The Senate-passed bill also recommends $175 million. The program aims to preserve commercial air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. The cost has doubled since FY2008 due to route reductions and new communities being added. The Essential Air Service program aims to preserve airline service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. The program's cost has doubled since FY2008, with changes made in 2012 to limit subsidies and allow smaller planes for communities with few passengers. Supporters argue that the program promotes economic development in rural areas, while critics point out high subsidy costs and low passenger numbers at some airports. The Essential Air Service program supports air service to small communities, promoting economic development in rural areas. Critics highlight high subsidy costs, low passenger numbers at some airports, and proximity to major airports. Congress mandated positive train control (PTC) installation by 2015, with an extension to 2018 and an option for further extension to 2020. Funding has been provided to assist railroads with PTC expenses. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget did not include funding for Positive Train Control (PTC) implementation. Congress has provided funding in recent years for PTC projects, with the House-reported bill specifying $150 million for PTC projects. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 reauthorized Amtrak and established new grant programs for intercity passenger rail development. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 reauthorized Amtrak and established new grant programs for intercity passenger rail development. Separate grants are now provided for operating and capital expenses for the Northeast Corridor and the national network. The FY2019 budget requested $738 million for intercity passenger rail funding, all for grants to Amtrak. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.9 billion for Amtrak and funding for new grant programs, including $150 million for PTC implementation projects. The Senate bill proposed $1.9 billion for Amtrak and $565 million for the new grant programs. The Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvement program allocated $1.9 billion for Amtrak and $565 million for new grant programs, prioritizing PTC projects. Congress historically provided little funding for intercity passenger rail development, except for brief periods in FY2009 and FY2010. Funding for intercity passenger rail development fluctuated from FY2011 to FY2018, with the majority of Federal Transit Administration funding going to state and local transit agencies. The Federal Transit Administration allocates funding to state and local transit agencies through various programs. The Capital Investment Grants program, also known as the New Starts program, is the largest discretionary grant program, funding new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions. It has three components: New Starts grants for projects over $300 million, Small Starts grants for projects under $300 million, and Core Capacity grants for increasing existing system capacity. Additionally, there is an Expedited Project Delivery Pilot program. The Capital Investment Grants program includes New Starts grants for projects over $300 million, Small Starts grants for projects under $100 million, and Core Capacity grants for increasing existing system capacity by at least 10%. There is also an Expedited Project Delivery Pilot program for eligible projects seeking no more than a 25% federal share. Grant funds for large projects are disbursed over years, with the Trump Administration requesting $1.0 billion for FY2019, $1.6 billion less than FY2018. The House Committee recommended $2.614 billion, slightly less than FY2018. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $2.614 billion for the Capital Investment Grants program, slightly less than the FY2018 amount. Congress has expressed concern over the Administration's stance on funding transit projects, as it has not requested funding for any new projects in its FY2018 or FY2019 budget requests. Congress has not supported the Administration's proposal to end federal assistance for new transit projects. Congress has not supported the Administration's proposal to end federal assistance for new transit projects. Both the House-reported bill and the Senate-passed bill for FY2019 would provide more than twice the amount requested by FTA for the CIG program. The Senate Appropriations Committee report expressed concern about FTA creating unnecessary delays for projects in the project development pipeline. The Senate Appropriations Committee report expressed concern about FTA creating delays for new transit projects in the project development pipeline. Transportation for America claims FTA is intentionally prolonging the project review process, leading to increased costs for project sponsors. FTA denies these allegations. The FTA is facing criticism for potentially delaying project reviews, leading to increased costs for sponsors. There are ongoing debates about the federal share for New Starts projects, with some advocating for a higher local match to support more projects with limited funding. Critics argue that the current federal share for highway projects is higher, making them more attractive than public transportation projects. Advocates argue that requiring a higher local match for New Starts funding can support more projects with limited funding and encourage careful cost estimation. Challenges in funding transportation infrastructure include the distribution of federal funding by mode, making it difficult for projects involving multiple modes to accumulate significant federal funding. This situation highlights the difficulty states face in accumulating funding for major projects while meeting other transportation needs. The Gateway Program, including the Hudson Tunnel replacement project, aims to enhance rail service between northern New Jersey and Manhattan. The program involves replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The estimated cost is at least $24 billion, with the new tunnel alone costing $11.1 billion. The existing tunnel is over a century old, deteriorating, and was flooded during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The estimated cost of the Gateway Program, including the new Hudson River Tunnel, is at least $24 billion. Funding for the project is limited, with competition for grants from the Capital Investment Grants program being intense. In 2016, an agreement was reached between DOT, Amtrak, and the States of New Jersey and New York to share the costs of building the new tunnel. The estimated cost of the Gateway Program, including the new Hudson River Tunnel, is at least $24 billion. In 2016, an agreement was reached between DOT, Amtrak, and the States of New Jersey and New York to share the costs of building the new tunnel. The Trump Administration does not feel bound by the previous agreement, and Congress would need to provide the funding. Both House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended significant funding for rail and transit grant programs that Gateway projects could be eligible for. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized grants to WMATA for preventive maintenance and capital projects. The Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized $1.5 billion over 10 years in grants to WMATA for maintenance and capital projects, in addition to around $310 million from FTA formula programs. The FY2018 grant was the final installment of the $1.5 billion funding commitment, with requests for $120 million in FY2019. Both House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended $150 million for FY2019, directing WMATA to continue working on extending the authorization for the grant. WMATA, local jurisdictions, and FTA are urged to extend the authorization for the grant. The House and Senate Appropriation Committees direct WMATA to implement wireless service throughout the rail system. WMATA faces maintenance backlog and safety concerns, leading to FTA restricting federal funds usage. FTA assumed safety oversight from the Tri-State Oversight Committee in 2015, conducting inspections and accident investigations. The agency overseeing WMATA safety performance was created by the governments of DC, Maryland, and Virginia. FTA conducts inspections, leads accident investigations, and ensures federal funds are used for safety improvements. FTA withheld 5% of FY2017 transit funds until a new safety oversight agency, the Metrorail Safety Commission, was established. The Commission must be operational for FTA to release funding. NTSB recommends FRA oversee WMATA's rail operations instead of FTA. Congress would need to act for this change to occur. The NTSB recommends that FRA, known for safety enforcement, oversee WMATA's rail operations instead of FTA, a grant management agency. Congress would need to authorize this change."
