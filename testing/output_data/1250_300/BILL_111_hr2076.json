Cost and impacts of security measures are also assessed, including land acquisition costs. The impacts of security measures assessed include land acquisition, construction, maintenance, contractor, management, wildlife, habitat, natural communities, cross-border wildlife migration corridors, hydrology, and costs of mitigating adverse impacts on various lands and waters. The curr_chunk discusses the costs of mitigating adverse impacts on various lands, waters, wildlife habitats, and residents near the border.
