    "content": "The U.S. agricultural sector heavily relies on trade, with exports accounting for 20% of total production. The U.S. plays a significant role in international agricultural markets, subjecting its farm policy to scrutiny for compliance with WTO rules. The farm bill, in place since the 1930s, locks in U.S. policy behavior and support programs, typically renewed every five or six years. The current omnibus farm bill is the Agricultural Act of 2014. The current omnibus U.S. farm legislation, known as the farm bill, was signed into law in 2014 and made significant changes to existing farm programs. The commodity programs of the 2014 farm bill are set to expire in 2018. The future of the farm bill may involve replacement, temporary extension, or lapse into \"permanent law.\" The WTO plays a role in shaping U.S. agricultural policy choices. The WTO shapes U.S. agricultural policy choices through commitments made as part of membership. It administers agreements, serves as a negotiating forum, and settles trade disputes. The Agreement on Agriculture and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures are key in governing domestic agricultural support. Violations of WTO rules may lead to challenges and potential changes in U.S. farm programs through new legislation. The WTO shapes U.S. agricultural policy through commitments made as part of membership, with potential changes in farm programs due to violations of WTO rules. Congress may need new legislation to ensure compliance with WTO agreements, especially regarding domestic subsidies in farm policies. Compliance with WTO rules can help avoid trade disputes and facilitate more open trade. The WTO's Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) categorizes and restricts agricultural domestic support programs based on their potential to distort markets. Amber box subsidies, which have the greatest potential to distort markets, are subject to spending limits, while more benign outlays are exempted under green box, blue box, de minimis, or special and differential treatment exemptions. The AoA provides detailed rules for classifying programs, calculating their cost using the Aggregate Measure of Support (AMS) index, and reporting to the WTO. The WTO categorizes agricultural domestic support programs based on their market-distorting potential. Green box programs are non-trade distorting, blue box programs are production-limiting, and amber box programs are the most market-distorting with strict spending limits. The United States has a spending limit of $19.1 billion for amber box outlays with de minimis exemptions. Prohibited programs include certain export and import subsidies. The WTO categorizes agricultural domestic support programs based on their market-distorting potential. Green box programs are non-trade distorting, blue box programs are production-limiting, and amber box programs are the most market-distorting with strict spending limits. De minimis exemptions are limited by 5% of the value of production. Prohibited programs include certain export and import subsidies. Each WTO member country is expected to submit notification reports on the implementation of their commitments for monitoring and compliance. The WTO's Committee on Agriculture reviews progress based on member notifications, which are posted on the WTO's official website for all members to review. The most recent U.S. notification to the WTO of domestic support outlays is for the 2015 crop year. The WTO categorizes agricultural domestic support programs based on their market-distorting potential. The most recent U.S. notification to the WTO of domestic support outlays is for the 2015 crop year. U.S. farm programs are subject to rules under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM), which detail when a subsidy is \"prohibited\" or \"actionable\" based on market distortion. Criteria for significant market distortions include the subsidy's share of farmer returns or production costs and the commodity's importance in world markets. The WTO evaluates agricultural subsidies for market distortions based on criteria like the subsidy's share of farmer returns, importance in world markets, and causal relationship with adverse effects. The SCM assesses market effects on international trade and market prices, including displacement of imports, exports, price suppression, and increase in market share. WTO dispute settlement panels review challenged farm programs under the SCM. The WTO evaluates agricultural subsidies for market distortions based on criteria like the subsidy's share of farmer returns, importance in world markets, and causal relationship with adverse effects. Under WTO rules, challenged subsidies found to be prohibited must be stopped or withdrawn without delay. The WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes provides a means for resolving disputes arising under WTO agreements through consultations and, if necessary, countermeasures. The WTO DSU allows members to resolve disputes through consultations and panel reviews. The United States has been involved in many complaints under the DSU. The U.S. is committed to limiting trade-distorting support under the AoA. The procedures for classifying such support are complex. The WTO's AoA sets a limit of $19.1 billion per year on trade-distorting support. Procedures for classifying such support are complex, with questions to determine if a farm measure exceeds the limit. Measures can be classified as \"green box\" or \"blue box\" policies, or as potentially trade-distorting \"amber box\" policies. Support may be excluded from the limit under the 5% de minimis exemption. The WTO's AoA sets a $19.1 billion limit on trade-distorting support, classified as \"green box,\" \"blue box,\" or potentially trade-distorting \"amber box\" policies. Support can be exempted under the 5% de minimis rule. Green box spending is not limited and must meet specific criteria to qualify for exemption. The green box criteria for agricultural programs require them to be publicly funded without providing price support to producers. Qualifying programs must benefit the agricultural community without direct payments to producers, including research, pest control, training, inspection services, marketing, and infrastructure development. The green box criteria for agricultural programs require public funding without providing price support to producers. Qualifying programs must benefit the agricultural community through advice, promotion, infrastructure development, and stockholding for food security. Domestic food aid and income support must have clearly defined eligibility criteria and be financially transparent. Income insurance eligibility is defined as agricultural income loss exceeding 30% of average gross income. Government financial participation in income insurance or safety net programs is based on agricultural income loss exceeding 30% of average gross income in the preceding three-year period. Payments compensate for less than 70% of income loss and are solely based on income, not production, price, or inputs. Total annual payments, including natural disaster relief, cannot exceed 100% of a producer's total loss. Natural disaster relief payments are determined by a production loss exceeding 30% in the preceding three-year period and apply only to income, livestock, land, or other production factors. Payments cannot exceed total replacement cost or require specific future production. Structural adjustment programs aim to assist producers in retiring from agricultural production or transitioning to nonagricultural activities. Eligibility is tied to specific criteria, with payments for resource retirement contingent on land being retired for at least three years and livestock being permanently disposed. Investment aids for structural adjustment must be determined through clearly defined programs. Environmental program payments are determined by specific criteria and eligibility is tied to government environmental or conservation programs. Payments cannot be tied to production type/quantity or prices, must be limited to compensate for structural disadvantages, and are contingent upon meeting specific requirements. Regional assistance program payments are limited to producers in a designated disadvantaged region based on specific criteria. Payments cannot be tied to production type/quantity or prices, must be made at a degressive rate, and are limited to extra costs or income loss in agriculture in the area. Payments under regional assistance programs must meet specific criteria to be eligible for exemption in the green box or blue box. In the green box, payments must not be tied to production or prices, must be degressive above a threshold level, and limited to extra costs or income loss in agriculture. In the blue box, payments must be under a production-limiting program based on fixed areas and yields, made on 85% or less of the base level of production, or on a fixed number of head for livestock. If these conditions are met, the program is exempt; otherwise, further evaluation is needed. The AoA outlines criteria for payments to be exempt from production-limiting programs in the green or blue box. If conditions are not met, payments are considered amber box policies, subject to evaluation based on the 5% de minimis rate for developed countries. Amber box programs may be excluded if their total cost is small relative to specific commodity value or total production. Product-specific domestic support must not exceed 5% of the total value of production to qualify for exclusion. Non-product-specific domestic support is exempt from inclusion under the AMS limit if it does not exceed 5% of the member's total agricultural production value. For example, in 2015, U.S. agricultural production was valued at $372.7 billion, and the 5% threshold for non-product-specific support was used to determine compliance. The United States has never exceeded its $19.1 billion amber box spending limit under the WTO agreement. In 2015, the U.S. notified $8.2 billion for non-product-specific support, which was exempted from inclusion under the AMS limit. If total U.S. AMS does not exceed $19.1 billion, the WTO commitment is met. In 2015, the United States did not exceed its $19.1 billion amber box spending limit under the WTO agreement. The 2014 farm bill includes a provision to adjust program outlays to avoid breaching the AMS limit. The SCM rules come into play when a domestic farm policy affects international markets. The United States, as a major player in agricultural markets, must ensure its farm policies do not distort international trade. The WTO may challenge programs that negatively impact other members, even if they comply with spending limits. The Doha Round of WTO negotiations aimed to reform agricultural trade, with discussions resuming in 2011 after an impasse in 2009. The structure of spending limits in the amber, blue, and green boxes encourages countries to design farm support programs that are green box compliant. Negotiations for agricultural trade reform in the WTO, known as the Doha Round, began in 2001 and resumed in 2011 after an impasse. The U.S. aims for substantial reductions in trade-distorting support while preserving green box policies. Other countries will evaluate U.S. farm policy options for compliance with WTO commitments and negotiating positions. Congress may seek domestic farm policy measures that align with U.S. objectives in WTO negotiations.
