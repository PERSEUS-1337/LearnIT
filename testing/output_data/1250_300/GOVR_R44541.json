Financial institutions can be involved in TBML schemes when used to settle international trade transactions. The U.S. Department of the Treasury issued reports on money laundering in June 2015, highlighting trade-based money laundering (TBML) as a significant challenge. TBML schemes can launder billions of dollars annually, with over 17,000 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) describing potential TBML activity totaling more than $276 billion. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers also use the international financial system and physical cash movement to disguise their activities. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves criminal organizations and terrorist financiers exploiting the international trade and finance system to obscure transactions, co-mingling legitimate and illicit funds, and misrepresenting goods during cross-border trade. TBML techniques are used in combination with other money laundering methods to further conceal the money trail. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves criminal organizations and terrorist financiers using techniques like over- and under-invoicing of goods and services to obscure transactions and misrepresent goods during cross-border trade. This method is commonly used to launder funds across borders by manipulating prices to shift value between parties, requiring collusion and having significant tax implications. Over- and under-invoicing, multiple invoicing, and over- and under-shipments of goods and services are common techniques used in trade-based money laundering. These activities involve manipulating prices, quantities, and transactions to obscure the true value of goods and services, complicating detection efforts by officials. Trade-based money laundering involves various techniques such as over- and under-shipments, falsely described goods and services, and manipulating prices to hide the true value of transactions. One classic scheme is the Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE), used by Colombian drug traffickers in the 1980s to launder billions in drug profits through trade-based methods. The Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE) emerged as a major money-laundering method in the 1980s, disguising up to $4 billion in annual narcotics profits from Latin America. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) is recognized as a common form of international money laundering and a method used by terrorist organizations. TBML, less understood than traditional methods, can have significant consequences for global trade and government revenue. ICE HSI warns that transnational criminal organizations may sell imported goods bought with illicit funds at discounted prices. TBML can have a more destructive impact on legitimate commerce than other money laundering schemes. Transnational criminal organizations may dump imported goods purchased with illicit proceeds at a discount into a market to expedite the money laundering process, creating a barrier to entrepreneurship and robbing governments of tax revenue. Global trends in trade have facilitated criminal organizations in hiding gains from illegal activities. Global trends in trade, driven by advances in communications and lower transportation costs, have created interconnected economies and societies, offering criminal organizations new markets to diversify into profitable illicit activities. Organized crime has expanded into new markets to reduce risks and exploit global market opportunities, as highlighted in a report by the OECD. This illicit trade poses challenges for law enforcement and facilitates the flow of illegal financial transactions. The OECD highlighted the challenges posed by illegal trade and financial flows, emphasizing the potential economic and development consequences. Criminal organizations and terrorist groups can exploit the international trade system due to its vulnerabilities, including the enormous volume of trade flows and complexity of foreign exchange transactions. According to FinCEN, trade-based money laundering (TBML) is on the rise globally, with most activity identified in transactions involving Mexico, China, Panama, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela. Limited resources and verification procedures in customs agencies contribute to the challenge of detecting illegal trade transactions. Countries with rapid growth in potential TBML activity include Afghanistan, Australia, Belize, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, China, Colombia, Greece, Guatemala, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, the Philippines, Singapore, Saint Maarten, Switzerland, Taiwan, UAE, Uruguay, Venezuela, and the West Bank and Gaza. TBML is associated with significant losses in customs and tax revenue, circumvention of capital restrictions, corruption of authorities, exploitation of free trade zones, laundering of proceeds from black market goods, and trade in gold and gems. Anecdotal case studies have highlighted these issues in recent years. The Treasury Department's June 2015 National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment stated that terrorist financing through trade-based money laundering (TBML) is not a dominant method, with cash movement and banking system transfers being more prevalent. Anecdotal case studies have shown instances of known terrorist groups using TBML, but it accounts for a smaller percentage compared to other methods. The Treasury Department's National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment found that cash movement accounted for 28 percent of cases, while banking system transfers constituted 22 percent. Licensed MSBs and unlicensed money transmitters made up 17 percent and 18 percent, respectively. TBML was identified as a terrorism-related concern in Tunisia and Syria, involving hawala brokers and corrupt officials. Hawala is an informal fund transfer method used in regions with limited banking presence, relying on a network of trusted brokers for transactions. Settlements among hawaladars do not always involve financial institutions. Unregulated hawala systems, used by money brokers for quick and low-cost fund transfers, are perceived as lacking transparency and vulnerable to abuse by terrorist groups. The State Department's 2016 report highlighted specific countries vulnerable to trade-based money laundering and terrorist financing schemes, such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Lebanon. In Lebanon, individuals are involved in a scheme involving trade in vehicles and weapons to launder drug proceeds linked to Hezbollah. In Lebanon, individuals are involved in a TBML scheme with trade in vehicles and weapons to launder drug proceeds linked to Hezbollah. U.S. law enforcement identified money wires from Jordanian and Lebanese entities to domestic vehicle dealerships, with funds used to purchase vehicles exported to Lebanon and Jordan, sometimes containing weapons. TBML schemes are prevalent in Paraguay's Tri-Border Area, where the cross-border cigarette smuggling market is used for money laundering, benefiting criminal organizations and potentially terrorist groups. The cross-border cigarette smuggling market, valued at around $1 billion annually, is utilized for money laundering, benefiting criminal organizations and potentially terrorist groups. The Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB) was designated as a primary money-laundering concern by the Department of the Treasury in 2011, with Hezbollah allegedly receiving financial support from drug and money laundering schemes involving trade-based money laundering. The Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB) laundered hundreds of millions of dollars monthly through accounts held at LCB and trade-based money laundering schemes involving consumer goods worldwide. This included purchasing used cars in the US, shipping them to West Africa, and repatriating the proceeds to Lebanon. LCB's banking license was revoked in 2011, and its assets were sold to another Lebanese bank. The Banque du Liban revoked LCB's banking license in 2011, and its assets were sold to another Lebanese bank. Individuals associated with an illicit network received cash payments from narcotics trafficking, laundered through a BMPE scheme. Woody Toys, Inc. in Los Angeles received cash payments and used them to purchase toys from China, which were exported to Colombia. Colombian pesos from toy sales were used to reimburse drug traffickers through the BMPE. Toys from China purchased by Woody Toys in Los Angeles were exported to Colombia, where Colombian pesos from sales were used to reimburse drug traffickers through a BMPE scheme. Some employees of Woody Toys had ties to Angel Toy Company, also involved in a similar scheme. An investigation benefitted from information sharing between the US and Colombia through Trade Transparency Units. Another money laundering scheme in the early 2000s involved cash couriers, money transfer services, and trade finance managed by an Indian national in Dubai with businesses worldwide. The Indian national in Dubai operated trade finance schemes involving inflated export values and drug trafficking funds, moving money through the financial system under the guise of trade financing. The funds were remitted to exporters in India, who distributed the proceeds to affiliates and sold the exports at market value. The Indian national in Dubai operated trade finance schemes involving inflated export values and drug trafficking funds, moving money through the financial system under the guise of trade financing. Funds were remitted to exporters in India, who distributed the proceeds to affiliates and sold the exports at market value. Additionally, the individual used various techniques to move funds offshore through hawala operators, facilitating trade in banned goods by falsifying trade documents. U.S. government policy responses to address trade-based money laundering include participation in the Financial Action Task Force, Treasury Department regulatory responses, and the use of Trade Transparency Units by the Department of Homeland Security. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was established to develop AML/CFT guidelines and currently has 34 member countries. FATF relies on self-assessments and mutual evaluations to ensure compliance with its guidelines, with the ability to suspend non-compliant members. Since 1989, FATF has been focused on combating money laundering, issuing 40 recommendations in 1990. The U.S. delegation to FATF, led by the Treasury Department's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, works to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit financing threats globally. The U.S. delegation to the FATF, led by the Treasury Department's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, plays a key role in combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit financing threats globally. The delegation includes members from various government departments and implements actions domestically to meet U.S. commitments to the FATF. In 2012, FATF members adopted revised recommendations to deepen global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats. The FATF has revised its guidelines to strengthen global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats, enhance partnerships with the private sector, and raise standards in low capacity countries. The new standards focus on addressing new and emerging threats, improving transparency requirements for beneficial ownership, and enhancing measures for higher-risk situations. Recommendations to counter trade-based money laundering are not included in the current set of FATF 40 Recommendations. The FATF has occasionally issued stand-alone reports addressing trade-based money laundering (TBML) and best practices, but there is no comprehensive data on the extent of the issue. Most jurisdictions do not identify TBML separately under money laundering and lack training to detect TBML activities. FATF recommends developing training for detecting TBML. Most jurisdictions lack specific training on TBML activities, but the FATF recommends developing training programs focused on financial and trade data analysis to detect trade anomalies and criminal activities. FinCEN issues advisories and special measures to combat TBML, red-flagging activities indicative of money laundering for financial institutions to file SARs. FinCEN first highlighted TBML in 1997 and issued advisories in 1999 and 2010 based on U.S. trade with Central and South America. In November 1997 and June 1999, FinCEN highlighted TBML and issued advisories on BMPE. In February 2010, an advisory was issued to aid financial institutions in reporting suspicious TBML activity. The advisory outlined basic TBML schemes, specific red flags, and requested the inclusion of TBML or BMPE on SARs. In May 2014, an updated advisory on TBML involving funnel accounts was issued, providing red flags associated with Mexican criminal and drug trafficking activities. In recent years, FinCEN has relied on Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) to combat criminal activity, including trade-based money laundering (TBML). GTOs impose recordkeeping and reporting requirements on financial institutions in specific geographic areas for up to 180 days. Violators may face civil or criminal penalties. For example, in April 2015, a GTO was issued for Miami-based electronics exporters to lower cash reporting thresholds and enhance monitoring of financial transactions. In April 2015, FinCEN issued a GTO that lowered cash reporting thresholds to $3,000 for Miami-based electronics exporters to combat TBML schemes by drug and transnational crime organizations. The GTO required businesses to report transactions exceeding $3,000 in cash. In October 2015, FinCEN renewed the GTO for an additional 180 days. Another GTO was issued in October 2015 for Los Angeles Fashion District businesses to deter drug traffickers engaging in BMPE schemes. FinCEN took action against suspected drug traffickers using fashion industry businesses for BMPE schemes, under the BSA and USA PATRIOT Act. Special measures can range from enhanced due diligence to prohibiting certain accounts. Treasury Department, including OFAC, also takes administrative actions. Two Lebanese exchange houses were designated for TBML involvement. In April 2013, FinCEN designated two Lebanese exchange houses, Halawi Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange, for their involvement in TBML. The exchange houses facilitated transactions related to a large-scale TBML scheme, including the purchase of used cars in the US for export to West Africa. They were also linked to money laundering for an international narcotics trafficking network associated with Hezbollah. ICE/HSI established the first Trade Transparency Unit in Washington, DC in 2004 to identify instances of TBML and customs fraud using specialized computer systems. In 2004, ICE/HSI established the first Trade Transparency Unit in Washington, DC to identify TBML and customs fraud using specialized computer systems. TTUs examine trade anomalies and financial irregularities in domestic and foreign trade data to uncover instances of TBML, customs fraud, contraband smuggling, and tax evasion. The State Department aims to develop an international network of TTUs similar to the Egmont Group of FIUs, with funding support from the Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. The 2007 National Money Laundering Strategy prioritizes attacking TBML at home and abroad, calling for ICE-led TTUs to facilitate the exchange and analysis of trade data among trading partners. The number of TBML investigations stemming from TTU activity is increasing, with over $1 billion seized since the establishment of the U.S.-led TTUs. The State Department reports that TBML investigations are growing from TTU activity, with over $1 billion seized since the establishment of U.S.-led TTUs. The 114th Congress has addressed TBML in hearings related to specific terrorist groups like Hezbollah and regional security priorities in Latin America. Witnesses have questioned the effectiveness of U.S. and international efforts to combat TBML, including the role and resources allocated to TTUs. Trade policy negotiations and free trade agreements could be linked to mutual commitments to combat TBML. The 114th Congress has shown interest in the links between TBML and terrorist financing, with concerns raised about Hezbollah's involvement in TBML schemes. In December 2015, the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 was enacted to impose additional financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial institutions. The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 imposed financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial institutions with U.S. accounts. President Obama committed to countering Hezbollah's activities through sanctions. The Treasury Department plans to implement the Act robustly while preserving the Lebanese financial system. Congress may monitor the Act's implementation and other financial tools against TBML. Congress may monitor the implementation of the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 and other financial tools to address trade-based money laundering (TBML) while preserving the strength and health of the Lebanese financial system. Hearings in the 114th Congress have discussed TBML, including a specific hearing on the topic titled \"Trading with the Enemy: Trade-Based Money Laundering is the Growth Industry in Terror Finance.\" The House Financial Services Committee and House Homeland Security Committee have held hearings on various aspects of terrorism financing, including trends, prevention of cultural genocide, and the state of the international financial system. These hearings aim to address terror funding streams, coordinated government efforts, and current terrorist financing trends. The House Financial Services Committee and House Homeland Security Committee have conducted hearings on terrorism financing, including the prevention of cultural genocide and the state of the international financial system. The hearings address terror funding streams, government efforts, and current trends in terrorist financing. The House Financial Services Committee, House Foreign Affairs Committee, Senate Judiciary Committee, and House Homeland Security Committee have conducted hearings on terrorism financing, including various aspects such as trade-based money laundering, terrorist financing through kidnapping and antiquities trafficking, immigration enforcement policies, and international security programs. The Security Committee, Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, House Financial Services Committee, Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing, House Judiciary Committee, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and House Foreign Affairs Committee have conducted hearings on various aspects of terrorism financing and border security. The House Foreign Affairs Committee held hearings on Iran and Hezbollah in the Western Hemisphere on March 18, 2015. The House Financial Services Committee also had a hearing on the state of the international financial system on March 17, 2015."
