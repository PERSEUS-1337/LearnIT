    "content": "The most recent multi-year authorization for federal surface transportation programs, SAFETEA-LU, expired in 2009. Since then, programs have operated on extensions due to constrained financial resources. The highway trust fund, funded by gasoline and diesel taxes, has declined, leading to debates on passing a bill without cutting spending, raising taxes, or increasing the deficit. Alternative finance and tolling are also key issues in the ongoing debate. The ongoing debate in Congress revolves around passing a multi-year bill for surface transportation programs without cutting infrastructure spending, raising the gas tax, or increasing the budget deficit. Other issues being discussed include alternative finance, tolling, public-private partnerships, project delivery acceleration, and performance management. The distribution of federal spending among states is also a concern, with challenges in resolving equity due to forecasted revenues. The Senate passed MAP-21 in 2012 to reauthorize surface transportation programs for two years. The House committees reported favorably on H.R. 7, a five-year bill authorizing $260 billion for surface transportation programs. The bill includes provisions to increase oil and gas production to fund highway infrastructure, controversially discontinuing mass transit funding from Highway Trust Fund revenues. The House also passed the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012, Part II, extending authorizations through FY2012. The House passed the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012, Part II (H.R. 4348) on April 18, 2012, extending surface transportation authorizations through the end of FY2012. The Senate later replaced the House language with MAP-21, leading to negotiations involving the entire substance of H.R. 7 and provisions of the extension bill. Transportation reauthorization is a complex issue before Congress. Negotiations will involve the entire substance of H.R. 7 and provisions of the extension bill. Surface transportation reauthorization is complex due to multiple committees involved. The highway trust fund is financed through various sources, with the majority coming from excise taxes on motor fuels. The fund consists of separate accounts for highways and mass transit, with specific allocations from fuel taxes. Fuel taxes do not adjust for inflation as they are set in cents per gallon. The highway trust fund is facing a shortfall due to stagnant fuel tax revenues and increased expenses. The fund has required transfers from the general fund to cover costs, and projections show a significant gap in funding through 2022. The mass transit account is also at risk of running out of funds. The CBO projections indicate a significant shortfall in the highway account, with a gap of $8 to $9 billion per year through 2022. The mass transit account is projected to fall into a negative $1.2 billion shortfall by the end of FY2014, with further deepening deficits in the following years. Without an increase in fuel taxes, policymakers must find new revenue sources for transportation or settle for a smaller program. The Federal-Aid Highway Program faces financial challenges and administrative issues. The Federal-Aid Highway Program (Highway Program) is a state-run program administered by FHWA, with states determining spending but following federal guidelines. Projects require a state/local matching share, with Interstate System projects at 10% and other roads at 20%. Funds are distributed through FHWA notifications, not upfront payments to states. Managing the Highway Program involves distributing funds through FHWA notifications, apportioning funds among states, allocating funds for specific projects, and providing reimbursement once a project is approved and costs are incurred. Contract authority allows for obligation without an appropriation, and limitation on obligations controls annual spending. This system is designed to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in the program. The FHWA legally commits the federal government to reimburse states for project costs using contract authority. Limitation on obligations (ObLim) controls annual spending, similar to an appropriation. Formula programs allocate funds annually based on legislation factors, while discretionary programs are smaller and allocated by FHWA or Congress. SAFETEA apportions the majority of federal-aid highway funds to state DOTs through core formula programs, which fund most projects. The majority of federal-aid highway funds are allocated to state DOTs through core formula programs like Interstate Maintenance Program, National Highway System, Surface Transportation Program, Highway Bridge Program, and others. State DOTs have flexibility to transfer funds between programs, reducing the importance of funding formulas and program eligibility. Some funding may also be used for transit projects. The Equity Bonus Program ensures each state receives a minimum share of funds regardless of funding formulas, diluting core program rationales. Smaller discretionary highway programs are also part of the Federal-Aid Highway Program, earmarked by Congress during SAFETEA. During SAFETEA, smaller discretionary highway programs, known as \"allocated\" programs, are part of the Federal-Aid Highway Program. These programs, controlled by FHWA, allocate funds through competition. The federal transit program, managed by FTA, consists of various programs with different funding amounts and distribution mechanisms. Four main federal transit programs in SAFETEA make up 85% of authorized transit funding, with funding distributed by formula in some programs. The Urbanized Area Formula Program and Fixed Guideway Modernization Program are two of the main federal transit programs in SAFETEA, accounting for 85% of authorized transit funding. The Urbanized Area Formula Program provides funding to urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more, while the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program funds mainly go towards replacing and rehabilitating transit rail system assets. The New Starts Program and Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Capital Program are discretionary programs, with New Starts funding primarily available for new fixed guideway systems and extensions. Transit funding in SAFETEA is primarily available on a competitive basis for new fixed guideway systems and extensions. New Starts funding has historically supported transit rail projects but also includes busways, bus rapid transit, ferries, automated guideway systems, and vintage trolleys. A \"Small Starts\" program was established to fund projects costing $250 million or less, with a federal share of $75 million or less. Small Starts projects receive $200 million annually from the New Starts authorization starting in FY2007. Bus Program funds, 9% of authorized funding, are used for buses, equipment, and building construction. Various smaller funding programs, such as the Rural Formula Program and JARC program, also contribute to transit projects. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) allocates funds for transit programs, including the Rural Formula Program, Jobs Access and Reverse Commute (JARC) program, Elderly and Disabilities grants program, and New Freedom Program. Highway safety is a major concern in the United States, with federal highway safety programs administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), and FHWA. NHTSA provides grants to states to improve driver behavior and vehicle safety. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) provides grants to states for traffic safety efforts, regulates vehicle safety, and oversees federal grant funds. States must submit approved highway safety plans to receive funds, identifying safety problems, setting goals, and establishing performance measures. NHTSA also offers training and technical assistance to states through various grant programs. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) administers safety grant programs to support state efforts in improving traffic safety, reducing speeding, increasing seat belt usage, and discouraging unsafe driving behaviors. The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) aims to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries by enhancing roadway design and operation. Each state receives funding based on road lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and traffic volume. HSIP is a federal-aid highway funding program aimed at reducing traffic fatalities and injuries through roadway improvements. States receive funding based on road metrics and traffic data, with set-asides for railway-highway crossings and high-risk rural roads. SAFETEA established funding protections to ensure consistent annual levels for highway and mass transit projects. SAFETEA established funding protections to ensure consistent annual levels for highway and mass transit projects, preventing appropriators from setting lower funding levels. The guarantees were maintained through the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, with additional protection via the House rules. However, the House eliminated the rule in the 112th Congress, removing the last vestige of the guarantees. RABA allows for adjustments in funding levels based on annual highway account receipts, but Congress has never allowed a reduction in spending despite revenues consistently falling below guarantee levels. Despite revenues consistently falling below guarantee levels, Congress has never allowed a reduction in spending based on RABA calculations. The Budget Control Act requires sequestration of certain funding authorizations if a special joint committee fails to reach an agreement on spending reductions, but exemptions likely mean that sequestration would not significantly reduce surface transportation spending beyond FY2012. Exemptions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 suggest that sequestration would not greatly reduce surface transportation spending beyond FY2012. Certain programs like Federal-Aid Highways and Transit Formula Grants are exempt, but the $739 million annual contract authority may be subject to sequester. The Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program could also be affected. SAFETEA expired in 2009, and surface transportation programs have been operating on extension legislation. The Surface Transportation programs have been operating on extension legislation since SAFETEA expired in 2009. The House-passed STEA-II bill extends the HTF authorization and federal transportation programs until September 30, 2012. The Senate replaced the House language with MAP-21, leading to a conference between the two chambers. Negotiations will involve the substance of H.R. 7, with provisions needing to fall within the scope of differences between the House and Senate versions. The conference on H.R. 4348 will involve the substance of H.R. 7, with provisions needing to fall within the scope of differences between the House and Senate versions. Members may raise issues on the allowable scope for conference. Conference reports with out-of-scope provisions may face points of order in both chambers. The STEA-II bill includes provisions unrelated to surface transportation programs, such as the North American Energy Access Act. Title II of the STEA-II bill includes provisions from the North American Energy Access Act, transferring permitting authority for the Keystone XL pipeline and establishing the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund funded by Deepwater Horizon-related penalties. The Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, financed by penalties from the Deepwater Horizon incident, would distribute revenues to Gulf Coast states, the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, and for research. H.R. 4348 requires a future act of Congress for revenue distribution, unlike S. 1400. Title V adds provisions for coal residuals management. Title V of the bill includes provisions from the Coal Residuals Reuse and Management Act, allowing states to implement coal combustion residuals permit programs. Title VI incorporates Title III of H.R. 7, focusing on accelerating transportation project delivery. Both House and Senate bills aim to expedite project delivery and reduce highway programs. MAP-21, a two-year reauthorization bill, makes significant changes to the federal highway program's structure, formulas, and funding distribution. It authorizes $39.5 billion for FY2012 and $40.5 billion for FY2013 for the Federal-Aid Highway Program, with $400 million allocated for research and education each fiscal year. MAP-21 eliminates formula factors under individual formula programs. MAP-21 authorizes $39.5 billion for FY2012 and $40.5 billion for FY2013, with $400 million allocated for research and education each year. It eliminates formula factors under individual programs, apportioning funds based on state shares from FY2005-FY2009. This change reduces congressional influence on project selection, shifting focus to federal planning and performance management. MAP-21 would bring significant changes to transportation funding, reducing the number of programs by two-thirds and shifting program eligibility to core programs. Discretionary grant programs under FHWA control would be eliminated, with the Transportation Enhancements Program rolled into the CMAQ program. A National Freight Program aims to increase funding for freight projects by removing competition with non-freight projects. The bill also allows states to use TE funds for non-TE CMAQ uses under certain conditions. The Senate bill proposes funding increases for transportation projects, including a ten-fold increase in the TIFIA program. However, there is little mention of tolling on federally funded roads and bridges. The House bill suggests modest increases in federal-aid highways funding and the consolidation of various programs into the National Highway System and Surface Transportation Programs. The House bill proposes folding existing Interstate Maintenance and Highway Bridge programs into the National Highway System and Surface Transportation Programs, reducing the number of programs by two-thirds. The Equity Bonus program guarantees a 94% state rate of return on payments to the HTF. The Mass Transit Account would be renamed the Alternative Transportation Account, providing funding for mass transit and highway programs. NEPA requirements would change for federal highway and transit projects, with exemptions for projects under $10 million or with federal funding below 15% of total costs. TIFIA funding would increase nearly ten-fold under the House bill. The House bill proposes changes to federal highway and transit projects, including exemptions for projects under $10 million or with federal funding below 15% of total costs. TIFIA funding would increase nearly ten-fold. MAP-21 provisions include funding for the Federal Transit Administration and its programs, with the HTF providing 79.9% of the funding. Funding for transit programs would be set at $10.458 billion annually for FY2012-FY2013. The State of Good Repair program would replace the Fixed Guideway Modernization Program, and the Bus and Bus Facilities program would be eliminated, with a remnant program providing competitive grants for bus upkeep. H.R. 7 would authorize $10.458 billion for FY2012 and $10.498 billion annually for FY2013 through FY2016. H.R. 7 proposes changes to federal highway and transit projects, including renaming the Mass Transit Account to the Alternative Transportation Account (ATA) and redirecting motor fuel taxes to the Highway Account. It would authorize $10.458 billion for FY2012 and $10.498 billion annually for FY2013 through FY2016. The bill eliminates various programs like the Clean Fuels Grant Program and combines others into a single program. MAP-21 includes provisions for a national rail plan, rolling stock equipment pool, and positive train control for freight rail. MAP-21 includes provisions for a national rail plan, rolling stock equipment pool, and positive train control for both passenger and freight rail. The bill also amends the RRIF program to accept state or local subsidies as collateral and makes modest changes to laws affecting rail freight enforced by the Surface Transportation Board. The finance title of the Senate bill extends highway-related taxes through FY2015 and provides revenue offsets for the Highway Trust Fund. The Senate bill extends highway-related taxes through FY2015 and highway trust fund expenditure authority through FY2013. It includes provisions to raise revenue for the HTF, including transfers from various sources totaling $13.872 billion over ten-and-a-half fiscal years. The curr_chunk discusses various revenue sources, including import tariffs on automotive products, changes in tax treatment of securities, clarification on IRS levy, pension funding stabilization, transfers to the Highway Trust Fund, phased retirement options for federal agencies, and reporting of life insurance policies sales. These sources are projected to generate a total of $15.542 billion over ten years. The curr_chunk outlines various revenue provisions totaling $15.542 billion over ten years, including funds from import tariffs, tax treatment changes, pension stabilization, and transfers to the Highway Trust Fund. Additionally, offsets and revenue provisions have raised concerns as they exceed the needed amount to offset the HTF revenue and MAP-21 spending levels, potentially allowing for deficit reduction or increased spending. The Finance Committee reported favorably on provisions costing money, including changes to small issuer exceptions, bonds not treated as tax preference, extensions for employer-provided benefits, and exemptions for water and sewage treatment facility bonds. The Senate bill also includes provisions for TRIP bonds and transportation access. The bill includes provisions for TRIP bonds and transportation access, with changes to the depreciation period for long-term highway leases and the amortization period for toll collection rights. The Finance Committee expressed concerns about the current law's amortization period being shorter than the lease term. The bill also establishes a \"solvency account\" for the Secretary of Transportation. The finance provision in the bill establishes a \"solvency account\" for the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer excess amounts appropriated to the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) under MAP-21 before October 1, 2013. These excess amounts would be made available for transfers to both the highway account and mass transit account to maintain a financial cushion of $2.8 billion each. The Senate bill proposes using the LUST trust fund as a new revenue source for the HTF, which was established in 1986 to address groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. The LUST trust fund, funded by a tax on gasoline and diesel fuels, supports environmental contamination investigation and cleanup programs related to leaking underground storage tanks. Over 85% of reported releases have been addressed, but there is still a backlog of 88,000 releases requiring cleanup. The fund's use was expanded in 2005 to include federal UST leak prevention and detection programs. The LUST trust fund, supported by fuel taxes, addresses environmental contamination from leaking underground storage tanks. 85% of reported releases have been addressed, leaving 88,000 requiring cleanup. The fund had a $3.392 billion balance in FY2012, with estimated interest and tax receipts. States receive grants from the fund, while EPA uses the remainder for program implementation. Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion to the highway trust fund in FY2012. The Senate bill proposes transferring $3.0 billion from the LUST trust fund to the highway trust fund in FY2012. Additionally, future LUST trust fund receipts from fuel taxes would be appropriated to the highway trust fund, providing an estimated $3.685 billion over ten years. The bill also extends the LUST trust fund expenditure authority through September 30, 2013, and reauthorizes HTF expenditure authority through FY2016. Highway taxes, including motor fuel taxes, would be extended through FY2018. H.R. 7, reported in 2012, reauthorizes HTF expenditure authority through FY2016 and extends existing highway taxes through FY2018. The bill requires all transfers from the general fund to the HTF to be fully offset. It aims to fill revenue gaps and amend the Internal Revenue Code to extend the LUST trust fund. Unlike the Senate bill, H.R. 7 does not allocate balances or revenues from the LUST trust fund to the Highway Trust Fund. H.R. 7 extends the LUST trust fund until October 1, 2016, and directs federal revenues from energy leasing and production into the Highway Trust Fund. The bill also addresses offshore energy development under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The Department of the Interior leases rights for oil and gas development in federal ocean areas for upfront payments, rentals, and royalties. Federal receipts from offshore oil and gas totaled $6.5 billion in FY2011. Current law allocates receipts to various programs, including the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the National Historic Preservation Fund. H.R. 7 renames the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and provides a one-time $40 billion appropriation. H.R. 7 renames the mass transit account to the alternative transportation account and provides a one-time $40 billion appropriation. It transfers motor fuels taxes to the highway account and proposes total authorizations of $80.8 billion over two years. MAP-21 eliminates the Equity Bonus Program and includes provisions for highway spending controls. MAP-21 includes provisions for highway spending controls to ensure the solvency of the highway account of the HTF. The \"ratchet mechanism\" requires adjustments to distribution if the account balance falls below certain levels in FY2012 or FY2013. This provision aims to prevent a shortfall under MAP-21 spending levels. The provision in the year-long appropriations bills related to the pending HTF shortfall under MAP-21 spending levels commits the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to keeping spending within the means of the HTF. Implementing the ratchet mechanism could face resistance in Congress, as seen in the history of negative RABA calculations. H.R. 7 proposes a total federal-aid highway program authorization of $205 billion over five years, with specific HTF obligation limitations for each fiscal year. H.R. 7 proposes a $205 billion federal-aid highway program authorization over five years, with specific HTF obligation limitations for each fiscal year. The bill includes an Alternative Transportation Account providing an additional $2.7 billion annually for certain highway programs. It also features a modified Equity Bonus Program ensuring states receive at least 94% of the motor fuel taxes they pay into the HTF. Additionally, the alternative transportation funding covers programs like CMAQ, Ferry Boats and Terminals, Puerto Rico Highways, and Territorial Highway Program. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes a $205 billion federal-aid highway program authorization over five years, with specific HTF obligation limitations for each fiscal year. It includes an Alternative Transportation Account providing an additional $2.7 billion annually for certain highway programs. The bill also allows expanded tolling of the Interstate system, with restrictions to maintain the same number of free lanes. Unlike previous authorization acts, MAP-21 determines state apportionments for major programs according to a single methodology. MAP-21 determines state apportionments for major programs using a single methodology. Initial amounts are calculated based on each state's share of total nationwide apportionments and adjusted to ensure a minimum of 95% of estimated tax payments. A set-aside for the new CMAQ program is determined from the adjusted initial amount. The Surface Transportation Program funding for FY2009 is allocated to the new CMAQ program, with the metropolitan planning amount determined based on a state's apportionment under Title 23 Section 134 for that year. The remaining amount is divided among core programs, with adjustments based on privatized highway lane miles and vehicle miles traveled on privatized highways. The provision would reduce apportionments for three states - Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado - and increase apportionments for all other states based on privatized highway lane mileage and vehicle miles traveled. This adjustment would result in a 0.087% reduction for Illinois, 4.375% reduction for Indiana, and 0.045% reduction for Colorado, while increasing apportionments for other states by 0.115%. The dollar amounts of the aggregate programmatic split are shown in Table 5. MAP-21 does not have an equity program like SAFETEA's Equity Bonus Program. It determines the initial amount for each state based on their share of total funding during FY2005-FY2009 to address the donor-donee issue. There is an adjustment mechanism to ensure all states receive at least a 95% rate of return on their payments to the HTF. If Congress does not provide sufficient funding, adjustments may be necessary to guarantee the 95% return. The MAP-21 program aims to lift all donor states above the 95% level, with a potential adjustment process if Congress fails to provide adequate funding. Some states prefer using state return on payments to the HTF for the \"initial amount\" calculation, citing legacy earmarking issues from SAFETEA. SAFETEA included numerous earmarks, with 67% being \"below the line\" and not bringing additional funds to states, while 33% were \"above the line\" earmarks increasing state shares of highway program funding. This issue arose in extension legislation, benefiting states with higher above-the-line earmarks. The MAP-21 program aims to increase states' shares of highway program funding, benefiting states with higher above-the-line earmarks from SAFETEA. MAP-21 eliminates project earmarks but still favors states that did well in the SAFETEA earmarking process. The number of funding programs is reduced by two-thirds, with most eligibilities absorbed into new core programs. MAP-21 reduces funding programs by two-thirds, favoring states that performed well in SAFETEA earmarking. The core programs, including the NHPP, would be authorized at $39.143 billion for FY2012 and $39.806 billion for FY2013. NHPP combines three SAFETEA core programs to improve the National Highway System's condition and performance. The NHPP program, combining the Highway Bridge Program's NHS component, focuses on improving infrastructure condition, safety, mobility, and freight movement. It includes projects for highway segments, bridges, tunnels, ferry facilities, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, traffic monitoring, intelligent transportation systems, and environmental restoration within NHS corridors. States must develop asset management plans with performance metrics and targets, with a limit of 40% on new capacity spending. The NHPP program focuses on improving infrastructure condition, safety, mobility, and freight movement. States must develop asset management plans with performance metrics and targets. Funds would be transferred if bridge conditions fall below minimum standards. The program replaces SAFETEA's Surface Transportation Program and includes projects for highways, bridges, tunnels, and more. Funding is available for various transportation projects and enhancements. TMP funds can be used for various transportation projects such as carpool programs, congestion pricing, recreational trails, ferry facilities, border infrastructure, scenic roads, and safe routes to school. States must develop asset management plans and could face penalties for deficient bridges. Funds are to be sub-apportioned within states based on population shares. Under MAP-21, TMP funds are to be sub-apportioned within states based on population shares. The Appalachian Development Highway System program would be eliminated, giving states more flexibility in spending. CMAQ funding would be expanded to include demand-shifting projects like telecommuting and ridesharing, receiving roughly $3.3 billion annually. Under MAP-21, CMAQ funding would increase to $3.3 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013, expanding eligibility to include demand-shifting projects. HSIP funding would remain at $2.5 billion annually for the same period, focusing on improving road safety. The High Risk Rural Roads Program and Rail-Highway Grade Crossing Program would be abolished, while the NFP would be a new program aimed at enhancing the national freight network with $2 billion in annual funding. The program to improve the national freight network would receive roughly $2 billion annually for FY2012 and FY2013. MAP-21 would reduce the maximum percentage of funding that states can transfer between programs. H.R. 7 proposes to consolidate or eliminate programs, retaining the core structure but expanding the National Highway System Program and the Surface Transportation Program. The National Highway System Program (NHS) and the Surface Transportation Program (STP) would be expanded to include the Highway Bridge Program. The Interstate Maintenance program would be folded into the NHS Program, while the 10% STP set-aside for Transportation Enhancements would be eliminated. The obligation limitations for core highway programs for FY2013 through FY2016 total $150.7 billion, with an additional $8 billion for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. H.R. 7 would be the largest formula program, allocating $70.4 billion for FY2013-FY2016 to help maintain and repair the Interstate Highway system. H.R. 7 would expand the funding of the existing NHS program to help pay for the maintenance and repair of the Interstate Highway system and bridges on the NHS. Projects must support national performance goals and states must develop state asset management plans for the NHS. The bill would also authorize $42.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014 for the STP program, broadening its purpose to include bridges and tunnels of all classifications. The bill, H.R. 7, would broaden the STP program to include construction, inspection, rehabilitation, and replacement of bridges and tunnels of all classifications. It eliminates the requirement for 10% of STP funds to be set aside for transportation enhancement purposes and reduces the percentage of funds required to be spent on urbanized areas with populations over 200,000. States must consult with local planning organizations before obligating funds for projects in certain population areas. The bill also provides $10.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014 for HSIP, requiring states to have their own highway safety improvement programs and state safety plans to receive funds. H.R. 7 would provide $10.4 billion for FY2013-FY2014 for HSIP, requiring states to have their own highway safety improvement programs and state safety plans to receive funds. States would need to consult with stakeholders to set safety goals, identify projects, and evaluate progress annually. The bill also includes $8 billion over FY2013-FY2014 for CMAQ from an alternative transportation account. Additionally, H.R. 7 guarantees each state a minimum 94% return in core program apportionments on highway users' payments. H.R. 7 authorizes $15.6 billion over FY2013-FY2014 for core program apportionments, guaranteeing each state a minimum 94% return on highway users' payments. The amount used to fulfill the guarantee is limited to $3.9 billion per year. The Senate bill clarifies eligibility criteria for ER funds for roads and bridges damaged by natural disasters. U.S. territories would not receive more than $20 million in a single fiscal year. The improvement plan at the time of the disaster would not be eligible for ER funds, which can only be used on federal-aid highways. The $100 million ceiling on a single natural disaster or catastrophic failure in a state would be eliminated. Section 1506 allows adjustments to the 180-day emergency period for federal government payment of repair costs. Reimbursement for debris removal costs would be limited to expenses not covered by the Stafford Act. The U.S. territories would not receive more than $20 million in a single fiscal year. The Senate bill proposes restructuring the Federal Lands Highways Programs to create the Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program, with three main components: the Tribal Transportation Program, the Federal Lands Transportation Program, and the Federal Lands Access Program. Funding for the Tribal Transportation Program would be $450 million annually, while other federal lands programs would receive $550 million annually. Assistance would be provided for federal lands highways and tribal roads, even if they are not on the federal-aid highway system, with a limit of $20 million for U.S. territories in a single fiscal year. Emergency assistance would require a declaration by the governor or President, and states must provide a list of projects and costs within two years. The Senate bill proposes restructuring the Federal Lands Highways Programs to create the Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Program. The Tribal Transportation Program would receive $450 million annually, while other federal lands programs would get $550 million annually. The Tribal Transportation Program would distribute funds based on road mileage and tribal population, while the Federal Lands Access Program would allocate funds based on federal land, recreational visitors, federal roads, and federally owned bridges. H.R. 7 authorizes the Tribal Transportation Program at $465 million annually and the Federal Lands Transportation program at $535 million annually for FY2013-FY2016. The Senate bill would combine the Puerto Rico and Territorial Highway programs, funding them at $180 million annually for FY2012 and FY2013, with set-asides for Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianas, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. The Territorial Highway Program and Puerto Rico Highway Program would receive annual funding set-asides under H.R. 7, with Puerto Rico receiving $135 million annually and the Territorial Highway Program receiving $45 million annually. The ADHS program would be incorporated into the new Transportation Mobility Program, and the Appalachian Development Highway System would retain its funding at $470 million per year for FY2013-FY2016. H.R. 1530 proposes to increase federal funding for constructing highways on the Appalachian Development Highway System to 95%. The program would be authorized at $470 million per year for FY2013-FY2016, with funds available until expended. States can use toll credits for matching shares, and funds would be apportioned based on cost estimates. The Senate bill establishes a $1 billion discretionary program for high-cost transportation projects with national benefits. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is to report on the selection process and factors for high-cost transportation projects. H.R. 7 would repeal the SAFETEA PNRS provision, while the Senate bill would create a general fund program for Ferries and Ferry Terminal Facilities with funding distribution based on passenger and vehicle metrics. The distribution of funds for ferry systems under the proposed National Highway Performance Program would be based on passenger and vehicle metrics. The House bill would allocate $67 million annually for FY2013-FY2016 through the Alternative Transportation Account, with funds distributed to states with eligible\nferry systems based on specific criteria. H.R. 7 proposes distributing funds for ferry systems based on passenger and vehicle metrics. The program would allocate funds to states with eligible ferry systems using a specific formula. Additionally, ferry boats and facilities on the National Highway System would be eligible for formula funds. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) provides federal credit assistance for large transportation projects, with loans repaid through project-related user fees. MAP-21 proposes significant changes to the TIFIA program, including authorizing $1 billion annually from the highway trust fund for administrative and subsidy costs. This would increase the capacity for loans to $9.9 billion per year and allow TIFIA to provide up to 49% of project costs. Additionally, credit assistance could be provided for a program of projects secured by a common security pledge. MAP-21 proposes changes to the TIFIA program, including increasing annual funding to $1 billion for administrative costs and allowing up to 49% of project costs to be covered. Credit assistance can now be provided for a program of projects secured by a master credit agreement, benefiting projects like the 30/10 Initiative by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The threshold for eligible projects remains at $50 million, except for rural infrastructure projects, which have a lower threshold of $25 million. Rural projects will have different loan interest rates compared to urban projects. The TIFIA program under MAP-21 proposes changes such as increasing annual funding to $1 billion for administrative costs and allowing up to 49% of project costs to be covered. Rural projects have a lower threshold of $25 million and receive loans at half the Treasury rate. Projects seeking TIFIA assistance would be evaluated on a first-come, first-served basis, with 10% of funds set aside for rural projects. Funding can be used for a master credit agreement or to pay the credit subsidy from federal surface transportation apportionments. H.R. 7 authorizes $1 billion annually for TIFIA from the highway trust fund, with administrative costs capped at $3.250 million. Projects are eligible for assistance on a first-come, first-served basis, with thresholds of $50 million for non-ITS projects, $15 million for ITS projects, $25 million for rural projects, and $1 billion for assistance under a master credit agreement. The bill also proposes $750 million per year for state infrastructure banks. H.R. 7 proposes to increase federal assistance to 49% under a master credit agreement and authorizes $750 million annually for state infrastructure banks. There is no separate federal freight transportation program in SAFETEA, with most funding provided through regular highway programs. The bill suggests a more focused federal effort towards funding freight improvements. The Senate bill (MAP-21) and House bill (H.R. 7) propose new funding programs for freight transport, with a focus on improving infrastructure critical to freight. Both bills require the U.S. Department of Transportation to develop a national freight transport plan and seek to increase private-sector participation in financing transportation improvements. These efforts aim to prioritize freight improvements and enhance the roles of freight carriers and shippers in project planning and development. The MAP-21 bill proposes a new core program to direct funds to critical infrastructure segments for freight movement. The Secretary of Transportation would designate a \"primary freight network\" (PFN) consisting of 27,000 centerline miles of existing roadways, with states guided to prioritize spending on the PFN. Additionally, up to 3,000 centerline miles could be added based on future importance to freight movement, with periodic re-designations every decade. States could also designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" based on truck density. The MAP-21 bill proposes a Primary Freight Network (PFN) of 27,000 centerline miles of existing roads, with the option to add 3,000 miles based on future importance. States can designate Critical Rural Freight Corridors based on truck traffic density and spend up to 20% of their freight program funds on these roads. The PFN, Critical Rural Freight Corridors, and portions of the Interstate System not designated as PFN would form the National Freight Network (NFM). States can also allocate funds for non-Interstate highways, transit projects, and up to 10% for freight rail or maritime projects with significant improvements to freight flow. The Secretary of Transportation can allocate up to 10% of freight program funds for rail or maritime projects that improve freight flow and provide better returns than highway projects on the Primary Freight Network (PFN). Creating a specific funding program for freight movement and requiring states to develop performance measures will prioritize freight needs in project selection. DOT estimates that congested segments on highways with high truck volumes cause delays, especially at urban interchanges. States may be hesitant to address costly bottlenecks that primarily benefit trucks due to reliance on apportioned funds. The Senate and House bills under MAP-21 focus on funding programs like TIFIA, PNRS, and CMAQ for addressing congested segments at urban interchanges. While the Senate bill requires a study on truck size and weight limits, the House bill aims to concentrate funding for freight transport by reducing funding for non-shipping programs. Additionally, the House bill proposes tolling for highway construction, which is opposed by trucking organizations preferring fuel tax increases. The House bill, H.R. 7, includes provisions for increasing truck weight limits and trailer lengths, as well as a pilot program for higher truck weights on certain Interstate Highway segments. Trucking organizations oppose the bill's reliance on tolling for highway construction, preferring fuel tax increases for revenue. The bill proposes a four-year pilot program allowing up to three states to increase truck weights to 126,000 pounds on specific Interstate Highway segments. It also includes a weight exemption increase for idle reduction equipment. MAP-21 introduces changes to transportation planning requirements at national, state, and local levels, emphasizing performance management and setting national goals while allowing states and metropolitan planning organizations to develop specific measures and targets. The bill includes national goals but allows states and MPOs to set performance measures and targets. Failure to meet targets results in a remedial plan. The National Freight Program requires a national freight strategic plan with performance measures. States must set performance targets for freight movement to receive funding. Failure to make progress requires a freight performance improvement plan submission. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act establishes additional provisions for a national freight system. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act (Division C, Title III) includes provisions for a national surface transportation and freight policy and strategic plan. Some provisions overlap or conflict with those in Division A, Title I, such as goals for reducing traffic fatalities and developing strategic freight plans. The Surface Transportation and Freight Policy Act includes provisions for a national strategic freight plan and a national surface transportation and freight performance plan. States must develop a risk-based asset management plan with performance targets and an investment strategy. The Secretary will set minimum standards for pavement and bridge conditions, with consequences for states that do not meet them. State planning requirements remain, but with some changes. MAP-21 would require states to update their transportation facilities and planning requirements. Statewide plans must now incorporate metropolitan transportation plans without change and involve nonmetropolitan areas. A performance-based approach with coordinated performance measures and targets is mandated, including a financial plan. Metropolitan transportation planning would create two tiers of MPOs based on population size. MAP-21 proposes creating two tiers of MPOs based on population size, with Tier I for areas with populations of 1 million or more and Tier II for areas with less than 1 million. The Secretary would establish minimum technical requirements for both tiers, with Tier I MPOs required to implement performance-based planning and targets. Tier II MPOs would have more discretion in meeting requirements, which may include performance measures. Optional blueprint planning and project selection from TIPs in consultation with states are also included in MAP-21. MAP-21 proposes creating two tiers of MPOs based on population size, with Tier I for areas with populations of 1 million or more and Tier II for areas with less than 1 million. The legislation also includes provisions for optional blueprint planning and project selection from TIPs in consultation with states, with the added requirement of concurrence from the facility owner. Additionally, MAP-21 suggests designating MPOs only in urbanized areas with a population of 200,000 or more, allowing for the possibility of multiple MPOs in an urban region if agreed upon by the governor and local officials. H.R. 7, like MAP-21, aims to streamline metropolitan planning by potentially consolidating planning within a single MPO in each urban region. However, it allows for the co-existence of multiple MPOs if deemed appropriate by the governor and existing MPO. H.R. 7 also includes provisions for national transportation planning, performance measurement, and the development of a national strategic transportation plan by the DOT. This plan would involve soliciting projects of national and regional significance from states, estimating costs, and updating every two years. Additionally, H.R. 7 mandates the creation of a national performance management system to track progress towards national performance goals for highway and public transportation systems. H.R. 7 focuses on national performance goals for highway and public transportation systems, including measures, targets, and reporting requirements at both national and state levels. It also emphasizes the identification of projects of national significance in long-range plans, addresses congestion issues at airports and freight rail corridors, and considers the role of intercity buses in reducing congestion and energy consumption. Regional transportation planning organizations would have a role in project selection in areas without a designated MPO. H.R. 7 proposes ways to improve the intercity bus system, involving privately owned buses. It suggests increasing the urbanized population threshold for MPO designation to 100,000 and requires consideration of intercity buses in metropolitan planning. Budgetary pressures have raised concerns about transportation project efficiency and federal government involvement in project delivery. The House and Senate proposals aim to expedite project delivery by changing elements of the environmental review process for highway and transit projects. This process involves preparing documentation to identify and consider project-related impacts on the environment, ensuring compliance with state, tribal, and federal requirements. Various environmental requirements may apply depending on the project-specific impacts. The environmental review process for highway and transit projects involves ensuring compliance with state, tribal, and federal requirements. Various environmental requirements may apply depending on project-specific impacts, such as obtaining necessary permits and mitigating effects on historic sites. NEPA documentation, analysis, and review are required for all proposed federal-aid projects before final design activities can proceed. Coordination of environmental investigations, reviews, and consultations is mandated by DOT policy. The FHWA or FTA must approve NEPA documentation before property acquisition or project construction. DOT policy mandates coordinating all environmental investigations as a single process. Recent legislative efforts aim to expedite environmental reviews, focusing on NEPA compliance for major projects. The House proposal suggests more sweeping changes to the existing process. The House proposal and MAP-21 aim to expedite environmental reviews for highway and transit projects by changing compliance requirements beyond NEPA. The proposed changes may either accelerate project delivery or slow it down by altering coordination mechanisms or adding new requirements. Compliance with environmental regulations is crucial during the project development phase. The environmental review process is a crucial phase in transportation project development, ensuring compliance with state, tribal, and federal environmental requirements, including NEPA. FHWA or FTA must confirm completion of this process before final design, property acquisition, or construction can proceed. Projects with significant environmental impacts require an environmental impact statement, while those with unclear impacts undergo an environmental assessment. Projects with no significant impacts are categorically excluded from EIS or EA requirements, known as categorical exclusions (CEs). DOT's NEPA regulations outline actions that generally fall under CEs. Since 1998, around 90% of highway projects approved annually by FHWA were processed as categorical exclusions (CEs), while approximately 6% required an environmental assessment (EA). These projects, deemed to have \"no significant environmental impact under NEPA,\" may still be subject to other environmental laws. The most significant changes in the environmental review process under MAP-21 involve \"Accelerated Decisionmaking\" and \"Review of Federal Project and Program Delivery.\" Section 1313 of MAP-21 would establish new requirements for issue resolution in the environmental review process. Under Section 1313, MAP-21 would amend environmental review procedures to establish new requirements for issue resolution and financial transfer provisions for agencies failing to issue permits or approvals. Agencies may be required to transfer $10,000 or $20,000 weekly if delays are their fault, with exceptions for delays beyond their control. The transfer of funds may be required within 180 days after a final project decision is made, pursuant to NEPA. Various agencies are responsible for issuing approvals or permits for DOT projects, which can lead to delays due to under-staffing or lack of funds. Redirecting limited agency funds to expedite a single transportation project approval could slow down other applications being processed. MAP-21 under Section 1316 would require DOT to prepare assessments comparing different projects. The requirement to redirect limited agency funds to expedite a single transportation project approval may inadvertently slow down other applications being processed. MAP-21 Section 1316 mandates DOT to compare completion times of different environmental assessments and reports to Congress within a year of enactment. However, determining completion times for NEPA documents may be challenging due to lack of data, especially for projects processed with EAs or CEs. The NEPA process completion times are difficult to track accurately, especially for projects processed with EAs or CEs. State DOTs do not typically monitor the time it takes to complete environmental compliance obligations. To meet Congress's directive, DOT may require states to start tracking this information and report it. MAP-21 provisions for CEs involve changing regulatory requirements and directing DOT to survey state agencies for new CEs. The most significant provisions applicable to CEs involve Programmatic Agreements and Additional Categorical Exclusions, directing DOT to survey state agencies for new CEs and promulgate regulations adding projects to the list. Other provisions specify DOT agency roles in NEPA compliance for multimodal projects and criteria for designating projects as categorical exclusions within existing highway right-of-way. The curr_chunk discusses provisions under SAFETEA that would continue or amend environment-related programs, including assistance to affected state and federal agencies, state assumption of responsibilities for categorical exclusions, and the surface transportation project delivery program. These provisions aim to expedite and improve transportation project planning and delivery. The curr_chunk discusses the Surface Transportation Project Delivery Program, which would make permanent a pilot program allowing states to assume federal responsibilities for environmental reviews. The program would require DOT to assess states' ability to implement it. Additional provisions in MAP-21 emphasize the importance of certain activities for NEPA compliance. The House bill includes environmental review provisions under \"Environmental Streamlining\" and \"Project Development and Review,\" which would extensively change NEPA requirements. The House bill proposes significant changes to NEPA requirements for federal highway and transit projects, including raising the cost threshold for NEPA application and altering the compliance process. It also sets specific timeframes for permits, establishes deadlines for environmental reviews, and limits judicial review and legal sufficiency standards for environmental documents. The House bill proposes changes to NEPA requirements for federal projects, including timeframes for permits and deadlines for environmental reviews. The Senate has agreed to substitute MAP-21 language for H.R. 4348 and called for a conference with the House. MAP-21 aims to speed project delivery by allowing state DOTs to enter into construction manager/general contractor agreements. MAP-21 proposes changes to existing law to speed up project delivery by allowing state DOTs to enter into construction manager/general contractor contracts. This contract method combines design and construction tasks, enabling the contractor to start construction before design work is complete. Additionally, MAP-21 increases federal funding share by 5% on highway projects. H.R. 7 accelerates project delivery by allowing state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts. MAP-21 increases federal funding share by 5% for highway projects with innovative delivery methods. It also includes a pilot program for advance payment of moving costs for those affected by highway projects. The \"Alternative Relocation Payment Demonstration Program\" in H.R. 7 allows for advance payments for relocation costs of people and businesses affected by highway projects. This program aims to expedite the removal of individuals from project right-of-ways, but is a minor change compared to other proposed alternatives for property acquisition and relocation laws. Additionally, MAP-21 proposes changes to the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ) to provide funds for projects reducing transportation-related pollutants. The CMAQ program provides funds for projects reducing transportation-related pollutants to help areas meet air quality standards. Areas are classified as \"attainment,\" \"nonattainment,\" or \"maintenance\" based on NAAQS for pollutants like ozone and particulate matter. The program focuses on projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas. Proposed changes under MAP-21 maintain program goals and eligibility criteria. The CMAQ program, established to fund projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas, would see changes under MAP-21. While program goals and eligibility criteria remain unchanged, amendments would alter how funding levels are determined and distributed within states. Instead of specific annual funding levels, funds would be tied to previous amounts with adjustments. Distribution within states would be based on set limitations and suballocations. The distribution of CMAQ funds under MAP-21 would be tied to previous funding levels with adjustments. States would reserve a portion for specific projects like transportation enhancements and recreational trails. Half of the remaining funds would be allocated for projects in nonattainment or maintenance areas based on a formula approved by DOT. Under MAP-21, CMAQ funds would be suballocated for projects in nonattainment or maintenance areas based on a formula approved by DOT. The formula would consider population and pollution severity, with funds reserved for low-emissions equipment. States in attainment for NAAQS can use their apportioned funds for eligible projects. Additional provisions in MAP-21 may change how the CMAQ program is implemented. Additional provisions in MAP-21 may significantly change how the CMAQ program is implemented in individual states. Provisions include prioritizing projects to reduce fine particulate pollutants, developing cost-effectiveness tables for projects, allowing optional technical assessments for emissions reductions, and requiring performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects. H.R. 7 also includes provisions amending CMAQ program requirements. Proposed Section 149(k) of H.R. 7 requires MPOs to prepare performance plans for CMAQ-funded projects. The House bill includes provisions amending project eligibility requirements under 23 U.S.C. \u00a7149(b). Current laws offer incentives for alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles, such as tax credits for plug-in vehicles and biofuel production. Non-tax incentives include automaker credits under the CAFE program. Highway programs like SAFETEA allowed states to permit low-emission vehicles in HOV lanes. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program and various highway programs provide incentives for alternative fuel vehicles. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 aim to extend states' authority to permit low-emission vehicles in HOV lanes, with limitations if vehicles cause lane degradation. Additionally, both bills support the expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure by allowing highway funds to be used for new charging stations at parking facilities. H.R. 7 and MAP-21 aim to extend states' authority to permit low-emission vehicles in HOV lanes and support the expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure by allowing highway funds for new charging stations at parking facilities. MAP-21 also amends the Clean Fuels Grant Program to include grants for clean fuel buses and facilities, including zero emission buses. The Senate's public transit provisions in MAP-21 authorize $10.458 billion annually for federal transit programs. The Public Transportation Act of 2012 authorizes $10.458 billion annually for federal transit programs, with funding from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and the general fund. The House surface transportation reauthorization bill would rename the mass transit account as the alternative transportation account and authorize funding through FY2016. The legislation eliminates the use of motor fuel taxes for mass transit and transfers revenue to the highway account. Additionally, the bill transfers $40 billion from the general fund into the alternative transportation account. MAP-21 includes significant restructuring of the federal transit program, replacing the Fixed Guideway (Rail) Modernization Program with a new State of Good Repair program. The bill proposes transferring $40 billion from the general fund to the alternative transportation account. It includes restructuring the federal transit program by replacing the Fixed Guideway (Rail) Modernization Program with a new State of Good Repair Grant Program, which has components for maintenance, repair, and replacement of fixed guideway public transit systems. Funding for these programs would come from the mass transit account of the highway trust fund and the general fund. The Fixed Guideway SGR Grant Program would distribute competitive grants for the upkeep of fixed guideway systems, funded by the general fund. The High Intensity Motorbus SGR program would distribute funds for public transportation on facilities at least seven years old, funded by the mass transit account. The Bus and Bus Facilities SGR program would distribute competitive grants for buses and facilities, with $75 million set aside from the New Starts program. The bill also eliminates the discretionary Bus and Bus-Related Facilities program, reallocating some of its funding to other formula programs. The Senate bill proposes significant changes to public transportation funding, including combining certain programs and creating new ones. One key change is the consolidation of programs for elderly and disabled individuals into a single program called Formula Grants for Enhanced Mobility. The Jobs Access and Reverse Commute program would be shifted to the Urbanized and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs. Additionally, the bill would create two new programs - the Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Program and the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes new programs mirroring existing highway programs, including the Appalachian Development Public Transportation Assistance Program and the Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program. It doubles funding for transit on Indian reservations to $30 million annually, with $20 million distributed by formula and $10 million competitively. The bill eliminates some programs like the Clean Fuels Grant Program and combines others into a single program. The House bill (H.R. 7) proposes changes to the federal transit program, including eliminating certain programs like the Clean Fuels Grant Program and combining others. It also suggests distributing funding for the Bus and Bus-Related Facilities Program by formula and providing incentives for contracting out bus services. H.R. 7 incentivizes contracting out bus services by allowing providers to lower their cost share of capital projects. The Senate bill proposes changes to the New Starts program, allowing funds for core capacity improvement projects and simplifying the process by reducing major stages. The bill would streamline the project development process by eliminating the separate alternatives analysis, requiring project justification and local financial commitment, and setting a two-year timeline for completion. Once the NEPA process is completed and project is approved, it can enter the Engineering Phase and potentially secure federal funding for construction. The Senate bill aims to expedite project delivery for transportation projects by providing federal funding assistance for projects with a federal share of $100 million or less. It would eliminate the Small Starts program but create a pilot program for expedited project delivery. The House bill, on the other hand, maintains the distinction between New Starts and Small Starts projects and allocates $150 million for the New Starts program. The House bill (H.R. 7) focuses on capital projects and core capacity improvement projects, maintaining the distinction between New Starts and Small Starts projects. It allocates $150 million for Small Starts projects and includes provisions for expediting projects. Changes in project justification criteria include adding private contributions and intermodal connectivity as factors. The Senate bill would maintain the prohibition on federal funds for operating expenses in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people, with exceptions for small bus transit systems. It allows up to 50% of Urbanized Area apportionments for operating expenses for systems with 75 or fewer buses, and 25% for systems with 76 to 100 buses. Additionally, funds can be used for operating expenses in high unemployment areas for up to three years, with decreasing percentages allowed each year. The House bill (H.R. 7) also makes modifications to the prohibition on federal funds for operating expenses in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people. The House bill (H.R. 7) would allow transit bus systems in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more with 100 buses or fewer in peak service to use federal funding for operating expenses. The cost share would be 25% federal, 75% local for systems with 76-100 buses, and 50% federal for systems with 75 or fewer buses. The bill also increases the share of funds for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit from 10% to 15% for both urbanized and nonurbanized areas. The Senate and House bills propose increasing the share of funds for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit from 10% to 15%. These funds can be used for capital and operating expenses. The bills also include provisions for passenger and freight rail, calling for the development of a national rail plan to guide future investments and regional rail plans to refine the national plan for each region. States may create state rail plans to further refine regional plans. Amendments are made to the NEC advisory commission, and Amtrak is required to submit a new plan. The bill proposes amendments to the NEC advisory commission and requires Amtrak to submit a new plan for high-speed service. It also mandates the development of guidance for measuring train delays, a data needs assessment for intercity passenger rail, and a survey on track access arrangements. Additionally, it aims to establish an equipment pool for corridor intercity passenger services. The bill proposes the establishment of an equipment pool for corridor intercity passenger services to achieve economies of scale in car production and maintenance. However, this could discourage innovation in car design. Implementation of positive train control may impact domestic car design regulations. The implementation of positive train control could lead to modifications in US car design regulations, potentially aligning them with foreign standards and facilitating a global market for passenger car equipment. H.R. 7 would repeal the congestion grant program for high-priority rail corridors and reduce funding for Amtrak's operating assistance grants. Additionally, H.R. 7 would amend the law regarding food and beverage service on Amtrak trains. H.R. 7 would amend the law covering food and beverage service on Amtrak trains, repealing the self-supporting requirement and putting the provision of service out to competitive bidding. It would also reduce funding for Amtrak's operating assistance grants and amend a federal grant program for relocating railroad lines. The Senate bill proposes amendments to federal grant programs for relocating railroad lines and the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing Program. It also includes changes to laws governing the Surface Transportation Board, such as raising the ceiling on maximum total dollar value of freight charges that shippers can bring before the board. The bill proposes increasing the maximum rate relief for shippers before the STB, imposing shorter deadlines for complex rate relief cases, studying railroad asset replacement costs, compiling and reporting railroad service complaints, repealing a capital grant program for smaller railroads, and facilitating access to the RRIF loan program. It also addresses the mandate for positive train control in response to past accidents. The Senate bill aims to extend the deadline for implementing positive train control (PTC) technology beyond December 31, 2015, if deemed infeasible, with a final deadline of December 31, 2018. PTC is required for passenger and freight railroads on routes carrying toxic-by-inhalation products. The bill also allows PTC implementation to be funded through RRIF loans and requires a joint study on spectrum needs for PTC. The Senate bill aims to extend the deadline for implementing positive train control (PTC) technology to December 31, 2018 if deemed infeasible. The House bill (H.R. 7) would extend the deadline for implementing PTC to 2021 for routes with passenger traffic and eliminate the deadline for routes carrying certain toxic chemicals. Additionally, the Senate bill includes new NHTSA grant programs, an incentive grant program for states to enforce texting while driving laws, and an increase in civil penalties for vehicle safety violations. The House bill, H.R. 7, proposes various changes to vehicle safety regulations, including increasing civil penalties for violations, requiring event data recorders in passenger vehicles, and consolidating highway safety grant programs. It also prohibits federal funding for measuring motorcycle helmet usage and creating motorcyclist checkpoints. The Senate bill authorizes higher highway safety grants and establishes a clearinghouse for drug and alcohol test results for commercial drivers to prevent penalties evasion. Both the House (H.R. 7) and Senate bills aim to create a clearinghouse for drug and alcohol test results of commercial drivers to prevent penalties evasion. They also address safety concerns related to \"reincarnated carriers\" and provide funding for truck safety grants to states in FY2013. Additionally, there are proposals to establish and enforce minimum safety standards for rail transit systems. The Public Transportation Safety Act of 2010 (S. 3638) aims to establish and enforce minimum safety standards for rail transit systems not regulated by DOT. It would create a safety certification program for states overseeing rail transit operations and require financial independence for state safety oversight agencies. Grants of \"not less than $10 million\" would be authorized for states to implement this program. H.R. 7 does not authorize DOT to set safety standards but allows for funds to be spent on safety and state of good repair projects before other projects. The proposed legislation would prioritize safety and state of good repair projects for transit agencies using federal grant funds. It includes provisions for certifying state safety oversight organizations and authorizes financial assistance for them. Both MAP-21 and H.R. 7 allocate funds for transportation research and education, technology deployment programs, and prize competitions to promote transportation innovations. Additionally, both bills direct the Department of Transportation to conduct studies on various aspects of transportation improvement. Both MAP-21 and H.R. 7 focus on improving transportation through research, safety, and infrastructure investment. They authorize grants for transportation research centers and emphasize the need to fully utilize the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for infrastructure maintenance. H.R. 4348 includes language to ensure that funds from the trust fund are used solely for harbor maintenance programs."
