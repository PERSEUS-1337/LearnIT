    "content": "The process of appointing a Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States is outlined in the Constitution's Appointments Clause. The President nominates a candidate, who must then be confirmed by the Senate for a lifetime appointment. The most recent nomination was Merrick B. Garland by President Obama in 2016 to replace Justice Scalia. Majority Leader McConnell argued that the American people should have a say in the selection of the next Justice. The 161st nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court was made by President Obama in 2016 for Merrick B. Garland. Majority Leader McConnell and Senator Grassley argued that the vacancy should not be filled until a new President is elected. Minority Leader Reid and President Obama urged the Senate to consider Garland's nomination, but it was not acted upon. President Obama nominated Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court, but the Senate did not act on the nomination. The nomination was returned to President Obama at the end of the 114th Congress. President Trump later nominated Neil M. Gorsuch to fill the vacancy left by Justice Scalia. The Gorsuch nomination is currently pending before the Senate. This report analyzes the issues surrounding the Scalia vacancy, including the frequency of Supreme Court vacancies and the length of the vacancy. Since President George Washington's initial six appointments to the Supreme Court in 1789 and 1790, a vacancy on the Court has occurred, on average, every two years. During the post-War period (1946 to the present), a vacancy on the Court has occurred, on average, every 2.4 years. In more recent years (since 1980), a vacancy has occurred, on average, slightly. Since the Supreme Court's establishment in 1789, vacancies have occurred every two years on average. In recent years, vacancies have occurred every 3.1 years. Justices hold office for life, leading to instances of Justices serving until death. Since the establishment of the Supreme Court in 1789, vacancies have occurred every two years on average, with Justices often serving until death due to the prestige of the office. Over the past 225 years, 42% of vacancies have arisen from the death of a sitting Justice, while 58% have occurred for other reasons. In the last 60 years, only 8% of vacancies were due to a Justice's death, with the passing of Justice Scalia in 2016 being the second instance during this period. From 1956 to 2016, 8% of vacancies on the Supreme Court were due to a Justice's death. Before 1900, the majority of vacancies were caused by a Justice's death. On average, vacancies on the Court last approximately 4 months before a nominee is approved by the Senate. Vacancies on the Supreme Court have varied in duration, with the average length being 4 months before a nominee is approved by the Senate. Prior to the 20th century, vacancies lasted longer, averaging 5.4 months, while since 1900, the average duration has been 2.5 months. As of March 1, 2017, the Scalia vacancy has lasted for 382 days, making it the seventh longest in the Court's history. The Scalia vacancy on the Supreme Court is currently the seventh longest in history, lasting 382 days as of March 1, 2017. Out of 80 vacancies since 1861, only one other vacancy in 1969 ranks among the top 10 longest vacancies. The average time from nomination to final Senate action for Court nominations since 1791 is 28 days, with variations in speed of confirmation over time. Since 1791, the average time for Supreme Court nominations to be confirmed by the Senate has increased significantly. Nominations now wait an average of 67 days for final Senate action, compared to 18 days before 1900. The longest pending nomination for a Supreme Court vacancy was Judge Garland's nomination, which waited 293 days before being rejected. The current nomination to fill the Scalia vacancy, Judge Gorsuch, has been pending for 28 days as of March 1, 2017. The Senate has seen various Supreme Court nominations with differing confirmation outcomes and lengths of pending time. For example, the longest-pending nomination was Judge Garland's at 293 days, while some vacancies lasted longer but had shorter nomination periods. Multiple nominations for a single vacancy can also contribute to a longer overall vacancy period. Since 1791, there have been 9 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years where the vacancy occurred before the general election and the President submitted a nomination after the election. Out of 16 vacancies during election years, 3 occurred after the general election and 4 had nominations submitted post-election. Since 1791, there have been 9 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years where the vacancy occurred before the general election and the President submitted a nomination after the election. The Scalia vacancy is the first to occur under these circumstances since 1932. Out of the 9 vacancies, 3 did not have the Senate approve a President's nominee for a vacancy that arose during a presidential election year prior to the election itself. Since 1791, there have been nine vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years. Eight out of nine vacancies that rolled over into a presidential election year were confirmed by the Senate during that year. In 1987, Justice Powell's retirement led to Anthony M. Kennedy's nomination and confirmation in 1988. In 1968, President Johnson anticipated vacancies by nominating Abe Fortas as Chief Justice and Homer Thornberry as an Associate Justice. In 1968, President Johnson nominated Abe Fortas as Chief Justice and Homer Thornberry as an Associate Justice, anticipating vacancies on the Supreme Court. However, the Senate failed to confirm Fortas, leading to the withdrawal of both nominations. Chief Justice Warren did not step down until 1969, resulting in no vacancies on the Court that year. Prior to the Scalia vacancy, there have been seven vacancies on the Supreme Court filled during different administrations, representing approximately 6% of all vacancies since 1791. The last time a vacancy arose during one presidency and was filled during another was in 1881. The vacancy on the Court created in July 1881 was eventually filled by President Arthur on December 20 of that year. Prior to the Scalia vacancy, there were seven vacancies filled by a President from a different party. The last time a vacancy arose during one presidency and was filled during a different administration was in 1862. Three vacancies occurred during the \"Second Party System\" period, while five vacancies occurred during the \"Modern Party\" era. During the \"Second Party System\" and \"Modern Party System,\" Supreme Court vacancies occurred. The Scalia vacancy had the longest period from occurrence to a President leaving office. Most departing Presidents nominated a replacement, except for Grant and Garfield. During their presidencies, six out of eight Presidents, including Obama, nominated replacements for Supreme Court vacancies before leaving office. The number of days a vacancy lasted before being filled varied, with some vacancies lasting longer than others. In some cases, multiple nominations were made before a vacancy was filled. Since 1791, there have been 20 vacancies on the Supreme Court that required multiple nominations before being filled. The Scalia vacancy is the most recent example. Figure 6 illustrates 12 vacancies since 1860 that needed multiple nominations before a new Justice was appointed. Between 1860 and 2016, there were 12 vacancies on the Supreme Court that required multiple nominations before being filled. Six vacancies involved the Senate rejecting nominations, four involved the President withdrawing nominations, and one nominee died before taking office. The Scalia vacancy is unique as the nomination was returned to the President after the Senate took no action. Vacancies needing multiple nominations generally lasted longer than the median vacancy length of 61 days, with 8 lasting over 61 days and 7 lasting at least 100 days. Vacancies requiring multiple nominations on the Supreme Court have generally lasted longer than the median length of 61 days, with 8 out of 11 vacancies lasting over 61 days and 7 lasting at least 100 days. Nominees who were eventually approved by the Senate received unanimous or nearly unanimous support. Samuel Alito's nomination in 2006 received 42 nay votes, deviating from this pattern."
