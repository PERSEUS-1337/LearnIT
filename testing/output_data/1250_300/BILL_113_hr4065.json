Congress finds that mobile device theft costs consumers $30 billion annually, with 1 in 3 robberies involving mobile device theft. Efforts have been made by carriers, manufacturers, law enforcement, and the FCC to address this issue, but more needs to be done. Consumers deserve secure technology, and the industry should educate them on available security tools. Technology advancements benefit the economy and public safety, but the industry must adapt to rapidly changing engineering and security needs. The mobile device industry, law enforcement, and consumer advocates should proactively develop solutions to protect consumers, drive innovation, and deter theft as engineering and security needs change rapidly. SEC. 3. FUNCTION FOR STOLEN MOBILE DEVICES. An amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 introduces a new section addressing stolen mobile devices. The section defines terms related to mobile devices and commercial mobile services. It requires providers to make a function available on mobile devices for commercial services. The section requires providers of commercial mobile services to offer a function on mobile devices that allows the account holder to remotely delete all their information, render the device inoperable globally, and prevent reactivation without authorization. The legislation mandates that mobile devices must have a feature allowing remote data deletion, global device inoperability, and prevention of unauthorized reactivation or reprogramming. Manufacturers and importers must comply with these standards, with exemptions for equivalent technology. The legislation requires mobile devices to have a feature for remote data deletion, global device inoperability, and prevention of unauthorized reactivation. Providers of mobile service or data service may be exempt from this requirement if they offer technology that achieves the same function. Manufacturers and importers can also be exempt if their devices are configured to meet these standards. The legislation mandates mobile devices to include features for remote data deletion, global device inoperability, and prevention of unauthorized reactivation. Providers of mobile services may be exempt from this requirement if they offer technology that achieves the same function. Manufacturers and importers can also be exempt if their devices are configured to meet these standards.

Compliance extensions may be granted by the Federal Communications Commission. The Federal Communications Commission may grant compliance extensions to individuals subject to requirements under section 343(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, allowing more time for compliance upon request."
