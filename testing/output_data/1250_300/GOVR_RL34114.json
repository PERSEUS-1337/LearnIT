There are three formal methods Congress can use to combat noncompliance: inherent contempt power, criminal contempt statute, and civil enforcement. Inherent contempt power encourages compliance with congressional demands by releasing the individual once the subpoena terms are met. Criminal contempt allows for the prosecution of noncompliant individuals, but may not lead to future compliance. Civil enforcement through the judicial branch can result in a civil judgment declaring legal obligation to comply with a subpoena, especially for executive branch officials. The power of Congress to enforce subpoenas against executive branch officials is crucial for ensuring compliance. Congress's contempt power is closely tied to its investigative authority, allowing for various methods of enforcement such as inherent contempt, criminal contempt, and civil enforcement through the judicial branch. Noncompliance with subpoenas may lead to contempt of court charges, highlighting the importance of upholding congressional demands. Contempt is closely linked to Congress's investigative power, which is broad and essential for its legislative function. The Supreme Court has established Congress's authority to seek information, including through oversight and investigations, as implied from its legislative powers. This authority was confirmed in Supreme Court rulings from the 1920s. In McGrain v. Daugherty, the Court emphasized the importance of inquiry and enforcement in the legislative process. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's authority to seek information for its legislative function, stating that the power of inquiry is essential for effective legislation. This includes the ability to compel information when necessary, as seen in cases like McGrain v. Daugherty. The Supreme Court upheld a witness's conviction for contempt of Congress in Sinclair v. United States, despite the witness's refusal to answer questions citing pending lawsuits. The Court emphasized that Congress has the authority to investigate and gather information for legislative purposes, even if it does not aid in ongoing legal proceedings. The Supreme Court has affirmed Congress's authority to investigate and gather information for legislative purposes, even if it does not aid in ongoing legal proceedings. Subsequent rulings have consistently upheld the breadth of Congress's investigative authority, stating that it is inherent in the legislative process and encompasses inquiries into the administration of existing laws as well as proposed statutes. The Supreme Court affirmed Congress's broad power of inquiry, stating it includes investigations into existing laws, proposed statutes, and government maladministration. The Court emphasized Congress's peak investigative power in cases of waste, fraud, abuse, or corruption within government departments. It recognized Congress's authority to expose corruption and inefficiency in the Executive Branch to ensure effective and honest government conduct. The Supreme Court affirmed Congress's power to investigate corruption in the Executive Branch. Congress has the authority to inquire into and publicize corruption, maladministration, or inefficiencies in government agencies. The inherent contempt power allows Congress to detain individuals who refuse to comply with investigations. The House has the power to detain individuals who refuse to comply with investigations, using traditional methods such as arrest and questioning. This was exemplified in the case of Anderson v. Dunn in 1818, where a non-Member was arrested for trying to bribe a Member of the House. The House granted the accused counsel, defense witnesses, and a copy of the accusatory letter before finding him guilty of contempt. The House has the power to detain individuals who refuse to comply with investigations, using traditional methods such as arrest and questioning. In the case of Anderson v. Dunn in 1818, the House granted the accused counsel, defense witnesses, and a copy of the accusatory letter before finding him guilty of contempt. The process includes attachment by the Sergeant-at-Arms, appearance before the bar, specification of charges, identification of the accuser, compulsory process, counsel, a hearing, determination of guilt, and imposition of penalty. Prompt judicial review through a writ of habeas corpus is available for those cited for contempt. Congress must grant notice and an opportunity to be heard, ensuring minimum due process standards are met. Inherent contempt proceedings may require notice and an opportunity to be heard, similar to statutory criminal contempt procedures. Monetary fines could be imposed instead of incarceration to avoid habeas corpus challenges. The 1821 Supreme Court decision in Anderson suggests that Congress could exercise its inherent function to impose fines for contemptuous behavior. The 1821 Supreme Court decision in Anderson suggests that Congress could impose fines instead of incarceration for contemptuous behavior, based on the principle of self-preservation and the least possible power adequate to the end proposed. In Kilbourn v. Thompson, the Court also indicated that Congress may compel testimony using the same means as a court of justice in certain cases. The Supreme Court has suggested that Congress could impose fines for contemptuous behavior, based on the principle of self-preservation. In comparison to other contempt proceedings, inherent contempt allows Congress to conduct summary proceedings and cite offenders without the need for assistance from other branches of government. Judicial review in such cases may be limited. The House or Senate can conduct summary proceedings and cite offenders for contempt. Judicial review may be limited, and imprisonment under inherent contempt cannot extend beyond the current session of Congress. However, this process is considered outdated and ineffective, with drawbacks such as being cumbersome and time-consuming. It has not been used since 1935 due to interruptions in legislative work. Inherent contempt proceedings, used since 1795, involved a trial at the bar of Congress but were seen as outdated and ineffective. Between 1795 and 1857, 14 actions were initiated, with 8 considered successful. A special committee could be used for fact-finding and witness examination, with the full House or Senate making the final decision on guilt. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted as an alternative to the outdated and ineffective inherent contempt proceedings. The statute allows for judicial trial of the contemnor by a United States Attorney, rather than a trial at the bar of the House or Senate. Despite this, most contempt proceedings continued to be handled at the bar of the house in the two decades following the enactment, as Members believed they would not obtain the desired information from witnesses through criminal contempt proceedings. The criminal contempt method was established in 1857 as an alternative to inherent contempt proceedings. Statutory provisions today are codified as 2 U.S.C. Sections 192 and 194. Section 192 outlines penalties for failing to testify or produce documents, while Section 194 details the procedure for referring a witness to the courts for criminal prosecution. The criminal contempt statute, established in 1857, outlines the procedure for punishing uncooperative witnesses through prosecution by the U.S. Attorney. This method is punitive and aims to deter similar conduct in the future. Once a witness is found in contempt, they lack an incentive to cooperate with the committee. In some cases, the House has decided that further proceedings were not necessary after certifying the contempt to the U.S. Attorney. The criminal contempt statute, established in 1857, outlines the procedure for punishing uncooperative witnesses through prosecution by the U.S. Attorney. In some cases, the House has decided that further proceedings were not necessary after certifying the contempt to the U.S. Attorney. It remains unclear whether the U.S. Attorney's duty to present the contempt to the grand jury is mandatory or discretionary, with conflicting guidance from case law. The House Committee on Un-American Activities sought a corpus from two witnesses charged with violating a statute. The court ordered the witnesses released due to procedural errors. Congress mandated that in cases of uncooperative witnesses, the committee must report to the House or Senate, and the Speaker or President must certify the facts to the district attorney for grand jury consideration. The Senate made certification of facts to the district attorney mandatory in cases of contempt, leaving no discretion. The U.S. Attorney is required to submit the facts to the grand jury. Different courts have varying interpretations on the discretionary nature of certifying contempt citations to the U.S. Attorney. The court ruled that referring a committee's contempt resolution to the U.S. Attorney is discretionary, not mandatory. This discretion is evident when Congress is in session, as approval by the parent body is required. The review of a committee's contempt citation by the Speaker or President of the Senate may also be discretionary. The U.S. Attorney's function is argued to be discretionary, despite the statute's mandatory language. Courts generally grant U.S. Attorneys prosecutorial discretion, even in cases with mandatory language. The U.S. Attorney's function is discretionary, even with mandatory language in statutes. Congress can enforce a subpoena through civil enforcement in federal court. The House can pursue civil enforcement through an authorizing resolution. In 1978, Congress enacted civil enforcement as an alternative to inherent and criminal contempt powers. In 1978, Congress enacted a civil enforcement procedure as an alternative to inherent and criminal contempt powers. The statute gives the U.S. District Court jurisdiction over a civil action to enforce, secure a declaratory judgment, or prevent non-compliance with a subpoena issued by the Senate. The Senate may seek a court order for compliance or a declaration of validity before enforcing the subpoena. The Senate has the discretion to use a two-step enforcement process for subpoenas, starting with seeking a declaration before court intervention. The court's jurisdiction is limited to reviewing the subpoena's validity, and it cannot enjoin congressional proceedings. If the court orders compliance and the individual still refuses, they may be tried in court. The court does not have jurisdiction to enjoin congressional proceedings but can order compliance with a subpoena. If an individual still refuses to comply, they may face contempt of court proceedings. Civil enforcement has limitations, especially when the subpoena is issued to a federal government officer or employee. The House of Representatives can authorize a committee to seek civil enforcement to compel compliance with a subpoena, as seen in the 2008 case involving former White House Counsel Harriet Miers. The House Judiciary Committee sought civil enforcement of a subpoena against Harriet Miers, marking the first attempt authorized solely by resolution of a single house. The federal courts now have jurisdiction over such claims, as seen in the case of Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers. In 2012, the House authorized a committee to enforce a subpoena against Attorney General Eric Holder for non-compliance with subpoenas related to Operation Fast and Furious. The House authorized a civil lawsuit against Attorney General Eric Holder for non-compliance with subpoenas related to Operation Fast and Furious. The court rejected the Department of Justice's motion to dismiss the lawsuit and ordered the DOJ to provide a list of withheld documents. The court has denied motions for summary judgment from both parties and ordered the DOJ to provide a list of withheld documents, but has not yet addressed the executive privilege question. Authorization from the full House is needed for civil enforcement of subpoenas, and without it, courts will not entertain civil motions on behalf of Congress. If an authorizing resolution by the House is obtained, there is a likelihood that the court will allow civil enforcement of subpoenas. The District Court for the District of Columbia may find no legal impediment to seeking civil enforcement of subpoenas or committee orders if authorized by the House. The DOJ prefers civil enforcement for subpoenas against executive officials, but Congress has been told it cannot use inherent contempt or criminal contempt procedures against officials asserting executive privilege. The Attorney General has instructed against pursuing criminal contempt prosecutions in such cases. The DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel has advised against criminal prosecution under 2 U.S.C. Sections 192, 194 for officials invoking executive privilege. This has been seen in cases involving contempt proceedings against high-ranking officials, leading Congress to rely on civil enforcement through federal courts to enforce subpoenas. The 2014 case of Lois Lerner suggests a broadening of the executive branch's stance on criminal contempt for executive officials. Former IRS official Lois Lerner faced criminal contempt from the House for refusing to testify about allegations of IRS targeting conservative groups. Despite the House's approval, the DOJ did not pursue a criminal case against Lerner. This contrasts with past refusals by the DOJ to prosecute executive branch officials for contempt of Congress. The DOJ did not pursue a criminal case against Lerner for refusing to testify about IRS targeting conservative groups, citing her Fifth Amendment privilege. Past refusals to prosecute for contempt of Congress involved executive privilege, showing challenges in enforcing subpoenas against executive officials. The challenges in enforcing subpoenas against executive branch officials through criminal contempt statutes are highlighted in past disputes involving Burford, Miers, Holder, and Lerner. While Congress has the authority to issue and enforce subpoenas, prosecuting noncompliance with a subpoena for criminal contempt may be ineffective, especially if the President supports the official's refusal to disclose information. The DOJ's prosecutorial discretion plays a significant role in determining whether a contempt citation will be pursued, with past cases showing reluctance to prosecute when executive privilege is invoked. The criminal contempt provision may be effective in punishing executive officials who disregard congressional subpoenas to protect personal interests, even if not endorsed by the President. However, the executive branch may choose not to prosecute, potentially undermining Congress's authority. Enforcing subpoenas through a declaratory civil action may be inadequate due to the time required for a final ruling, as seen in the Miers case. Enforcing congressional subpoenas through civil actions may prove ineffective due to lengthy legal processes, as seen in the Miers case. The delay in obtaining enforceable rulings can diminish Congress's ability to effectively oversee the executive branch. Congress may not always rely on the executive branch or civil enforcement to enforce subpoenas, leading to delays in oversight. Congress can use its inherent contempt authority to enforce subpoenas."
