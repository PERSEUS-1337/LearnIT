    "content": "The number of non-U.S. citizens enrolling in U.S. colleges and universities slowed after 9/11 due to visa policies and global competition. However, in 2008-2009, foreign student enrollment increased by 8.0%, with significant growth from China. New enrollments rose by 16.0%, attributed to recruitment efforts and improved visa processing. Enrollment changes varied by institution, study level, and discipline, with differences by region of origin. The international student enrollment changes are reflected differently by types of institutions, levels of study, and disciplines. India, China, and South Korea were among the top countries of origin for foreign students in the US. The top fields of study for foreign students were business, engineering, and physical sciences. Foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in the sciences and engineering. Foreign students, including those on temporary resident visas, consistently earned the majority of doctorate degrees in the sciences and engineering from 1996 to 2006. In 2006, they earned 32.0% of science doctorates and 58.6% of engineering doctorates. Permanent resident status students earned 4.2% of both science and engineering doctorates in 2006. Foreign students were awarded 47.9% of physical science doctorates and 55.3% of mathematics doctorates in 2006. In 2006, foreign students were awarded a majority of doctorates in various science fields, with 47.9% in physical sciences, 55.3% in mathematics, and 61.3% in computer sciences. Additionally, specific data shows that 33.5% of non-U.S. citizen doctorate degree holders were from China, 11.9% from India, and smaller percentages from other countries. In 2006, foreign students earned a majority of doctorate degrees in physical sciences, mathematics, and computer sciences. Among non-U.S. citizens, 33.5% were from China, 11.9% from India, and smaller percentages from other countries. Foreign graduate students in the U.S. face restrictions on employment and financial support, but can work as research or teaching assistants on federally funded projects. Many foreign students receive support from various sources such as personal, university, foreign government, and employer. Universities primarily provide support through teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowships. Foreign students on temporary and permanent resident visas receive financial assistance from universities, mainly through research and teaching assistantships funded by federal grants. Foreign students, including those on temporary and permanent resident visas, receive financial assistance from universities through assistantships, fellowships, and grants. Non-U.S. citizen doctoral recipients are more likely to receive financial support compared to U.S. doctoral recipients. Data disaggregated by race/ethnicity shows varying percentages of students relying on their own resources to finance their studies. In physical sciences and engineering, universities are the primary source of financial support for foreign students. Foreign doctoral students, including those on temporary and permanent resident visas, receive significant financial support from universities. In disciplines like education and social sciences, foreign students rely more on university funding compared to U.S. citizens. There are differing opinions on the impact of foreign student enrollment in graduate science and engineering programs. Foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs benefit U.S. universities by increasing skilled workers in the labor force, contributing to the workforce at institutions, and providing important revenue through tuition. However, their noticeable presence has sparked concerns among minority communities about disparities in the science community. The presence of foreign students in graduate science and engineering programs has raised concerns among minority communities about disparities in the university science community. Minority groups argue that there is unequal access to resources and opportunities for U.S. minorities compared to foreign students. Former professor Frank L. Morris criticized colleges and universities for favoring departments admitting foreign students over supporting minority graduate students. Morris highlighted the disparity in funding and support for foreign doctoral students compared to American minority students. The generous immigration policy and disproportionate subsidy of foreign doctoral students over American minority students have put the economic well-being of the African American community at risk. Critics also point out communication issues with foreign teaching assistants, impacting the learning process. Some states have set English-language standards for foreign teaching assistants, but challenges persist. Several states have set English-language standards for foreign teaching assistants in graduate schools. Proponents argue that international migration of academics and scientists benefits the U.S. economy by keeping it at the forefront of science and technology. The participation of international graduate students and scholars is crucial for research activities in various fields. The number of immigrant scientists and engineers entering the U.S. remained stable in the 1980s. In the 1980s, the number of immigrant scientists and engineers entering the United States remained stable at 12,000. However, in 1992, there was a significant increase in admissions due to changes in immigration laws, with the number of scientists and engineers on permanent visas rising to 23,534 by 1993. The proportion of foreign-born scientists and engineers in the U.S. labor force reached a record high in 2000, driven by high levels of entry during the 1990s. The issuance of permanent visas has been influenced by administrative changes, immigration legislation, and post-9/11 impacts. Foreign scientists and engineers on temporary work visas have sparked debate. The impact of administrative changes at USCIS, immigration legislation, and post-9/11 effects on foreign scientists and engineers on temporary work visas, particularly the H-1B program, has generated debate. Some argue that the influx of immigrant scientists and engineers has led to decreased job opportunities, lower wages, and declining working conditions for U.S. scientific personnel. Some argue that the influx of immigrant scientists and engineers on H-1B visas has led to depressed job opportunities, lowered wages, and declining working conditions for U.S. scientific personnel. Critics advocate for restrictions on hiring foreign skilled employees to protect U.S. workers, while supporters argue that foreign workers are necessary to fill needed positions. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report highlights limitations in Labor's review of H-1B applications and enforcement of program requirements. Complaints and violations have increased, but USCIS lacks a formal mechanism to report information to Labor. Justice pursues charges against employers based on complaints from U.S. workers alleging displacement by H-1B workers. The Department of Labor does not have a formal mechanism to report information on H-1B visa violations, and current law limits their ability to investigate employers. The maturing computer industry has led to concerns about lower salaries for foreign-born professionals compared to U.S. workers. The DOL is enforcing policies on H-1B visas, but many believe the U.S. needs foreign skills to compete in science and technology. The United States needs foreign skills to compete in science and technology, especially in the maturing computer industry. The Department of Labor lacks a formal mechanism to report H-1B visa violations and faces limitations in investigating employers. Many in the scientific community advocate for monitoring the entry of foreign talent into U.S. colleges and universities more carefully. The National Science Board emphasizes the importance of attracting and retaining foreign-born talent in STEM fields to meet global demand. Retaining foreign-born talent is crucial for the Nation's STEM enterprise. Developing domestic human capital is essential as global demand for STEM talent increases. The debate on foreign students in STEM programs intensified after 9/11, with concerns about an inhospitable environment for them in the U.S. There are worries about the U.S. losing its status as the top destination for international students. The United States is facing a decline in international student enrollment, with concerns about foreign students in sensitive areas and access to research on chemical and biological weapons. There is debate on the impact of stricter requirements on enrollments and the competitiveness of U.S. industry. Tracking foreign students post-9/11 has sparked controversy in the academic and scientific community. The tracking of foreign students attending U.S. institutions post-9/11 has sparked debate in the academic and scientific community. Legislation such as the SEVP/CIPRIS aimed to monitor foreign students' enrollment, field of study, and financial support, but faced challenges in implementation due to cost and opposition from institutions. The USA Patriot Act and Enhanced Border Security Act also impacted the tracking of foreign students. The USA Patriot Act and the Enhanced Border Security Act enhanced the process for monitoring foreign students and researchers in U.S. institutions. The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) was developed to maintain current information on foreign students and exchange visitors to ensure proper visa status during their stay. However, SEVIS faced implementation problems and delays, partly due to more rigorous screening of visa applicants. The implementation of SEVIS was extended to February 15, 2003, but faced considerable problems and delays in processing visa applications. The proposal for SEVIS II aims to address technical difficulties and security issues. A hearing in 2005 focused on strengthening the visa process for antiterrorism measures while facilitating legitimate travel. Witnesses highlighted increased consular workloads and the lack of strategic direction and resources in visa-processing offices. Witnesses testified about the challenges in visa processing, including increased workloads, lack of resources, and training. The Government Accountability Office has released reports on improvements in visa operations. Clear procedures are needed to ensure consistent visa adjudication worldwide. The GAO assessed agencies' progress in implementing changes in visa operations, recommending clarifying visa policies and procedures. Comprehensive immigration reform legislation was debated in the 110th Congress but failed. H.R. 4321, Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America's Security and Prosperity Act, aims to exempt certain U.S.-educated immigrants from employment-based immigration limits and amend H-1B visa employer application requirements. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America's Security and Prosperity Act aims to exempt U.S.-educated immigrants from employment-based immigration limits and amend H-1B visa employer application requirements. Other bills in the 111th Congress focus on attracting foreign students in scientific and technical disciplines and addressing issues impacting collaboration between U.S. and foreign scientists and engineers. The H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act would limit the number of H-1B and L-1 employees that large employers can hire and require annual audits of businesses with many H-1B workers. The STAPLE Act aims to prevent Ph.D.s trained in America from leaving the economy. The bill H.R. 1791, known as the Stopping Trained in America Ph.D.s from Leaving the Economy Act (STAPLE), aims to set numerical limitations on immigrants with a doctorate degree in scientific disciplines from a U.S. institution and an offer of employment in a related field. It also includes provisions for H-1B visa numerical limitations for immigrants with a doctorate in a scientific discipline and requires education as a condition of employment."
