    "content": "Each year, Congress funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to renew over 2.1 million Section 8 vouchers, which are rental subsidies for low-income families in the private market. The vouchers cover the difference between rent and the tenant's contribution (30% of adjusted income). The program is federally funded but administered locally by public housing authorities. The cost to PHAs is based on the tenant's actual rent or the maximum subsidy level, and 30% of the tenant's income. In recent years, Congress has made changes to the Section 8 voucher renewal funding distribution, leading to uncertainty for many local Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). This has prompted calls for a permanent funding formula, possibly through legislation. The changes started in FY2003, with PHAs previously funded based on their per-voucher cost from the previous year, adjusted for inflation. Despite receiving full funding, few PHAs were able to lease all their vouchers. Despite receiving full funding, few Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) were able to lease 100% of their authorized vouchers. Low utilization rates were a major concern for Congress, with national voucher utilization rates just over 91% in FY2000 and FY2001. PHAs typically had low budget utilization as well, resulting in excess funds in their budgets. HUD would reconcile budgets at the end of the year and recapture excess funds from PHAs' reserves. HUD used a formula based on actual costs from the previous year, adjusted for inflation, to request funding from Congress for the renewal of tenant-based Section 8 vouchers. In FY2003, Congress changed the funding formula for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to reduce unspent funds and better reflect actual voucher usage. This adjustment aimed to lower the amount of appropriations needed for the program by funding PHAs based on their average utilization rates. In FY2003, Congress changed the funding formula for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to reduce unspent funds by funding based on actual voucher usage. HUD was directed to fund PHAs based on their average annual per-voucher cost from the previous year, adjusted for inflation and actual lease numbers. HUD implemented a provision to base PHAs' budgets on utilization rates and costs from end-of-year statements or recent data. Renewal calculations for FY2003 were based on total unit months under lease and actual cost data. Funding increments were generally renewed for three months to calculate funding more accurately. Congress also created a Central Reserve fund for PHA replenishment. The Central Reserve fund was created by Congress to replenish PHA reserves in case of increased costs. Restrictions were placed on maximized leasing to prevent over-leasing by PHAs. The FY2004 appropriations law continued the restrictions on maximized leasing for PHAs, funding them based on actual voucher utilization rather than total authorized vouchers. Concerns about cost increases led to expectations for the Secretary to control expenses by utilizing administrative tools. The FY2004 appropriations law changed the process for renewing expiring annual contributions contracts (ACC) for public housing agencies, including using an inflation factor based on local factors. Additionally, the Secretary could now use Central Reserve funds for specific purposes. In FY2003, the Central Reserve fund could replenish PHA reserves depleted by increased utilization rates or costs. In FY2004, funds could only replenish reserves due to increased utilization, not costs. HUD implemented this change in April 2004. PHAs' budgets were based on end-of-year statements and adjusted by the annual adjustment factor. PHAs could appeal if rental costs rose higher than the inflation factor adopted by HUD. In FY2003, PHAs' budgets were adjusted by the annual adjustment factor (AAF) and could appeal if rental costs rose higher than the inflation factor adopted by HUD. HUD granted appeals requests of 380 agencies out of approximately 400 that applied, distributing $160 million from the Central Reserve. The final FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act moved the program further towards budget-based funding. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed the Secretary to fund PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates from specific time periods. PHAs were expected to manage their voucher programs within their budgets for CY2005, with reduced reserves and no Central Reserve provided. The act also continued the prohibition on maximized leasing. The FY2005 appropriations act made changes to how PHAs received voucher renewal funding, shifting to a calendar-year cycle. HUD provided guidance on budget levels in December 2004, with appeals limited to data errors. In 2004, PHAs were directed to inform HUD of data errors within 10 days. Appeals were limited to data errors only, not the formula used for budget calculations. Final calculations were published in January 2005, with agencies funded at 4.03% less than actual cost levels. A proration factor of just under 96% was implemented due to insufficient funding from Congress. Median change in PHA renewal budgets from FY2004 to FY2005 was a 0.17% increase, with a wide variance in changes. HUD provided administrative options to lower costs in 2005 in Notice PIH 2005-9. On February 25, 2005, HUD published Notice PIH 2005-9, offering administrative options for PHAs to reduce costs in 2005. Suggestions included lowering payment standards, restricting portability, and monitoring income eligibility more strictly. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act distributed renewal funding based on CY2005 eligibility, adjusted for inflation and prorated to fit within the budget. The act also provided $45 million for the Secretary to adjust agency budgets. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act provided $45 million for the Secretary to adjust agency budgets based on CY2005 eligibility, with PHAs funded at about 94% of their eligibility due to insufficient funding from Congress. Incentives were given to PHAs to reduce costs, resulting in a reversal of the cost growth trend seen in 2003. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act provided incentives to PHAs to reduce costs, resulting in a reversal of the cost growth trend seen in 2003. Average annual per voucher costs remained flat from 2004 to 2005 and declined by about 1.5% from 2005 to September 2006. Utilization dropped, with nearly 100,000 fewer households receiving assistance in 2006 compared to 2004. PHAs accumulated reserve funds, with unspent balances of 10% of their budget authority from January 2005 through September 2006. Budget utilization nationally dropped from over 98% in 2003 and 2004 to under 92% in 2006. The debate continued in FY2007 between a \"budget-based\" and \"unit-based\" funding formula for PHAs. In FY2007, the debate continued between a \"budget-based\" and \"unit-based\" funding formula for PHAs. President Bush requested Congress to fund the voucher program using a budget-based formula, but Congress rejected this proposal in the final FY2007 appropriations law. This law adopted a formula based on how much funding PHAs were using, rather than a fixed pot of funding. In FY2007, Congress rejected President Bush's proposal for a budget-based funding formula for PHAs. Instead, they adopted a formula based on PHAs' leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months, adjusted for various factors, and prorated to fit within the appropriated amount. The law included a central reserve fund for adjustments due to unforeseen circumstances or formula shifts, and continued the prohibition on over-leasing. The FY2007 funding formula for public housing agencies was based on leasing and cost data from the previous 12 months, with adjustments made for various factors. The formula was later amended by P.L. 110-28 to provide exceptions for certain agencies, including those affected by Hurricane Katrina and those with higher costs and utilization rates. The FY2007 funding formula for public housing agencies was based on leasing and cost data from the previous 12 months, with adjustments made for various factors. PHAs were funded based on their FY2006 usage, with higher costs and utilization rates benefiting under the new formula. The funding provided was sufficient for all PHAs to serve at least the same number of families as before. The formula combined unit-based and budget-based elements, with PHAs receiving funding based on the number of vouchers used and a fixed budget to administer their programs. The FY2008 funding formula for public housing agencies was unit-based and budget-based, with funding allocations tied to voucher usage and capped at a fixed budget. President Bush's FY2008 budget proposal included a \"budget-based\" voucher funding formula, adjusted for costs and program deposits. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act adopted a cost and utilization-based funding formula similar to FY2007, funding agencies based on leasing and costs from the prior year. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act adopted a cost and utilization-based funding formula similar to FY2007 for public housing agencies, with adjustments for leasing and costs from the prior year. It included a central reserve fund for HUD to make adjustments and an alternative formula for specific categories of agencies. Additionally, the Act included a rescission that reduced each PHA's funding level based on their unusable reserves exceeding 7% of their total received in FY2007. The FY2008 Act rescinded $723 million in FY2008 renewal funding, freeing up unusable reserves above 7% of total funding for PHAs. Congress reduced new appropriations for voucher renewals without decreasing overall funding available for PHAs in FY2008. President Bush's request for a budget-based funding formula in FY2009 was rejected, and HUD continued to use a hybrid, cost, and utilization-based formula for PHA funding. In FY2009, HUD funded PHAs based on leased vouchers' cost in FY2008, adjusted for inflation. PHAs' allocations were prorated based on Net Restricted Assets, with an offset of $750 million. PHAs were expected to supplement new funding with unused NRA and a $100 million renewal set-aside for adjustments. HUD used a hybrid formula for CY2009 funding as directed by Congress. HUD based CY2009 allocations on utilization and cost data submitted by PHAs for FY2008, but inaccurate estimates led to funding shortfalls for some PHAs administering the voucher program. Approximately 15% of PHAs faced insufficient funding to cover all voucher costs, requiring additional assistance from HUD. HUD estimated that 15% of PHAs administering the voucher program faced funding shortfalls in CY2009. To address this issue, HUD provided additional funding from the FY2009 set-aside and advised agencies on cost-cutting measures to prevent families from losing assistance. Congress also enacted legislation allowing HUD to access up to $200 million to support PHAs at risk of terminating assistance. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget requested up to $200 million in funding to prevent termination of assistance for families by adjusting PHAs' budgets. This funding formula aimed to offset excess reserves and reallocate funds to high-performing or needy agencies, lifting the prohibition on over-leasing. The final FY2010 funding law adopted a similar formula. The FY2010 funding law adopted a funding formula based on FY2009 data, adjusted for inflation. It did not provide the Secretary with authority to offset agency budgets based on reserves or lift the prohibition on over-leasing. Unlike previous years, there was no offset for unspent agency reserves in FY2010. Congress directed HUD to allocate Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher renewal funding based on costs and utilization in FY2011 and FY2012. The FY2012 law included a rescission of $650 million to be offset from PHAs with reserves above a certain level. The FY2012 funding law included a rescission of $650 million to be offset from PHAs with reserves above a certain level. Following funding formula changes between FY2003 and FY2006, PHAs served fewer families and spent a smaller share of federal funding. Utilization patterns have started to change again with a hybrid cost and utilization-based model, increasing from around 91% in 2006 to 95% by the end of 2009. PHAs were serving over 150,000 more families by the end of 2009 compared to 2006. By the end of 2009, PHAs were serving over 150,000 more families than in 2006, surpassing the previous high point in families served in 2003. Per voucher costs began rising in 2007 and were expected to continue increasing in 2012. Proposed voucher reform legislation aims to change the funding formula, but Appropriations Committees have the authority to override it each year since FY2003. The Section 8 voucher program underwent funding changes starting in FY2003, shifting from an entitlement program to a discretionary one with fixed annual funding. Appropriations Committees have overridden new funding formulas each year since FY2003, raising concerns about cost control and efficiency. The Section 8 voucher program underwent funding changes starting in FY2003, shifting to a fixed annual funding structure. This change gave Congress more budget control but made the program harder to administer for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). PHAs had limited control over costs, leading to adjustments in payment standards and voucher issuance. Some PHAs reduced payment standards and conducted rent reviews, resulting in landlords accepting lower rents or exiting the program. PHAs also had the option to select higher-income families from waiting lists. Some PHAs reduced rents paid to landlords, leading to some landlords leaving the program. PHAs could select higher-income families from waiting lists to lower subsidy costs. PHAs intentionally lowered utilization rates to save money, causing budget problems in FY2005. Voucher costs leveled off and utilization rates declined from 2005 to 2006. Average voucher costs declined by around 1.5% and utilization declined by over 2% from 2005 to 2006. Some agencies received more funding than allowed, leading to unusable funds for 7% of all PHAs. Changes in budget-based funding formulas were controversial, with advocates calling for a return to an actual-cost and unit-based formula. PHA industry groups felt constrained by the current formula. In FY2007, PHAs were funded based on the amount of funding they were using in the previous year, rather than the amount of money they had received in the previous year. This reversed recent trends and allowed PHAs to continue serving all families, with additional families, as long as they were not overleasing. FY2008 and FY2009 formulas closely followed the FY2007 formula, including reductions in budgets for agencies with excess reserve funding. The FY2008 and FY2009 formulas closely followed the FY2007 formula, including reductions in budgets for agencies with excess reserve funding. The funding model has now shifted to a cost and utilization-based model, incentivizing PHAs to increase utilization. This has led to rising costs and utilization, putting pressure on policymakers to contain costs in the program. Rising costs in FY2003 and FY2004 may pressure policy makers to contain program costs. Past strategies reduced costs but also decreased families served and led to unspent funds. Future cost containment strategies should aim to maintain service levels while minimizing unspent funds. Proposed Section 8 voucher reform may increase families served without capping cost growth, subject to future appropriations legislation."
