    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts legislation to ensure county assessors follow state laws for consistent and accurate property assessments. Staff must be certified to make decisions on property exemptions and ownership changes. Education and certification requirements will be implemented efficiently with existing resources. Section 674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended and renumbered to 681. Section 674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require competitive bids for appraisal work contracts. Contractors must maintain confidentiality of assessee information and records obtained during the contract. The assessor must authorize any requests for additional information or records by the contractor. A contractor must not share appraisal data with assessors from other counties. They must return and purge any confidential information obtained from an assessee after the contract ends. Contracts must include provisions for confidentiality and compliance with state regulations. Article 8.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code requires contractors performing appraisal work for assessors to include specific language in their contracts. Assessors must hold a valid assessment analyst certificate to make decisions on changes in ownership or property tax exemptions. The board administers examinations for assessment analyst certificates, in collaboration with the Department of Human Resources. Applicants must pass the exam and demonstrate competency in making ownership or exemption decisions. Denials can be reviewed under the Administrative Procedure Act. Holding an appraiser's certificate exempts assessors from this requirement. The board requires certified assessment analysts to complete 24 hours of training annually to maintain their certificate. Any excess training hours can be carried over for up to three years. Failure to comply may result in certificate revocation following procedures outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act. This requirement does not apply to assessors holding valid appraiser's certificates. The board issues an advanced assessment analyst certificate for applicants with at least three years of experience who have completed an advanced course of study or passed an advanced level examination. To maintain the certificate, holders must complete 12 hours of training annually, with excess hours carried over for up to two years. The advanced assessment analyst certificate requires 12 hours of annual training, with excess hours carried over for up to two years. Failure to comply may result in certificate revocation. Training includes updates on case law, statutory law, and administrative rules. Applicants must disclose financial interests in legal entities at certification and annually thereafter. The board requires applicants to disclose financial interests in legal entities at certification and annually thereafter. A temporary certificate may be issued to newly elected or appointed assessors for up to one year to allow time for examination. Temporary certificates are not renewable. The board may issue an interim certificate to current assessors or employees of the county assessor's office to allow them to apply for an examination. The interim certificate cannot exceed four years unless the person is elected or appointed assessor. The article does not prevent assessors from efficiently managing staff resources, as long as noncertificated staff do not make exemption or ownership decisions. This article applies only in counties that have passed a resolution requiring certification."
