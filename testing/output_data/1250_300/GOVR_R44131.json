Congressional actions have been proposed to resolve these issues and move the program forward. The report details the history of UCLASS requirements development and changes over time, starting with research on unmanned combat air vehicles in 1999. In 1999, the Navy and DARPA began research on unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs). The Navy's UCAV, known as N-UCAV, was designed for reconnaissance missions to identify targets for manned aircraft. Northrop Grumman built a single X-47A air vehicle for testing. In 2002, the OSD mandated the Navy and Air Force merge their UCAV programs into a joint demonstration program for increased synergy. The Defense Department directed the Navy and Air Force to merge their UCAV programs into a joint demonstration program in 2003, resulting in the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems (J-UCAS) program. The J-UCAS program aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and military utility of networked high-performance unmanned air vehicles for various missions. However, the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review called for the termination of the J-UCAS program, with the Air Force tasked to develop a new bomber and the Navy mandated to develop an unmanned carrier-based aircraft capable of air-refueling. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review led to the termination of the J-UCAS program. Instead, the Air Force started developing a new bomber, while the Navy was directed to create an unmanned carrier-based aircraft with greater capabilities. This effort resulted in the Navy Unmanned Combat Air System (N-UCAS), which aimed to provide persistent surveillance and strike capabilities in high-threat areas. The Navy invested over $1.4 billion in the N-UCAS program, including the successful demonstration of operating unmanned air combat systems from an aircraft carrier in 2013. The Navy invested over $1.4 billion in the UCAS-D program, a subset of N-UCAS, which successfully launched and landed on an aircraft carrier in 2013. Following this, the Navy received approval to begin planning for the UCLASS acquisition program, aimed at addressing a capability gap in sea-based surveillance and enhancing operational capabilities in contested environments. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council approved the UCLASS Initial Capabilities Document, defining it as a persistent, survivable carrier-based Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance and precision strike platform. The JROC approved the UCLASS Initial Capabilities Document in 2011, defining it as a carrier-based ISR and precision strike asset. In 2012, revised requirements favored permissive airspace ISR capabilities due to budget constraints. The Navy adapted to affordability directives by redefining the scope of the UCLASS program. The Navy redefined the scope of the UCLASS program to support various missions, emphasizing affordability as a top priority. The CDD established an affordability KPP with a cost limit for air vehicles. The Navy issued a draft RFP for the UCLASS system in April 2014, focusing on affordability, timely fielding, and endurance. The Navy issued a draft request for proposals (RFP) for the UCLASS system in April 2014, emphasizing affordability, timely fielding, and endurance. The goal of the UCLASS program is to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance orbits at tactically significant ranges 24/7 over uncontested airspace, with a light strike capability. The system is designed for early operational capability in permissive environments, with the potential for future growth to operate in contested environments. The UCLASS program aims to design a system that allows for capability growth to operate in contested environments. Delays in procurement have been experienced due to changes in requirements, with the timeline for awarding the air system contract now expected in fiscal year 2017, a delay of around 3 years. The Navy's UCLASS program has experienced delays in procurement, with the award of the air system contract now expected in fiscal year 2017, a delay of around 3 years. Early operational capability is now expected in fiscal year 2022, a delay of around 2 years. Further reviews and changes in DOD priorities may lead to evolving requirements."
