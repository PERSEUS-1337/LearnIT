    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal statute that provides funding for special education services for children with disabilities. It requires states to offer a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to all eligible children, identify and evaluate those with disabilities, create individual education programs (IEPs) for each child, and involve parents in the planning process. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires states to provide special education services to children with disabilities through individual education programs (IEPs). Parents must be involved in planning and overseeing their child's education. IDEA also ensures that children with disabilities are educated alongside non-disabled children whenever possible. The law was enacted in 1975 to address the need for education for children with disabilities. IDEA has undergone multiple reauthorizations, with the most recent in 2004. Congress is currently considering potential issues for the next reauthorization. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires states to provide special education services to children with disabilities through individual education programs (IEPs). Congress is currently beginning the process of identifying potential issues for the next reauthorization. The IDEA definition of a child with a disability is categorical and includes specific conditions that require special education and related services. The court in Hansen v. Republic R-III School District examined whether a child with conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and ADHD qualified as a child with a disability under IDEA. The court found that the child met the categories of serious emotional disturbance and other health impairments, emphasizing the need for special education services. Other court decisions have also focused on the importance of the need for special education services in determining eligibility under IDEA. In court decisions, children with disabilities, even if their disability has minimal impact on education, are considered covered by IDEA. For example, a child with Asperger's Syndrome and an adjustment disorder was deemed a child with a disability under IDEA, despite high grades and non-disruptive behavior. Similarly, a child with schizophrenia was also considered a child with a disability under IDEA, as evidenced by missed school days and incomplete assignments. The courts rejected arguments that IDEA only applies to children with disabilities significantly impacting educational performance. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found that a child with disabilities, including ADHD, depression, reactive attachment disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder, was eligible for IDEA services due to missed school days, incomplete assignments, and potential relapse in a public school setting. However, the Ninth Circuit ruled that a child with similar conditions but exhibiting violent tendencies was not eligible for IDEA services as her behavior did not significantly impact her educational performance. The Fifth Circuit also found no adverse educational effect from a child's ADHD in a separate case. The Second Circuit case of Mr. and Mrs. N.C. v. Bedford Central School District examined whether a child with dysthymic disorder met the requirements of IDEA regulations for seriously emotionally disturbed. It was found that the child's behavior did not meet the criteria for seriously emotionally disturbed. Additionally, there was insufficient evidence that the child's educational performance was adversely affected. IDEA mandates that states must have policies in place to identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities in need of special education, known as child find. The Ninth Circuit case of Compton Unified School District v. Addison highlighted that a school district's failure to evaluate a ninth grader who exhibited concerning behavior in class could be a violation of IDEA's child find requirement. The Supreme Court is considering a case involving a school district's failure to evaluate a ninth grader who failed all her classes and exhibited concerning behavior in class. The issue is whether parents can file a due process complaint alleging negligence when school officials fail to provide an educational program for their child with a disability. IDEA requires states to provide children with disabilities a free appropriate public education to receive federal funding. The Supreme Court's decision in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley in 1982 established the requirements of a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The Court emphasized that access to specialized instruction and related services must be sufficient to confer educational benefit upon children with disabilities. The Supreme Court's decision in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley in 1982 established the requirements of a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The Court emphasized that access to specialized instruction and related services must be sufficient to confer educational benefit upon children with disabilities. FAPE is met when personalized instruction with support services is provided at public expense, meeting state standards and the child's IEP, and when the child's educational progress is monitored through grading and advancement systems. The Supreme Court emphasized that the IEP should enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade, but states are not required to maximize each child's potential. FAPE is met if the child is progressing and making measurable gains. Courts must avoid imposing their views on educational methods, as the responsibility lies with state and local agencies. Determining if children with disabilities are receiving sufficient educational benefits is more challenging than ensuring access to education due to the wide spectrum of disabilities. Determining if children with disabilities are receiving sufficient educational benefits under IDEA is more challenging than ensuring access to education. The Court did not establish a specific test for adequacy of educational benefits, with lower courts interpreting the Rowley decision differently. Some courts have supported schools' IEPs even with minimal educational progress, citing the \"access to education\" requirement. For example, in Fort Zumwalt School District v. Clynes, the Eighth Circuit found an IEP adequate despite low reading scores, while dissenting opinions argued the child's progress was trivial. The court noted that the child was making progress in school despite low reading proficiency scores. Some courts have differing interpretations of IDEA, with some requiring more than minimal educational benefit in an IEP. For example, the Third Circuit held that an IEP must provide more than de minimis benefit, while the Fifth Circuit emphasized that the educational benefit must be meaningful. The Cypress-Fairbanks court identified four factors to determine if an IEP meets this standard. The Cypress-Fairbanks court identified four factors to determine if an IEP meets the standard of providing meaningful educational benefit. Courts have looked at academic achievement testing and grades to measure educational benefit under IDEA. Procedural violations do not always result in a violation of FAPE. The Ninth Circuit held that failure to evaluate a child in all areas of suspected disability is a procedural error that can deny FAPE. Certain procedural violations may be significant enough to be a denial of FAPE, such as unilaterally scheduling an IEP meeting without attempting to reach a mutually agreed upon time. The Ninth Circuit ruled that not evaluating a child in all suspected disability areas is a procedural error denying FAPE. Another FAPE denial occurred when an IEP meeting was unilaterally scheduled without parental agreement. The interpretation of \"educational standards\" has evolved, now focusing on specific content-based standards. The 1997 IDEA Amendments reflected this shift towards standards-based education. The IDEA Amendments reflected the standards-based education movement, changing IEP requirements to include present levels of performance and measurable goals. The 2004 reauthorization emphasized high expectations and access to the general curriculum for children with disabilities. Questions have arisen regarding the application of the Rowley standard in light of these changes. The 2004 IDEA Amendments introduced new standards for education, including the requirement for specially designed instruction based on peer-reviewed research. This has raised questions about how it aligns with the Rowley standard for educational benefit. In a court case, Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District, this issue was addressed. The court in Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District rejected the argument that an IEP must be based on peer-reviewed research, emphasizing that the school's \"eclectic approach\" was sufficient under IDEA. The court also highlighted the importance of not imposing preferred educational methods on states. IDEA mandates the formation of an Individualized Education Team to create a personalized education program for disabled children, with specific requirements for the IEP. The IEP under IDEA must include present levels of academic achievement, annual goals, services provided, and integration with non-disabled children. Judicial decisions focus on compliance with IDEA procedures and the educational benefits provided by the IEP. It does not have to be perfect but should be reasonably calculated to benefit the child. In a specific case, flaws in an IEP were found but still considered compliant with IDEA. In School Board of Independent School District No. 11 v. Joshua Renollett, the Eighth Circuit court of appeals found that despite some flaws in the child's IEP, as long as they did not compromise his right to an appropriate education or deprive him of educational benefits, there was no violation of IDEA. Similarly, the Second Circuit in Cabouli v. Chappaqua Central School District determined that evidence supporting the adequacy of the IEP, such as the child's recent social progress, indicated that the child would likely make educational progress under the IEP, thus not violating IDEA. Lack of a functional behavioral assessment in an IEP does not automatically invalidate it, as shown in Nack v. Orange City School District where procedural violations that did not harm the student substantively were not considered a violation of IDEA. Additionally, lack of progress in one school year does not necessarily indicate an IDEA violation, as IDEA does not guarantee success but requires that a student receives educational benefits. In Nack v. Orange City School District, the court held that violations not causing substantive harm were not IDEA violations. A lack of progress in one school year does not always indicate a violation, as IDEA does not guarantee success but requires specialized services for educational benefit. However, in cases like A.K. v. Alexandria City School Board and M.L. v. Federal Way School District, an IEP that does not provide educational benefits violates IDEA. In R.B. v. Napa Valley Unified School District, IDEA does not mandate the child's current special education teacher's participation, as long as a teacher who has taught the child is present. In R.B. v. Napa Valley Unified School District, IDEA does not require the child's current special education teacher's participation, as long as a teacher who has taught the child is present. Courts have limited parents' control over the IEP content, allowing schools to perform independent evaluations without parental consent. Despite this, courts have ruled in favor of parents in some IEP cases. Courts have found in favor of parents in IEP cases, such as in County School Board of York County v. A.L. where a lack of notice and failure to inform parents of due process rights violated IDEA. Violations of procedural requirements, like determining placement before an IEP meeting, have also been found. FAPE, a cornerstone of IDEA, includes special education and related services like transportation and speech-language pathology. FAPE under IDEA requires special education and related services, including transportation, speech-language pathology, and other supportive services to help children with disabilities benefit from special education. Supreme Court cases have addressed the definition of related services, particularly regarding what constitutes a medical service. The Supreme Court has addressed the concept of related services under IDEA, specifically focusing on the provision of medical services to children with disabilities. In Irving Independent School District v. Tatro, the Court ruled that services impacting both medical and educational needs must be provided if necessary for the child to benefit from special education. The decision established criteria for when non-physician personnel can administer medical services, setting a precedent for future court rulings on the matter. In Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F., the Supreme Court ruled that the medical services exclusion from the definition of related services under IDEA is limited to services provided by a physician or hospital. This decision emphasized the overarching purpose of IDEA to provide public education to all qualified children, regardless of their medical needs. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA established risk pools for high-need children with disabilities, allowing states to reserve funds to assist LEAs. Recent IDEA cases have focused on defining required services for children with disabilities and emphasized the importance of inclusive education. Children with disabilities should be educated with non-disabled children to the maximum extent possible, with separate schooling only when necessary. Recent court decisions use a two-pronged approach to determine if an Individualized Education Program (IEP) places a student in the least restrictive environment. Factors considered include efforts to accommodate the child in a regular classroom, educational benefits compared to special education, and the impact on other students. In A.G. v. Durtan, the Third Circuit examined the impact of a child with disabilities on other students in a regular classroom, noting disruptive behaviors. The court upheld the decision that the child could not be satisfactorily educated full time in a regular classroom. P.L. 94-142, the original version of IDEA, provided grants to states for education of children with disabilities and outlined specific requirements for receiving federal funds, including resolving disputes between schools and parents. The Public Law 94-142 provided federal funds for education of children with disabilities and outlined specific requirements for states. It included a \"stay put\" provision to prevent discriminatory practices of expelling children with disabilities from school. The Supreme Court case Honig v. Doe in 1988 addressed the issue of exceptions to the \"stay put\" rule for emotionally disturbed children involved in disruptive behaviors. The Supreme Court case Honig v. Doe in 1988 addressed the issue of exceptions to the \"stay put\" rule for emotionally disturbed children involved in disruptive behaviors. The Court ruled that schools cannot unilaterally expel disabled students, but can temporarily suspend them for up to 10 days if they pose a safety threat. The decision also allowed schools to seek judicial relief in cases where parents refuse to change the child's placement. This right to seek judicial relief became known as a Honig injunction. The Honig injunction allows schools to seek judicial relief for placement changes under IDEA. Amendments in 1994, 1997, and 2004 expanded the provision to include weapons, drugs, and serious bodily injury cases. Courts have also addressed stay put requirements during transitions from Part C to Part B of IDEA. The stay put provision applies during transitions from Part C to Part B of IDEA. The Third Circuit in Pardini v. Allegheny Intermediate Unit held that the provision requires the child to continue receiving services until disputes are resolved. However, the Eleventh Circuit in D.P. v. School Board of Broward County disagreed, stating that children applying for initial admission to a public school program are not entitled to continue services under their IFSPs. Other issues related to stay put involve mediation, private school placement, resource room to classroom moves, and appeals in the courts. Sammons v. Polk County School Board raised questions about the provision's application. The stay put provision under IDEA applies during transitions from Part C to Part B, ensuring children receive services until disputes are resolved. Issues related to stay put include mediation, private school placement, resource room to classroom moves, and court appeals. Legal cases like Sammons v. Polk County School Board have questioned the provision's application in various scenarios. In E.Y. v. Elysian Charter School of Hoboken, the court held that the stay put provision applied to the previous school year's placement. In Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District, the provision was upheld throughout the appeals process. However, in N.D. v. State of Hawaii, a novel application of the stay put provision failed. The Ninth Circuit ruled in a case involving Hawaii's furlough of teachers that the provision does not cover system-wide changes affecting all students. The Ninth Circuit found no violation of the stay put provision in IDEA, stating it does not cover system-wide changes in public schools. Congress showed interest in seclusion and restraints, passing the \"Keeping all Students Safe Act.\" IDEA emphasizes positive behavioral interventions but does not prohibit the use of restraints for children with disabilities. State laws may address the use of restraints. The Department noted that state laws may address the use of restraints for children with disabilities, emphasizing that restraints should be consistent with the child's IEP and positive behavioral interventions. The Supreme Court has not specifically addressed the use of seclusion or restraints under IDEA, but in Honig v. Doe, it held that suspensions longer than ten days violated IDEA's \"stay-put\" provision. The Court suggested alternative measures like study carrels, timeouts, and detention. Educators can use various disciplinary measures, including study carrels, timeouts, detention, and suspension, to address behavioral issues in students with disabilities. While IDEA does not specifically mention restraints and seclusion, courts have generally allowed their use if necessary to prevent harm and if the child's IEP addresses behavioral issues. In cases like C.N. v. Willmar Public Schools, parents have challenged the use of these procedures, leading to the child's withdrawal from the school. The parents withdrew their daughter from the school due to alleged improper and excessive use of seclusion and restraint procedures. They requested a due process hearing challenging the adequacy of educational services. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the case, stating that complaints must be filed while the child is still in the school district. In another case, parents used IDEA to challenge a New York State regulation banning aversive interventions, leading to a vacated injunction and remand for further findings. The Second Circuit vacated the district court's injunction against the regulation banning aversive interventions, finding it to be an informed and rational choice consistent with the purposes of the IDEA. Disability harassment may result in a denial of FAPE, with courts differing on whether it must be tied to IDEA and exhaustion of administrative remedies under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The court held that disability harassment can lead to a denial of FAPE and must be addressed under IDEA, ADA, and Section 504. Procedural safeguards under Section 615 of IDEA protect the rights of parents and children with disabilities, including due process procedures for filing complaints within two years of the alleged violation. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA allows schools to file due process complaints within two years of the alleged violation. A resolution session is required before a due process hearing, involving parents, the IEP team, and a representative from the local educational agency. Mediation provisions were added in the 1997 reauthorization and judicial enforcement of agreements was provided for in the 2004 reauthorization. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA allows schools to file due process complaints within two years of the alleged violation. Provisions for mediation of disputes were added in 1997 and judicial enforcement of agreements was provided for in 2004. Court decisions have addressed issues regarding resolution sessions, including confidentiality, presence of attorneys, and the impact of procedural violations on FAPE. In legal cases related to IDEA, courts have ruled that settlement agreements reached through mediation are enforceable. For example, in Amy S. v. Danbury, the court upheld a mediation agreement despite a dispute over transportation for tutoring services. Similarly, in Ballard v. Philadelphia School District, a parent's argument against a settlement agreement was rejected. IDEA requires due process complaints to include a description of the problem, relevant facts, and proposed resolution. In Knight v. Washington School District, a district court addressed issues regarding the review of a hearing officer's determination that a due process complaint did not meet IDEA's pleading requirements. The court found it troubling that a state official's dismissal of a complaint based on federal law appeared to be unreviewable in federal court. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of the action. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of the action but modified it to be without prejudice. Courts have addressed whether an LEA can sue an SEA for IDEA noncompliance, finding no private right of action. In Traverse Bay Area Intermediate School District v. Michigan Department of Education, the Sixth Circuit held that LEAs lack statutory authority to challenge state agencies on IDEA procedural issues. Similarly, the Ninth Circuit in Lake Washington School District No. 414 v. Washington State Office of Administrative Hearings ruled that LEAs cannot litigate issues beyond those raised by parents under IDEA. In Winkelman v. Parma City School District, the Supreme Court ruled that parents have the right to bring pro se suits under IDEA for their own rights, including the entitlement to a free appropriate public education. Justice Kennedy emphasized that IDEA grants parents enforceable rights beyond procedural or reimbursement issues, considering the Act's entire statutory scheme. Kennedy emphasized that IDEA grants parents enforceable rights beyond procedural or reimbursement issues, considering the Act's entire statutory scheme to protect the rights of children with disabilities and their parents. The Court found that parents have a personal interest in IDEA's goals and that the Act provides both procedural and substantive rights to parents and children with disabilities. The Supreme Court found that IDEA grants parents enforceable rights beyond procedural or reimbursement issues. Justice Kennedy emphasized that the Act provides both procedural and substantive rights to parents and children with disabilities, allowing parents to enforce FAPE and award attorneys' fees in certain circumstances. Courts have ruled that non-attorney parents can amend complaints to assert their own claims, but cannot use their rights to bypass existing consent decrees. In some cases, parental rights have been extended to cases under Section 504, ADA, and IDEA, but not all courts agree with this interpretation. In Woodruff v. Hamilton Township Public Schools, parents' claims were dismissed as not personal to them. In D.A. and M.A. v. Pleasantville School District, the court found that Winkelman reflected the specific language and structure of IDEA with its emphasis on parental involvement and was not applicable to Section 504 and the ADA. The issue of parental rights in recovering damages under IDEA for lost earnings and suffering was raised in Blanchard v. Morton School District. The Ninth Circuit noted that money damages were not available for a child with a disability under IDEA. The Second Circuit addressed the rights of a noncustodial parent in Fuentes v. Board of Education of New York City. The IDEA regulations define the term \"parent\" and emphasize that a parent is presumed to have legal authority to make educational decisions for the child. The Fuentes court ruled that a noncustodial biological parent lacked this authority. Besides IDEA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA also address the education rights of individuals with disabilities, with each statute playing a significant role in ensuring equal education opportunities. IDEA, enacted in 1975, provides additional programs for children with disabilities, while Section 504 and the ADA, civil rights statutes enacted in 1973 and 1990 respectively, prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities. The Section 504 and ADA statutes prohibit discrimination against individuals with disabilities, with the ADA having broader coverage. The interaction of these statutes with IDEA in providing educational coverage has been examined by courts, noting differences in coverage and due process requirements. The burden of proof in a due process hearing under IDEA is not specified. IDEA contains detailed due process requirements for FAPE, including an impartial hearing. The burden of proof in an IDEA due process hearing was clarified in the Supreme Court's Schaffer v. Weast decision, placing it on the party seeking relief. Various arguments for shifting the burden to the school system were rejected, with the Court emphasizing fairness in determining the burden of proof. The Supreme Court rejected arguments for shifting the burden of proof to the school system in IDEA due process hearings. Justice O'Connor emphasized that IDEA provides parents with protections to ensure fairness and equal access to information, including the right to review records, independent evaluations, and disclosure of evaluations and recommendations. This ensures that schools do not have a unique informational advantage. Issues regarding services for children with disabilities in private schools and payment for these services remain a ongoing concern. Justice O'Connor emphasized that IDEA provides protections to ensure fairness and equal access to information for parents of children with disabilities. The issue of services for children with disabilities in private schools and who pays for them continues to be a source of controversy. IDEA requires some services for children in private schools, even if they are unilaterally placed there by their parents. The IDEA allows for reimbursement of private school placement costs if a child with a disability did not receive a free appropriate public education in a timely manner. Recent Supreme Court cases have addressed this issue, with the 2007 decision in Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York v. Tom F. being a key example. In 2007, the Supreme Court allowed reimbursement for private school tuition for parents of a child with a disability, even if the child had not received special education services from the public school. This decision did not set a precedent for lower courts, leaving the issue unsettled. However, in 2009, the Supreme Court ruled in Forest Grove School District v. T.A. that reimbursement for private special-education services is authorized under IDEA when a public school fails to provide a FAPE and the private-school placement is appropriate. In Forest Grove School District v. T.A., the Supreme Court ruled that IDEA allows reimbursement for private special-education services when a public school fails to provide a FAPE and the private-school placement is appropriate. Lower court decisions have found that if a child is making educational progress with an adequate IEP from the public school, they may not be entitled to private school placement or tuition reimbursement. The same standards apply when parents seek to place their child in a different private school than the one chosen by the school district. If a private school does not meet the child's needs, the court may not require tuition reimbursement. The court may not require private school tuition reimbursement if the private school does not adequately address the child's educational needs. Reimbursement for private school tuition is barred if parents arrange for private school services without notifying the LEA of their problems with their child's IDEA services. Parents may be entitled to private school reimbursement if the child has not previously received special education services. If a school district deprives a child with a disability of FAPE, the child may be entitled to private school reimbursement. Compensatory education is awarded to compensate for inadequate special education services. It stems from the Supreme Court's ruling in School Committee of the Town of Burlington v. Department of Education of Massachusetts. Parents can receive reimbursement for private school tuition if the public school program violates FAPE. Lower courts have ruled that if financial reimbursement is allowed, compensatory services must also be provided. However, there is ambiguity in how compensatory education should be awarded, with some courts basing it on the amount of time appropriate services were withheld. Courts have differing approaches to awarding compensatory education, with some basing it on the time appropriate services were withheld and others focusing on equitable education under IDEA. Section 1983 allows suits against state officials for rights deprivation, but the application to IDEA and damages is unclear. Some courts allow damages, while others do not. The IDEA procedural remedies must be exhausted before filing a \u00a71983 action. The application of section 1983 to IDEA and damages is unclear, with some courts allowing damages while others do not. The Supreme Court in Smith v. Robinson held that the only remedies under IDEA are those contained in the statute, stating that using other statutes for attorneys' fees would be inconsistent with Congress' scheme. Congress responded by enacting the Handicapped Children's Protection Act in 1986 to provide for attorneys' fees. In response to the controversial decision in Smith v. Robinson, Congress enacted the Handicapped Children's Protection Act in 1986 to provide for attorneys' fees under IDEA. Subsequent amendments in 1997 and the 2004 IDEA reauthorization, P.L. 108-446, made changes to attorneys' fees provisions, including allowing fees for the state or local educational agency in certain situations. The ADA also allows for attorneys' fees to be awarded to a prevailing party at the court's discretion. The ADA allows courts to award attorneys' fees to a prevailing party. The Supreme Court rejected the \"catalyst theory\" for attorneys' fees, stating fees are only available with a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship. Courts have applied this to IDEA cases, awarding fees in administrative and judicial proceedings, even without a denial of FAPE. Attorneys' fees can be awarded to the prevailing party in judicial proceedings, even without a denial of FAPE. Fees may not be awarded if a child has not been determined to be disabled under IDEA. Judicial approval is required for attorneys' fees in settlement agreements. Fees are not awarded for voluntary settlements or representation by consultants. Attorneys' fees can be awarded to the prevailing party in judicial proceedings, even without a denial of FAPE. Fees may not be awarded if a child has not been determined to be disabled under IDEA. Courts have discretion in determining the amount of attorneys' fees to award, considering the party's degree of success. Refusal to attend a meeting when a proposed settlement has not been offered does not necessarily result in a reduction of the award. Congress imposed a fee cap on IDEA cases in the District of Columbia in FY1999. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization added a provision allowing courts to award attorneys' fees to a prevailing party in cases where a parent's complaint is found to be frivolous or without foundation. In El Paso Independent School District v. Berry, the Fifth Circuit permitted attorneys' fees to be awarded against a lawyer who obstructed the evaluation of a student. In School District v. Berry, the Fifth Circuit allowed attorneys' fees against a lawyer who obstructed student evaluation. The fee-shifting provision doesn't apply to private schools. Prevailing in court doesn't make parents' actions frivolous. The Ninth Circuit warned against discouraging lawyers from taking on meritorious IDEA cases. Cases have debated if the LEA was the prevailing party. In School District v. Berry, the Fifth Circuit allowed attorneys' fees against a lawyer who obstructed student evaluation. The D.C. Court of Appeals refused to award fees for the school district in District of Columbia v. Straus. The court noted concerns about allowing attorney's fees for prevailing parties in IDEA cases. The Supreme Court, in Arlington Central School District v. Murphy, held that IDEA does not authorize prevailing parents to recover fees paid to experts. The decision was guided by Congress enacting IDEA under the Spending Clause, which requires unambiguous conditions for states accepting funds. The Supreme Court's decision in Arlington Central School District v. Murphy was guided by Congress enacting IDEA under the Spending Clause, which requires clear conditions for states accepting funds. H.R. 1208 and S. 613 were introduced in the 112th Congress to amend IDEA to include expert witness fees. IDEA has two dispute resolution methods, and the Department of Education monitors its implementation. The Department of Education is responsible for monitoring the implementation of IDEA, which allows complaints by any organization or individual. Court cases filed by protection and advocacy systems often involve systemic violations of rights, including those of special education students."
