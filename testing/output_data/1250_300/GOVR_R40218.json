    "content": "Since the mid-1980s, Congress has passed legislation to support older youth in foster care through the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP), providing services like housing. Despite these efforts, research shows that foster youth struggle more than their peers in transitioning to adulthood. Former foster youth face challenges in transitioning to adulthood, including difficulties in higher education, poor health, homelessness, and reliance on public support. Policy makers and advocates are working to provide support for youth after they age out of the system at 18. The 110th Congress focused on child welfare reforms, leading to the passage of the Fostering Connections to Success Act. The 110th Congress conducted hearings on child welfare reforms, leading to the passage of the Fostering Connections to Success Act. Subsequent efforts by the 113th Congress resulted in the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, which provides protections and promotes normalcy for older youth in foster care. The report discusses issues affecting older youth transitioning from foster care into adulthood, focusing on the implementation challenges of extending foster care to older youth. States may face difficulties in providing continued support due to cost concerns, despite federal assistance. States are also required to assist youth in developing a transition plan within 90 days of exiting care. Emancipated youth transitioning from foster care face challenges in establishing permanent connections, securing health insurance, housing, and staying connected to work and school. Concerns also exist about their vulnerability to child sex trafficking. A new national database may provide insight into their outcomes in education, employment, and contact with social services and the criminal justice system. Youth in foster care face challenges in education, employment, and contact with social services and criminal justice systems. They are also vulnerable to child sex trafficking. P.L. 113-183 requires child welfare agencies to have policies in place to serve these youth. Congress may monitor state implementation of these requirements and identify best practices for serving victims. The overall number of children in foster care has been declining in the past decade. The number of children in foster care has been decreasing over the past decade. Older children aged 13-17 made up about 29% of the caseload in FY2002, increasing to 35% in FY2010, and then decreasing to 34% in FY2012. The number of youth aging out of foster care has fluctuated, with a recent low of 23,396 (10%) in FY2012. A study tracked outcomes of former foster youth in three states: Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The survey collected data at different ages, comparing their outcomes to peers in the general population. The most recent results at age 26 showed negative outcomes for former foster youth. Former foster youth, aged 21 and no longer in care, were compared to their peers in the general population at ages 23, 24, and 26. The study found that former foster youth had more negative educational and employment outcomes, such as lower college degree attainment (2.5% vs 23.5%) and lower current employment rates (48.3% vs 79.9%). They also had a lower mean annual income of about $13,000 compared to their peers' $32,000. Youth in the Midwest Evaluation faced barriers to education, including financial constraints and employment. Former foster youth, aged 21 and no longer in care, had lower educational and employment outcomes compared to their peers. They had a lower college degree attainment rate (2.5% vs 23.5%) and lower current employment rate (48.3% vs 79.9%), with a mean annual income of about $13,000 compared to their peers' $32,000. The state child welfare agency is responsible for the care and placement of children removed from their homes due to abuse or neglect, using federal and state funds to reunite children with their parents or find them a permanent home. The state child welfare agency is responsible for promoting the safety, permanency, and well-being of children in foster care through written case plans and regular reviews. Specific procedures for older youth include preparing for transition to adulthood and listing rights in the case plan. The state child welfare agency is required to include in the child's case plan a document listing certain rights for children in foster care at age 14 or older, including education, health, visitation, and court participation. Children must also be consulted in the development of their case plan and permanency plan, with the option to choose up to two members of the planning teams. The state child welfare agency includes rights for children in foster care at age 14 or older in their case plan, allowing them to choose individuals to be part of their planning teams. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program prepares older youth for emancipation from foster care. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program prepares older youth in foster care for emancipation by providing services. The Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act made significant changes to federal child welfare statutes, including extending foster care to youth age 18 and older. The 113th Congress has focused on the needs of older youth in foster care and child sex trafficking. The 113th Congress has passed the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, which provides protections for older youth in foster care and addresses child sex trafficking. It promotes normalcy for children in foster care and requires agencies to respond to sex trafficking. Federal child welfare law includes provisions for older youth in care and those aging out, with funding available for room and board costs under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act. Indian tribes can request federal funds for room and board costs for eligible children in out-of-home foster care through the Title IV-E foster care program. This program is funded from the general treasury and provides reimbursement to states for eligible expenditures. Eligibility criteria include being in state care, meeting certain requirements such as citizenship, age, and family structure, and being placed in a licensed setting with an eligible provider. The state must also make efforts to secure a permanent home for the child. The state or tribal child welfare agency must provide a \"foster care maintenance payment\" on behalf of every Title IV-E eligible child in foster care, covering food, clothing, shelter, supervision, school supplies, personal incidentals, insurance, visitation travel, and school enrollment. Federal reimbursement is only available for children in licensed care settings. Reimbursement for child care costs is available for children in licensed care settings or foster homes. States and tribes receiving federal child welfare funds must promote safety and well-being for all youth in care. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments are available until age 18 or 19 if still in school, with the option to extend payments until age 21. States can seek reimbursement for youth over 18 who are in school, vocational training, employment, or participating in programs to promote employment. States and tribes can seek reimbursement for older youth in foster care who are unable to work or attend school due to a medical condition supported by their case plan. The law allows reimbursement for eligible youth living in licensed foster homes or child care institutions. A child care institution is a facility licensed by the state for up to 25 children, excluding detention facilities or forestry camps. States can seek reimbursement for youth aged 18 or older in foster care living independently. HHS encourages extending foster care assistance until age 21, with rationale required if extending to a lower age. Funding under Title IV-E is contingent on an approved plan. States and tribes must establish criteria for determining if youth meet education or employment conditions to receive Title IV-E funding. They must also verify that youth continue to meet these conditions while in care. Examples of eligible activities include finishing high school, pursuing a GED, enrolling in college or vocational school, attending Job Corps programs, and working part-time or full-time. HHS advises that students are considered enrolled even during breaks. In addition to meeting education or employment conditions for Title IV-E funding, states and tribes may establish requirements for extended foster care, such as enrollment in post-secondary education. The program instructions address eligibility criteria for young people in foster care, including those who continue in care after reaching the state age of majority. The AFDC Program Criteria outline eligibility requirements for youth in foster care, including those who enter or reenter care at age 18 or older. Eligibility is based on the youth's circumstances without considering their parents or legal guardians. Youth in extended care must have entered care through a court order or voluntary placement agreement. Removal criteria for youth over 18 are also specified in the program instructions. The instructions address removal criteria for youth over 18, allowing for court determinations or voluntary placement agreements. State and tribal agencies can meet placement and care rules for older youth through written authorization or court orders. Placement setting for youth in extended care is permitted under P.L. 110-351. The instructions under P.L. 110-351 allow for youth in extended care to be placed in supervised independent living settings or licensed foster family homes. States and tribes have the discretion to develop various supervised independent living settings, such as host homes, college dormitories, shared housing, and supervised apartments, for reimbursement. The instructions provide examples of eligible settings for reimbursement, such as host homes, college dormitories, shared housing, and supervised apartments. Youth in supervised independent living settings should have opportunities to form connections with caring adults. Title IV-E foster care maintenance payments can be paid directly to young people in independent living settings. States and tribes must apply case planning and review requirements to youth in extended care in a developmentally appropriate manner. Case plans for youth age 18 and older should address their needs and be developed jointly with the youth. The program guidance outlines case plan and review requirements for youth age 18 and older in extended care, emphasizing the need for independence and safety in placement. States and tribes are instructed to make efforts to finalize a permanency plan every 12 months, with a focus on preparing older youth for emancipation or independence. The court can determine reasonable efforts for permanency planning without a hearing, as long as authorized judiciary members are involved. The program guidance advises that states and tribes can extend care to youth ineligible for federal foster care without fulfilling IV-E requirements. Nearly half of jurisdictions have amended their plans to extend the maximum age of foster care, with 18 states approved by HHS as of May 2014. As of May 2014, nearly half of jurisdictions have extended the maximum age of foster care, with 18 states approved by HHS. Most states allow care until age 21, with exceptions for medical reasons. Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia have specific conditions for youth to remain in care. Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia have specific conditions for youth to remain in care, with exemptions for medical reasons. Other states considering extending care need to consider various factors such as outcomes, costs, court oversight, reentry into care, and placement options. Research on youth aging out of care is limited. The Midwest Evaluation study examined outcomes for former foster youth in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin, comparing those who remained in care past age 18 with those who emancipated. Remaining in care was associated with higher earnings and delayed pregnancy, with each additional year in care after age 18 showing positive outcomes. The Midwest Evaluation study in Illinois found that remaining in care past age 18 was linked to higher earnings and delayed pregnancy. Each additional year in care after age 18 was associated with a $470 increase in average annual earnings. Youth in care were also 38% less likely to become pregnant between ages 17 and 19. Additionally, they were more likely to receive transitional living services between ages 19 and 21. The study in Illinois found that youth who remained in care past age 18 had higher earnings and delayed pregnancy. By age 23, these young people were more likely to have completed one year of college but were not more likely to have earned a two- or four-year degree. Challenges exist in extending care due to budget constraints. States face challenges in extending care to youth aging out of foster care due to budget constraints. The Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative suggests convening a planning group of stakeholders, reviewing federal requirements, considering existing supports, and reaching agreement on key design issues when deciding whether to extend care. The advantages of youth remaining in foster care after age 18 are significant, as shown by studies on extending care. These studies suggest that providing care beyond age 18 can offset costs to society, such as state prison admissions and welfare payments. Researchers have evaluated the costs and benefits of extending foster care based on experiences in Illinois. Researchers in Illinois calculated the cost of extending foster care beyond age 18 to be around $20,800 annually, with potential benefits including increased earnings from attending college. The analysis found an average return of $2 for every $1 spent on youth in care, resulting in approximately $72,000 additionally earned over their lifetime. The study did not consider additional costs to state child welfare agencies or courts. The analysis found that extending foster care beyond age 18 could result in an average of approximately $72,000 additionally earned over the youth's lifetime. It did not consider the potential costs to state child welfare agencies or courts, such as additional personnel and time devoted to these cases. Eligibility for federal foster care maintenance payments varies by state, and state foster care expenditures may only be partially reimbursed by the federal government for Title IV-E eligible children and youth. State foster care expenditures may only be partially reimbursed by the federal government for Title IV-E eligible children and youth. The reimbursement rates vary based on different factors such as income/assets tests, family structure, and placement in licensed settings. The reimbursement rate for federal foster care maintenance payments is tied to the state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), ranging from 50% to 73%. The federal government does not require states to make foster care maintenance payments for children ineligible for federal foster care. The federal government does not explicitly require states to make foster care maintenance payments for children ineligible for federal foster care. States may choose to cover only youth who are IV-E eligible, with different levels of reimbursement and services for eligible and ineligible youth. Eligible youth can remain in care after age 18 if they meet certain criteria. States may choose to cover only IV-E eligible youth with different levels of services and supports. Eligible youth can stay in care after age 18 by meeting certain criteria, such as attending school or working. Some states restrict eligibility based on specific activities, which could raise equity concerns. Making extended care available only to those in post-secondary education may reinforce unequal opportunities for youth in care. Federal child welfare law gives state courts a crucial role in overseeing the safety and appropriateness of a child's placement, regardless of IV-E eligibility or the circumstances of entry into care. Regular case reviews are required to assess progress and establish a permanency plan within 12 months of entering foster care. The court plays a vital role in overseeing a child's placement in foster care, ensuring progress is made towards addressing the reasons for entering care. A permanency plan must be established within 12 months of placement, with regular reviews every 12 months. HHS guidelines extend case review protections to all children under 18, regardless of IV-E eligibility, and to IV-E eligible children aged 18 and older. Children who are ineligible for IV-E may not be subject to court oversight, aligning with Departmental policy allowing states to exclude them from case review if they have reached the state's age of majority and are not receiving IV-E payments. Permanency hearings are not required for non-IV-E eligible youth under voluntary placement agreements, but a case review must be conducted every six months. States extending care beyond age 18 may provide different levels of services based on IV-E eligibility, potentially leading to less oversight and supervision for non-IV-E eligible youth. This lack of information on IV-E ineligible youth may hinder policymakers from assessing their needs effectively. The American Bar Association (ABA) recommends that states enact legislation to ensure juvenile court involvement can continue beyond age 18 for older youth in care. They also suggest modifying hearings so that older youth are present and involved in their proceedings. This aims to hold child welfare agencies and others accountable for meeting the needs of all young adults in extended care, including those who are IV-E ineligible. The ABA encourages courts to involve older youth in care in their hearings and urges states to reconceptualize their models for youth in foster care at age 18 and older. Stakeholders emphasize the need for different supports for older youth transitioning out of foster care. The Jim Casey Foundation highlights the challenges faced by foster youth as they age out of the system. Young people aging out of foster care face challenges as they transition to adulthood. Extended care should be developmentally appropriate, taking into account trauma and loss, and involving youth in decision-making. Research on adolescent brain development supports the need for strong social supports during this transition period. Extended care for young people transitioning to adulthood emphasizes the importance of social supports, opportunities for growth, and building permanent connections. This approach involves graduated levels of supervision, redesigning case planning, and empowering youth to take on responsibilities and develop healthy relationships. The focus is on supporting young people in building their social networks and increasing autonomy. The case planning team works closely with young people to increase autonomy and build social networks. Research by the Chapin Hall Center for Children in Illinois identified factors influencing youth remaining in care beyond age 18. In Cook County, over 81% of youth stay in care past 18, compared to 54% in other regions. Chapin Hall evaluated data and conducted surveys to determine why some youth leave care before age 21. Factors influencing youth remaining in care beyond age 18 were identified through research by Chapin Hall. Some key factors include active involvement of juvenile courts, lack of uniform understanding of laws and policies, availability of appropriate foster care placements, stable relationships with adults, and youth attitudes towards staying in care past the age of majority. Youth who have stable and supportive relationships with adults tend to remain in care longer. Youth attitudes about staying in care beyond age 18 can be a challenge, leading them to request to leave or become uncooperative. States can extend foster care assistance to allow youth to return to care if needed. The HHS allows states and tribes to extend foster care assistance for youth to stay in care continuously or leave and return after turning 18. A 2014 report by the GAO found that 19 states have policies for youth to re-enter care. Some states allow youth to stay in care under voluntary placement agreements. HHS is directed to clarify independent living settings for youth in care after age 18. HHS is directed to clarify independent living settings for youth in care after age 18, but has not issued regulations at this time. Advocates emphasize the importance of youth learning adult skills while still receiving state support. States with foster youth in independent living settings must consider oversight protocols and whether to purchase units or contract with organizations. States with foster youth in independent living settings must consider various issues such as purchasing units, screening residents, rent responsibilities, visitation frequency, consequences for rule violations, and support for transitioning back home. In a 2014 GAO survey of 19 states with extended care, most provided supervised independent living settings for youth. States faced challenges in finding suitable housing options. Minnesota allows youth to live in various settings like apartments, homes, and dorms. The state is working on assisting youth pursuing postsecondary education out of state. Independent living settings do not require licensing, and counties have discretion on background checks for roommates and safety concerns. The state does not require independent living settings to be licensed, and each county has discretion on handling background checks for roommates and safety concerns. Provisions of the law focus on connecting youth to caring adults through adoption or placement with relatives. Monthly federal assistance is generally not available for children who have left foster care for a permanent family via adoption or kinship guardianship after turning 18. However, states and tribes can provide subsidies for eligible children who leave foster care after 16 but before 21 if they are enrolled in school, employed, or in a program to promote employment. Older youth with medical conditions preventing participation may also be covered. States and tribes may provide assistance to older youth with medical conditions preventing participation in employment activities. Assistance can be extended up to the age of 21 for children with mental or physical handicaps. Kinship guardianship requires the child to have resided with the prospective relative guardian for at least six months. HHS program instructions advise states to offer adoption and kinship guardianship subsidies to youth aged 18 and older if foster care is extended beyond age 18. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) provides support services for youth expected to emancipate from foster care. States and tribes can offer adoption and kinship guardianship subsidies to youth aged 18 and older, with the term \"relative\" broadly defined. Conditions for guardianship may include a minimum time in care and targeting specific age groups. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) aims to support youth aging out of foster care by providing services to help them transition to self-sufficiency, obtain employment, and access education and training. It also offers personal and emotional support through mentors and adults, as well as assistance in achieving self-sufficiency through various supports. States and tribes can provide independent living services to youth leaving foster care after age 16 for adoption or kinship guardianship. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act added a new purpose area to the program. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act added a purpose area to the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) to ensure children likely to remain in foster care until 18 have opportunities for age-appropriate activities. The CFCIP provides funding for independent living programs for youth aging out of foster care, offering services like housing, career exploration, education, health activities, counseling, mentoring, and financial management training. States must provide a 20% match for the capped entitlement program with an annual ceiling of $140 million. States have developed independent living programs under the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program (CFCIP) to provide services like housing, career exploration, education, health activities, counseling, mentoring, and financial management training for youth aging out of foster care. To be eligible for CFCIP funds, states and tribes must describe their program in their five-year Child and Family Services Plan, ensuring statewide coverage and serving children of various ages. Additionally, the Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) provides support for children who have emancipated from care or were adopted from care at age 16 or older. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program (ETV) provides vouchers worth up to $5,000 annually for eligible youth who have emancipated from care or were adopted from care at age 16 or older. The program is funded by Congress with approximately $45 million allocated each year. Vouchers cover the cost of full-time or part-time attendance at an institution of higher education, including tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board. Students must be in good academic standing and making progress towards completing their program. The Chafee Education and Training Voucher Program provides vouchers up to $5,000 annually for eligible youth who have emancipated from care or were adopted from care at age 16 or older. Youth must be in good academic standing and making progress towards completing their program. States may provide independent living services to youth who have left foster care under a permanent arrangement before age 18. Independent living services may be available to these youth until age 21, focusing on connecting them to school, work, and resources. States have discretion in defining which youth are likely to remain in foster care until age 18 and may need to determine if additional youth can be served in the program. States must prioritize which youth to serve in independent living programs, ensuring capacity to serve additional youth. They must fulfill the purpose of addressing age-appropriate activities. Caseworkers must assist youth in developing transition plans, including housing, education, and employment options. Plans must be implemented 90 days before the youth's 18th birthday. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care includes elements such as designating a healthcare decision-maker and providing options for executing legal documents. This plan is separate from the case plan but complements it, focusing on the youth's future after leaving care. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care includes options for services and supports to help them live independently. It is separate from the case plan and requires input from the youth and stakeholders to identify specific options for housing and other needs. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care includes specifying housing options and is directed by the youth in consultation with others. It is not reviewed by a court and should be initiated well in advance of the 90-day period before the youth turns 18. Additional guidance on the transition plan is provided in July 2010 program instructions issued by HHS. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care should be planned well in advance of the 90-day period before the youth turns 18. Questions arise for youth who emancipate at age 17, as they may leave care less prepared than their peers. States and tribes may not develop transition plans for youth who remain in care beyond age 18 but leave before reaching age 19, 20, or 21. Social work professionals are developing guidance on how to carry out a transition plan that engages youth and stakeholders in the process. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care should engage youth and stakeholders in a process focused on achieving permanency with caring adults. States have adopted policies to involve youth in the planning process and provide essential supports for their transition. Transition planning for youth aging out of foster care involves engaging youth in the process to ensure they have key documents and support. While many jurisdictions have requirements for transition planning, challenges include staff training, engaging supportive adults, and finding appropriate housing. Some states have developed detailed processes, such as Hawaii's \"transition planning circles,\" to assist youth in the transition to adulthood. In Nebraska and Hawaii, transition planning processes involve engaging youth and their support systems. Hawaii uses \"transition planning circles\" to celebrate the young person becoming an adult and assist in future planning. Foster Club in Nebraska provides a transition planning kit with specific roles and checklists for older youth in foster care. The kit includes a \"permanency pact\" to identify individuals who can assist during the transition. The transition planning process for older foster youth involves creating a \"permanency pact\" to identify individuals who can provide support during the transition to adulthood. Despite policy changes, concerns remain about the challenges faced by older foster youth as they age out, including difficulties in forming permanent connections, securing health insurance and housing, and staying connected to work and school. Research shows a lack of knowledge about the outcomes of youth transitioning from foster care, but a new national database may provide insight into their education, employment, and interactions with social services and the criminal justice system. The effectiveness of services for older foster youth is being evaluated through a new national database, focusing on outcomes in education, employment, and interactions with social services and the criminal justice system. Congress is also addressing protections for vulnerable children in foster care, particularly regarding sex trafficking. Research shows that youth aging out of foster care struggle to form permanent relationships and often remain connected to their biological families. At age 26, former foster youth are more likely to be married but may also be estranged from their families. The Midwest Evaluation on the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth shows that at age 26, these youth were more likely to be married and less likely to live with their parents. Many alumni reported not having strong relationships with their biological family members. Despite federal protections, advocates push for policies to improve the transition to adulthood for foster youth by promoting connections to caring adults for better outcomes. Advocates for youth in care push for policies to improve their transition to adulthood by promoting strong, long-term connections to caring adults. These connections can provide emotional, financial, and other support, leading to more successful outcomes. Child welfare agencies play a role in ensuring permanent adult connections for youth aging out, which can include safe, stable, and secure relationships with committed adults. Practitioners suggest ways to help youth achieve permanency, such as reconsidering case goals, identifying permanent connections, pursuing adoptive relationships, and developing relationships with caring adults like teachers or mentors. Advocates emphasize the importance of establishing lasting connections for youth in care as they transition to adulthood. Child welfare agencies are urged to prioritize permanency planning before youth age out of the system. It is crucial to assist youth in forming healthy relationships with adults, including adoptive relationships and connections with teachers or mentors. Research shows that youth who age out tend to maintain contact with their biological family, highlighting the need for policies that support ongoing connections with caring adults. Advocates stress the importance of permanency planning for youth in care before they age out. Permanency goals include returning home, adoption, guardianship, or placement with a relative. Another planned permanent living arrangement (APPLA) is an option if none of these goals are feasible, with states required to provide a compelling reason for this choice. APPLA was introduced in the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 to address concerns about the instability of long-term foster care. Advocates emphasize the need for permanency planning for youth in care, with options including returning home, adoption, guardianship, or placement with a relative. Another option, known as Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA), was introduced in the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 to provide a stable and permanent arrangement for children in care. Concerns have been raised that APPLA is sometimes used as a default permanency goal, replacing long-term foster care, and caution against pursuing certain settings like group care unless necessary. The Senate Caucus on Foster Youth issued a white paper in December 2010, suggesting policy changes to improve outcomes for children in foster care. One recommendation was to eliminate or restrict APPLA as a case plan goal, with the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act incorporating some of these suggestions. The law now prohibits children under 16 from having a permanency plan of APPLA. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) prohibits children under 16 from having a permanency plan of APPLA. The law requires additional requirements for children with an APPLA designation to ensure the state continues to search for a permanent family, the court reviews the appropriateness of APPLA as a plan, and the child is consulted about their desired outcome. The court revisits whether APPLA is a suitable permanency plan for the child, ensuring the child's input and participation in age-appropriate activities. Transition plans aim to establish permanent connections in adulthood, including mentoring opportunities. Proposed changes to federal child welfare law could help youth achieve permanency by documenting steps taken to secure a permanent living arrangement after emancipation or foster care. This includes finding a family or adult connection for the youth and documenting their permanent living arrangement. The transition planning process after foster care includes efforts to establish adult connections and permanent living arrangements for youth. Some states require intensive efforts to ensure young people have adult connections if not already established. In Texas, youth receive assistance in identifying caring adults for support. Foster Club's Permanency Pact helps youth aging out connect with supportive adults. Foster Club's Permanency Pact aims to provide consistent support for youth aging out of care by connecting them with caring adults. Efforts to support permanency include Adoption Opportunity Grants to demonstrate effective strategies for adoption and securing permanent connections for older youth. Additional federal changes may be needed to achieve permanency for current and former foster youth. The grants funded 10 projects throughout the country to secure permanent connections for youth through adoption, open adoption, guardianship, and kinship care. Federal changes, such as funding for mentoring, could help achieve permanency for foster youth. Legislation in Congress aims to authorize grants for mentoring programs for foster children. State and local child welfare agencies are responsible for promoting the safety, well-being, and permanency of all children, including child victims of sex trafficking who may come to their attention. Child victims of sex trafficking may be reported to child welfare agencies through CPS hotlines. Foster care children, often placed due to abuse or neglect, are vulnerable to trafficking, especially if they run away. State and local agencies may struggle to respond adequately due to limited resources and training. Collaboration and information sharing across sectors are recommended to improve responses to child sex trafficking. The National Academy of Sciences recommends improving collaboration across various sectors to combat child sex trafficking. Hearings in the 113th Congress led to the passage of the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, amending the Title IV-E foster care program to address child victims of sex trafficking. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (P.L. 113-183) amends the Title IV-E foster care program to require state child welfare agencies to develop procedures to identify and provide services for children at risk of sex trafficking. Agencies must collaborate with various organizations and provide training for caseworkers. The law mandates the development of these procedures within one year and implementation within two years of enactment. State agencies must report child trafficking victims to law enforcement within 24 hours and provide annual reports within three years of the law's enactment. State child welfare agencies must report child trafficking victims to law enforcement within 24 hours and provide annual reports to HHS. HHS is required to report to Congress and the public the total number of child trafficking victims. HHS must also establish the National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking within 180 days of the bill's enactment. The law mandates the establishment of the National Advisory Committee on Domestic Sex Trafficking within 180 days of enactment. The committee advises on policies for combating domestic sex trafficking of minors from the child welfare system and developing best practices for states. Congress should monitor state implementation of these requirements, including HHS guidance, serving youth not in foster care, reporting victims, and identifying best practices. State child welfare agencies are required to serve children and youth victims of trafficking, with pending legislation aiming to improve identification and assessment of sex trafficking victims. Congress may consider expanding agency responsibilities to screen in potential victims not already in the child welfare system. Children in foster care due to abuse and neglect are at risk of going missing. Federal law and policy address these issues. Children in foster care are at risk of going missing, with limited federal guidance on serving them. Stakeholders seek a more uniform response to missing children. States have policies in place, but implementation varies. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act directs state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating and responding to children missing from foster care, including identifying factors contributing to their disappearance and reporting any related information. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act requires state child welfare agencies to develop protocols for locating and responding to children missing from foster care, including identifying factors contributing to their disappearance and reporting any related information as required by HHS. State agencies must report information on missing children to the National Center on Missing and Exploited Children and law enforcement authorities for inclusion in the FBI's NCIC database. Child welfare agencies may need to address larger issues that contribute to children going missing, as recommended by the CWLA in 2005. The Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) issued guidelines in 2005 for state child welfare agencies to have procedures in place to prevent children from going missing. This includes recruiting and training a competent workforce, involving various parties in decision-making, examining foster care facilities with high runaway rates, and taking corrective action if needed. States also need to define \"missing\" and decide whether all missing children should be reported to law enforcement. States need to define \"missing\" to include children whose whereabouts are known but are not at their foster care placements. Questions arise about reporting missing children to law enforcement, considering their competing demands and limited resources. Even children with known whereabouts may still be at risk. Coordination between child welfare agencies and law enforcement is crucial. The coordination between child welfare agencies and law enforcement is crucial in preventing children from going missing. Federal child welfare policy provides general requirements for collaboration, but more specific guidelines from CWLA and NCMEC are encouraged. Little is known about children missing from foster care, and state agencies must report on runaways who have not returned. Child welfare agencies report to HHS via AFCARS on children who run away from foster care placements. AFCARS does not track children missing for other reasons. States may need to improve tracking to locate missing children. Concerns have been raised about limiting foster youth's normal activities for safety reasons. Witnesses at a House Ways and Means Subcommittee hearing testified about the restrictions foster youth face in participating in normal activities due to safety policies. These restrictions include limitations on sleepovers, dating, phone use, obtaining a driver's license, driving, working, school trips, and sports. Youth may only participate in these activities after background screenings of adults. Witnesses highlighted that teenagers naturally seek independence and take risks, which can lead to injury due to changes in brain development during adolescence. Prior to the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, federal child welfare provisions did not specifically address promoting normalcy for youth in foster care. The law established a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard for foster parents to make decisions allowing children in care to participate in age-appropriate activities. HHS must assist states in implementing best practices for foster parents. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act established a \"reasonable and prudent parenting\" standard for foster parents to allow youth in care to participate in appropriate activities. Child welfare agencies must provide training on children's developmental stages and applying the standard. States are required to revise licensing standards for foster homes to reflect provisions on normalcy. Concerns for youth aging out of foster care include lack of affordable housing, with studies showing varying rates of homelessness among former foster youth. Studies have shown that former foster youth face challenges with housing, with varying rates of homelessness ranging from 11% to 36%. Factors such as lack of financial support, ties to family, early parenthood, and involvement with the juvenile justice system contribute to their housing instability. Youth who lack housing may struggle to stay in school and maintain employment. Former foster youth face challenges with housing due to factors like lack of financial support, ties to family, early parenthood, and involvement with the juvenile justice system. The CFCIP allows states to allocate funds for room and board, but this may not cover housing costs adequately. Nonprofit organizations offer housing programs for former foster youth, including single-site, scattered-site, and host homes, focusing on independent living support. Some housing programs for former foster youth include single-site, scattered-site, and host homes, providing independent living support. Evaluation of these programs is lacking, and challenges exist in finding appropriate housing options, especially for youth in college during breaks. Some states require public universities to provide housing for emancipated foster youth during school breaks. The Higher Education Act authorizes housing services for youth in foster care or recently emancipated youth, including temporary housing during academic breaks. Additionally, the Act allows funds to establish projects providing support services for students who were in foster care before age 13. The Higher Education Act allows funds for projects providing support services for students who were in foster care before age 13, including housing during academic breaks. Additionally, owners of properties financed with Low-Income Housing Tax Credits can claim units occupied by low-income students who were in foster care as low-income units. The U.S. Government Accountability Office defines disconnected youth as individuals aged 14 to 24 who are not in school or working, lacking support networks. Youth in care are at higher risk of disconnection. Those who aged out of care have low employment rates and earnings, with three out of five working at age 24, earning less than their counterparts. At age 24, three out of five youth who aged out of care were working, earning less than their counterparts nationally. They also faced challenges in education, with only 7% attaining a degree by age 26, compared to one-third of the general youth population. Foster care alumni may need additional support to complete their education. Only 7% of youth who aged out of foster care attained a degree by age 26, compared to one-third of the general youth population. Additional support, including academic, social/emotional, and logistical assistance, may be necessary for foster care alumni to complete their education. Federal and state child welfare laws address the educational needs of youth in or formerly in foster care, ensuring considerations for school proximity, educational records in case plans, and continuity in school enrollment. The law requires state child welfare agencies to ensure that children in foster care remain in the same school or are immediately enrolled in a new school if it is in their best interest. States can claim federal funding for transporting children to their \"school of origin.\" Additionally, states must ensure that children receiving foster care maintenance payments are enrolled in school or have completed high school, and educational records must be provided to foster care parents at each placement. Federal agencies are collaborating to address the educational needs of vulnerable youth populations, including foster youth. A summit in November 2011 brought together state teams to promote educational stability and improve outcomes for children in foster care. Despite collaboration, federal education law does not address these needs, but recent legislation aims to improve access to education for children in foster care. Recent legislation aims to improve access to education for children and youth in foster care through amendments to federal education law. For example, S. 1094 would require state education agencies to ensure that children in foster care remain in the same school or enroll in a new school if it is in their best interest. The bill also mandates policies for transferring school credits and receiving partial credit for children changing schools. Additionally, the Higher Education Act provides supportive educational services for current and former foster youth. Federal education law addresses the postsecondary educational needs of current and former foster youth through provisions in the Higher Education Act. The law includes Trio programs that offer supportive services like mentoring and tutoring for foster youth and homeless children. The programs aim to identify potential post-secondary students from disadvantaged backgrounds, prepare them for higher education, provide support services while in college, and train individuals who provide these services. Additionally, the FY2014 appropriations law directs the Department of Education to modify the FAFSA form to include a box for applicants to identify if they are or were in foster care. The FY2014 appropriations law directs the Department of Education to modify the FAFSA form to include a box for applicants to identify if they are or were in foster care. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides funding for independent living services for youth in care or who have aged out, but little is known about the effectiveness of these services. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides funding for independent living services for youth in care or who have aged out. A national database, the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD), will offer insight into the lives of youth leaving care, but full implementation may take years. States receive $140 million annually for the program, with a 20% match requirement. Many states go beyond this match to provide additional services for eligible youth. States often spend additional funds to provide independent living services beyond the required 20% match for the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program. Federal funding alone may not be sufficient for states to fully support their independent living programs. Research on effective independent living services is limited, but evaluations of innovative programs funded by the CFCIP have been conducted to assess outcomes such as educational attainment, employment rates, interpersonal skills, and pregnancy prevention. The evaluation assessed the effects of independent living programs funded by P.L. 106-169 on achieving key outcomes for foster youth. 1,400 youth were randomly assigned to programs in California and Massachusetts, with surveys conducted at three points over two years. In-person interviews and focus groups were also held with program participants and stakeholders. The evaluation of independent living programs in California and Massachusetts involved in-person interviews, focus groups, and data analysis. While the programs in Los Angeles and Kern County showed no significant impacts, the Massachusetts Adolescent Outreach Program for Youth in Intensive Foster Care demonstrated positive outcomes in education and life skills for participating youth. The Outreach program aims to support youth in foster care by providing tailored services and emphasizing a youth development approach. Social workers oversee a small caseload and work closely with youth to help them achieve outcomes like obtaining a high school diploma, continuing education, and gaining employment. The program focuses on empowering youth to make positive decisions about their lives and offers assistance with tasks like obtaining driver's licenses and applying for college. The evaluation assesses educational, employment, and other outcomes to measure the successful transition to adulthood for participating youth. The evaluation of the Outreach program for youth in foster care showed that participants were more likely to enroll and persist in college compared to the control group. They also received more help in various areas such as educational assistance, employment assistance, and financial aid for housing. Remaining in care and college enrollment were found to be closely linked. However, the program did not show significant improvements in employment, economic well-being, housing, delinquency, pregnancy, or preparedness for independent living compared to the control group. The evaluation of the Outreach program for youth in foster care showed that participants had higher college enrollment and persistence rates compared to the control group. However, the program did not result in better outcomes in employment, economic well-being, housing, delinquency, pregnancy, or preparedness for independent living. The effectiveness of independent living programs and classroom-based instruction in aiding youth transition to independent living is questioned. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) aims to track outcomes of foster youth but states have reported limited information to the database. The National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) aims to track outcomes of foster youth, but states have reported limited information to the database. P.L. 106-169 required the development of outcome measures and data collection to assess state performance in operating independent living programs. The final rule establishing the NYTD became effective in 2008. The NYTD was established to track outcomes of foster youth, with states required to collect data on youth receiving independent living services. Information includes their status in foster care, outcomes at ages 17, 19, and 21. States began data collection in FY2011, tracking youth regardless of service receipt. The NYTD tracks outcomes of foster youth at ages 17, 19, and 21, regardless of whether they receive independent living services. States can choose to track a sample of youth to reduce data collection burden. Financial penalties are imposed on states that do not meet data submission requirements."
