    "content": "The 2008 farm bill expanded on renewable energy policies established in the 2002 farm bill, which included an energy title. This title authorized funding for research on agriculture-based renewable energy and promoted the adoption of renewable energy systems. Interest in renewable energy has increased due to rising petroleum prices and biofuels production. Biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel receive federal support through tax incentives, loans, and grants. The 2008 farm bill expanded federal support for biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel, in line with the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. It includes provisions to increase biofuel production from cellulosic feedstocks, reflecting concerns about corn starch-based ethanol's economic and environmental impact. The bill aims to reach a total of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022, with specific targets for biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol. The economic and environmental concerns surrounding corn starch-based ethanol include escalating commodity prices, high energy costs, and competition with petroleum in the marketplace. Ethanol production in 2010 used nearly 40% of U.S. corn production, leading to a decrease in corn stocks and increased prices. The profitability of ethanol depends on petroleum and corn prices, with rising petroleum prices driving up demand for ethanol and corn. The \"food versus fuel\" debate intensified during the 2008 farm bill debate, highlighting potential problems with replacing gasoline consumption with corn-based ethanol. Several federal programs support renewable energy production, including agriculture-based energy production. The federal programs supporting renewable energy production, including agriculture-based energy, have legislative origins outside of the farm bill. For example, the RFS mandates increasing biofuels in the national fuel supply, originating from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Tax credits for biofuel blenders were initially in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and extended in the Tax Relief Act of 2010. The 2008 farm bill expands programs for biofuels production and use, with a distinct energy title covering various energy and agricultural topics. The 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) expands programs for biofuels production and use, with a distinct energy title covering various energy and agricultural topics. It includes provisions for corn starch-based ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, and biodiesel, as well as research, tax, and trade provisions. Key provisions include a new cellulosic ethanol production tax credit and promotion of cellulosic feedstocks production. The 2008 farm bill includes key provisions for biofuels, such as a new cellulosic ethanol production tax credit, promotion of cellulosic feedstocks production, grants and loan guarantees for biofuels research and production, support for rural energy efficiency, and continuation of the import duty on ethanol. The 2008 farm bill energy title provides financial incentives and support for advanced biofuels production, including grants and loan guarantees for new technologies and infrastructure. Programs like BCAP and the Biorefinery Assistance program support the production of cellulosic feedstocks and the construction of advanced biofuels refineries. Increased funding for biofuels research is also included in the bill. The 2008 farm bill energy title provides financial incentives for advanced biofuels production, including grants and loans for commercial-scale refineries. Funding supports research on cellulosic ethanol production from various agricultural feedstocks like prairie grasses, woody crops, and waste biomass materials. The bill also includes programs like BCAP and the Biorefinery Assistance program to support advanced biofuels production. Cellulosic ethanol production utilizes various feedstocks like prairie grasses, waste biomass, and agricultural residues. Despite environmental benefits, commercial-scale production is limited. The EPA has reduced RFS mandates due to slow progress. The 2008 farm bill supports cellulosic ethanol with tax credits and tariffs. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions for tax credits and tariffs on ethanol to promote cellulosic ethanol production. This includes a producer tax credit of $1.01 per gallon for ethanol produced from qualifying cellulosic feedstocks and an ethanol blender tax credit of $0.45 per gallon. The ethanol import tariff of $0.54 per gallon was extended to the end of 2010 to protect U.S. ethanol industry from lower-cost imports. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the ethanol blender tax credit and import tariff until the end of 2011. The tariff exceeds the blender tax credit by nine cents, imposing a punitive duty on imported ethanol. The farm bill includes provisions for reports on the impact of ethanol production on the farm economy, environment, and consumer food prices. The farm bill includes provisions for reports assessing the impact of ethanol production on the farm economy, environment, and consumer food prices. It authorizes over $1 billion in funding for various programs related to biofuels, including the Biorefinery Assistance Program and the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels. The 2008 farm bill increased funding for energy-related programs, with mandatory authorization totaling $993 million and discretionary funding totaling over $1.7 billion. Key programs receiving funding include the Biorefinery Assistance Program, Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, Rural Energy for America Program, Biomass Research and Development Act, and potentially unlimited funding for the Biomass Crop Assistance Program. Funding is provided through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation for mandatory programs, while discretionary programs are funded annually through the appropriations process.
