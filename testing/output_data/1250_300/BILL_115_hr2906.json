    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ensuring Access to General Surgery Act of 2017\". Congress acknowledges the shortage of physicians in the United States, with projections showing a growing gap in the supply of general surgeons by 2030. Comprehensive research and data are needed to address future workforce demands influenced by various factors. The shortage of physicians in the United States, especially in rural and surgical workforce shortage areas, requires comprehensive research to address future workforce needs influenced by various factors such as health outcomes, utilization trends, and population changes. SEC. 3. STUDY ON DESIGNATION OF GENERAL SURGERY SHORTAGE AREAS. Amends the Public Health Service Act to add a section on the designation of General Surgery Shortage Areas. The term 'general surgery shortage area' is defined as an area underserved by general surgeons in urban, suburban, or rural areas. The Secretary will conduct a study on the adequacy of current shortage designations in addressing the needs of underserved populations in accessing general surgeons. The Secretary will analyze methodologies for designating general surgery shortage areas, including the development of surgery service areas based on hospitals with surgery services and populations by zip code areas. The methodology involves developing surgery service areas by identifying hospitals with surgery services and populations by zip code using Medicare patient origin data. It also includes identifying actively practicing general surgeons, establishing surgeon-to-population ratios, and determining threshold ratios for optimal, adequate, shortage, and critical shortage levels of general surgeons. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the study of general surgeon shortages within a year of this subpart's enactment. Stakeholder consultation is required, and data on general surgery availability and shortages will be periodically published in the Federal Register. The Secretary may establish a methodology for designating general surgery shortage areas in the United States within 12 months of submitting a report to Congress on the study of general surgeon shortages. This methodology will consider data on general surgery availability and shortages. The Secretary shall designate general surgery shortage areas in the United States, publish a descriptive list of these areas, and review and revise the designations annually. Similar procedures to those for health professional shortage areas will be followed, including consultation with relevant stakeholders. The Secretary will consult with stakeholders, including medical societies, surgical facilities, general surgery experts, and patient organizations when designating general surgery shortage areas."
