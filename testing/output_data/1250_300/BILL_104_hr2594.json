    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Railroad Unemployment Insurance Amendments Act of 1996\". It includes a waiting period for unemployment benefits. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is amended to specify the payment of unemployment benefits, including a waiting period for the first registration period. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act specifies that if a qualified employee experiences continuing unemployment due to a strike, no benefits will be paid for the first 14 days. Subsequent days of unemployment will be compensated according to the Act. If the unemployment period ends but the strike continues, a waiting period will apply for the employee's new registration period. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act defines a period of continuing unemployment as more than 4 days of unemployment in a registration period. Benefits are not payable for the first 14 days of a strike-related unemployment, and a waiting period applies for a new registration period if the strike continues. No benefits are payable to an eligible employee if their total remuneration in a registration period exceeds the base year monthly compensation base. This includes any remuneration that would have been payable if the employee was ready and willing to work. SEC. 3. WAITING PERIOD FOR SICKNESS BENEFITS. Amendment to the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act regarding the payment of sickness benefits after the 4th consecutive day of sickness in a period of continuing sickness. Benefits are payable for each day of sickness in excess of 7 during the employee's first registration period in a period of continuing sickness. The first registration period in a period of continuing sickness starts with 4 consecutive sick days and includes more than 4 sick days. A period of continuing sickness is defined as a series of sick days from one or more causes, or consecutive sick days from a single cause with no more than 90 days interruption. The period of continuing sickness ends when sickness benefits are exhausted. SEC. 4 amends the maximum daily benefit rate calculation under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. SEC. 5 sets the maximum number of days for benefits. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act is amended to set the maximum number of days for benefits at 130 for both unemployment and sickness, with a limitation that benefits cannot exceed the employee's compensation in the base year. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act limits benefits to not exceed the employee's compensation in the base year, with exceptions for certain cases involving extended benefits for employees with 10 or more years of service. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act allows for extended benefits for employees who have exhausted their normal benefit rights, providing up to 65 days of additional unemployment or sickness benefits within an extended benefit period of 7 consecutive 14-day periods. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act allows for extended benefits for employees who have exhausted their normal benefit rights, providing up to 65 days of additional unemployment or sickness benefits within an extended benefit period. This period consists of 7 consecutive 14-day periods, with termination at age 65 for sickness benefits, unless for paying unemployment benefits. Accelerated benefits are available for employees with 10 or more years of service. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act provides extended benefits for employees with 10 or more years of service, allowing for accelerated benefits in cases of unemployment or sickness lasting 14 or more consecutive days. The Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act includes exceptions for sickness benefits, determination of age, and repeals deadwood and expired provisions. The amendments made by this Act will be effective on the date of enactment."
