    "content": "The \"Farmers Tax Deferral Act\" allows for the nontaxable exchange of qualified agricultural property for real property under Section 1046 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. No gain or loss recognized for qualified person receiving US real property in exchange for qualified agricultural property. Qualified person defined as individual age 55+, corporation owned by qualifying individuals, or partnership/trust/estate with ownership by qualifying individuals. Qualified agricultural property includes certain agricultural structures in service for over 20 years. The section defines United States real property as property located in the US and sets a requirement that exchanged property must be identified and completed within 180 days. If property is not identified within 45 days or received after 180 days, it is treated as non-real property. The taxpayer must transfer the relinquished property in the exchange before the earlier of 180 days or the due date for the tax return. Rules similar to section 1031 apply, and the transaction is treated as a section 1031 exchange for tax purposes. Ordinary income recapture is deferred until the disposition of real property acquired in the exchange. The taxpayer must transfer the relinquished property in the exchange before the earlier of 180 days or the due date for the tax return. Rules similar to section 1031 apply, and the transaction is treated as a section 1031 exchange for tax purposes. Ordinary income recapture is deferred until the disposition of real property acquired in the exchange, with special rules for like-kind exchanges of qualified agricultural property. The fair market value of property acquired in an exchange under section 1046 is not taken into account if it is not section 1245 property or United States real property. If the transferee disposes of United States real property acquired in the exchange, ordinary income recapture is triggered based on the excess of the amount realized over the adjusted basis of the property. The excess of fair market value over adjusted basis of real property in a sale or exchange triggers ordinary income recapture. The amendments made by this Act require that any gain recognized on the disposition of qualified agricultural property be treated as ordinary income, regardless of other provisions in the tax code. These amendments apply to transfers and dispositions after the enactment date of the Act. Special rules apply for installment sales of qualified agricultural property. Special rule for qualified agricultural property under subsection (i) of section 453 of the Internal Revenue Code allows income from installment sales to be recognized under the installment method, with recapture income recognized in the same proportion. The amendments made by this section apply to sales after the enactment of this Act, with a conforming amendment to section 453(i) of the Internal Revenue Code."
