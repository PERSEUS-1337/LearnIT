    "content": "The federal government has a strong interest in regulating hazardous chemicals security to prevent terrorist attacks since 9/11. Congress focuses on security of chemicals in rail, tanker trucks, and commercial facilities. Legislation like H.R. 2651 and S. 1052 address penalties for criminal activities around ports and marine vessels. The federal government is reviewing policies related to marine transportation of hazardous chemical cargo, with a focus on security measures. Legislation such as H.R. 2651 and S. 1052 aim to increase penalties for criminal activities around ports and vessels. Congress is seeking a broader understanding of hazardous chemical marine shipments and efforts to secure them. The report provides an overview of hazardous chemicals marine transportation in the United States, discussing risks, federal statistics on shipments, and relevant maritime security regulations. Security policy issues related to these shipments are also raised. The report focuses on marine shipments of acutely hazardous chemical cargoes in U.S. waters, addressing security policy issues and risk uncertainties. It does not cover other maritime security hazards like petroleum products or biological agents. The report emphasizes threats to the general public from chemical releases during marine transport, excluding attacks targeting economic activity or the environment. Due to legal limitations, detailed statistics on specific hazardous chemicals or ports are not provided. Marine shipments of hazardous chemical cargo are potential terrorist targets due to their toxicity and combustibility. Protecting these shipments is crucial for U.S. homeland security, although no terrorist attacks using hazardous chemicals on marine vessels have occurred. Major accidents involving marine shipments of hazardous chemicals have been rare but deadly, with historical examples like the Mont-Blanc explosion in 1917 and the Texas City explosion in 1947. While no terrorist attacks using hazardous chemicals on marine vessels have occurred, intelligence suggests that terrorists may have the interest and capability to execute such attacks in the United States. The 1947 explosion of two cargo ships in Texas City killed nearly 600 people and injured 3,500. Since then, there have been incidents involving chemical marine shipments, but no major disasters like Texas City. Examples include a 1985 fire in Somalia, a 1987 accident in Spain, and a 1999 fire off the coast of Scotland. While terrorists have not used marine vessels for chemical attacks, there is concern for public safety. Terrorists have not used marine vessels for chemical attacks on the general public, but there have been attempts to release chemicals from land-based facilities. In the late 1990s, incidents occurred in foreign war zones and the United States involving explosives and hazardous chemicals. In 2002, Moroccan authorities foiled an Al-Qaeda plot to attack U.S. and British warships. Terrorists have targeted marine vessels, including an oil tanker off the Yemeni coast and concerns about commandeering hazardous chemical vessels. The Department of Homeland Security is concerned about the security of chemical infrastructure, including tanker ships, as part of national preparedness standards. The President's National Strategy highlights the challenge of protecting high consequence cargo in ports. The DHS is concerned about the security risks associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers, which are considered potential terrorist targets. Various attack scenarios on LNG tankers have been identified, including ramming, explosives, hijacking, and missile or airplane attacks. Homeland Security directives focus on preventing terrorist attacks that could result in catastrophic health effects or mass casualties comparable to those from a weapon of mass destruction. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) directs federal homeland security activities to focus on terrorist attacks involving hazardous chemical cargo on commercial marine vessels that could pose catastrophic hazards to the public. Federal standards from the Department of Transportation, Coast Guard, and Environmental Protection Agency regulate the transportation of hazardous materials to prevent unreasonable risks. The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975 empowers the Secretary of Transportation to designate hazardous materials that may pose risks during transportation. The DOT classifies hazardous materials in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.101, including toxic, radioactive, corrosive, explosive, and flammable materials. Shippers of highly hazardous cargo must develop security plans, which include radioactive materials and over 55 pounds of explosives. The DOT requires shippers of highly hazardous cargo to develop security plans for materials such as radioactive material, explosives, poisonous inhalation materials, bulk hazardous liquids or gases, bulk hazardous solids, and packaged hazardous materials. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels, defining certain dangerous cargoes in 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 160.204. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels, identifying hazardous cargo in various sections of the federal code. Hazardous materials include bulk solid, liquid, liquefied gas, and compressed gas cargoes, as well as incompatible chemicals carried on ships. Regulations also cover waterfront facilities handling hazardous marine cargoes. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels, identifying hazardous cargo in various sections of the federal code. Hazardous materials include bulk solid, liquid, liquefied gas, and compressed gas cargoes, as well as incompatible chemicals carried on ships. Regulations also cover waterfront facilities handling hazardous marine cargoes. Additionally, EPA regulates stationary facilities handling potentially hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act, requiring risk management plans for facilities possessing specified threshold quantities of certain hazardous substances. The Clean Air Act Amendments defined \"hazardous substances\" to include listed substances and additional chemicals designated by the EPA based on risk criteria. The EPA promulgated a list of acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, and volatile liquids. High explosives were removed from the list in 1998, and flammable substances used as fuel were excluded in 2000. The current EPA/RMP list is in Appendix 2. The majority of hazardous materials on DOT lists do not pose a catastrophic health hazard to the public due to quantity or physical properties. The EPA/RMP list in Appendix 2 identifies chemicals with the greatest potential consequences to the public. These hazardous substances are also found in DOT and Coast Guard lists, making the findings in this report applicable to them as well. EPA/RMP chemicals are used as the basis for marine cargo hazard analysis. The report identifies hazardous materials found in the EPA/RMP, DOT, and Coast Guard lists, with notable classes like radioactive materials and explosives. Excluding these classes would not impact policy conclusions. EPA/RMP chemicals are broadly classified as acutely toxic or flammable, with variations in toxicity and flammability among specific chemicals like Ammonia. Ammonia is a toxic gas used in fertilizer production and other industries, causing skin and respiratory irritation. Methane, a heating fuel, can be asphyxiating and flammable. Methyloxirane is used in manufacturing various industrial products. Methyloxirane is a toxic liquid used in manufacturing polyurethane foam, solvents, and other industrial products. It is a fire hazard and can irritate the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. Methyloxirane vapor is highly flammable and reacts explosively with certain substances. The EPA considers all RMP chemicals hazardous and subject to special regulatory treatment. The report assumes all shipments of hazardous chemicals are potential terrorist targets, with different hazards over water compared to land. Some chemicals dissolve or sink in water, reducing public hazard in a marine incident. Others evaporate quickly or create larger hazard zones in a marine release. The characteristics of EPA/RMP chemicals may differ between land and water releases, limiting conclusions drawn from a study of marine hazards. The Army Corps of Engineers maintains statistics on marine commerce in U.S. waters, which can be used to estimate the shipping volumes of EPA/RMP chemicals. In 2003, over 48 million tons of these hazardous chemicals passed through U.S. waters, accounting for 2% of total waterborne cargo tonnage. Further research is needed to understand the relative marine hazards of specific chemicals. In 2003, over 48 million tons of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals passed through U.S. waters, accounting for 2% of total waterborne cargo tonnage. The hazardous materials on the EPA/RMP list are included primarily because of their chemical properties that make them hazardous to human health. The overall volume of a hazardous material in a marine shipment becomes an important consideration when evaluating potential public impacts of a terrorist attack. Additionally, a larger number of shipments could potentially equate to a larger overall terrorist risk. Over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waterways in 2003, with varying cargo tonnage per shipment. The EPA regulations specify minimum threshold quantities for risk planning, with off-site consequence plans required for shipments above 20,000 pounds. The data is plotted on a logarithmic scale for clarity. The average waterborne shipment volume of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals exceeds the 20,000 pound threshold, requiring off-site risk management plans. Hazardous cargoes are shipped hundreds to thousands of times in 2003, with cargo vessel characteristics playing a crucial role in security considerations. Cargo vessel characteristics are crucial for security considerations, determining vulnerability to accidents or attacks. In 2003, 67% of EPA/RMP hazardous marine cargo was shipped in tankers or liquid chemical barges, with liquefied gas tankers designed to carry various liquefied gas cargoes. Liquefied gas tankers are designed to carry various liquefied gas cargoes such as butane, propane, LNG, butadiene, and more. These tankers have onboard tanks that are pressurized, refrigerated, and insulated to meet different cargo needs. They are built to withstand high pressures or low temperatures, making them resistant to impact damage. Additionally, liquefied gas tankers are double-hulled, providing a high level of structural integrity that makes them highly resistant to grounding and collision damage. Liquefied gas tankers have a high level of structural integrity due to their double-hulled design, making them resistant to grounding and collision damage. LNG tankers carry only LNG, while other liquefied gas tankers may carry a combination of different cargoes. LNG tankers have capacities ranging from 25,000 m3 to 147,000 m3, with plans for new construction of ships with a capacity of 200,000 m3. LNG tankers have capacities ranging from 25,000 m3 to 147,000 m3, with plans for new construction of ships with a capacity of 200,000 m3. Chemical parcel tankers, like gas carriers, are versatile vessels designed to carry a wide range of liquid and chemical cargoes, including hazardous chemicals. They can carry 10 to 60 separate cargo tanks and range in total cargo capacity from approximately 3,000 to 50,000 tons. Chemical parcel tankers are versatile vessels designed to carry a wide range of liquid and chemical cargoes, including hazardous chemicals. They may have cargo tanks lined with stainless steel or specialized coatings to ensure compatibility with chemicals. Tankers have double bottoms or hulls to prevent incompatible cargoes from coming into contact with each other. Liquid chemical barges are shallow draft vessels designed to carry bulk liquid chemicals, ranging in size from 700 tons to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity. Larger barges transporting hazardous chemicals are typically double-hulled and self-propelled. Liquid chemical barges range in size from 700 to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity and may be unpowered, relying on tugboats for movement. Inland barges usually travel in groups of two to eight per towboat, with the possibility of larger \"linehaul\" tows. These barges may be refrigerated, with insulated cargo tanks capable of carrying hazardous chemicals like ammonia and propylene. Pressurized cargo tanks are also available for liquid cargoes. Hazardous chemicals can be transported on various types of vessels, including container ships, roll-on/roll-off vessels, and general cargo ships. Large quantities of hazardous chemicals can be present on container ships at any given time. For example, the Jolly Rubino was carrying containers of vinyl acetate and other toxic chemicals when it caught fire in 2002. These chemicals must be shipped in designated cargo areas on the vessels to ensure safety. Additionally, hazardous chemicals may also be transported on container barges, ferries, and other vessels. The public hazards associated with these chemicals are proportional to the amount present in a given setting. Hazardous chemicals can be transported on various vessels, including container ships, general cargo ships, container barges, and ferries. The volume of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo on marine vessels is compared to other transportation modes like rail tank cars and highway tanker trucks. Rail tank cars can carry 50 to 90 tons, while containerized tanks on railcars can carry up to 70 tons. Highway tanker trucks also transport hazardous cargoes like anhydrous ammonia and chlorine. The capacity of cargo tanks for EPA/RMP chemicals varies across marine, rail, and highway transport modes. Marine vessels generally have a much larger capacity compared to rail tank cars and highway tanker trucks. Multiple tanks are common on liquefied gas tankers, chemical parcel tankers, and liquid cargo barges. Comparing actual volumes shipped across these modes is challenging due to partial cargoes and multiple shipments involved. Based on marine shipment volumes and rail/highway tank capacities, marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous materials are often larger than land shipments. The EPA maintains a database of on-site chemical storage volumes for facilities required to file risk management plans. Comparing average and maximum marine shipping volumes to land storage volumes, it is noted that marine shipments can exceed land storage quantities. The subset of chemical facilities with the highest on-site quantities of EPA/RMP chemicals were compared for marine and land storage volumes. Marine shipments of higher volume chemicals were generally larger than land storage volumes, consistent with shipping practices. The comparison included chemicals like acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, ethylene, methyloxirane, oxirane, propene, sulfurdioxide, and vinyl chloride. The largest marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals originate or terminate in U.S. ports, where they may be stored temporarily or used in industrial processes. Port facilities vary in the volume and type of hazardous cargo they handle, leading to significant variations in total marine shipments and specific chemicals across different ports. Security hazards may be influenced by both the volume and type of EPA/RMP cargo being transported. The total marine shipments of EPA/RMP chemicals vary significantly from port to port, with the top 30 ports handling approximately 95% of the hazardous cargo tonnage. In 2003, 113 ports in the United States shipped EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals, with some ports handling more hazardous cargo than others. For example, the port of Baton Rouge shipped 22 EPA/RMP chemicals in quantities exceeding 2,500 tons. In 2003, 22 EPA/RMP chemicals were shipped through the port of Baton Rouge in quantities exceeding 2,500 tons. The top 30 hazardous chemical ports are located in 15 states, with over half in the Gulf of Mexico region. The mix of principal EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals varies considerably from port to port. In 2003, 30 ports classified as coastal by the ACE handled EPA/RMP hazardous cargo, with LPG and ammonia being the most frequently shipped chemicals. The list of ports is based on EPA/RMP estimates and other factors affecting terrorism risk in U.S. ports include DOT hazardous cargo shipments, non-chemical cargo hazards, marine passenger traffic, and proximity to populations on land. The Department of Homeland Security considers various factors in its Port Security Grant Program, providing security enhancement grants to U.S. ports. The Coast Guard is responsible for promoting maritime security and oversees vessel and port security, including tracking and inspecting commercial ships. The Coast Guard is tasked with promoting U.S. maritime security, including tracking, boarding, and inspecting commercial ships. They have a special focus on ships carrying hazardous cargo and have regulations in place to ensure safety and environmental protection. After 9/11, the Coast Guard expanded its maritime security regulations to address terrorism concerns. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has enhanced its maritime security regulations to prevent sabotage or subversive acts. Area maritime security committees assess port vulnerabilities and create plans to address them, focusing on preventing terrorist attacks on vessels and facilities under Coast Guard jurisdiction. These plans also involve other vital port infrastructure like bridges, channels, and tunnels. The Coast Guard deploys resources to prevent terrorist attacks, focusing on vessels and facilities under its jurisdiction. Vulnerability assessments also include other vital port infrastructure like bridges, channels, and tunnels. The agency has developed maritime security standards under the MTSA and led in creating the ISPS Code for safe ship and port operations. The ISPS Code requires security plans for ships and certain port facilities, with designated security officers for different threat levels. The Coast Guard enforces security plans for ships and ports under different threat levels, ensuring implementation and conducting inspections. They have also assessed the security of strategic ports and taken measures to prevent terrorist attacks on hazardous chemical vessels and high consequence shipping. The Coast Guard evaluates vulnerability of marine tankers to various types of attacks and conducts special assessments of inland barges carrying dangerous cargoes. They require vessels to report information before arrival or departure to determine security risks and take necessary actions for secure transit. The Coast Guard may board vessels and post armed sea-marshals to ensure safety. The Coast Guard evaluates security risks posed by vessels entering U.S. waters and takes actions to ensure secure transit. They may board vessels, post armed sea-marshals, and enforce security zones around ships carrying hazardous cargo in harbors. Additionally, vessels may be required to provide roving patrols during mooring, and non-commercial traffic may be banned in high threat areas. The Coast Guard maintains Maritime Safety and Security Teams nationwide for security operations at ports, aiming to improve \"maritime domain awareness.\" Cargo and passenger vessels calling at U.S. ports must comply with ISPS Code and MTSA regulations. The Coast Guard is enhancing maritime domain awareness by outfitting vessels with AIS transponders and installing AIS receivers at port areas. They are developing joint harbor operations centers to monitor vessel traffic using various equipment and coordinating with federal security agencies and local law enforcement for a better response to threats. The Coast Guard is enhancing maritime domain awareness through various measures such as outfitting vessels with AIS transponders and developing joint harbor operations centers. They are also enlisting the help of the recreational boating public to identify and report suspicious activity. Additionally, they are working with other agencies like the Transportation Security Administration to improve security for merchant mariners and landside workers. NOAA maintains hazardous material emergency response capabilities that can be utilized in case of an accident or attack on a hazardous chemical vessel. NOAA maintains hazardous material emergency response capabilities, including the CAMEO program for first responders. They have linked air dispersion models to improve support for emergency planners. NOAA partnered with the Coast Guard and Office of Naval Intelligence for risk assessments on hazardous chemicals. NOAA is also involved in coordinating federal chemicals emergency response through the Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center. NOAA, along with the DHS, coordinates federal chemicals emergency response through the Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center. Industry groups, including the American Waterways Operators, promote security for hazardous marine cargo through the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee. In October 2002, CTAC formed a Subcommittee on Hazardous Cargo Transportation Security to assess vulnerability and promote industry security awareness. The American Waterways Operators, in consultation with the Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers, created a model vessel security plan to prevent terrorist attacks on the inland waterway system. The Chemical Distribution Institute inspects and issues audit reports on chemical and LPG tankers, tank storage terminals, and container ships carrying hazardous cargo. The American Chemistry Council has also issued transportation security guidelines for the chemical industry. Securing hazardous chemicals against terrorist attacks is a priority in U.S. homeland security policy. Securing hazardous chemicals against terrorist attacks is a priority in U.S. homeland security policy, including maritime security of chemical cargo. Policy issues related to hazardous marine cargo may warrant Congressional attention due to risk uncertainty, resource availability, and security effectiveness concerns. Terrorism risk is defined by threat, vulnerability, and consequence, with uncertainties existing in all three factors. Public concern about specific threats to hazardous chemicals shipping is debated, despite general threat information provided by government agencies. The debate over the threat of terrorist attacks on ships in U.S. waters post-9/11 continues, with some experts downplaying public concern about specific threats to hazardous chemical shipping. However, others argue that terrorists have the desire and capability to attack such shipping, citing uncertainties in threat intelligence and the shifting goals of attackers. The Coast Guard has approved security assessments for vessels, while NOAA partners with them to assess hazardous chemical risks at U.S. ports. The Coast Guard has approved security assessments for vessels and established a partnership with NOAA to assess hazardous chemical risks at U.S. ports. However, analysts suggest that the potential vulnerabilities and consequences of a terrorist attack on marine cargo vessels are not well understood, leading to conflicting studies on LNG shipping risks. The security sensitivity of these assessments and plans complicates evaluation efforts, with little public information available on the physical vulnerabilities of vessels to terrorist attacks. Additionally, there is limited research on intentional release of hazardous chemicals in the marine environment. The Coast Guard has approved security assessments for vessels and established a partnership with NOAA to assess hazardous chemical risks at U.S. ports. However, there is limited research on intentional release of hazardous chemicals in the marine environment, and little public information available on the physical vulnerabilities of vessels to terrorist attacks. Vessel vulnerability assessments and security plans are central to U.S. maritime security strategy, but their value and effectiveness for hazardous chemicals carriers may be limited if operators lack a full understanding of vulnerability and consequence, especially for attacks affecting the general public. Federal officials may struggle to determine the precise risk of terror attacks on hazardous marine cargoes, but reducing risk uncertainty could help prioritize maritime security activities. Security experts can reduce risk uncertainty through research and analysis of vessel vulnerabilities and chemical attack consequences. Standard models and methodologies, such as those maintained by NOAA and EPA, are beneficial for analyzing hazardous marine cargo security. The federal government plays an important role in ensuring methodological consistency across chemicals, vessel types, and locations. Concerns about the costs associated with securing marine shipments of hazardous cargo and potential diversion of Coast Guard resources have been raised by policymakers. Coast Guard officials note that maritime security expenditures are part of their general mission, but resources dedicated to securing hazardous cargo shipments could be used elsewhere. Maritime security expenditures are a significant part of the Coast Guard's mission to protect the nation's waters and coasts. Resources dedicated to securing marine shipments of hazardous cargo could be used for other missions like boating safety, search and rescue, and drug interdiction. A Government Accountability Office study reported a significant increase in security activities following 9/11. President Bush requested $8.1 billion for the Coast Guard in FY2006, with $2.2 billion allocated for port, waterway, and coastal security. Additional funding of $11 million was sought for general maritime security to enhance operational presence and response capabilities. The Coast Guard's FY2006 budget includes additional funding for maritime security, such as new response boats and crew, vessel monitoring systems, and increased surveillance. State and local agencies are seeking more funding to offset the costs of securing hazardous marine cargo, particularly LNG tankers. Federal officials recommend that new LNG terminal operators cover the costs of additional maritime security needed for their facilities. Federal officials recommend that new LNG terminal operators cover the costs of additional maritime security needed for their facilities, with some government officials expressing concerns over ambiguous security cost accounting and uncertain federal funding sources. Some LNG companies resist paying more for public security, arguing that their taxes should cover law enforcement and emergency services, while others are willing to pay for \"excess\" security beyond what is typically covered by corporate tax payments. The security costs associated with LNG shipments may not be indicative of the costs to secure other hazardous marine cargo. New security technology and changing threat assessments may help lower security costs in the future. Public agencies may need to review cost-sharing mechanisms for securing hazardous marine cargo from terrorist attacks. The effectiveness of Coast Guard security measures for hazardous chemicals shipping is still an open issue, with questions about resource deployment and evaluation of security activities. The Coast Guard's security measures for hazardous marine cargo lack performance measures to assess progress in enhancing security and addressing terrorism risks. Questions remain about the adequacy of security activities in relation to terrorism risks within ports, particularly concerning hazardous chemical vessels. The Coast Guard's internal maritime security plan identifies high-risk cargos, but uncertainties persist regarding terrorism risks and resource allocation. Some question if Coast Guard security for hazardous chemical vessels appropriately reflects their relative risk, with concerns about varying levels of protection between ports. Congress may assess the effectiveness of the agency's hazardous marine cargo activities in the context of maritime security responsibilities. Emergency response to marine chemical attacks is also a concern among security analysts. The Homeland Security Council's national planning scenario involves chemical cargo ships with potential casualties from an attack. Terrorist attacks on chemical tankers could overwhelm emergency agencies and medical facilities, requiring specialized treatment for poisoning and burns. Salvage of a damaged vessel in a chemical attack poses additional challenges for U.S. marine salvage companies. Developing specific measures for emergency and medical authorities near potentially affected waterways is prudent due to the terrorism risk associated with hazardous cargo. The curr_chunk discusses the need for emergency response plans for marine shipments of hazardous chemicals in the U.S. It mentions potential sources of funding for developing these plans, such as the DOT's Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness Fund and the DHS's Homeland Security Grant Program. The report highlights the importance of having specific measures in place for dealing with chemical cargo releases in different regions. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Sec. 311d) provides a legislative model for planning emergency response for marine shipments of hazardous chemicals. These shipments are comparable in volume to chemicals stored at large plants and pass through populated areas and major U.S. ports. The Coast Guard has authority over maritime security, but there are concerns about terrorism risks and efforts to improve security by both government and industry. The Coast Guard is evolving its security activities to fulfill legislative mandates regarding marine chemicals security. Congress may question terrorism risks and evaluate the effectiveness of current security measures. Evaluating emergency response capabilities of coastal communities exposed to chemical shipping hazards is also of interest. Congress may assess how hazardous chemicals marine security fits into the nation's overall strategy to protect the public. Bulk quantities of hazardous chemicals are found in various transportation modes and facilities. The nation's chemicals security resources are spread across marine vessels, rail and highway tankers, and chemical facilities on land. Balancing security resources across these sectors is a policy challenge due to different homeland security authorities and regulations. Limited vulnerability and consequence information, especially for marine transportation, complicates the comparison of terrorism risks. Without a comprehensive perspective on hazardous chemical risks, security analysts may struggle to identify which assets to protect and how to protect them effectively with limited resources. Diverting resources from safety to enhance security may reduce terror risk but increase overall risk if safety programs become less effective. The Army Corps of Engineers collects detailed marine commerce statistics through its Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center for planning and managing projects. Separate databases track domestic and foreign vessel trips and tonnages, including dry cargo ships, tankers, barges, and fishing vessels. The ACE waterborne commerce databases collect detailed marine commerce statistics for U.S. ports and waterways, including vessel types and tonnages by commodity. While not originally intended for chemical-specific analysis, the ACE provided estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics for this report, which are considered accurate with limitations. The ACE databases provide estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics, using standardized commodity codes that may not always correspond uniquely to individual hazardous chemicals. CRS has attempted to correct for inconsistencies in classification through comparison of codes and consultation with experts. The ACE databases contain errors in data classification and processing, which may affect summary statistics. CRS used LNG trade data to separate LNG and LPG volumes. Cargo vessels may load or unload partial cargoes at multiple locations during a single shipment, but total tonnage carried aboard a vessel at any time cannot be accurately reported. The ACEwaterborne commerce databases contain millions of records with potential errors in data classification and processing. CRS identified inconsistencies in ACE estimates, which were corrected. The databases contain detailed commercial information, but specific shipping data is considered privileged information not for public release."
