    "content": "The \"Community-Based Independence for Seniors Act\" emphasizes the importance of community-based services in maintaining the health and independence of seniors. Without these services, seniors may face negative health outcomes and loss of independence, leading to reliance on Medicaid for long-term care expenses. Targeting community-based services to at-risk seniors can help prevent asset depletion and Medicaid dependency. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan demonstration program to prevent institutionalization among low-income Medicare beneficiaries. Up to 5 eligible MA plans can enroll 1,000 beneficiaries each in the program, using rebates to provide supplemental benefits. The Community-Based Institutional Special Needs Plan demonstration program requires eligible MA plans to provide supplemental benefits to low-income Medicare beneficiaries, including long-term care services and supports such as homemaker services, home delivered meals, transportation services, respite care, adult day care services, and non-Medicare-covered equipment. Eligible MA plans are specialized plans for special needs individuals. Eligible MA plans for special needs individuals must have experience with nursing home-eligible beneficiaries, low-income beneficiaries, and Medicaid data availability in their service area. Eligible low-income Medicare beneficiaries are defined as individuals who are Medicare Advantage eligible. Eligible low-income Medicare beneficiaries are individuals who are Medicare Advantage eligible, subsidy eligible, not eligible for Medicaid benefits, have difficulty with daily activities, and are aged 65 or older. They have a special election period to switch plans outside of the annual enrollment periods. The CBI-SNP demonstration program allows eligible Medicare beneficiaries to switch to a participating MA plan or enroll in a prescription drug plan. The Secretary will educate beneficiaries on the program, and it will run for 5 years starting January 1, 2018. The CBI-SNP demonstration program for Medicare beneficiaries allows plan switching or enrollment in a prescription drug plan. It will run for 5 years starting January 1, 2018, with budget neutrality ensured by the Secretary. Expansion may occur based on evaluation results. The CBI-SNP demonstration program for Medicare beneficiaries allows plan switching or enrollment in a prescription drug plan. An independent evaluation by a third party will assess the program using predefined criteria to determine its effectiveness. The CBI-SNP demonstration program for Medicare beneficiaries will undergo an evaluation to assess its impact on patient care, hospitalizations, Medicaid admissions, spend down of income/assets, and quality of life. A report with recommendations will be submitted to Congress by January 1, 2022. The Secretary will prepare a report with recommendations for legislative or administrative action based on the evaluation of the CBI-SNP demonstration program using 3 years of data. Funding for program administration will come from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The Secretary will transfer $500,000 from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Program Management Account for evaluation and reporting purposes. The transferred amounts will remain available until expended. The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply to the testing and evaluation of the CBI-SNP demonstration program."
