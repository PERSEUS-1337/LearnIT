    "content": "This report provides a comparison of Department of Energy (DOE) funding for renewable energy with funding for other energy technologies over different time periods. The final funding amounts for FY2017 and FY2018 were established by specific acts signed by the President. Funding levels for DOE are included in Energy and Water Development programs. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) set funding levels for the Department of Energy (DOE) in Energy and Water Development programs. Tables and charts display DOE funding totals in real terms for different time periods, showing the relative shares of spending for each technology or energy source. Energy availability, especially during World War II, played a crucial role. During the post-World War II era, the federal government focused on R&D for energy sources to support economic growth, including fossil fuels and nuclear energy. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission for civilian control of nuclear development. The oil embargo in 1973 led to the creation of the Federal Energy Administration in 1974. The Federal Energy Administration was established in response to the oil embargo in 1973, leading to the creation of the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) in 1975. The Department of Energy (DOE) was established in 1977, consolidating various energy programs. Federal government spending on energy R&D focused on fossil fuels and nuclear power technologies, with about $51.6 billion allocated to nuclear energy R&D from FY1948 to FY1977. The federal government spent about $17.1 billion on fossil energy technologies and $51.6 billion on nuclear energy R&D from FY1948 to FY1977. Funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies began in the 1970s, with DOE becoming the main funder since FY1978. Funding for all energy technologies peaked at $8.6 billion in FY1979, dropping to $2.0 billion in the late 1990s before gradually increasing. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided a one-year spike of $13 billion in funding. DOE energy R&D funding has fluctuated over the years, peaking at $8.6 billion in FY1979 before dropping to $2.0 billion in the late 1990s. Funding gradually increased, with a spike of $13 billion in FY2009 due to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. In FY2018, funding stood at nearly $4.5 billion."
