    "content": "Ebola virus disease (Ebola, or EVD) is a severe, often fatal disease first detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976. It is spread through contact with infected bodily fluids and has caused a large outbreak in West Africa. Nearly 10,000 people have been infected, with almost 5,000 deaths reported. WHO updates on EVD cases can be found at http://www.who.int/ebola. WHO updates on Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases, with concerns about underreporting due to weak surveillance systems in neighboring countries. Mali reported its first EVD case, prompting WHO to send a team for assistance. Efforts are underway to develop Ebola vaccines and treatments, with plans to test vaccines on health workers. Supportive care is currently used to treat EVD symptoms, and disease spread can be limited through surveillance and containment measures. WHO has released manuals outlining these measures. The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa is spreading quickly due to the ill-equipped health systems in affected countries. Key factors distinguishing this outbreak include emergence in West Africa and simultaneous multi-country outbreaks along shared borders. WHO has released manuals outlining appropriate patient care and containment measures to limit disease spread. The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks in West Africa have spread to countries like DRC, Gabon, Sudan, South Sudan, and Uganda. Disease transmission along shared borders has led to imported cases in other countries. Efforts in contact tracing and containment have halted the spread in Senegal and Nigeria. Cases have also been reported in Mali, the United States, and Spain. Urban areas are now affected by the outbreak, unlike previous outbreaks confined to rural areas. The current Ebola outbreak is spreading rapidly in urban areas, posing challenges for responders due to limited access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare facilities. The scale and pace of transmission are unprecedented, with cases doubling every 15-40 days in affected countries. A separate Ebola outbreak in the DRC, unrelated to the West Africa outbreak, has resulted in 66 cases and 49 deaths as of October 20, 2014. The Ebola outbreak in the DRC began in late July or early August 2014, with 66 cases and 49 deaths reported as of October 20. Congressional actions have been taken to address the outbreak, including providing $88 million for response efforts and research on treatments and vaccines. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa prompted Congress to allocate funds for CDC response activities and research on treatments and vaccines. The affected countries' weak health systems have been overwhelmed by the crisis, exacerbating challenges in human resources, governance, financing, supply chain, service delivery, and information. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has overwhelmed the affected countries' weak health systems, exacerbating challenges in human resources, governance, financing, supply chain, service delivery, and information. Constraints in each component of the health systems enable the virus to continue spreading, leading to perceptions of government ineptitude and mistrust among civilians. Reports of attacks on health workers and facilities persist, prompting some governments to use armed forces for disease control measures and quarantine neighborhoods, deepening public resentment. Despite criticisms and protests, some quarantine zones remain in place. Per capita health spending in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is low, leading to poor conditions in health facilities. Health workers face delays in compensation, causing absenteeism. Some workers abandoned their posts due to safety concerns and unpaid salaries. Donors, including the United States, are offering financial aid to support payment of health workers' salaries. Several local staff at Ebola treatment units in Liberia have not been paid for three months. Donors, including the United States, are offering financial aid to support payment of health workers' salaries. The outbreak-affected countries lack sufficient financial resources to fund their national Ebola response plans and need support. The United Nations estimates it will cost Guinea $194 million, Liberia $473 million, and Sierra Leone $220 million to address the health and secondary effects of the outbreak. Inadequate access to health personnel and facilities is a problem in all three countries, leading to people caring for the ill on their own and facilitating the spread of Ebola. Access to medical care and treatment is inadequate in Sierra Leone and Guinea due to human resource constraints and concerns about health center conditions. The shortage of medics and health facilities has led to people caring for the ill on their own, contributing to the spread of the virus. Clinic closures are impacting broader health issues, particularly maternal and child health, with high mortality rates in the affected countries before the outbreak. In 2012, nearly 1 million children died in affected countries before their fifth birthday, accounting for 30% of under-five deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Many deaths could have been prevented with access to vaccines, clean water, and nutrition. Pregnant women are avoiding health facilities due to fear of contracting EVD, leading to lack of medical attention during labor. Liberia is experiencing more deaths from treatable ailments than Ebola. High maternal and child mortality rates are linked to the shortage of health workers, with Sierra Leone having only two doctors per 100,000 people. Liberia had fewer than 200 doctors before the outbreak, with only about 50 remaining after. In August 2014, Liberia had fewer than 200 doctors before the Ebola outbreak, with only about 50 remaining after. The shortage of healthcare workers is severe, with EVD deaths among health workers further diminishing staffing levels. WHO estimates that a facility treating 70 Ebola patients needs at least 250 healthcare workers. The affected countries would need more than 13,000 health workers to provide care, contact tracing, and safe burial, with only 5% coming from foreign countries. The Ebola outbreak in August 2014 highlighted the need for more than 13,000 health workers in affected countries. Only 5% would come from foreign countries, with the rest being national health staff. The lack of healthcare personnel has led to closed facilities and limited access to clinics, forcing the ill to travel long distances for healthcare. This delayed health-seeking behavior is reducing survival prospects and hindering efforts to detect and contain the virus. The Ebola outbreak in August 2014 emphasized the need for more health workers in affected countries, with only 5% coming from foreign countries. The lack of healthcare personnel has led to closed facilities and limited clinic access, causing delays in seeking healthcare. This delay is reducing survival prospects and hindering virus containment efforts. Severe deficiencies in health services, including treatment centers and laboratories, are impeding outbreak control. Liberia faces the most severe treatment shortage, with only 23% of needed beds available as of October 22. Treatment capacity is expected to improve with U.S. plans to build 27 ETUs in the country. The treatment capacity in Liberia is inadequate, with only 23% of needed beds available. The US plans to build 27 ETUs to improve this situation. Health experts are investigating a decrease in Ebola care seekers, while safe disposal of dead bodies is improving. Concerns include poor healthcare quality, inconsistent infection control, and transmission among health workers. Ebola cases among healthcare workers in Liberia are attributed to various transmission opportunities, including inadequate use of protective equipment and poor sanitation due to water supply interruptions. The lack of essential resources like running water, power, and ambulances further hampers healthcare efforts in the region. Shortages of protective gear contribute to Ebola cases among health workers. Shortages of protective gear and essential resources in Ebola-affected areas, such as Sierra Leone, contribute to the spread of the disease. Limited supplies of protective equipment and antibiotics for health workers increase the risk of contracting and spreading Ebola. The high demand for disinfectants and medicine has led to price increases, while transportation challenges hinder aid delivery in the region. Efforts to combat Ebola in affected areas are hindered by high prices of disinfectants and medicine, transportation challenges, and limited access to safe blood. Awareness about preventing EVD infection has improved, but poverty, infrastructural deficiencies, and health system constraints continue to pose challenges. Consumption of wild animals, driven by food insecurity, remains a concern despite health officials' efforts to educate the public about associated risks. Health officials are expanding efforts to inform the public about the risks of eating wild animals carrying EVD due to food insecurity. Weak laboratory and surveillance systems hinder containment efforts, with uncertainty about the number and location of EVD cases, particularly in Liberia. Limited laboratory capacity leads to diagnosis backlogs, endangering health workers and hindering containment. International responses are increasing, but the financial requirements for containment are rising with the outbreak's spread. The financial requirements for containing the Ebola outbreak are escalating as the outbreak spreads. WHO estimated $4.8 million in March, but by August, the cost was revised to $490 million. The outbreak has caused over 3,600 cases and 1,800 deaths. The United Nations established UNMEER to coordinate the international response, urging member states to expedite support. The United Nations Security Council held a special meeting on Ebola, urging member states to expedite support for the affected countries. A $988 million plan calls for addressing health and social impacts, with half the funds for health programs and the rest for food insecurity and economic disruptions. Donors have contributed $493 million towards the plan and pledged an additional $279 million. Resources have also been committed for addressing the outbreak outside of the UN response. WHO and UNOCHA may revise their funding requests as the outbreak continues to spread. The World Health Organization and UNOCHA have pledged an additional $938 million for immediate and long-term preparedness needs in response to the Ebola outbreak. WHO has requested donors provide $490 million for building referring and isolation centers, increasing diagnostic capacity, and attracting health workers to contain the outbreak by January 2014. Several countries have pledged medical support, including Cuba's commitment to deploy 165 health professionals. Since September, countries like Cuba, the U.S., Britain, China, the African Union, and East African Community have pledged medical support to the region to combat the Ebola outbreak. In response to human resource constraints, the Liberian Government, WHO, CDC, and partners developed the Community Care Campaign to establish community care centers managed by NGOs, CHWs, and family members of EVD patients. The Community Care Campaign calls for the establishment of community care centers (CCCs) managed by NGOs, CHWs, and family members of EVD patients to complement Ebola Treatment Units. The United States is the leading funder of the international Ebola response, with financial support totaling $344.6 million as of October 22. President Obama established an Ebola Czar to coordinate U.S. domestic and global responses to the outbreak. The U.S. has allocated over $1 billion to combat the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. President Obama appointed an Ebola Czar to oversee domestic and global responses. The U.S. Global Ebola strategy aims to control the outbreak, mitigate impacts, establish leadership, and enhance global health security. Nearly 900 U.S. Government personnel, including 700 military personnel, are stationed in the region. The response builds on previous efforts to strengthen foreign nations' capacity to handle disease outbreaks. Since 2005, USAID has invested roughly $1 billion in pandemic preparedness efforts, including Ebola outbreak responses. The Emerging and Pandemic Threats program operates in 18 countries in Africa and Asia, focusing on viral detection in wildlife, livestock, and human populations. Congressional funds for these efforts have fluctuated between FY2005-FY2014. USAID has invested $1 billion in pandemic preparedness efforts since 2005, with funds fluctuating between FY2005-FY2014. Activities in East and Central Africa and South and Southeast Asia focus on viral detection, risk determination, institutionalization of a \"one health\" approach, outbreak response capacity, and risk reduction. USAID has committed over $300 million for combating Ebola in West Africa, including deploying a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to coordinate the U.S. Government's response. Between March and October 2014, USAID committed over $300 million to combat Ebola in West Africa. This included providing treatment beds, protective equipment, hygiene kits, and supporting public awareness and prevention efforts. Funds were reprogrammed from various accounts to support these initiatives. CDC funds global pandemic preparedness efforts through various accounts, including Global Disease Detection, Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Global Health, Immunization, and Public Health Preparedness. Appropriations for Global Disease Detection have increased since 2003. CDC requested additional support in FY2015 to accelerate activities for the Global Health Security Agenda, focusing on detecting, preventing, and responding to infectious disease threats like Ebola. CDC supports pandemic influenza preparedness in over 50 countries by sending experts to work with WHO offices or forming cooperative agreements with partners. Teams were sent to Guinea and Liberia in March 2014 to assist Health Ministries in controlling the Ebola outbreak. CDC teams traveled to Guinea and Liberia in March 2014 to assist Health Ministries in controlling the Ebola outbreak. CDC has committed over $16.7 million for its Ebola responses and is providing technical assistance, training airport personnel, and displaying Ebola-specific travel messages at airports in affected countries. DOD announced a $22 million fund to set up a 25-bed field hospital in Liberia for treating EVD cases among healthcare workers. The DOD announced a $22 million fund to set up a 25-bed field hospital in Liberia for treating EVD cases among healthcare workers. President Obama launched \"Operation United Assistance\" in Monrovia, Liberia, deploying 4,000 U.S. military forces to support relief efforts and establish 12 treatment centers with 100-bed capacity each. The first 22-bed ETC is expected to be completed by the end of October. The DOD has allocated $22 million to set up a 25-bed field hospital in Liberia for treating EVD cases among healthcare workers. Operation United Assistance, launched by President Obama, involves deploying 4,000 U.S. military forces to establish 12 treatment centers with 100-bed capacity each in Liberia. Over 700 U.S. military personnel are in the region, operating mobile medical labs for EVD testing. Congress has approved funding requests for Operation United Assistance and other related activities, with total DOD funding for the global Ebola response expected to exceed $1 billion. The current Ebola outbreak has overwhelmed Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, with insufficient capacity to detect, treat, and prevent the spread of the disease. The spread of disease has weakened health systems and Congress has enacted legislation to expand responses and provide funds. WHO estimates 13,000 health workers are needed to contain the Ebola outbreak. Human resource constraints are most acute in Liberia. The United States has partnered with various groups to develop a Community Care Campaign. Doctors Without Borders has expressed concerns about the campaign. The United States has partnered with the Liberian government, WHO, and other groups to develop a Community Care Campaign. Doctors Without Borders has expressed concerns about the campaign, citing risks of contamination centers without proper infection control, supplies, trained staff, and burial methods. WHO acknowledges the potential for virus transmission within the CCC due to deficiencies in implementation quality, including inconsistent adherence to infection control protocols. Concerns also arise regarding the ability to ensure IPC protocols among trained health personnel and non-governmental organizations, community health workers, and family members. The concern is whether non-governmental organizations, community health workers, and family members will adhere to infection prevention and control protocols in Ebola care centers. WHO recommends only one family member provide care to each patient in CCCs to prevent the spread of EVD. Compliance with familial care guidelines may be challenging due to cultural practices, loss of income, and emotional stress. The challenges in ensuring compliance with WHO familial care guidelines in Ebola care centers include loss of income, separation from family, emotional stress, and deficiencies in waste management. Strict adherence to IPC protocol, including wearing PPE and proper waste disposal, is crucial. Monitoring and supervision are essential for the success of the approach, especially among lay caregivers without medical training. The Community Care Campaign emphasizes the need for daily supervisory visits by trained health care workers to ensure compliance with IPC protocols and proper use of PPE in CCCs. Poor supply chain management leads to interruptions in medical supplies and lack of protective equipment in health clinics, increasing the risk of EVD infection among health workers. WHO and its partners must ensure continuous supply of commodities to CCCs to prevent unsafe practices. The implementation of the Community Care Campaign in response to EVD includes ensuring proper supply chain management and continuous provision of protective equipment to prevent infection among health workers. The U.S. government is already involved in providing community care kits in Liberia, with oversight by USAID to ensure program targets are met. Questions remain about U.S. oversight and standardization of quality control in managing Community Care Centers. Questions have been raised about U.S. oversight and implementation of the Community Care Campaign (CCC) in response to Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). Critics have also pointed out budget cuts at the World Health Organization (WHO) that have hindered its effectiveness in containing outbreaks. Some observers believe that bureaucratic issues and underqualified staff have further impeded WHO's response to global health crises. The response to the Ebola outbreak has been hindered by bureaucratic bloat and underqualified staff with political connections. There are debates on whether WHO should focus on advisory roles or maintain operational capacity. Some suggest creating a \"Health Systems Fund\" administered by WHO. Weak health systems in affected countries have contributed to the rapid spread of Ebola. Donors have struggled to address health emergencies due to dysfunctional health systems. Donors have grappled with addressing health emergencies in countries with weak health systems. In the early 2000s, disease-based funding was introduced through non-governmental groups, sparking debates on its impact. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) intensified this debate, with the U.S. funding non-governmental organizations to establish care facilities outside government networks. This approach saved lives but raised concerns about sustainability if U.S. funding were to be withdrawn. In the second phase of PEPFAR, increasing resources were used to support health systems to strengthen country capacity. Debate on the use of PEPFAR funds for building health systems has resumed, with concerns about budgetary reforms potentially jeopardizing efforts. The U.S. Congress faces a similar dilemma with the current Ebola outbreak, as affected countries require focused support. Health system advocates fear that budgetary reforms may jeopardize efforts to strengthen health systems. The U.S. Congress also faces a dilemma with the current Ebola outbreak, as affected countries need focused support. Ken Isaacs highlighted the importance of building capacity during emergencies, while USAID has established a working group to strengthen health systems post-outbreak. The USAID has established an Ebola Health Systems Strengthening working group to support the resumption of health care delivery and bolster health systems once the outbreak is contained. The majority of health aid is directed towards specific diseases, leaving minimal resources for broader activities to strengthen health systems. Various U.S. agencies are responding to the Ebola outbreak, with the Department of State leading diplomatic engagements, USAID coordinating responses, CDC heading public health activities, and DOD providing support for foreign armed forces. The CDC is leading public health and medical response activities for the Ebola outbreak, while the DOD is providing support for foreign armed forces. USAID can finance outbreak responses through disaster assistance accounts, and the DOD budget supports various health activities without detailed congressional direction. Congress has directives on how foreign aid funds are used, with USAID receiving specific directions on fund usage through annual appropriations. USAID receives specific direction from Congress on fund usage through annual appropriations, limiting its ability to address unanticipated events like the Ebola outbreak without drawing from ongoing health efforts. Funds planned for preventing future outbreaks are being reprogrammed to address the current Ebola outbreak, as well as responses to other outbreaks. Congressional directives are seen as tools for overseeing health programs, but opponents argue they limit agility in the field and create artificial segmentation of health and development issues. Disease outbreaks are unpredictable, but with appropriate surveillance and response mechanisms, their impact can be mitigated. USAID's pandemic preparedness efforts are focused on East and Central Africa, as well as South and Southeast Asia. The FY2015 budget request for pandemic preparedness is $50 million, 30% less than the previous year. Experts predict the Ebola outbreak can be contained by the end of January, but the high death tolls are causing long-term effects in the region. MSF has reported disruptions in social structures in affected villages in Sierra Leone. The Ebola outbreak may be contained by the end of January, but high death tolls are disrupting social structures and causing long-term effects in the region. MSF reports that affected villages in Sierra Leone have lost many adult community members, leaving vulnerable populations without resources. Concerns also arise about growing numbers of orphaned children, who are at risk of marginalization. The outbreak is hindering governments' capacity to address health issues like obstetrical complications, potentially leading to higher child and maternal mortality rates in West and Central Africa. The Ebola outbreak in West and Central Africa is hindering governments' capacity to address health issues like obstetrical complications, leading to higher child and maternal mortality rates. Diminishing numbers of health personnel, diversion of resources to Ebola treatment centers, and public avoidance of health centers are contributing factors. The full health effects of the outbreak may not be known until it is contained, sparking debates on global health assistance funds allocation. There are no specific cure, treatment, or vaccine for Ebola, and therapeutic options remain undeveloped. Since 1976, Ebola outbreaks have occurred in sub-Saharan Africa with no specific cure, treatment, or vaccine available. Experimental treatments and vaccines are being tested, raising ethical concerns about equity in access. The use of untested drugs may worsen mistrust in healthcare workers and modern medicine. WHO held a special meeting to address these issues. WHO announced that under the circumstances of the Ebola outbreak, it is ethical to offer unproven interventions with unknown efficacy and adverse effects. They planned to test two Ebola vaccines on 20,000 health workers and volunteers in January. A limited amount of experimental treatment might be available in Liberia by early November. WHO convened a meeting to discuss fast-tracking testing and deployment of vaccines to impact the Ebola epidemic. WHO convened a meeting with stakeholders to fast track testing and deployment of Ebola vaccines in affected countries. Concerns about potential Ebola outbreaks in neighboring countries were raised, prompting WHO to assist in building surveillance and response plans. An Oxford University study highlighted the risk of future outbreaks in forested areas of Central and West Africa. The article discusses concerns about potential future Ebola outbreaks in Africa, particularly in forested areas where fruit bats, a suspected vector, reside. Questions are raised about the effectiveness of the U.S. response to the outbreak, support for pandemic preparedness efforts, and the impact of disease-specific funding on preparedness. Additionally, the reprogramming of USAID funds to address Ebola and ongoing outbreak responses are evaluated for their impact on global health and development programs."
