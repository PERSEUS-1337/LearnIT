Changes in water quantity and quality since the 1950s have significantly impacted the region's ecology, leading to water shortages during the dry season. The Everglades, a vital component of the South Florida ecosystem, faces challenges in meeting freshwater demands for both natural systems and human consumption. The Everglades, a network of wetland landscapes, once stretched from Orlando to Florida Bay. Water flowed south from lakes through slow-moving creeks and marshes, acting as natural filters. Human efforts to control floods and reclaim land led to development in South Florida. The Everglades ecosystem in South Florida has been significantly altered by human interventions, particularly the Central and Southern Florida project authorized by Congress in 1948. This project has redirected water flows through canals and levees, leading to changes in the Everglades' water regime. As a result, the ecosystem now receives less water during the dry season and more during the rainy season, impacting its natural state. The Everglades ecosystem has changed due to altered water flow, urban and agricultural development, leading to habitat loss and reduced size. Degraded water quality from pollutants has harmed plant and animal populations, causing a decline in native vegetation and an overabundance of invasive species. Restoration efforts by the federal government and the State of Florida aim to address the health of the Everglades. The South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force coordinates restoration activities in the Everglades, focusing on goals like improving water quality and restoring natural habitats. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) aims to capture and store freshwater for the dry season, with 80% directed to the natural system and 20% for consumption. CERP includes removing levees and canals to restore natural hydrologic functions. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) aims to capture and redistribute water to replicate natural flow, with 80% directed to the natural system and 20% for consumption. Title VI of WRDA 2000 approved CERP and authorized $700 million in federal funds for initial projects. WRDA 2007 authorized additional activities, totaling roughly $2.0 billion in authorizations. CERP activities in the legislation represented roughly $2.0 billion in authorizations. Title VI of WRDA 2000 established that construction and O&M costs of CERP projects would be equally shared by Floridian stakeholders and the federal government. Authorization was achieved after negotiations among various stakeholders. Federal agencies receive appropriations for CERP activities through their annual appropriations bills. Concerns remain over project prioritization and federal efforts. Concerns remain over the implementation of CERP, including project prioritization, federal efforts, and mitigation of excess phosphorous. Approximately $2.0 billion in authorizations have been allocated for CERP projects, with federal and state funds totaling $2 billion. Stakeholders are divided on prioritizing water supply needs over ecosystem restoration in the Acceler8 initiative. Some stakeholders are concerned about the focus on water supply projects in the Acceler8 initiative, which could detract from ecosystem restoration efforts. Proponents argue that priority projects under the CERP program have benefits for both water supply and restoration, but federal funding is perceived as too slow. There are worries about specific Everglades restoration projects primarily benefiting locally rather than nationally, and increasing costs, particularly in land acquisition, are a cause for concern. Acceler8 supporters believe these rising costs necessitate a quicker pace in project implementation. The increasing costs of land acquisition are a major concern for stakeholders involved in the Acceler8 initiative. There are worries that federal funds allocated to the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) may limit funding for other ecosystem restoration projects nationwide. Delays in completing CERP projects have raised concerns about the feasibility of the plan, with potential impacts on ecosystem restoration goals. The interdependency of CERP and non-CERP projects for ecosystem restoration goals was codified in WRDA 2000, with potential delays in restoration due to a Florida state law extending phosphorus mitigation deadlines. Appropriations for restoration are conditioned on achieving water quality standards in federal properties. The FY2004 and FY2005 Interior appropriations included provisions conditioning funds for restoration on achieving water quality standards in federal properties. If standards are not met, restoration appropriations may be reduced. Congressional interest in overseeing water quality standards for waters entering federal lands in Florida is indicated. Some question the effectiveness and necessity of the complicated and costly CERP plan for Everglades restoration, citing concerns about insufficient measures to improve water quality. Critics note that CERP prioritizes water supply over ecological restoration, leading to revisions in project sequencing. Despite changes, opposition from some environmental groups and scientists persists. The Corps revised the project implementation sequencing to include restoration activities earlier. Some groups and scientists oppose CERP, concerned about Florida's financial contribution source. They argue against using funds designated for land purchase for other CERP projects. Land acquisition is seen as essential for successful Everglades restoration. Questions have been raised about Lake Okeechobee management, flood management impact on ecosystems, and integration of water management issues into Everglades restoration planning. Concerns about sea level rise and climate change impacts have also been raised. Ecosystem restoration in central Florida, particularly on the Caloosahatchee River, is being integrated into Everglades restoration efforts. Concerns about sea level rise and climate change impacts on the Everglades ecosystem have been raised. Adaptive management is being used in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) to address uncertainties, with pilot projects testing new water management strategies like aquifer storage and recovery. Pilot projects for aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) are part of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) in central Florida. These projects aim to store surface water in underground aquifers for later use during dry periods, but their effectiveness is uncertain as they are still ongoing."
