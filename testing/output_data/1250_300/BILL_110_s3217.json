    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2008\". Congress finds that justice is served when all parties in litigation have experienced counsel, protecting attorney-client privileged communications promotes compliance with the law, and clarity on the privilege enhances organizations' compliance programs. Prosecutors and government officials can still perform their duties while respecting these protections.
