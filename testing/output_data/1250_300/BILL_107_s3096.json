    "content": "The \"Ballistics, Law Assistance, and Safety Technology Act\" or the \"BLAST Act\" aims to increase public safety by assisting law enforcement in solving gun-related crimes through ballistics technology. It requires ballistics testing of all new firearms for sale and those in custody of Federal agencies to aid in identifying firearms used in crimes. Additionally, it adds ballistics testing to existing firearms enforcement programs. The definition of ballistics is amended to include a comparative analysis of fired bullets and cartridge casings to identify the firearm used. Additionally, there is a provision for test firing and automated storage of ballistics records. The amendment to Section 923 of title 18, United States Code, requires licensed manufacturers or importers to test fire firearms, prepare ballistics images, store records in a database, and store fired bullet and cartridge casings as specified by the Secretary. The Attorney General and the Secretary will assist in compliance. No civil liability except for civil penalties is imposed for non-compliance. The Attorney General and the Secretary will assist firearm manufacturers and importers in complying with requirements such as acquiring ballistics equipment, hiring personnel for database maintenance, providing education on ballistics, coordinating with law enforcement agencies, and taking necessary steps for effective ballistics testing. The Attorney General and the Secretary will establish a computer system for law enforcement access to ballistics records, encourage training for examiners, and submit annual reports on the impact of the section on gun crime investigations. The subsection authorizes funding for ballistics equipment, testing programs, personnel salaries, and mandatory testing of firearms by the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury. The amendment mandates ballistics testing of firearms by the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury. The effective date is contingent on the interoperability of ballistics systems and ranges from immediate to 5 years after enactment. SEC. 5. PRIVACY RIGHTS OF LAW ABIDING CITIZENS.
