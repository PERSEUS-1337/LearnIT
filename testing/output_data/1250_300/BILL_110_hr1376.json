Amendments to the Social Security Act involve changes to various sections, including updating references from (XIX) to (XVIII) and (XVIII) to (XVII) in different subsections, with an effective date starting from October 1, 2007. The State plan for medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act must meet additional requirements imposed by amendments. Failure to meet these requirements before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the State legislature's session will not be considered non-compliance solely for that reason. If a State has a 2-year legislative session, each year is deemed a separate regular session."
