    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Act of 2015\". Congress acknowledges the importance of crowdsourcing and citizen science. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 has allowed Federal agencies to use incentive prizes and challenges, resulting in benefits such as paying only for success, setting ambitious goals, involving a broader group of people, bringing diverse perspectives, and maximizing cost-effectiveness. Granting agencies direct authority to use crowdsourcing and citizen science will remove ambiguity and encourage their appropriate use to advance agency missions. Granting agencies direct authority to use crowdsourcing and citizen science will remove ambiguity about their use, encourage their appropriate use to advance agency missions, and stimulate broader public participation in the innovation process. Crowdsourcing projects offer unique benefits such as improving government service delivery with lower resource investments, connecting citizens to Federal agency missions, and acquiring data at a greater geographic extent and frequency than conventional methods. Citizen science benefits include advancing scientific research through group discovery, improving science literacy, furthering science diplomacy, and building trust between citizens and science. Federal agencies should consider providing meaningful incentives for participants in crowdsourcing and citizen science projects, such as receiving attribution for their contributions, learning new skills, connecting with others, and knowing their work is contributing to solving important problems in science for the benefit of society. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. CROWDSOURCING AND CITIZEN SCIENCE.\" is a concise statement about the topic of crowdsourcing and citizen science. In this section, \"citizen science\" refers to open collaboration in the scientific process, while \"crowdsourcing\" involves obtaining services or content through voluntary contributions. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and \"Federal agency\" is defined as a government agency. The terms defined in this section include \"participant\" as an individual or entity volunteering in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects, and \"related entity\" as a contractor, subcontractor, supplier, or grantee of a Federal agency. Federal agencies, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, and grantees can utilize crowdsourcing and citizen science approaches for their missions. Participants can provide voluntary services without financial compensation for approved projects. Under this section, services can be performed as part of crowdsourcing or citizen science projects authorized under paragraph (1), without financial compensation and without displacing any Federal Government employees. Federal agencies engaged in such projects must advertise and promote them for broad participation. Agencies can determine the level of consent, registration, or acknowledgment required from participants on a project-by-project basis. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must disclose key terms such as privacy, data ownership, and compensation to participants clearly. Consent can be obtained electronically or in writing. Projects involving human subjects must adhere to regulations. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must disclose key terms such as privacy, data ownership, and compensation to participants clearly. Projects involving human subjects shall be subject to part 46 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations. Data collected through authorized projects should be made open and available in machine-readable formats. Participants must be informed about the expected uses of the data, ownership rights, availability for public use, and authorization to publish the data. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must disclose key terms such as privacy, data ownership, and compensation to participants clearly. Participants in these projects must agree to assume risks, waive claims against the Federal Government, and ensure scientific integrity. Technologies developed through these projects should be made open and available to the public. Federal agencies coordinating citizen science projects must ensure participants adhere to scientific integrity policies. They can partner with private or public entities for administrative duties and may share funding responsibilities. In carrying out crowdsourcing and citizen science activities, Federal agencies can use funds appropriated by Congress and accept funds or support from other Federal agencies, private sector entities, and government agencies, including public institutions of higher education. Special consideration cannot be given in return for such funds or support. The General Services Administration will provide assistance within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The General Services Administration will provide assistance within 180 days of the enactment of the Act to facilitate crowdsourcing and citizen science activities by developing products and services, specifying contract vehicles, and enhancing technology platforms for Federal agencies. Federal agency heads engaged in these activities are encouraged to consult guidance provided by the Director. A report is required every 2 years after the Act's enactment. The Director must report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies every 4 years, including project goals and participation statistics. The Director must report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies every 4 years, including project goals, participation statistics, resources used, activities, obligations, expenditures, ways projects advanced agency mission, and project results. The Director must report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies every 4 years, including project goals, participation statistics, resources used, activities, obligations, expenditures, ways projects advanced agency mission, project results, data quality methods, cost savings, challenges, and barriers faced by Federal agencies. The Director must report on crowdsourcing and citizen science projects conducted by Federal agencies every 4 years, including project goals, participation statistics, resources used, activities, obligations, expenditures, ways projects advanced agency mission, project results, data quality methods, cost savings, challenges, and barriers faced by Federal agencies. The report should also include steps taken to address challenges, recommendations for future action, a summary of the use of crowdsourcing and citizen science methods by all Federal agencies, and any other relevant information. Additionally, the section includes savings provisions to ensure that the authority to conduct crowdsourcing and citizen science projects is not affected by this reporting requirement."
