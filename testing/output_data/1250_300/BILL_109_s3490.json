    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge Study Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the scenic Cherry Valley area in northeastern Pennsylvania is home to over 80 special-concern animal and plant species, including 6 endangered or threatened species such as the bog turtle, dwarf wedge mussel, and bald eagle. Additionally, Cherry Valley provides habitat for 79 species of national or regional concern. Cherry Valley in northeastern Pennsylvania is home to over 80 special-concern animal and plant species, including 6 endangered or threatened species. It provides habitat for at least 79 species of national or regional concern, including neotropical migratory birds, waterfowl, globally rare plants, and anadromous fish species. The Cherry Valley watershed encompasses a large segment of the Kittatinny Ridge, an important migration route for birds of prey, where every migratory raptor species in the northeast United States is regularly observed during autumnal migration. The Kittatinny Ridge in Cherry Valley, northeastern Pennsylvania, is a significant migration route for birds of prey, including the bald eagle, golden eagle, and broad-winged hawk. It also includes a portion of the Appalachian Trail and rare calcareous wetlands. Ongoing studies have shown high water quality in Cherry Creek, and there are federally-owned parcels of land nearby that could potentially be included in a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Public meetings over several years have shown strong local support for a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, with landowners, business leaders, and conservation entities expressing enthusiasm for the project. Local communities and conservation groups are actively working to protect Cherry Valley's wildlife habitat and farmland, making them potential partners for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Local entities, including State land management agencies and the National Park Service, are potential partners for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in establishing a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Many local landowners have already placed their land in conservation easements. Voter-approved funds in Monroe County and Stroud Township, Pennsylvania, have supported conservation projects in the area. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Map.--Refers to the map titled \"Proposed Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge-Authorization Boundary\" dated February 24, 2005.\n            (2) Secretary.--Refers to the Secretary of the Interior.\n            (3) Study area.--Refers to the fish and wildlife habitat in Cherry Valley, located in northeastern Pennsylvania as identified on the map.\n\nSEC. 4. STUDY OF REFUGE POTENTIAL AND FUTURE REFUGE LAND ACQUISITION. The Secretary will conduct a study to evaluate the Study Area for potential acquisition by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for inclusion in a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Consultation with State and local officials, conservation organizations, and landowners will be done to identify suitable land and determine acquisition boundaries. The Secretary will also assess if the Study Area is suitable for inclusion in the National Wildlife Refuge. The Secretary will determine if the Study Area is suitable for inclusion in the National Wildlife Refuge System, assess conservation benefits for establishing a Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, including preserving diverse populations of fish, wildlife, and plants, protecting habitats, and providing opportunities for wildlife-dependent recreation and research. The Secretary will acquire up to 30,000 acres of land, water, and interests in the Study Area for the Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. A report must be submitted to the Senate and the Committee on Environment and Public Works within one year of the Act's enactment. Public participation and local input will be considered for future refuge purposes. The Secretary will complete a study and submit a report to the Senate and House Committees, including a map identifying specific land for acquisition, cost estimates, and funds needed for the Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress with a map identifying land for acquisition, cost estimates, and funds needed for the Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, with an authorization of $200,000 for implementation."
