    "content": "The \"Hospital Cooperative Agreement Act\" aims to promote collaboration among hospitals to reduce costs and enhance efficiency in healthcare delivery by avoiding unnecessary duplication of expensive medical services. Additionally, a new section is added to the Public Health Service Act to establish a Hospital Technology and Services Sharing Demonstration Program. The Secretary will establish a demonstration program awarding grants to hospitals for collaboration on expensive medical technology. Eligible applicants must be hospitals willing to enter into cooperative agreements with other hospitals in the same state or region. The Secretary will establish a demonstration program awarding grants to hospitals for collaboration on expensive medical technology. Eligible applicants must be hospitals willing to enter into cooperative agreements with other hospitals in the same state or region. The application process includes providing a statement of intent, describing the activities planned under the agreement, and submitting any additional information deemed necessary by the Secretary. Evaluation guidelines will be developed by the Administrator of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, and applications will be evaluated by the Secretary in consultation with the Administrator. The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator, evaluates applications for grants under a demonstration program for hospitals collaborating on medical technology. Criteria include enhancing care quality, preserving hospital facilities, improving cost-effectiveness, resource utilization, and avoiding duplication. The grants awarded under this program are to facilitate collaboration among hospitals, not for purchasing facilities or equipment. Permissible uses include expenses for personnel, administrative services, support services, and instructional programs. Additionally, at least three grants must demonstrate how cooperative agreements can improve access to care in rural areas. Cooperative agreements under this program aim to increase access to quality care in rural areas by sharing medical technology and services among participating hospitals. Medical technology includes drugs, devices, and procedures used in medical care, along with support systems. Eligible services for sharing must be outlined in the agreement. The demonstration program aims to increase access to quality care in rural areas by sharing high-cost services through cooperative agreements. The program will run for 5 years, with a report due to Congress after this period on the effectiveness of the agreements. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the potential benefits of cooperative agreements in containing healthcare costs, increasing access to medical services, and improving healthcare quality. The report will also include recommendations for future programs. Additionally, hospitals are allowed to enter into cooperative agreements without violating antitrust laws. The term \"antitrust laws\" refer to the Sherman Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, Clayton Act, and State antitrust laws. Appropriations are authorized for the implementation of these laws for fiscal years 1994 through 1998."
