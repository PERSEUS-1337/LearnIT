    "content": "The \"Landmine Elimination Act of 1997\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to landmines. Congress found that in the past, there have been significant injuries and deaths caused by landmines, leading to calls for a ban on their production and use. The text highlights the significant injuries and deaths caused by landmines, with statistics on casualties in various regions. It also mentions international efforts towards banning anti-personnel landmines, including declarations by President Clinton, the Organization of American States, and the Organization of African Unity. Additionally, Canada announced negotiations for a treaty banning landmines. The Government of Canada announced negotiations for a treaty banning anti-personnel landmines to be completed in Ottawa in December 1997. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution to pursue a treaty banning the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of landmines. Formal negotiations on the Ottawa treaty are set to begin in Oslo, Norway in September 1997. The United States could secure broad support for a treaty banning landmines, which would further its security and humanitarian interests. SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON NEW DEPLOYMENTS OF ANTI-PERSONNEL LANDMINES. Beginning in 2000, no US funds can be used for new deployments of anti-personnel landmines. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report to Congress within 180 days outlining alternatives for landmines on the Korean Peninsula. The President can delay the restriction for Korea if deemed necessary for defense. The report under subsection (d) shall describe efforts to implement proposals for the defense of the Republic of Korea in case of war or emergency. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"anti-personnel landmine\" refers to munitions designed to detonate by a person's presence, proximity, or contact, causing harm. \"New deployments of anti-personnel landmines\" are those placed after January 1, 2000, excluding command-detonated Claymore munitions."
