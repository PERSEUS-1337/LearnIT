    "content": "The \"Primary Care Enhancement Act of 2015\" amends the Internal Revenue Code to treat direct primary care service arrangements separately from health plans and insurance. This change applies to taxable years after the enactment of the Act. Certain provider fees are also classified as medical care under this legislation. The Primary Care Enhancement Act of 2015 amends the Internal Revenue Code to include periodic provider fees as medical care. This change applies to taxable years after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, the Act establishes the Medicare Primary Care Medical Home Demonstration Program. The Primary Care Enhancement Act of 2015 amends the Social Security Act to include a Primary Care Medical Home Model under which qualified practices are reimbursed a periodic fee for services provided to individuals enrolled under part B of title XVIII. The Primary Care Enhancement Act of 2015 establishes a model for qualified direct primary care medical home practices to receive a periodic fee for each enrolled individual, with limits on the fee amount to ensure affordability. The Secretary will estimate the monthly amount payable from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for services under parts A and B of title XVIII. Adjustments to the periodic fee will be based on performance benchmarks established using ACO quality measures in the Medicare shared savings program. Qualified direct primary care medical home practices participating in the model must meet or exceed the benchmarks. In a qualified direct primary care medical home practice participating in the model, the periodic fee paid to the practice for each individual enrolled will be increased by 5 percent if it meets or exceeds the performance benchmark for the year, and reduced by 5 percent if it does not meet the benchmark. The Secretary will terminate participation if the performance benchmark is not met for 2 consecutive years. Each qualified direct primary care medical home practice must provide preventive care, wellness counseling, primary care, coordination with specialty and hospital care, availability of appointments 7 days a week, secure e-mail and telephone consultation, and 24/7 telephone access for ongoing care consultation. The Secretary shall prioritize direct primary care practices enrolling dual eligible individuals, who are enrolled in Medicare Part B and meet specific criteria. The term 'dual eligible individual' refers to someone enrolled in Medicare Part B and meeting specific criteria. Care provided in a qualified direct primary care medical home practice under this model is not considered insurance and is not regulated as such by State insurance commissioners. Practices must submit an annual report on the progress of enrolled individuals to the Secretary. A qualified direct primary care medical home practice participating in the model must submit an annual report to the Secretary on the progress of individuals with chronic conditions, including ER visits, hospitalizations, surgeries, specialist visits, and use of advanced radiology. The Secretary will provide necessary patient data to practices for clinical purposes. Qualified direct primary care medical home practices participating in the model will receive necessary patient data, including prior claims data, for clinical purposes and evaluation. Physicians currently opted out of Medicare can still participate in the model and receive payment for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries under private contracts. Physicians excluded from Federal health care programs due to fraud will not be allowed to participate. The model under this subsection will be conducted for a minimum of 3 years. After the third year, if a qualified direct primary care medical home practice meets certain requirements, it can continue permanently as long as it continues to meet those requirements. The model under this subsection will be conducted for a minimum of 3 years. If a majority of qualified direct primary care medical home practices meet specific requirements, the Secretary will expand the model nationwide. SEC. 5. Use of direct primary care medical homes in the Medicare Advantage program allows Medicare Advantage organizations to contract with qualified direct primary care medical home practices for primary care services and shared savings agreements. Qualified practices are defined as those described in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."
