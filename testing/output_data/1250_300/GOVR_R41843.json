    "content": "A focus on U.S. rules governing imports from North Korea has been sparked by the debate over the South Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA). The agreement's opponents argue it could increase U.S. imports of goods from North Korea, but historically, the U.S. imports very few finished goods from North Korea due to trade restrictions. Since 2005, the United States has only imported $8,363 worth of stamps from North Korea, with zero imports of finished goods in four of the past five years. Critics are concerned that the KORUS FTA could allow South Korean firms to use goods from the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea to benefit the North Korean government. The report examines U.S. rules on imports from North Korea, including the Kaesong Industrial Complex and China. It also discusses the potential impact of the KORUS FTA on U.S. imports of North Korean content. The U.S. no longer has a comprehensive embargo on North Korea but still requires licenses for imports. In 1999, President Clinton eased restrictions on U.S. trade with North Korea, except for national security concerns. President Bush later removed North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and terminated Trading With the Enemy Act authorities. Despite these changes, importing from North Korea remained highly restricted or banned until 2008. Importing from North Korea was restricted until 2008 due to various reasons, including missile proliferation activities. President Obama used emergency powers to block assets of individuals and entities involved in illicit economic activities, expanding the prohibition on imports from North Korea in 2011. All imports from North Korea into the United States are prohibited, with exceptions. The President expanded the prohibition on imports from North Korea in 2011, following provocative actions by the North Korean government. All imports into the United States from North Korea are prohibited, with exceptions. It is necessary to distinguish between the admissibility of North Korean goods and the tariff treatment of admissible goods under U.S. laws and regulations. North Korea imports into the United States are prohibited, with exceptions. Approval from OFAC is required to import directly from North Korea. Executive orders prohibit importation of goods, services, or technology from North Korea. OFAC prohibits transactions prohibited by Executive Orders 13466, 13551, and 13570. The President has authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate regulations to implement executive orders prohibiting transactions with designated persons and entities, including importation from North Korea. OFAC can issue licenses for such transactions, but the President can revise or revoke the orders if national emergency conditions change. Importers must have OFAC approval to bring North Korean goods into the US through a third country. The President's executive order prohibits the importation of goods, services, or technology from North Korea into the United States without OFAC approval. This includes finished goods made with North Korean components. OFAC guidance states that a license is required for importing any goods, services, or technology from North Korea, even if they are used as components in products from a third country. New regulations from OFAC in June 2011 enforce the license requirements for both direct and indirect importing. The updated North Korea Sanctions regulations do not address issues like the treatment of North Korean component parts in third-country manufacturing. OFAC plans to supplement the regulations with more comprehensive guidance. North Korea's economy is highly isolated, with limited commercial and financial relations with other nations. The country's export markets have shrunk to South Korea and China. North Korea's economy has minimal commercial and financial ties with other countries. Its main export markets are South Korea and China, accounting for most of its exports. The Kaesong Industrial Complex plays a significant role in boosting North Korea's exports to South Korea, with over 120 South Korean manufacturing companies operating there in 2010. The facility produced $323 million in output, mainly in clothing, textiles, kitchen utensils, auto parts, semiconductor parts, and toner cartridges. In 2010, the Kaesong Industrial Complex had over 120 South Korean manufacturing companies operating, generating $323 million in output. Most firms produced clothing and textiles, with some also manufacturing kitchen utensils, auto parts, semiconductor parts, and toner cartridges. About 10% of the production was exported to countries like Australia, the European Union, Russia, and China. The complex's future depends on inter-Korean relations and South Korean leaders' policies. President Lee Myung-bak's government has been hesitant about expanding the complex due to strained inter-Korean relations. President Lee Myung-bak's government has been ambivalent about the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) since 2008. Despite halting major expansion plans, the complex has continued to grow incrementally. The reluctance to shut down the KIC is due to financial costs and political support within South Korea. With Lee's term ending in 2013, future South Korean leaders may decide to expand or close the complex, posing a dilemma for U.S. and South Korean policymakers. The Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) poses a dilemma for U.S. and South Korean policymakers. It provides revenue to the North Korean regime but also helps maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula. The KORUS FTA includes a Committee on Outward Processing Zones to consider preferential treatment for zones like the KIC. China has become key to North Korea's economic relations, with over half of its imports coming from China by the end of the decade. China has emerged as a crucial player in North Korea's economic relations, providing over half of its imports and most of its foreign assistance. North Korean exports to China have significantly increased, with major items including mineral fuels, apparel, fish, and agricultural products. North Korea has also imported technology and equipment from China to boost production in various sectors. This partnership has led to a significant rise in coal and mineral exports through collaboration with Chinese firms. North Korea's economic partnership with China involves importing equipment for coal and mineral mines, with Chinese firms providing modern equipment in exchange for the products being mined. There are plans to create an integrated industrial region in northeastern China and North Korea, including building roads, investing in North Korean industries, and potentially establishing a free trade zone. Discussions are ongoing about building an industrial park similar to the Kaesong Industrial Complex near the border. China and North Korea are exploring the possibility of building an industrial park similar to the Kaesong Industrial Complex near their mutual border. Chinese companies are engaged in various sectors in North Korea, including mining, agriculture, industrial parts, apparel, and consumer goods. There is potential for North Korean products to enter the Chinese supply chain and be sold in the U.S. market. Extensive documentation would be required to identify products manufactured using North Korean resources. The KORUS FTA raises concerns about North Korean goods entering the US market. Critics argue that the agreement may give preferential treatment to products from the Kaesong Industrial Complex, limit US import restrictions on North Korea, and lack clear rules of origin. During negotiations, South Korea pushed for KIC products to be included, but the US opposed. During the 2006-2007 KORUS FTA negotiations, the South Korean government sought preferential treatment for products from the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea, which the US opposed. A compromise was reached in the final agreement with the creation of a special committee to handle the KIC issue. The KORUS FTA's Annex 22-B establishes a process for reviewing conditions on the Korean Peninsula for economic development through outward processing zones. This would allow manufacturing or processing outside the FTA territory to qualify for preferential tariff treatment. The United States and South Korea would establish a Committee on Outward Processing Zones on the Korean Peninsula to determine geographic areas that may be designated as OPZs. The committee will set criteria for goods to be considered originating under the KORUS FTA, including labor and environmental standards. Additionally, a maximum threshold for the value of the total input of the 'originating final good' will be established by the committee. The Committee on Outward Processing Zones will determine if proposed OPZs meet criteria for originating goods under the KORUS FTA. Decisions made by the committee will be recommended to the US and South Korea for legislative approval. The US would need to pass a law to extend tariff benefits to products from Kaesong or any OPZ. The US must first deem OPZ goods admissible before considering applicable tariff treatment. The US must first deem goods from OPZs admissible before considering applicable tariff treatment. Congress has the authority to impose duties and must authorize specific tariff rates for products. Goods from countries under Title IV, like North Korea, can only receive NTR treatment under specific requirements. The President must abide by Title IV requirements to grant NTR tariff status to a Title IV country. Imports not subject to Title IV are entitled to NTR tariff status under the Trade Act of 1974. The extension of preferential tariff rates to imports from any country must be expressly authorized, with presidential authority likely limited to goods originating from South Korea as defined in the KORUS FTA implementing legislation. Critics have called for renegotiation of the agreement to exclude Annex 22-B and products from the Kaesong Industrial Complex. South Korea has previously agreed to modifications requested by the US regarding other parts of the KORUS FTA. The KORUS FTA has provisions that make it unlikely for the US to restrict imports from South Korea containing North Korean components. Article 2.8.1 of the agreement aligns with WTO rules, prohibiting quantitative restrictions on each other's goods. The United States and South Korea, under the KORUS FTA and WTO agreement, are prohibited from imposing quantitative restrictions on each other's goods, including import prohibitions or restrictions on goods from South Korea, even if they contain components from a third country. Exceptions to this rule may apply, such as when a party restricts imports from a non-party. The KORUS FTA allows countries to impose import embargoes on goods from non-signatory countries without violating the agreement. This provision also applies to import restrictions on goods from any third country, including U.S. embargoes on countries like Cuba and Iran. The United States has traditionally understood that import embargoes on goods from non-signatory countries, including Cuba and Iran, are protected under FTAs. This interpretation includes non-Party components used in third-country production. For example, the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement did not affect existing Cuban sanctions programs. The CFTA rules of origin would not override existing Cuban sanctions programs, allowing the US and Canada to restrict imports of Cuban products. This provision is similar to those in the KORUS FTA and NAFTA, ensuring that goods made from Cuban materials are not imported into the US. The KORUS FTA separates admissibility from tariff treatment, stating that the origin of a good does not determine its admissibility. The KORUS FTA provision states that the origin of a good does not determine its admissibility into the US or South Korea. The security exception in the agreement allows for measures necessary for international peace or security. The KORUS FTA includes a security exception clause that allows for measures necessary for international peace or security. This clause may be invoked in disputes, where the tribunal or panel must find that the exception applies. The KORUS FTA includes a security exception clause that allows for measures necessary for international peace or security. In disputes, the tribunal must find that the exception applies, preventing examination of whether a measure falls within the exception. Critics argue that South Korean manufacturers may benefit from the agreement's rules of origin. The responding Party plans to use a security exception in the KORUS FTA, allowing South Korean manufacturers to use North Korean components in exports to the US. Rules of origin are crucial for determining where products come from, impacting trade restrictions, tariffs, and other policies. Determining origin can be complex for products with components from multiple countries, like in the automotive sector with its extensive global supply chain. The global trading environment can be complex, especially in the automotive sector with its extensive supply chain. The KORUS FTA's rules of origin are crucial for determining product eligibility for preferential treatment. Preferential rules of origin aim to exclude products from non-signatory countries and protect import-sensitive domestic industries. Preferential rules of origin in the KORUS FTA require products to meet specific criteria to receive favorable tariff treatment. These rules are tailored for each party and incentivize using inputs from the United States or South Korea. Compliance is more crucial when tariffs are higher, encouraging manufacturers to source locally rather than from non-signatory countries like North Korea or China. The strength of incentives in FTAs depends on pre-existing tariffs. For example, under the KORUS FTA, meeting rules of origin can eliminate tariffs on products. This benefits manufacturers in the US and South Korea, while those in non-signatory countries face higher tariffs. Chapter 7 of the KORUS FTA enhances cooperation between US and South Korean customs officials. Chapter 7 of the KORUS FTA mandates sharing information and intelligence between US and South Korean customs officials, enhancing cooperation and efficiency in enforcing regulations. This could potentially limit the entrance of North Korean-manufactured inputs into the US. The proposed KORUS FTA includes methods for customs cooperation and ongoing dialogue between US and South Korean officials. Members of Congress may seek additional certification from South Korean exporters to the US. The agreement is unlikely to impact US sanctions on North Korean imports. The KORUS FTA's preferential terms do not apply to goods made in the KIC, and provisions allow the US to block inclusion of the KIC in the agreement. The KORUS FTA includes provisions to block the inclusion of the KIC in the agreement and preserve US restrictions on North Korean imports. The issue of handling imports from North Korea focuses on customs controls, cooperation, and enforcement, especially if North Korean industry revives in the future. The potential challenge of North Korean imports could increase if North Korean industry revives and integrates into the global economy through ties with Chinese provinces or expansion of the Kaesong Industrial Complex. There is a risk of circumventing U.S. import restrictions, especially in the automobile supply chain, where components from North Korea could enter U.S. commerce without proper authorization. The KORUS FTA may provide preferential treatment to these imports if passed. Korean producers could source components from low-wage North Korean producers to evade U.S. customs authorities. If the KORUS FTA is passed, these imports could receive preferential treatment, depending on U.S.-South Korea customs cooperation and penalties for non-compliance."
