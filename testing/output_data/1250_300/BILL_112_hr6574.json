    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Servicemember Mental Health Review Act\" and includes findings. Since September 11, 2001, around 30,000 veterans have been discharged from the Armed Forces due to personality or adjustment disorders. These veterans are then restricted from accessing various disability benefits. Many of them struggle to find employment due to the stigma attached to their discharge reason. The Department of Defense's compliance in these separations was as low as 40 percent between 2001 and 2007. A Mental Health Discharge Board of Review is proposed to review such separations. The establishment of a Mental Health Discharge Board of Review is necessary to review separations of veterans based on personality or adjustment disorders, ensuring wrongly separated veterans can access disability benefits and employment opportunities. The Department of Defense will review military separations based on a mental condition that does not amount to disability. The Department of Defense will establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review within each military department to review separations based on mental conditions not amounting to disability. Each board will consist of at least five members, including a licensed psychologist and psychiatrist. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review will be appointed to review separations of members and former members of the armed forces since September 11, 2001, due to mental conditions not amounting to disability. The Secretary of a military department must provide adequate support staff for the board and ensure that covered individuals are notified of their right to the review. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review will review separations of armed forces members since September 11, 2001, for mental conditions not amounting to disability. The Secretary of the military department must notify covered individuals of their right to the review and provide legal counsel options. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review will review separations of armed forces members since September 11, 2001, for mental conditions not amounting to disability. The board will consider findings from Department of Defense psychologists or psychiatrists, separation authority decisions, and adherence to separation processes. Private mental health records can also be submitted for review. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review will consider all evidence, including private mental health records, for separations of armed forces members. If the board proposes a review, consent must be obtained before proceeding. After completing the review, the board will provide a statement of reasons for their decision, and the covered individual can request reconsideration with new evidence. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review can recommend various actions for a covered individual, such as no negative recharacterization of separation, retirement for disability, or different types of separations. The individual can request reconsideration with new evidence if they disagree with the board's decision. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review can recommend actions for a covered individual, including retirement for disability or different types of separations. The board must provide a brief statement if not recommending retirement for disability, and the military records will be corrected accordingly. The Secretary of the military department corrects military records of covered individuals based on recommendations from the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review. Corrections are effective from the date of separation. For individuals previously receiving back pay, benefits will be adjusted accordingly. Regulations for this section are set by the Secretary of Defense, including deadlines for required reviews. The Secretary of Defense sets regulations for correcting military records of covered individuals based on recommendations from the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review. Deadlines for required reviews are specified in the regulations. The Secretary of Defense will establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review within 90 days of the enactment of the Act, as required by section 1554b of title 10, United States Code. Regulations for this process will also be prescribed."
