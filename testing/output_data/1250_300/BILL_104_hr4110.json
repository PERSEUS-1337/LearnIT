It amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a chapter on Health Insurance Availability for Children, which includes provisions for an excise tax on failure to provide access to coverage. The tax imposed on group health plans and insurers for failing to meet coverage requirements is 25% of premiums received. Self-insured plans are treated the same as premiums for this tax. The tax imposed on insurers offering individual health insurance coverage is 25% of the total premiums paid for the plan year in which the failure occurs. There are limitations on the tax amount, such as no tax if the failure was not discovered with reasonable diligence or if the failure is corrected within 30 days. The tax imposed on insurers for failures in individual health insurance coverage can be waived if the failure is corrected within 30 days and was due to reasonable cause, not willful neglect. The tax does not apply to governmental or church plans.
