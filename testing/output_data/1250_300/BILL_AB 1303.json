The section also addresses compliance with zoning ordinances for cities incorporating areas included in tentative or parcel maps. (e) For a tentative subdivision map or parcel that is extended under specific sections, the five-year period is reduced to three years. (f) Cities, counties, or city and counties can still impose fees or conditions on extended tentative maps, including fees upon building permit issuance.

The Government Code allows for a 24-month extension of approved tentative maps, vesting tentative maps, or parcel maps within specific counties if they are consistent with zoning and general plan requirements. The extension can be denied if the map is not in compliance with the requirements. Additionally, an automatic 60-day extension is granted upon application for an extension before the map's expiration.

If the advisory agency denies an extension, the subdivider may appeal to the legislative body within 15 days. In a county, specific conditions must be met for this section to apply: household income is less than 80% of the statewide average, unemployment rate is at least 2.75% higher than the statewide rate, and poverty rate is at least 4% higher than the statewide median. The extension of expiration dates for development projects in certain sections is provided in addition to any other extensions. Legislative approvals for projects included in extended maps shall be extended by 24 months. Modifications to conditions for building permits for residential subdivisions are outlined for tentative maps extended under this section. This act allows local agencies to levy charges to fund mandated services. It is an urgency statute to preserve development applications affected by economic conditions."
