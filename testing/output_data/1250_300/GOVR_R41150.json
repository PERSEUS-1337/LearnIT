    "content": "Energy and Water Development funding for FY2010 was provided in H.R. 3183, which became P.L. 111-85 when signed by President Obama on October 28, 2009, totaling $33.5 billion. Additional funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act remained to be expended. President Obama's proposed FY2011 budget totaled $35.3 billion. Various bills were approved in the House and Senate, but a continuing resolution was passed on September 30, funding government programs. The Senate and House passed a continuing resolution (H.R. 3081, P.L. 111-242) on September 30, extending funding until December 3. Later, funding was extended through March 4, 2011, and then further extended to March 18, 2011. H.R. 1 was introduced to continue funding for FY2011 at the FY2010 level with some exceptions. The House passed H.R. 1, while the Senate rejected it and offered a substitute with fewer funding reductions. The Senate rejected both the House-passed version of H.R. 1 and S.Amdt. 149, leading to the introduction of H.R. 1473, which was passed and signed into law on April 15 (P.L. 112-10). The bill funded Energy and Water Development programs at approximately $32.2 billion, including funding for various agencies and projects. Tables provide budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted from FY2004 to FY2011, as well as totals for each of the bill's four titles. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) are included in budget totals for energy and water development appropriations enacted from FY2004 to FY2011. Tables provide details for each of the bill's four titles, including the Corps of Engineers, Department of the Interior, Department of Energy, and independent agencies for FY2010-FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee provided the Corps with $5.32 billion in FY2011, an increase of $381 million over the Administration's request. In FY2011, the Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $5.32 billion to the Corps of Engineers, which was $381 million more than the Administration's request. The House Appropriations Subcommittee proposed $5.28 billion, while the Continuing Resolution provided $5.05 billion for the Corps. Federal funds for the Corps are not distributed based on a formula or competitive program, with 85% of appropriations directed to specific projects. The Corps of Engineers receives federal funds for water infrastructure programs, with 85% of appropriations directed to specific projects. Funding debates often involve earmarks, and projects must be previously authorized. The backlog of authorized projects ranges from $11 billion to over $80 billion, leading to questions about the authorization and appropriations processes. Annual appropriations for the Corps' Civil Works program are regularly supplemented. The Corps of Engineers receives federal funds for water infrastructure programs, with debates over earmarks and project prioritization. Since Hurricane Katrina, the Corps has received approximately $18.7 billion in supplemental appropriations for post-hurricane emergency repairs in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. This includes funding for Louisiana hurricane protection and barrier island restoration. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided the Corps with $4.6 billion for construction funding. The Corps of Engineers received $439 million for barrier island and ecosystem restoration in the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated an additional $4.6 billion for construction funding. The FY2011 Obama Administration request included $1.69 billion for construction, with a focus on completing ongoing projects rather than new starts. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $1.9 billion for the Construction account, utilizing unobligated balances from prior year appropriations. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $1.9 billion for the Construction account, utilizing unobligated balances from prior year appropriations for ongoing activities. The committee included one new construction start and barred the Corps from using appropriations for new starts. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund is facing a deficit as funding for ongoing work exceeds incoming collections. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF) has been facing a deficit as expenses for construction and rehabilitation exceed collections. The fund is supported by a fuel tax on commercial vessels and federal general revenue. Previous proposals to increase revenues, such as a lock user fee, have faced criticism. The FY2011 Budget proposed limiting IWTF spending to current fuel tax revenues. The FY2011 Budget proposed limiting IWTF spending to current fuel tax revenues, rejecting additional revenue from a lock user fee. The Senate Appropriations Committee agreed with this approach but warned of potential action if a solution is not reached soon. The Corps plays a key role in the restoration of the Central and Southern Florida ecosystem, with funding from Energy and Water Development appropriations and Department of the Interior appropriations. The FY2011 Obama Administration requested $180 million for the Corps' component of south Florida Everglades restoration work, the same as FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed reducing it to $155 million due to delays and funding issues. Since FY2006, there have been no across-the-board reductions for savings and slippage in individual accounts. In FY2011, Congress stopped applying an S&S rate to decrease the need for reprogramming allocations among projects. The FY2011 Senate Appropriations Committee markup included reductions for various Corps accounts, such as Investigations, Construction, Operations and Maintenance, and Mississippi Rivers & Tributaries. The Obama Administration requested $43.0 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Account, $1 million more than FY2010. The FY2011 request for the Bureau of Reclamation totaled $1.064 billion. In FY2011, the Obama Administration requested $43.0 million for the Central Utah Project Completion Account, $1 million more than FY2010. The Bureau of Reclamation's FY2011 request totaled $1.064 billion, with a net discretionary authority of $1.015 billion. The total discretionary budget request for Title II funding was approximately $1.107 billion, with the enacted bill appropriating $1.129 billion. The Senate bill, S. 3635, proposed $1.133 billion for Title II programs, while the House subcommittee's bill suggested $1.108 billion. P.L. 112-10 allocated $1.094 billion for these programs. Reclamation's largest account, Water and Related Resources, includes various programs like construction, operations, Dam Safety, and Fish and Wildlife Management. The Obama Administration requested $913.6 million for this account in FY2011, a decrease of $37.6 million from FY2010. H.R. 1 proposed funding this account at $911.6 million, $39 million below the FY2010 level. Amendments in H.R. 1 included eliminating funding for a dam removal study in the Klamath basin. The House-passed version of H.R. 1 included amendments that would have significant policy impacts, such as eliminating funding for a dam removal study in the Klamath basin and barring funding for certain projects related to the operations of the Central Valley Project and the California State Project. These provisions were not included in the final enacted version of P.L. 112-10. Reclamation manages dams and diversion projects in the West, primarily for irrigation purposes. The Bureau of Reclamation manages dams and water projects in the West for irrigation, providing water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people. It is the largest water supplier in the western states and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. Reclamation also offers flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits, but faces controversy over its impact on fish and wildlife species and conflicts among water users. The agency's budget is mainly project-based, and it has been criticized for lacking leadership in water supply provision. The Bureau of Reclamation's budget is primarily project-based, with criticism for lacking leadership in water supply provision. The agency manages the Central Valley Project (CVP) in California, facing challenges such as limited water deliveries due to drought and environmental restrictions. Recent appropriations bills have included amendments to prevent new Biological Opinions on project operations. Active leadership in western water resource management is deemed necessary to address competing needs and changing hydrology. The recent Biological Opinions (BiOps) on project operations for the Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP) in California have raised concerns about the impact on Delta Smelt and salmon species. These species are protected under the federal Endangered Species Act and the California Endangered Species Act. The Operations Criteria and Plan (OCAP) implemented in 2004 allowed increased pumping from the Delta, which some believe has further imperiled threatened or endangered fish species. Other factors such as invasive species, pollution, and water withdrawals from the Delta have also contributed to fishery declines. The low numbers of Delta Smelt have led to court-imposed limits on pumping and a new review of project operations and their impacts on the economy and species. The decline in fishery populations in the Delta is attributed to various factors such as pollution, water withdrawals, and low numbers of Delta Smelt. This has led to court-imposed limits on pumping and a review of project operations. Additionally, low water deliveries to certain districts are worsening unemployment in an already struggling economy. Proposed amendments in FY2010 were not enacted, but a bill included authorization for water transfers among CVP contractors without meeting specific conditions. The Administration requested $40.0 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account for FY2011, focusing on water use efficiency and other program areas. The Administration requested $40.0 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account (Bay-Delta, or CALFED) for FY2011, with funds allocated to water use efficiency, water quality, water storage, conveyance, and ecosystem restoration. Reclamation proposed $72.1 million for the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund for FY2011, a significant increase over FY2010. Reclamation proposed an allocation of $72.1 million for the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund for FY2011, authorized by the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act. The fund will be used for fisheries restoration and water management, funded through various sources including Central Valley Project Restoration Fund receipts. Planned actions for FY2011 include releasing interim flows from Friant Dam and completing planning and design for structural improvements. Significant actions planned for FY2011 for the San Joaquin River restoration include releasing interim flows from Friant Dam and completing planning, environmental compliance, and design for initial channel and structural improvements. The construction of Friant Dam in the 1940s blocked salmon migration and dewatered stretches of the San Joaquin River, leading to the elimination of spring-run Chinook. The Senate Appropriations Committee markup included an additional $8 million for the restoration, in addition to the $72 million already allocated. The House-passed CR (H.R. 1) includes a provision withholding funding for the settlement agreement for the remainder of FY2011. Reclamation has not commented on the potential impact of this provision. P.L. 112-10 did not specify funding levels for the settlement, and Reclamation proposed funding for a new program for FY2011 called WaterSMART. Reclamation proposed funding for the WaterSMART Program in FY2011, focusing on water conservation, re-use, and planning. The program includes WaterSMART Grants, Basin Studies, and Title XVI Projects, with a proposed increase of $27.4 million over FY2010 levels. The Senate Appropriations Committee decreased funding levels for these programs to $20 million. The Reclamation proposed funding for the WaterSMART Program in FY2011, with allocations for WaterSMART/Challenge Grants, Basin Studies, and Title XVI Projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee reduced funding levels for these programs. The Energy and Water Development bill has historically funded DOE programs, including research on renewable energy, nuclear power, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs.

The FY2011 request sought $2,355.5 million for EERE programs, with a reduction in funding provided in P.L. 112-10. The FY2011 request for EERE programs was $2,355.5 million, with a proposed increase of $85.6 million. However, P.L. 112-10 allocated $1,825.6 million, a reduction of $416.9 million. Additionally, DOE requested $189.5 million for EDER programs, with a proposed increase of $13.9 million, but P.L. 112-10 provided $144.7 million, a cut of $27.3 million. The DOE also sought $50 million for a new science and engineering education program called RE-ENERGYSE to address the need for a skilled clean energy workforce in the U.S. The DOE aims to educate and train Americans for green technology jobs, increase U.S. competitiveness, and develop clean energy programs at universities and community colleges. The $50 million request includes funding for higher education programs to develop professionals in the clean energy field and technical training programs at community colleges. The DOE requested $15 million for a technical training, education, and outreach subprogram to support training programs at community colleges and K-12 education activities focused on clean energy careers and sustainable practices. This funding was part of a larger $50 million request to develop professionals in the clean energy field and promote green technology jobs. The FY2010 proposal for a technical training program received mixed feedback from the Senate Committee on Appropriations. While the committee supported the goals, they expressed concerns about program duplication and lack of details. They recommended $7.5 million for a study to define education and workforce needs. The committee also sought further dialogue with the Department of Energy to clarify their role in the initiative. Ultimately, zero funding was recommended for the FY2010 RE-ENERGYSE proposal. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended zero funding for the FY2010 RE-ENERGYSE proposal and again for FY2011. The Solar Program would have received a net funding increase of $55.4 million in the FY2011 request, with a focus on Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) to accelerate deployment in the desert Southwest. The Photovoltaic (PV) R&D Program would have also received an increase of $23.5 million for full funding.

The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established in 1975 to provide an emergency source of crude oil. It consists of caverns in Louisiana and Texas with a capacity of 727 million barrels. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) stores 2 million barrels of refined home heating oil. The SPR has been filled with royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil since 2000, and the federal government has not purchased oil for the reserve since 1994. In 2000, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) started acquiring royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil instead of cash royalties. Congress ordered a suspension of RIK fill in 2008 unless oil prices dropped below $75/barrel, but fill resumed due to declining prices. The Bush Administration purchased nearly 10.7 million barrels in 2009 to replace oil sold after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. RIK fill resumed in May 2009 at 26,000 barrels per day, totaling over 6.1 million barrels by January 2010. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) resumed acquiring royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil in May 2009 to replace oil sold after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, totaling over 6.1 million barrels by January 2010. The SPR reached capacity, and the RIK Program was phased out in September 2009. Plans for expanding the SPR to 1 billion barrels were proposed but suspended in the FY2011 budget, redirecting funds to non-expansion operations and maintenance activities. The Administration proposed redirecting $71 million in previously appropriated funds for SPR expansion to support non-expansion operations and maintenance activities. This decision was based on EIA projections of declining U.S. petroleum consumption and import dependence. The FY2011 SPR budget was reduced to $138.9 million from $243.8 million in FY2010. Congress approved $11.3 million for the NHOR in FY2010, with the same amount proposed for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $209.9 million for the SPR and did not support canceling the $71 million in prior funds for the Richton, MS, SPR site expansion. The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas and is a significant federal funder of research in the physical sciences. For FY2011, DOE requested $5.121 billion for the Office of Science, with varying recommendations from different Congress bills. Ultimately, P.L. 112-10 appropriated $4,857.7 billion for the Office of Science in the 112th Congress. The House passed H.R. 1 with $4.018 billion for the Office of Science, while the Senate amendment S.Amdt. 149 proposed $4.733 billion. P.L. 112-10 allocated $4,857.7 billion for the Office of Science, with no specified program allocations. The President's Plan for Science and Innovation aims to double R&D funding over a decade.

The request for fusion energy sciences was $380 million, with a decrease in funding for ITER. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $384 million for fusion energy sciences, including $4 million more than requested for inertial fusion. Concerns were expressed about the cost and schedule of ITER and U.S. leadership in materials science for fusion. The U.S. contribution to ITER would have dropped to $80 million in FY2011 due to construction delays. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $384 million for fusion energy sciences, expressing concerns about the cost and schedule of ITER and U.S. leadership in materials science for fusion. The Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy (ARPA-E) received $179.6 million in funding in FY2011, with a mission to overcome long-term technological barriers in energy development. President Obama's FY2011 budget called for the termination of DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) to dispose of highly radioactive waste. OCRWM was developing a repository at Yucca Mountain, NV, but the Obama Administration deemed it unworkable. Funding for Yucca Mountain and OCRWM was not requested for FY2011. DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application in 2010, but it was rejected by an NRC licensing panel. The full NRC commission is now considering the withdrawal, which is opposed by states with defense-related waste. Alternatives to Yucca Mountain are being explored. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) to dispose of highly radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain, NV. The Obama Administration deemed the Yucca Mountain repository unworkable, leading to a motion to withdraw the license application in 2010. The full NRC commission is now considering the withdrawal, which is opposed by states with defense-related waste. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future is evaluating alternatives to Yucca Mountain, with a focus on temporary storage, treatment, and permanent disposal of nuclear waste. DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) has taken over waste management activities and is conducting research on disposal technologies and options. Substantial funding has been requested for NE to support the Commission's work. The DOE is responsible for leading future waste management activities, with substantial funding requested for research on nuclear waste disposal technologies. Utilities have won court cases against the DOE for failing to meet waste removal deadlines, with potential liability payments estimated at $11 billion by 2020. Congress established the DOE to address nuclear waste disposal issues. The DOE Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program, established by Congress, provides loan guarantees for energy projects using new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Estimated future government costs from defaults on guaranteed loans must be paid upfront by each project, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan guarantee amount. The FY2009 omnibus funding measure provided DOE with loan guarantee authority of $47 billion, with allocations for nuclear power, energy efficiency, renewables, coal, and other projects. The DOE has loan guarantee authority of $47 billion, with allocations for nuclear power, energy efficiency, renewables, coal, carbon capture, and uranium enrichment. President Obama's FY2011 budget requested an increase to $54.5 billion for nuclear power plants. The first preliminary nuclear loan guarantee was announced for the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia, totaling $8.33 billion for two reactors. The proposed increase in nuclear loan guarantees to $54.5 billion would cover about 13 reactors, with critics calling it a taxpayer bailout. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created a loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects, but funding has been redirected to other programs. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated funds for loan guarantees for renewable energy projects, but $2 billion was redirected to the \"cash for clunkers\" program and $1.5 billion was used for other purposes. The remaining $2.5 billion is expected to support loan guarantees totaling $25 billion. President Obama also requested $500 million for energy efficiency and renewable energy loan guarantees. The Department of Energy requested $3 billion-$5 billion for energy and energy efficiency loan guarantees, with $58 million for administrative costs. The loan guarantee authority for non-nuclear technologies was reduced to $7.3 billion, while nuclear loan guarantees remain at $18.5 billion. P.L. 112-10 provides $170 million for renewable energy and efficiency projects with no expiration date. Additional loan guarantee authority of up to $1.183 billion is available for renewable energy projects. The Department of Energy requested $3 billion-$5 billion for energy and energy efficiency loan guarantees, with $58 million for administrative costs. The loan guarantee authority for non-nuclear technologies was reduced to $7.3 billion, while nuclear loan guarantees remain at $18.5 billion. P.L. 112-10 provides $170 million for renewable energy and efficiency projects with no expiration date. An additional loan guarantee authority of up to $1.183 billion is available for renewable energy projects. The FY2009 Continuing Resolution appropriated $7.5 billion to allow DOE to issue up to $25 billion in direct loans for automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers to invest in plant capacity for vehicles with improved fuel economy. The Stockpile Stewardship Program was established in the FY1994 National Defense Authorization Act to preserve U.S. nuclear weapons competencies. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, established in the FY1994 National Defense Authorization Act, aims to preserve U.S. nuclear weapons competencies. It is operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and ensures the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, managed by the NNSA, aims to maintain the safety and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. It includes a stockpile management program to enhance weapon reliability, safety, and security, while reducing the need for nuclear testing. Activities mainly occur at the nuclear weapons complex. The stockpile management program supports the stockpile stewardship program at the nuclear weapons complex, consisting of three laboratories and four production sites managed by NNSA. The FY2011 request includes data from NNSA's Future Years Nuclear Security Program, projecting budgets and components for FY2012-FY2015. Despite Cold War reductions, Congress seeks further changes for the Complex to increase efficiency and security. Despite Cold War reductions, Congress has long desired changes to the nuclear weapons complex for increased efficiency and security. In response, NNSA submitted the \"Complex 2030\" plan in 2007, which was met with displeasure by the House Appropriations Committee in FY2008. They demanded a comprehensive nuclear defense strategy, a detailed nuclear stockpile description, and a long-term expenditure plan before considering further funding for Complex 2030 and the Reliable Replacement Warhead program. The Senate Appropriations Committee also criticized the inadequate linkage between warheads, the Complex, and strategy. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized the Department's premature deployment of the NNSA Complex 2030 consolidation effort and called for a comprehensive nuclear weapons strategy for the 21st century. NNSA announced its plan, Complex Transformation, which included reducing the weapons program footprint, closing or transferring structures, reducing weapons workers, dismantling weapons more rapidly, and building new facilities. The House Appropriations Committee emphasized the need for a modern nuclear deterrent strategy, determining the size and nature of the nuclear stockpile, and the nuclear weapons complex before considering funding for new programs or the Reliable Replacement Warhead. Key facilities like the Uranium Processing Facility, Weapons Surveillance Facility, and Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Nuclear Facility were proposed as part of the Complex Transformation plan. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended eliminating funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) and other programs in the FY2009 report. The FY2010 and FY2011 budgets did not request RRW funds, with the FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities at $7,008.8 million. The Department of Defense emphasized the need to move towards a nuclear-free world by canceling the development of RRW. The FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities was $7,008.8 million, with plans to invest $80 billion in the next decade to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex. The Department of Defense submitted its Nuclear Posture Review Report in April 2010, outlining the role of U.S. nuclear forces and plans for the nuclear arsenal. The Administration intends to maintain delivery platforms, ensure a safe and reliable nuclear weapons stockpile, and modernize the nuclear weapons complex. Projections for weapons stockpile and infrastructure costs are outlined for FY2011 to FY2019. The FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities was $7,008.8 million, with plans to invest $80 billion in the next decade to sustain and modernize the nuclear weapons complex. The projections for weapons stockpile and infrastructure costs from FY2011 to FY2020 are outlined, with a reduction proposed by the House in H.R. 1 being contentious. The Administration worked out a compromise with Senate Republicans to increase funding for Weapons Activities substantially to modernize the nuclear weapons complex and maintain nuclear weapons, as outlined in a November 2010 document and the New START resolution of ratification. The New START resolution of ratification emphasized the commitment to a robust stockpile stewardship program and modernizing nuclear weapons production capabilities. The President's FY2012 budget requested an increase in Weapons Activities funding to $7,629.7 million. The FY2011 budget for Weapons Activities was reduced to $6,946.4 million in P.L. 112-10. This program involves direct work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, including monitoring, maintenance, R&D, and dismantlement. Life Extension Programs aim to extend the life of existing warheads through component replacement. The Defense Stockpile Work (DSW) includes Life Extension Programs (LEPs) for existing warheads like B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs and ongoing work on the W76 warhead for the Trident II missile. Stockpile Systems program involves maintenance and assessment for all weapon types. Funding for these programs increased in FY2011. The FY2011 budget for the Stockpile Systems program increased significantly, with the largest increases allocated to the B61 bomb, W78 warhead, and W87 warhead. The B61 funds are divided into system sustainment and phase 6.2/6.2A study, with a focus on maintenance, inspections, and life extension studies for nuclear and non-nuclear components. The budget also includes enhancements for safety, use control features, and compatibility with modern aircraft like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for Stockpile Systems, with a focus on surveillance activities to monitor the status of nuclear weapons. A robust surveillance program is crucial for maintaining confidence in the performance of nuclear weapons. The B61 bomb has multiple variants, with a controversial study on a new variant, the B61-12, aiming to consolidate most variants into a single version. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about funding a major warhead redesign without a clearly defined nuclear weapons strategy and stockpile. The FY2010 appropriations cycle saw controversy over the consolidation of B61 variants into a single version. The House bill recommended no funds for the redesign without a clear nuclear weapons strategy. The Senate bill included the requested amount, with $92.0 million allocated for B61 stockpile systems activities. $32.5 million was designated for a study on nonnuclear components for the proposed B61-12 version. Reallocation of funds for the B61-12 upgrade study required approval from the Appropriations Committees. Two reports on the B61-12 were called for in the conference agreement. The FY2011 request focused on extending the lifespan of individual B61 variants. The FY2011 appropriations language authorized reallocation of funds for the B61-12 nonnuclear upgrade study, with notification to congressional committees. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for the study and directed NNSA to submit reports on safety features and cost-benefit analysis for refurbishing the B61. The NNSA was directed to submit a revised analysis of B61 LEP alternatives on costs and benefits. The President and Congress aim to reduce the stockpile to the lowest level consistent with national security. Warhead numbers have decreased since the Cold War, leading to a need for dismantlement and disposition. The FY2011 budget request for Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition is $58.0 million, reflecting a decrease in dismantlements and component dispositions. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $64.4 million, an increase of $6.4 million above the request. The FY2011 budget request for Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition is $58.0 million, reflecting a reduction in dismantlements and component dispositions. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $64.4 million, an increase of $6.4 million above the request, with $27.5 million allocated to help restore weapons dismantlement activities at Pantex. Components of WDD have been relocated within DOE or to different budget categories. The major activity for FY2009 was the Pit Disassembly and Conversion Facility (PDCF), which was moved to the Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities account for FY2010. The PDCF converts plutonium pits to plutonium oxide for use in a Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) for commercial nuclear reactors. The Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) converts plutonium pits to plutonium oxide for commercial nuclear reactors. The Waste Solidification Building (WSB) converts liquid wastes into solids for disposal. Stockpile Services provides production support, R&D, and logistics for the nuclear security enterprise. The FY2010 appropriation for Stockpile Services was $828.8 million. The FY2010 appropriation for Stockpile Services was $828.8 million. The FY2011 request was $941.5 million, with the largest increase for Plutonium Sustainment. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the request by $30.5 million and allocating funds for specific activities within the program. These efforts provide specialized scientific knowledge and technical support for the nuclear weapons stockpile. The Science Campaign at Pantex focuses on improving warhead performance assessment without nuclear testing, readiness for nuclear tests if needed, and maintaining scientific infrastructure. The FY2011 request for this campaign is $365.2 million, with a significant increase in Advanced Certification funding. The FY2011 request for the Science Campaign at Pantex is $365.2 million, with a notable increase in Advanced Certification funding to improve weapons certification processes and study surety mechanisms. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the request by $10.9 million, allocating funds to the Z facility at Sandia for experiments on plutonium. The Z facility in Albuquerque, NM received an additional $10.0 million for experiments on plutonium. The facility releases a large amount of energy to study materials under high temperature and pressure. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing the FY2011 appropriation for the Engineering Campaign by $8.0 million to improve nuclear weapon safety and reliability without underground testing. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing the FY2011 request for the Inertial Confinement Fusion Ignition and High Yield Campaign by $8.0 million to support capabilities for simulating a nuclear environment and conducting high energy density physics experiments. The centerpiece of this campaign is the National Ignition Facility (NIF), which aims to achieve thermonuclear burn conditions in the laboratory. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is the world's largest laser, dedicated in May 2009. Scientists successfully fired 192 laser beams at a helium-filled target, heating it to 6 million degrees Fahrenheit. The facility received $457.9 million in FY2010 and requested $481.5 million in FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported the requested amount and recommended creating an independent advisory board for NIF experiments. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for the Advanced Simulation and Computing Campaign, which develops computation-based models of nuclear weapons. Some analysts doubt the reliability of simulation for certifying the safety of warheads. The Readiness Campaign aims to improve manufacturing safety and efficiency. The FY2011 request for the campaigns was $615.7 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for the Readiness Campaign, which aims to improve manufacturing safety and efficiency. The FY2011 request for the campaign is $112.1 million, with increases for Stockpile Readiness and decreases for Tritium Readiness. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the Tritium Readiness component funding from $50.2 million to $30.2 million due to technical challenges in tritium production at the Watts Bar reactor. The program funds infrastructure and operations at Complex sites with a total FY2011 request of $1,849.0 million, including subprograms for Operations of Facilities, Program Readiness, and Material Recycle and Recovery. Facilities funding for FY2011 is $1,258.0 million, with reductions in Institutional Site Support. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended increasing funds for RTBF by $71.0 million to avoid layoffs and disruptions at Pantex and Y-12 facilities. The committee expressed concern about insufficient funds for Pantex and Y-12, stating that increased funding would prevent layoffs and schedule disruptions. They restored funding for the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center and raised issues about NNSA's use of funds for a replacement facility for the Kansas City Plant. The most costly item in Construction is the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which would replace the over 50-year-old CMR building. The House Appropriations Committee stated that proceeding with the CMRR project as currently designed would strongly prejudice any nuclear complex transformation plan. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees expressed concerns about the CMRR project at Los Alamos National Laboratory, stating that it lacks a coherent mission and adequate safety measures. Delays in funding may require continued use of the existing CMR facility. The House committee emphasized the need for critical decisions on the stockpile to determine the capacity required for facilities like CMRR and the Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $125.0 million for the CMRR project at Los Alamos National Laboratory, citing funding shortfalls and restricted capabilities at the CMR facility. Some suggest modifying Plutonium Facility 4 to fulfill CMRR's functions, arguing that CMRR's capacity is excessive. The Secure Transportation Asset program ensures safe transport of nuclear weapons and materials. The Weapons Activities program includes Secure Transportation Asset for safe transport of nuclear materials, Nuclear Counterterrorism Incident Response for global incident response, and Facilities and Infrastructure Recapitalization Program for infrastructure revitalization. Senate Appropriations Committee recommended requested funding amounts for these programs. The FY2010 and FY2011 budgets focused on restoring and revitalizing the nuclear security enterprise, with specific allocations for site stewardship and safeguards and security. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees made adjustments to the requested amounts based on budget limitations and mission priorities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the Defense Nuclear Security budget by $5.0 million, citing efficiencies in staffing levels and procurement. The FY2011 request for Defense Nuclear Security was $720.0 million, with a reduction of $38.8 million. Cyber Security aims to protect NNSA information assets. The FY2010 appropriation for Cyber Security was $122.5 million, with a request of $124.3 million for FY2011. Nonproliferation and national security programs under the National Nuclear Security Administration received $2.137 billion in FY2010, up from $1.482 billion in FY2009. The increase was mainly due to returning major construction projects to the Fissile Materials Disposition program. The Obama Administration requested a further increase for FY2011 to include another construction project. The Obama Administration requested a further increase for FY2011 to return another construction project, the Pit Disassembly plant, to the Fissile Materials Disposition program. Nonproliferation and International Security programs include international safeguards, export controls, and treaties and agreements. The FY2011 request for these programs was $155.9 million, compared with $187.2 million appropriated for FY2010. International Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting (MPC&A) was funded at $572.1 million in FY2010; the FY2011 request was $590.1 million. Elimination of Weapons-Grade Plutonium Production aims to persuade Russia to shut down nuclear reactors producing weapons-grade plutonium. Plutonium Production aims to persuade Russia to shut down nuclear reactors producing weapons-grade plutonium. Two reactors were shut down in 2008 and replaced with fossil-fueled facilities. The third reactor will be shut down in December 2010. The Fissile Materials Disposition program aims to dispose of U.S. surplus weapons plutonium by converting it into fuel for commercial power reactors. Funding for the program was controversial due to lack of progress on disposing of Russian plutonium. The Obama Administration requested $701.9 million for the program in FY2010. The Obama Administration requested $701.9 million in FY2010 for the Fissile Materials Disposition program to dispose of Russian surplus weapon-grade plutonium. The FY2011 request was $1,030.7 million to continue construction of the Savannah River project and fund research for a gas-turbine modular helium reactor in Russia. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative aims to convert research reactors to use less enriched uranium and protect nuclear materials. The FY2011 request for this program was $558.8 million. The Office of Environmental Management was established by the DOE in 1989 to consolidate the cleanup of former nuclear weapons production facilities. This includes disposal of radioactive and hazardous wastes, managing surplus nuclear materials, and decontaminating facilities. Cleanup continues at larger and more complex facilities for several years, especially where high-level radioactive wastes are stored. DOE expects cleanup to continue at larger and more complex facilities for several years, with estimated costs ranging between $192.8 billion and $247.2 billion. Additional funds may be needed for operating and maintaining cleanup remedies, monitoring contaminant levels, and ensuring the effectiveness of remedies over time. Long-term activities for permanent containment of radioactive wastes may need to be continued indefinitely at some sites. The Office of Environmental Management oversees cleanup of radioactive waste sites, with some facilities transferred to other offices or the Army Corps of Engineers. Smaller, less contaminated sites are managed by the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP), funded by the Corps. Once cleanup is complete, the Corps handles initial post-cleanup activities for two years before transferring jurisdiction back to DOE. The Office of Legacy Management manages long-term operations and maintenance at FUSRAP sites and other cleaned facilities. Funding for these offices is discussed in three appropriations accounts. Management oversees cleanup of radioactive waste sites, with some facilities transferred to other offices or the Army Corps of Engineers. Funding for the Office of Environmental Management is discussed in three appropriations accounts, with a total of $5.69 billion allocated in FY2011. The Defense Environmental Cleanup Account receives the majority of the funding. The enacted amount is lower than the President's request and the previous year's appropriation. Table 14 provides a breakdown of the FY2011 appropriations for each account. The FY2011 enacted appropriations for DOE's Office of Environmental Management included a rescission of $22.7 million in unobligated balances from previous fiscal years. Cleanup challenges at nuclear weapons production facilities like Hanford, Savannah River, and Idaho National Laboratory require significant funding. The Hanford, Savannah River, and Idaho National Laboratory sites are among the most challenging for cleanup due to decades of nuclear weapons production. These facilities require significant funding, with cleanup expected to continue for decades. High-level radioactive wastes stored at these sites pose a major challenge, with cleanup estimated to last until 2062 at Hanford, 2040 at Savannah River, and 2044 at Idaho National Laboratory. According to a DOE estimate in 2009, there are 54 million gallons of high-level wastes stored in tanks at Hanford, 33 million gallons at the Savannah River Site, and nearly 1 million gallons at the Idaho National Laboratory. The removal and treatment of these wastes for disposal face technical challenges, with delays in waste treatment facilities construction raising concerns about environmental risks. Some tanks at Hanford have leaked wastes into groundwater discharging into the Columbia River, prompting routine water quality monitoring. Funding for the cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities is also a growing concern. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to finance the cleanup of three uranium enrichment facilities in Paducah, KY; Portsmouth, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN. Congress authorized special assessments from nuclear utilities and payments from the federal government to the fund for cleanup costs. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established in 1992 to finance cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities. Congress authorized assessments from nuclear utilities and federal payments for cleanup costs. Federal payments to the fund have continued through annual appropriations, despite expiration of the authority to collect utility assessments. Concerns have been raised about the fund's balance not being sufficient for future cleanup costs. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund balance is insufficient to cover future cleanup costs. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments to increase resources for cleanup, with OMB estimating $200 million in assessments for FY2011 and $2.2 billion over 10 years. Legislation is needed for the federal government to resume collection of assessments, with bills introduced in the 111th Congress but not enacted. In the 111th Congress, bills were introduced but not enacted to reauthorize nuclear utility assessments. The Senate Appropriations Committee questioned the need for reinstatement, citing the balance of the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund. The President requested $730.5 million for cleanup in FY2011, assuming $200 million in offsetting receipts from nuclear utility assessments. P.L. 112-10 included $507.0 million in appropriations, a decrease from the President's request. Legislation to reauthorize assessments has not been enacted to generate the $200 million in receipts. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $550.0 million for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, noting the lack of legislation to generate $200 million in offsetting receipts. P.L. 112-10 allocated $33.6 million for the fund in FY2011, much less than the President's request of $496.7 million. The Senate committee aimed to fulfill the required federal contribution as authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires DOE to pay for cleanup costs of federal uranium enrichment facilities, even if the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund is depleted. Additional federal funds may be needed in the future for cleanup. Responsibility for long-term maintenance is transferred to DOE's Office of Legacy Management, funded within the Other Defense Activities Account. In FY2011, P.L. 112-10 allocated $788.4 million for the Other Defense Activities Account, with no specified amount for DOE's Office of Legacy Management. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $188.6 million for the Office of Legacy Management, which is expected to see increased funding as nuclear weapons production facilities are cleaned up and transferred for long-term operation. DOE's Power Marketing Administrations were established to sell power from dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established to sell power from dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. PMAs prioritize \"preference customers\" like municipal utilities and cooperatives, selling power at low rates. The Obama Administration's FY2011 request for PMAs was $118.5 million, a decrease of $4 million from FY2010. The budget request reclassified receipts from PMAs from mandatory to discretionary, offsetting expenses of WAPA, SWPA, and SEPA. The FY2011 budget request for Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) decreased by $4 million compared to FY2010. This change reclassified receipts from PMAs from mandatory to discretionary, offsetting expenses for WAPA, SWPA, and SEPA. SWPA requested $12.7 million and WAPA requested $105.5 million in discretionary funding. SEPA's receipts are expected to cover all operating costs in FY2011. Additionally, $220,000 was requested for Falcon and Amistad operations and maintenance, with collections of $23 million from Colorado River basins as an offset. BPA is self-funded and receives no appropriations, but funds some activities from permanent borrowing authority. The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is self-funded and receives no appropriations. It funds activities through permanent borrowing authority, which was increased to $4.45 billion in FY2003. The FY2011 budget proposed expenditures for operating expenses, projects funded in advance, capital investments, and capital transfers. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) provided additional borrowing authority for BPA under the Transmission System Act. ARRA also allocated $10 million in non-reimbursable appropriations to Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) for activities authorized in section 402 of the act. The ARRA provided WAPA with borrowing authority for new transmission lines to deliver renewable energy resources. The borrowing limit is $3.25 billion, available indefinitely. Other agencies funded by the Energy and Water Development bill include the NRC, ARC, and Denali Commission. The NRC requested $1.053 billion for FY2011, with major activities in safety regulation and licensing of nuclear reactors. The NRC budget under P.L. 112-10 is $1.052.3 billion. The NRC budget for FY2011 is $1.052.3 billion, including $272.5 million for new reactor activities. Applications for new nuclear power plant licenses have increased due to factors like volatile fossil fuel prices and incentives from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The proposed budget also includes $10 million for licensing DOE's Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which the Obama Administration wants to cancel. The NRC's FY2011 budget includes $10 million for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which the Obama Administration wants to cancel. The budget also covers costs for adjudicating the license withdrawal motion and activities related to an orderly closure of Yucca Mountain licensing support. Additionally, the budget request includes funding for regulation of operating reactors, reactor safety inspections, license renewals, security oversight, and an increase in homeland security spending. Homeland security spending in NRC to increase by $3.8 million in FY2011, reaching $26.1 million. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by fees on licensees. Expenditures from the Nuclear Waste Fund for waste repository licensing and general homeland security are not subject to the offset. The FY2011 request includes offsets resulting in a net appropriation of $138.3 million, a $16.4 million decrease from FY2010. P.L. 112-10 provides for a net appropriation of $138.1 million, including the inspector general's office."
