    "content": "The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides federal funding to states for education of children with disabilities, requiring a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) for all. Prior to P.L. 105-17 in 1997, states had to ensure participation of disabled children in private schools, leading to varying interpretations and court decisions. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 replaced the \"equitable participation\" standard with a requirement for provision of special education and related services to children with disabilities in private schools. This change aimed to ensure equal access to services for all children with disabilities, regardless of the type of school they attended. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 replaced the \"equitable participation\" standard with a requirement for providing special education and related services to children with disabilities in private schools. These services were to be funded proportionately with federal funds under Part B of IDEA, including services on the premises of private schools. The 2004 reauthorization further clarified the responsibilities of local educational agencies to ensure fair and equitable services for these children. The 2004 reauthorization clarified the responsibilities of LEAs to ensure fair and equitable services for children with disabilities in private schools, with costs covered by the LEA if placed by them or the SEA. IDEA requires some services for children in private schools, even if unilaterally placed by parents. The 2004 reauthorization clarified that LEAs are responsible for providing services to children with disabilities in private schools, with costs covered by the LEA if placed by them or the SEA. IDEA mandates services for children in private schools, even if placed there unilaterally by parents. The 2004 reauthorization clarified that LEAs are responsible for providing services to parentally placed children in private schools within their school district. This provision aims to protect LEAs from having to work with private schools located in multiple jurisdictions. However, it has sparked controversy due to issues such as disproportional effects on LEAs with large concentrations of private schools and potential conflicts with state laws. The funding formula under part B of IDEA requires LEAs to expend funds equal to a proportionate amount for services to parentally placed private school children, including direct services. The 2004 reauthorization clarified that LEAs must provide services to parentally placed children in private schools within their district. The new provision emphasizes direct services over indirect services, such as professional development. LEAs must conduct a thorough child find process after consulting with private school representatives to determine the number of children with disabilities. Services can still be provided on the premises of private, including religious schools. The final regulations discuss the proportionate share calculation for services provided to children in private, including religious schools. The new law requires that state and local funds supplement, not supplant, federal funds for children with disabilities. Each LEA must maintain records of children evaluated, determined to have disabilities, and served under private school provisions. The child find requirement remains the same as previous law. The child find requirement for children with disabilities in private schools, including religious schools, remains the same as previous law. New provisions in P.L. 108-446 address equitable participation, activities, cost, and completion period. Child find activities must ensure the accurate count and equitable participation of parentally placed private school children with disabilities. The cost of child find activities cannot be used to meet the LEA's spending obligation. Consultation with private school officials and parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities is required, including in the child find process. The child find process for parentally placed private school children with disabilities must be completed within a timeframe comparable to students in public schools. P.L. 108-446 adds requirements for LEA consultation with private school officials and parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities. This includes discussions on child find process, federal funds allocation, consultation process, provision of special education services, and written explanations for decisions. The new law (P.L. 108-446) adds requirements for LEA consultation with private school officials regarding the provision of special education services. This includes discussions on federal funds allocation, apportioning services in case of insufficient funds, written explanations for decisions, and compliance procedures for private school officials to submit complaints to the SEA. The new law (P.L. 108-446) requires private school officials to submit complaints to the SEA if they believe the LEA did not consult properly. If dissatisfied, they can appeal to the Secretary of Education. Equitable services must be secular, neutral, and nonideological, with funds controlled by a public agency. The new law (P.L. 108-446) requires private school officials to submit complaints to the SEA if they believe the LEA did not consult properly. Equitable services must be secular, neutral, and nonideological, with funds controlled by a public agency. When a child with a disability is unilaterally placed in a private school, the cost of the placement is not paid by the LEA unless certain findings are made by a hearing officer or court. Reimbursement may be reduced or denied if parents did not give notice, but exceptions exist in cases where the school prevented notice, parents were unaware of the requirement, or compliance would likely harm the child. The new law (P.L. 108-446) allows reimbursement not to be reduced or denied if a parent is illiterate or compliance would result in serious emotional harm to the child. The issue of private school reimbursement for parents of a child with a disability, even if the student never received special education services from the school district, was addressed in a recent Supreme Court decision. The Supreme Court decision on private school reimbursement for parents of a child with a disability, even if the student never received special education services from the school district, was upheld by a 4-4 ruling. The issue is not settled as the decision does not set a precedent for lower courts."
