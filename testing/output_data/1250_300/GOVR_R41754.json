    "content": "The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill appropriating funds for the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development for FY2013. The bill recommends $3.210 billion for activities funded under the Community Development Fund account, including the Community Development Block Grant Program. The President's budget proposal for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for the Community Development Fund account, supporting neighborhood revitalization and economic development activities. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development. Grants are allocated to entitlement communities, states, and insular areas. The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2013 includes $3.143 billion for HUD's Community Development Fund. This represents 8.9% of the total discretionary budget authority requested by the agency for FY2013. The budget proposal would increase funding for Community Development Fund activities by 4.5% or $135 million. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposal for HUD includes $135 million increase in funding for the Community Development Fund (CDF) account. This increase would be achieved by reinstating funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) and transferring funding for Section 4 capacity building activities. The budget request also includes $100 million for the SCI and transfers funding for the Section 4 program from another HUD account to the CDF account. Funding for the CDBG formula grants would remain unchanged from FY2012 levels. The Administration's FY2013 budget proposal includes $2.948.1 billion for the CDBG formula component of the CDF account, with $2.059 billion for CDBG entitlement communities, $882 million for CDBG state administered program, and $7 million for insular areas. Additionally, $60 million is requested for Indian tribes, and $100 million for the SCI program activities. The SCI program is requesting an appropriation of $100 million to support three components: Regional Integrated Planning Grants, Community Challenge Grants, and Housing-Transportation Integration Research. Funds would be used for various planning efforts in collaboration with federal agencies. $8 million is allocated for a joint HUD, DOT, and EPA research initiative to evaluate benefits of regional planning grants. $3 million is requested for technical support in developing energy modeling systems and standards for energy efficiency improvements. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and communities to attract private capital using their CDBG allocation as collateral. The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and communities to collateralize their annual CDBG allocation to attract private capital for economic development, housing, and infrastructure projects. Communities can borrow up to five times their allocation for 20 years through bond issuance, with funds used to support job creation and meet CDBG program goals. The program's loan commitment ceiling is proposed to double from $240 million to $500 million in FY2013. The Administration's budget proposes doubling the CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program's loan commitment ceiling from $240 million to $500 million in FY2013 to help local governments finance job creation activities. The program will charge a fee-based assessment to borrowers, eliminating the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3.210 billion for CDF activities in FY2013, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants. The bill recommends $3.210 billion for CDF activities in FY2013, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants. It supports the Administration's funding request for Indian tribes and restores funding for SCI activities, with an appropriation of $50 million. Additionally, the bill calls for the conversion of Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program and increasing the loan guarantee commitment to $500 million for FY2013. The Senate committee bill recommends continued funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million but does not support transferring the program from its current account. The House Appropriations Committee reported a bill recommending $3.404 billion for CDF activities, including $3.344 billion for CDBG formula grants. H.R. 5972 supports the Administration's $60 million funding request for Indian tribes. H.R. 5972 recommends funding for Indian tribes, excludes set-aside for CDBG funds for SCI activities, and supports loan subsidies for Section 108 loan guarantees. It also recommends continued funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million. H.R. 5972 recommends funding for Indian tribes, excludes set-aside for CDBG funds for SCI activities, and supports loan subsidies for Section 108 loan guarantees. It also recommends continued funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million. The full House began floor consideration of the bill on June 27, 2012, with several unsuccessful amendments introduced to reduce or eliminate funding for CDBG and Section 108 loan guarantee programs. In June 2012, the House considered funding recommendations for Indian tribes, with unsuccessful amendments to reduce or eliminate funding for CDBG and Section 108 loan guarantee programs. Amendments to eliminate funding for the CDF and Section 108 loan guarantee program were also defeated. Congress debated reducing federal spending while focusing on funding activities supporting job creation to address high unemployment and a struggling economy. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account in the FY2012 budget, reducing funding for CDBG formula grants, eliminating NI and EDI programs, and converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program. Supporters defended CDBG for its role in economic development and job creation. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account in the FY2012 budget, reducing funding for CDBG formula grants, eliminating NI and EDI programs, and converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program. The proposed funding level for CDF programs was $3.804 billion, representing a 14.5% reduction from FY2010 enacted appropriations but an 8.6% increase from FY2011. Additionally, the Administration requested an 11.5% increase in funding for CDBG states and entitlement communities, along with specific funding for insular areas, Indian tribes, Rural Innovation Grants, and Guam. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposed $25 million for Rural Innovation Grants and $23 million for Guam to address community development needs. Funding for Economic Development Initiatives and Neighborhood Initiatives grants was not included, as the Administration opposed earmarking these funds. Additionally, the budget recommended transferring SCI programs to a new stand-alone account with an appropriation of $150 million to support Regional Integrated Planning Grants. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposed $150 million for SCI programs, including Regional Integrated Planning Grants, Community Challenge Grants, and Housing-Transportation Integration Research. The budget also proposed doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling to $500 million to help local governments finance job creation activities. The Administration proposed increasing the loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2012 to assist local governments in financing job creation activities. Congress rejected the proposal and maintained the status quo for CDF appropriations in FY2012. The draft bill recommended $3.501 billion for CDF activities, with $3.466 billion for CDBG formula grants to states and local governments, and $35 million for Indian tribes. The bill aimed to maintain overall CDF appropriations at the FY2011 funding level, but there were recommendations to eliminate the program as it was not considered a core federal government function. The draft bill also suggested that states and local communities should use more of their own taxes for community development activities to increase transparency and accountability. Funding priorities would shift, including eliminating funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and reducing funding for CDBG Indian Tribes. The subcommittee draft bill recommended shifting CDF funding priorities by eliminating funding for the Administration's Sustainable Communities Initiative and reducing funding for CDBG Indian Tribes from $64 million to $35 million. It also rejected the proposal to restructure Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program, maintaining the current structure with $6.8 million in credit subsidies. Additionally, the bill included a provision to lower the ceiling on the percentage of funds grantees could use for CDBG administrative expenses from 20% to 10%. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a substantial reduction in CDF funding, with overall funding declining to $3.0 billion. The bill proposed $2.851 billion for CDBG formula funding, a 13.7% reduction from FY2011 levels. Additionally, $90 million was recommended for the Sustainable Communities Initiative, $60 million less than requested. The Senate approved a Minibus bill on November 1, 2011, which included an amendment by Senator Coburn to prohibit the use of grants for repaying federal loans, impacting the CDBG program and Section 108 loan guarantee program. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows CDBG funds to secure and repay Section 108 loan guarantees in case of default. States and communities use CDBG funds to cover revenue shortfalls for bond repayments. The House and Senate reconciled differences in H.R. 2112 through a conference report, leading to the approval of P.L. 112-55 on November 18, 2011, which appropriated $3.308 billion for CDF activities, including $300 million for CDBG disaster activities. The act allocated $60 million for Indian Tribes and $2.948 billion for formula grants to states, entitlement communities, and insular areas, a 10.7% decrease from FY2011. The $2.948 billion for CDBG formula grants in FY2012 is 10.7% less than FY2011, 19.6% less than the President's request, and 15% less than the House recommendation. Other CDF activities like the Sustainable Communities Initiative were not funded directly, but could be carried out using CDBG and Transformation Initiative funds. The decrease in CDBG funding reflects efforts to reduce federal spending for deficit reduction. P.L. 112-55 did not include provisions to prohibit the use of federal grants for repaying other federal loans. The Senate version of H.R. 2112 included a provision to prohibit the use of federal grants like CDBGs to repay other federal loans. The House recommended reducing the percentage of CDBG funds for administrative expenses from 20% to 10%. The act directed the GAO to study the effectiveness of CDBG and HOME programs within 180 days. HUD was required to submit a progress report on grantee accountability within 120 days. The act also mandated an analysis of how CDBG funds are used for matching fund requirements of other federal programs. The conference report directed HUD to analyze the use of CDBG funds for matching fund requirements of other federal programs. The Administration's proposal to convert Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program was not supported for the third year. P.L. 112-55 maintained the program's structure and appropriated $5.952 million in credit subsidies for $240 million in loan guarantee commitments. Additionally, $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance was included for recovery efforts in areas declared disasters in 2011. The CDBG supplemental disaster assistance provided funds to states and local governments for recovery efforts in areas declared disasters in 2011. Funds were to be used for disaster relief and long-term recovery plans, excluding activities funded by FEMA or the Army Corps of Engineers. Eligible recipients had to submit a recovery plan detailing fund usage. HUD could waive certain CDBG fund provisions, except for fair housing, nondiscrimination, labor standards, and environmental review. $400 million was appropriated for disaster relief, with $100 million exempted. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011 signed into law included a provision appropriating $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF). This amount was reduced to $3.501 billion, approximately 16% lower than the previous year's appropriation. The House-passed H.R. 1 bill aimed to reduce funding for HUD's Community Development Fund, including the CDBG program, by $61 billion below the Obama Administration's request. This was part of congressional efforts to cut the federal budget deficit, with the CDF account's total appropriation reduced to $3.501 billion, 16% lower than the previous year. The House-passed H.R. 1 bill aimed to cut funding for discretionary programs by $61 billion, including the CDF account which houses the CDBG program. After failed Senate approval, negotiations led to the passing of P.L. 112-10, allocating $3.508 billion for CDF activities, with $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. P.L. 112-10 appropriated $3.508 billion for CDF activities, including $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. The act included a 0.2% mandatory across the board rescission and a 1% discretionary transfer to HUD's Transformation Initiative. This reduced the CDF account by $7 million to $3.501 billion and transferred $35 million to the Transformation Initiative. The CDF account for FY2010 received $3.501 billion, which is 21.3% less than the previous year's funding. The FY2011 appropriation is 20.1% less than the Administration's request but 133% higher than recommended by H.R. 1. The CDF account includes the CDBG program, with reduced funding for formula grants by 16.4%. Additionally, funds are allocated for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to support regional land use, housing, environmental, and transportation efforts. P.L. 112-10 reduced funding for CDBG formula grants by 16.4% and for SCI activities by 33%. H.R. 1 proposed a 66.3% reduction in CDF account funding and prohibited funds for earmarks and SCI. Allocation instructions for CDBG program components were not included. The House-passed version of H.R. 1 proposed a reduction in CDF account funding and prohibited earmarks and SCI funding. Senator Inouye's amendment to H.R. 1 included $4.230 billion for CDF activities, with $3.990 billion allocated to the CDBG program. The amendment aimed to freeze CDBG formula grant funds at the FY2010 level for states and entitlement communities, while providing $7 million for insular areas and $40 million for Indian tribes. The Senate bill proposed freezing CDBG formula grant funds at the FY2010 level, with $3.943 billion allocated to states and entitlement communities, $7 million for insular areas, and $40 million for Indian tribes. Funding for formula-based components of the CDBG program decreased from $3.943 billion in FY2010 to $2.942 billion in FY2012, resulting in a 29.1% reduction in average grant amount for entitlement communities. The average grant amount for entitlement communities declined from $2.4 million in FY2010 to $1.7 million in FY2012, a 29.1% reduction. This decrease is due to lower appropriations and an increase in qualifying communities. The average state allocation also decreased by 25.4% during the same period. The proposed funding reduction in H.R. 1 would have significantly impacted long-term community and economic development plans. The proposed funding reduction in H.R. 1 would have impacted community and economic development plans, forcing states and local governments to postpone or terminate activities supporting job creation and public services. This reduction would also affect non-profit organizations managing CDBG-funded services for low and moderate-income households. The FY2012 appropriations for the CDBG program are the lowest in over a decade, leading to delays in projects and reduced support for entitlement communities. The FY2012 appropriations for the CDBG program are the lowest in over a decade, resulting in delays in projects and reduced support for entitlement communities. Funding reductions have impacted community and economic development plans, forcing states and local governments to postpone or terminate activities supporting job creation and public services. This reduction also affects non-profit organizations managing CDBG-funded services for low and moderate-income households. The FY2012 CDBG allocations decreased by 25.1% below FY2011 levels for states and entitlement communities. 70% of CDBG funds go to entitlement communities, with the remaining 30% allocated to states and Puerto Rico for nonentitlement communities. Funds are distributed using two formulas based on population factors for metropolitan cities and urban counties. Formula A, from the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, allocates funds based on population, poverty, and overcrowded housing factors for metropolitan cities and urban counties. Formula B, from the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1977, allocates funds based on population growth lag, poverty, and housing built before 1940 factors for the same areas. The distribution of CDBG funds to states is governed by a two formula system based on population, poverty, and housing factors. HUD uses Census Bureau data for allocations starting from FY2012. HUD will use Census Bureau data from the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS) five-year estimates for CDBG fund allocations starting from FY2012. This allows for more accurate reflection of demographic changes annually. Prior to FY2012, HUD used the 2000 Decennial Census for data sources. HUD released a study on the impacts of the introduction of 2010 Census and ACS data on the allocation of CDBG formula grant funds. The study assumed constant eligible entities and appropriations from FY2011 to FY2012 to isolate the impact of the new data sources. Findings show that communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific/Hawaii regions experienced declines in CDBG allocations, while those in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions saw increases. Entitlement communities in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions would see an increase in their CDBG allocations. New data sources result in principal cities and urban counties receiving a greater share of funds, while funding for other entitlement cities would decline. States like New Mexico and Puerto Rico experience the largest decline in funding due to changes in poverty and housing conditions. The report can be found at http://www.huduser.org/publications/pdf/cdbg_redis_eff.pdf. Appendix 2 of the report compares funding allocations for 1,166 entitlement communities in FY2011. It reviews the funding history of the CDF account from FY2000 to FY2011, discussing CDBG formula grants, set-asides, and supplemental appropriations. Total appropriations for the CDF account fluctuated between $3.772 billion and $5.112 billion from FY2000 to 2010. FY2011 saw the lowest appropriations in over a decade, with debates focusing on increasing funding for the CDBG-formula component. Supporters argue that appropriations have declined in both current and constant dollars. The funding level for the CDBG-formula component of the CDF account has been a topic of debate. Supporters argue for increased funding due to declining appropriations and increased entitlement communities. Critics question the justification for increased funding based on program performance and the need to reduce domestic discretionary spending. Data shows a decline in average grant amounts allocated to CDBG entitlement communities from FY2000 to FY2010. The average grant amount allocated to CDBG entitlement communities declined by 26.7% from FY2000 to FY2010, but has been increasing since FY2008. The FY2011 estimated average allocation is 34.5% less than in FY2000, due to fewer dollars appropriated and an increase in the number of entitlement communities. The number of jurisdictions receiving a direct allocation increased by 155 from FY2000 to FY2011. The number of jurisdictions receiving CDBG entitlement community allocations increased by 155 from FY2000 to FY2011. The average state allocation fluctuated, reaching a high of $25.5 million in FY2002, dropping to $21.1 million in FY2008, and then rebounding to $23.2 million in FY2010. However, the FY2011 average state allocation decreased to $19.1 million. Inflation-adjusted constant dollars show a 40% decline in program funding from $4.235 billion in FY2000 to $2.545 billion in FY2011. Appropriations for CDBG formula grants varied between $3.5 billion and $4.3 billion. Program funding for the CDBG formula grants declined by 40% in inflation-adjusted dollars from $4.235 billion in FY2000 to $2.545 billion in FY2011. The CDF account includes various programs with smaller appropriations, some of which have fluctuated significantly from FY2000 to FY2011. Earmarks for specific activities or projects have been a point of contention, with appropriations for set-aside programs varying over the years. From FY2000 to FY2011, funding for set-aside programs in the CDF account fluctuated significantly, with Congress appropriating varying amounts each year. The appropriations for CDF set-asides ranged from $647 million in FY2001 to $61 million in FY2007. In FY2010, $509 million was allocated, with a focus on earmarked accounts like the Economic Development Initiative (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiative (NI). However, funding for these earmarked accounts was eliminated in FY2011. Congress made decisions to move categorical grant programs in and out of the CDF account, leading to the fluctuation in funding amounts. Funding for set-aside programs in the CDF account fluctuated significantly from FY2000 to FY2011. Congress appropriated varying amounts each year, with a focus on earmarked accounts like the Economic Development Initiative (EDI) and Neighborhood Initiative (NI). Earmarked projects funded by these programs were dominant in CDBG-related set aside appropriations, except in FY2007 and FY2011 when there were no earmarks. The issue of earmarks has been a source of debate in recent Congresses, leading to new rules governing disclosure of earmark requests since FY2007. In FY2007, Congress removed all earmarks from the CDF account and instituted new rules for disclosure. Earmarks for EDI and NI were included in subsequent legislation for CDF activities in FY2008 and FY2009. These earmarks were dominant in CDBG-linked set-aside programs. However, in FY2011, Congress did not fund NI and EDI earmarks. Congress has used the CDBG program's framework for supplemental appropriations for disaster relief and mitigation efforts. The CDBG program has been used for disaster relief and mitigation efforts, including assisting with events like 9/11 and the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005, reducing abandoned properties due to the mortgage foreclosure crisis, and supporting job creation in response to the economic recession. Funding is allocated based on specific criteria, with Congress deciding on supplemental funds for disaster areas. Funds allocated to disaster areas by Congress are based on specific criteria, with a minimum grant amount established for each state. States are required to distribute a portion of these funds to local governments experiencing high rates of mortgage foreclosures, subprime loans, and delinquencies. Direct allocation of funds is limited to communities meeting certain thresholds, resulting in 309 communities qualifying for NSP-1 funds and 268 for NSP-3 funds. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) allocated funds based on specific criteria, with a minimum threshold of $2 million for NSP-1 and $1 million for NSP-3 funds. 309 communities qualified for NSP-1 funds and 268 for NSP-3 funds. NSP-2 funds were awarded competitively to various entities. A bill was introduced to rescind $1 billion in NSP-3 funds, leading to hearings and discussions in the House Financial Services Committee. During the House Financial Services Committee markup of H.R. 861 on March 9, 2011, an amendment was approved requiring HUD to publish a notice of termination of the NSP program on its website within five days of the bill's enactment. Representative Miller criticized the NSP program as ineffective and a waste of taxpayers' dollars, arguing for rescinding funding for NSP-3. Other Members defended the program's success in combating the negative impacts of the mortgage foreclosure crisis on communities. During a hearing on March 2, 2011, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, Mercedes M. M\u00e1rquez, testified that the NSP program is expected to impact 100,000 properties in the nation's hardest-hit markets, with 36,000 units already under construction. The program is estimated to support more than 93,000 jobs nationwide. Members argued that NSP helps reduce the supply of abandoned, blighted, and foreclosed housing stock. The measure passed the House on March 16, 2011, by a vote of 242 to 182, but a companion bill has not been introduced in the Senate."
