The \"Alien Terrorist Removal Act of 1995\" defines key terms and procedures for the removal of alien terrorists, including the use of classified information and special removal hearings. The Attorney General must certify the presence of an alien terrorist in the US for deportation. The Alien Terrorist Removal Act of 1995 requires approval from the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General for proceedings involving alien terrorists present in the US. Removal through deportation proceedings may pose a national security risk due to classified information disclosure. A Special Court with designated judges handles cases under this section, following procedures similar to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Attorney General initiates the special court procedure. The Alien Terrorist Removal Act of 1995 requires approval from designated judges for proceedings involving alien terrorists. A single judge of the special court considers the application in camera and ex parte if there is probable cause to believe in the immediate threat of death or serious bodily harm. Special removal hearings are conducted following specific procedures. The Alien Terrorist Removal Act of 1995 mandates special removal hearings for alien terrorists if there is an immediate threat of death or serious bodily harm. These hearings are open to the public, allow the alien to be present and have legal representation, introduce evidence, and cross-examine witnesses. The judge can authorize the introduction of evidence in camera and ex parte. The judge can authorize the introduction of evidence in camera and ex parte to protect national security by withholding classified information. The alien may receive a summary of the evidence or a statement admitting relevant facts if disclosure poses a risk of harm. If the judge determines that substituted evidence provides the alien with the ability to defend themselves or that disclosure of such evidence would pose a risk of harm, deportation may be decided. The judge, based on the evidence, can order deportation if necessary. The judge can order deportation if the Attorney General proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the alien is subject to deportation as described in section 241(a)(4)(B). Appeals can be made to the court of appeals for the Federal Circuit within twenty days of the determination. The Attorney General can appeal a determination under subsections (d), (e), or (f) to the court of appeals for the Federal Circuit by filing a notice of appeal within twenty days. The entire record of the proceeding can be transmitted to the court of appeals under seal upon request, and the court will consider the appeal in camera and ex parte."
