    "content": "The United States has historically been a major provider of food aid globally, but funding for agricultural development has decreased over the years. President Obama made alleviating global hunger a top priority, leading to the launch of the Feed the Future initiative in 2010 with a $3.5 billion pledge over three years. The initiative aims to promote agricultural development, increase food production, and improve food security and nutrition, especially for vulnerable populations. The Feed the Future initiative was launched in May 2010 to promote global agricultural development, increase food production, and improve food security and nutrition, especially for vulnerable populations. There is a call for reform in American food aid and foreign assistance, with a focus on innovative approaches and increased engagement from local populations and the private sector. Congressional discussions on development and foreign assistance policies will be influenced by these events. The interagency review processes of development and foreign assistance policies and programs are relevant to Congress as it discusses the U.S. global food security initiative. Congress plays a central role in funding and oversight of agricultural development programs administered by various U.S. agencies and international organizations. The 112th Congress may consider legislation to authorize and fund aspects of the food security initiative, building on similar efforts in the 111th Congress. The 112th Congress may consider legislation to authorize and fund aspects of the food security initiative, building on similar efforts in the 111th Congress. The primary objectives of this report are to provide a context for the state of food insecurity in the world, overview the Obama Administration's global hunger and food security initiative, and highlight issues the 112th Congress may consider regarding agricultural development and global food security. The 112th Congress may consider legislation related to agricultural development and global food security. The number of food-insecure people worldwide reached historic levels in 2009, with over 1 billion undernourished. The current estimate for chronic hunger in 2010 is 925 million, down from 1.023 billion in 2009. The number of undernourished people had been slowly increasing for the past decade, with a decline in the 1980s and early 1990s attributed to increased investment in agriculture. The number of hungry people increased in all regions except Latin America and the Caribbean between 1995-1997 and 2004-2006, as official development assistance for agriculture declined. Gains in hunger reduction were later reversed due to food and economic crises. The proportion of hungry people in the world dropped from about 20% in the early 1990s to about 16% in the mid-2000s, but rose a percentage point in 2008. Progress in meeting Millennium Development Goals of reducing hunger has slowed or reversed. The number of hungry people rose in 2008, leading to a slowdown in meeting the Millennium Development Goals. The majority of undernourished individuals are in developing countries, with Asia and the Pacific having the highest number. Sub-Saharan Africa still faces high rates of food insecurity, with two-thirds of the world's undernourished living in seven countries. The 2010 Global Health Index (GHI) shows improvements in food insecurity rates, with significant progress in Southeast Asia and Latin America. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest GHI scores, but South Asia has made more progress since 1990. The causes of hunger differ between regions, with factors like low nutritional and educational status of women contributing in South Asia. According to the Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the causes of hunger in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa differ. In South Asia, low nutritional and educational status of women contribute to high prevalence of underweight children, while in sub-Saharan Africa, factors like low government effectiveness, conflict, and high rates of HIV/AIDS lead to high child mortality. Progress in reducing GHI scores has been slower in these regions compared to Latin America, with only a third of countries making modest progress and nine countries experiencing an increase in GHI scores, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. According to IFPRI, some countries made modest progress in reducing their GHI scores, while others saw an increase, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. Factors such as conflict, political instability, high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, and economic collapse have contributed to increased hunger in certain countries. Some countries, including Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Vietnam, achieved significant improvements in their GHI scores between 1990 and 2010. Between 1990 and 2010, Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Vietnam showed significant improvements in their Global Hunger Index (GHI) scores. President Obama prioritized alleviating global hunger, pledging $3.5 billion over three years for agricultural development and food security at the G8 Summit in 2009. The Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security was launched with a goal of mobilizing $20 billion to combat hunger and poverty. The G8 summit established a goal of mobilizing $20 billion over three years to finance a food security initiative. They committed to five principles including supporting comprehensive strategies, investment through country-owned plans, and improving coordination among donors. The focus is on promoting sustainable production, productivity, and rural economic growth, along with social protection mechanisms for the most vulnerable. Leaders pledged sustainable funding to enhance world production capacity and reverse the trend of decreasing official development assistance for agriculture. Leaders pledged to provide sustainable, predictable, flexible funding to enhance world production capacity and reverse the trend of decreasing official development assistance for agriculture. The initiative aims to support country and regional agricultural strategies through country-led coordination processes, in line with the Accra Agenda for Action. Developing countries commit to taking control of their futures, donors pledge better coordination, and both parties agree to be mutually accountable. In sub-Saharan Africa, the G8 supports the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) to target resources to country priorities. The G8 supports the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) in sub-Saharan Africa to target resources to country priorities. CAADP aims to improve food security, nutrition, and increase incomes of smallholder farmers by raising agricultural productivity and increasing public investment in agriculture. The L'Aqulia declaration also leverages the Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) of the U.N. High Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis to address immediate and longer-term global food and nutrition security challenges. The CFA proposed actions to address the global food price challenge, focusing on immediate needs of vulnerable populations and longer-term food security. This included enhancing emergency food assistance, boosting smallholder farmer food production, adjusting trade policies, and developing an international biofuels consensus. The G20 Summit endorsed the L'Aquila food security initiative and called for the establishment of a World Bank Food Security Trust Fund to finance investments in agricultural productivity in low-income countries. At the G20 Summit, countries pledged to support the Global Partnership with an additional $2 billion, bringing the total to $22 billion. The United States collaborated with private sector actors for food security efforts. FAO convened a World Summit on Food Security in Rome, where leaders endorsed the Global Partnership and renewed commitments to reduce hunger by half by 2015. Agricultural output would need to increase by 70% to feed the growing population. The U.S. State Department issued a Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative (GHFSI) Consultation Document outlining priorities and strategies for addressing global food security. The initiative was officially launched in May 2010 as the \"Feed the Future\" (FtF) Initiative, with a new guiding strategy document and implementation plans developed through a consultative process involving various stakeholders. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative was developed through a consultative process with global stakeholders, focusing on sustainable food security principles. It aims to accelerate inclusive agriculture sector growth and improve nutritional status in specific countries by enhancing agricultural productivity, expanding markets, and promoting policies for smallholder farmers. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative aims to enhance agricultural productivity, expand markets, and promote policies for smallholder farmers. It focuses on developing country-owned plans to improve agricultural production and income levels for men and women farmers. Additionally, FtF works to strengthen links between agriculture and nutrition outcomes by coordinating with governments and development partners to implement nutrition strategies tailored to each country's needs. Progress in nutrition will be measured by changes in child stunting and wasting rates, as well as women's underweight prevalence. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative focuses on implementing country-specific nutrition strategies to improve nutrition outcomes, measured by changes in child stunting, wasting, and women's underweight prevalence. The initiative also includes investments in regional programs, partnerships with countries like Brazil, India, and China, and global research and innovation. FtF does not include traditional U.S. food aid funding but maintains a commitment to providing emergency food assistance. Currently, FtF is targeting 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean based on criteria such as chronic hunger, agricultural-led growth potential, and opportunities for development. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative targets countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean based on criteria like chronic hunger, agricultural-led growth potential, and government commitment. Investments are divided into Phase 1 for developing country investment plans and Phase 2 for countries with completed plans outlining priorities, financial needs, targets, and beneficiary analysis. Phase 2 countries under the Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative should have completed a Country Investment Plan (CIP) with clear priorities, costing, financial projections, targets, beneficiary analysis, and gender assessment. They must also commit their own resources and establish a policy environment conducive to agricultural development and improved nutrition. The FY2011 budget request for FtF activities is $1.64 billion, representing about 3% of the total international affairs budget. The FY2011 budget request for Feed the Future (FtF) activities is $1.64 billion, which is about 3% of the total international affairs budget. The request includes $200 million for nutrition activities funded through the Global Health and Child Survival account. Additionally, there is a $408 million request for contribution to a newly created multilateral trust fund for global food security at the World Bank. The FY2011 request is 40% greater than the estimated FY2010 allocation for similar activities. The FY2011 budget request for Feed the Future (FtF) is $1.64 billion, representing 3% of the total international affairs budget. The request includes funding for nutrition activities and a contribution to a multilateral trust fund for global food security at the World Bank. The Administration is also requesting $4.2 billion for humanitarian and emergency assistance, including food aid, refugee assistance, and disaster assistance. Discussions during the 111th Congress focused on reforming U.S. foreign aid capabilities to address national security challenges and development needs. The Obama Administration launched the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) in response to criticisms of U.S. aid programs. Led by the State Department, the QDDR aimed to reform U.S. development policy and address national security challenges. Despite delays, Secretary Clinton released the findings in December 2010. The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) was led by the Secretary of State and Deputy Secretary for Management and Resources, with the Administrator of USAID and State Department's Director of Policy Planning as co-chairs. Despite delays, Secretary Clinton released the findings in December 2010, outlining a strategy document titled \"Leading Through Civilian Power\" to elevate American \"civilian power\" for better national interests and partnership with the military. The QDDR developed U.S. foreign policy and development objectives, recommended strategies, tools, resources, and organizational reforms. Additionally, a Presidential Study Directive on Global Development Policy (PSD-7) was launched in August 2009 to review the roles and advantages of U.S. government agencies in global development. The PSD-7, launched in August 2009, authorized a U.S. government-wide review of global development policy to enhance effectiveness. Led by key officials, including the President's National Security Advisor, the review prioritizes economic growth and democratic governance in U.S. foreign policy. The draft of PSD-7 titled \"A New Way Forward on Global Development\" aims to elevate development as a key pillar of U.S. foreign policy, generating enthusiasm in the development community. The QDDR is expected to complement the PSD by contributing to its objectives. The PSD-7 process, aimed at elevating development as a key pillar of U.S. foreign policy, has been delayed. President Obama's Global Development Policy Directive emphasizes the importance of development, diplomacy, and defense working together for national security. Global Food Security, Climate Change, and Global Health are highlighted in the directive. Global Food Security is a key development initiative highlighted in the President's Policy Directive, along with Climate Change and Global Health. The directive calls for interagency coordination to implement the directive, including the establishment of a new Bureau for Food Security at USAID. This bureau will lead efforts to implement the Feed the Future initiative and coordinate with other agencies, private sector, and NGOs. The 112th Congress may face policy decisions on agricultural development, global food security, and foreign aid reform. The 112th Congress may face policy decisions on agricultural development, global food security, and foreign aid reform. Congress is currently considering FY2011 appropriations for agricultural development and food security within the Feed the Future Initiative. The House and Senate have marked up and approved funding bills, with the House bill providing $1 billion for food security and agricultural development, 38% less than the Administration request. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a FY2011 State-Foreign Operations funding bill with $1.3 billion for food security and agriculture development programs, which is less than the Administration's request. Congress did not enact any of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2011, instead funding the federal government through continuing resolutions. The current fiscal situation and shift in congressional leadership may lead to further debate on funding priorities for food security and agricultural development. The current fiscal situation and shift in congressional leadership may result in additional debate about the Administration's priorities and funding requests for food security and agricultural development. Skepticism exists regarding the G8 pledge to the Global Partnership, with concerns about meeting funding commitments. Critics highlight past shortfalls in development aid pledges. Concerns have been raised about the lack of strong leadership at USAID under the Obama Administration. Many experts have criticized the lack of strong leadership at USAID under the Obama Administration, with key posts remaining unfilled. This leadership vacuum has allowed other federal agencies to take on a larger role in development activities traditionally overseen by USAID, raising concerns about the agency's authority and resources. The Center for Global Development has noted the absence of USAID in significant foreign policy challenges in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. The Center for Global Development criticizes the absence of USAID in key foreign policy challenges in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. Concerns have been raised about the decline in staff capacity at USAID by senior government officials, including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former USAID Administrator Peter McPherson. Secretary Gates highlighted the imbalance between military and civilian elements in national security capabilities, attributing it to a lack of capacity stemming from reductions in key instruments of U.S. power abroad in the 1990s. The State Department and USAID have experienced significant staff cuts, leading to a decrease in on-the-ground effectiveness and technical expertise. USAID has shifted from an implementation agency to one that contracts out a large portion of its foreign aid program, resulting in less coherence and effectiveness overall. Since the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. government has collaborated with land-grant universities to establish counterpart institutions in developing countries. In 1975, the Title XII \"Famine Prevention and Freedom from Hunger\" amendment was passed to address country-level fragmentation in USAID-managed agricultural development assistance. USAID has faced challenges in managing numerous small projects due to staff shortages, prompting efforts to rebuild technical capacity by hiring additional agriculture foreign-service officers. Since the 1975 Title XII amendment, land-grant universities have been involved in international development efforts. However, USAID's support for capacity building has decreased since the 1990s, leading to a decline in post-graduate training and agricultural research support. This has weakened institutional capacity in developing countries, despite USAID recognizing the importance of long-term institutional building for aid effectiveness. USAID has acknowledged the importance of long-term institutional building for aid effectiveness, emphasizing the need to strengthen institutional capacity in developing countries. However, questions remain about the adequacy of institutional capacity in both the United States and developing countries, particularly in Africa, to effectively implement agricultural programs. Concerns have been raised about the weak scientific foundation in sub-Saharan Africa for modern agriculture and the reluctance of African governments and donors to invest in science, technology, and training to improve agricultural productivity. Several U.S. agencies, including USAID, State Department, USDA, MCC, Treasury Department, and USTR, are involved in agricultural development and food security assistance. Interagency coordination is crucial in this area, with a recommendation to create an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture for consistent priorities and actions among government agencies. The Chicago Council recommended creating an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture within the Executive Office of the President for consistent priorities and actions among U.S. government agencies. The Government Accountability Office highlighted coordination issues between USDA, USAID, and other agencies in providing food and development aid. The Feed the Future initiative aims for better interagency coordination, but some see fragmentation as a constraint. USAID is designated as the lead implementation agency for Feed the Future. The QDDR identifies fragmentation and siloing of activities across government agencies as a major constraint to U.S. food security efforts. USAID is designated as the lead implementation agency for the Feed the Future initiative, but coordination with other U.S. government entities is still unclear. Bills in Congress emphasize the need for interagency coordination in addressing global hunger. Donors and aid agencies have worked to harmonize strategies and activities to make international aid more effective. The United States works with partner countries and international bodies like the United Nations and OECD to coordinate aid efforts. Global summits play a key role in establishing development goals and creating new coordination mechanisms. Donors aim to increase aid predictability and flexibility to better meet recipient countries' needs. The United States aligns with other donors to increase aid predictability and flexibility, supporting initiatives like the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) and the global food security initiative. Some argue for faster aid reform progress, while others prioritize U.S. strategic interests in foreign assistance activities. The Feed the Future Guide emphasizes country-led planning for foreign assistance activities, which some Members of Congress are concerned about due to potential lack of donor control and oversight. Developing countries may struggle with capacity for strategic planning and accountability measures. Civil society sectors fear that government-led strategies may exclude them. Coordination efforts do not address U.S. food aid. The country-led planning process for foreign assistance activities may shift towards a government-led strategy, potentially excluding civil society, NGOs, and private sector actors. Coordination efforts do not address the need to coordinate U.S. food aid with Feed the Future activities in focus countries. Key questions include how U.S. commodity food aid will be coordinated with Feed the Future and if food aid will reinforce FtF objectives. The FtF strategy also emphasizes cross-cutting initiatives like gender, global health, environmental sustainability, and climate change. The Feed the Future (FtF) strategy emphasizes cross-cutting initiatives such as gender, global health, environmental sustainability, and climate change. However, it is unclear how these issues will be integrated into country plans, the resources needed, metrics to track progress, and coordination with other USG initiatives like PEPFAR and GCCI. The Administration is working on defining key indicators and metrics for progress, but it is still unclear which agency will be responsible for monitoring and evaluation. The Feed the Future (FtF) strategy lacks clarity on the agency responsible for monitoring progress and evaluating results over time. It is uncertain when results will be realized, if FtF will achieve MDG1 in the 20 countries, and how frequently Congress will receive updates."
