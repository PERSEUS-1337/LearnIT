    "content": "The U.S. Congress has been addressing the issue of state courts considering a servicemember's military service in child custody cases since 2007. Military members with custody of dependents may face custody battles when deployed, requiring contingency plans for their dependents' care.Deployment can lead to the other parent seeking temporary or permanent custody in the servicemember's absence. The proposed legislation aims to prevent custody battles involving military parents deployed for duty. It addresses the conflict between federal protection of servicemembers' rights and state jurisdiction over child custody matters. The United States Supreme Court has stated that domestic relations fall under state laws, but there is a push for federal military child custody legislation due to the rights of servicemembers. H.R. 1898, introduced in 2013, seeks to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to address child custody issues arising from increased deployments. State courts considering a servicemember's deployments in custody decisions is a concern, impacting military children's welfare and servicemembers' ability to serve effectively. The potential for state courts to consider a servicemember's deployments in child custody decisions is a concern. Approximately 142,000 Armed Forces members are single custodians of minor children. The lack of uniform state laws complicates child custody matters for deploying military parents. Proponents of federal child custody legislation argue for a national standard to prevent state courts from using a servicemember's deployment against them in custody determinations. Opponents believe such legislation infringes on states' rights and prioritize the best interest of the child. Congressional interest in this issue stems from the need to address the complexities faced by deploying military parents in child custody cases. The issue of state courts potentially using military service and deployments against servicemembers in child custody cases first came to the attention of Representative Michael R. Turner of Ohio via the 2004 case of Kentucky National Guard Lieutenant Eva Slusher, who temporarily lost custody of her daughter after serving on active duty. Congressional interest in federal legislation for military child custody cases is based on Congress's authority to support the armed forces and make rules for their regulation. Lt. Slusher lost custody of her daughter to her ex-husband after serving on active duty for 16 months. She regained custody after a legal battle, prompting proposed amendments to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act for a national standard in military child custody cases. H.R. 1898 mandates reinstating custody orders post-deployment unless not in the child's best interest. The proposed legislation, H.R. 1898, mandates that custody orders be reinstated upon the return of a servicemember from deployment, unless not in the best interest of the child. It also prohibits courts from using deployment as the sole factor in determining the child's best interest and establishes that it does not create a Federal right of action. Additionally, it states that if State laws provide higher protection to deploying servicemembers' rights in child custody proceedings, the higher State standard should be applied. The legislation has passed in the House multiple times but has failed to pass in the Senate due to concerns over enacting federal legislation. The proposed legislation, H.R. 1898, aims to reinstate custody orders for servicemembers returning from deployment, with the child's best interest in mind. It prohibits courts from solely considering deployment in custody decisions and defers to State laws for higher protection. Existing federal protection for single-parent servicemembers in custody disputes is under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA). The SCRA provides protections for servicemembers in child custody cases, requiring judges to grant a stay of legal proceedings if military service affects participation. Stays are mandatory for the first 90 days post-deployment, with the option for additional stays based on ongoing military duties. However, courts may not always grant additional stays, prioritizing the best interests of the child. Proponents argue for federal child custody legislation to address these issues. Proponents argue that the SCRA is inadequate in protecting servicemembers' rights in child custody cases, as it does not prevent courts from using military service against them in custody determinations. They also point out that the SCRA lacks procedures for temporary custody arrangements and guidance on balancing servicemembers' interests with the best interest of the child. Opponents believe the SCRA, along with state laws, already provides sufficient protection for military parents without the need for federal intervention. Opponents argue that the SCRA provides military parents protection in line with state laws without federal litigation. The SCRA prevents any permanent change in parental rights until a reasonable time after an absent servicemember's return. The DOD submitted a Priority DOD Appeal in 2010, stating that in high-visibility child custody cases, the prerequisites for automatic 90-day stays under the SCRA were often not followed. This lack of compliance was attributed to a lack of education about the SCRA rather than issues with its limitations. In high-visibility child custody cases, judges sometimes ignored the SCRA or it was not properly pled, indicating a lack of education about its use. The legislative debate centers on the conflict between protecting servicemembers' rights federally and state jurisdiction over child custody. Proponents argue for federal legislation to establish a national standard for military child custody cases, citing inconsistencies in state laws that could disadvantage servicemembers based on their military service. Proponents advocate for federal legislation to create a national standard for military child custody cases, citing the risk of servicemembers' military service being used against them in custody determinations. They argue that differences in state laws could lead to venue shopping by ex-spouses, creating uncertainty and involving multiple states in custody battles. Critics believe child custody issues should remain under state jurisdiction. Opponents argue that child custody issues should be governed by state law, not federal legislation. The American Bar Association emphasizes that states are better equipped to handle child custody laws and that a national standard could hinder the flexibility needed for unique cases. Opponents argue against federal legislation on child custody, stating that state courts are better equipped to handle such cases due to their unique nature. They believe that federal involvement would lead to increased costs, delays, and uncertainty, as well as potential bias from federal judges unfamiliar with family law issues. Additionally, opponents highlight the residency requirements that states have in place to prevent \"venue shopping\" or multiple jurisdiction venues. States have residency requirements to prevent \"venue shopping\" in child custody cases. The best interest of the child is the ultimate criteria for determining custody, considering various factors like the child's relationship with each parent, siblings, and their comfort in their home and community. Deployment or the threat of deployment may impact custody decisions, but no court should show bias against a military parent solely based on their service. The impact of deployments on child custody decisions is considered along with various factors, but it is not the sole determinant. Some argue for federal legislation to prevent bias against military parents, while others point to a DOD study showing deployment is not the sole factor in custody decisions. Opponents argue against federal child custody legislation, stating that it could prioritize servicemembers' rights over the best interest of the child. They believe that deployment should not be the sole factor in custody decisions and that the proposed legislation could allow losers of state-level cases to seek better outcomes in federal court. Opponents of federal child custody legislation argue that it could prioritize servicemembers' rights over the child's best interest. Legal analysts believe that the language in the legislative proposal may not prevent federal court involvement in military child custody cases. The American Bar Association points out that federal jurisdiction can be invoked to vindicate rights claimed under federal statute, potentially leading to removal to federal court to avoid unfavorable outcomes in state court. The proposed legislation on federal child custody cases does not prevent removal to federal court for military servicemembers. Despite general support in the House, similar bills have not advanced in the Senate since 2008. Senate members agree on the need to protect military personnel in custody disputes but oppose federal intervention. Most federal child custody bills introduced in the Senate since 2008 have not progressed past Senate committees. Senators are hesitant about federal legislation interfering with state matters and believe the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act already offers sufficient protection in custody disputes. Senator John McCain expressed concerns about preempting state laws and the need for a nationwide standard in a letter to Representative Turner. The Senate Veterans' Committee and the American Bar Association have opposed proposed legislation to modify the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The Senate Armed Services Committee supported a recommendation for more data on child custody disputes involving deployed service members. The Senate Armed Services Committee supported a report on child custody disputes involving deployed service members, emphasizing personal responsibility and effective family care plans. The Senate's 2009 National Defense Authorization Act emphasized the importance of family care plans for servicemembers to ensure proper care for their families during deployments. Properly prepared plans contribute to military readiness and minimize legal difficulties related to child custody arrangements. Family Care Plans are essential for servicemembers to arrange care for their dependents during deployments. While not legally binding, they can help minimize legal issues and serve as supporting evidence in custody disputes if properly drafted with the consent of both parties. The Senate committee recommends obtaining the views of the Council of Governors on legislative proposals to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act regarding child custody disputes during deployment. The committee is concerned about the implications of federal law interfering with state laws on domestic relations. The Senate committee is concerned about preemptive federal legislation on child custody disputes during deployment, as it may interfere with state laws on domestic relations. The Department of Defense has generally opposed such legislation, except for a brief period in early 2011. DOD has historically opposed federal child custody legislation, except for a brief period in early 2011 when Secretary Gates considered it. Gates acknowledged state protections for service members facing child custody issues but deemed federal legislation unwise due to varying state approaches. Secretary Gates acknowledged state protections for service members in child custody cases but deemed federal legislation unwise due to varying state approaches. He outlined steps for DOD to ensure protection of Service members, including personally contacting governors, including custody concerns in key issues presented to state officials, improving liaison efforts, and developing a strategy for states with large military populations. The Department of Defense is taking steps to address military custody concerns by reaching out to state officials, working with the American Bar Association for legal representation, and updating Family Care Plans. They believe these efforts can resolve issues for Service members more effectively than new federal legislation. The Department of Defense opposes a proposal in the FY2010 Defense Authorization Bill that would disrupt state domestic laws and increase oversight by federal courts. They encourage states to pass legislation addressing the challenges faced by parents in the military and are updating their Family Care Plan guidance to support Service members. The Department of Defense is updating its Family Care Plan guidance to support Service members, in response to challenges faced by parents in the military. Although a proposed legislation did not pass, a report was submitted to Congress on child custody disputes involving deployed service members. The Department of Defense updated its Family Care Plan guidance to assist Service members with challenges faced by military parents. A report concluded that no custody battles are decided solely based on military service, and federal legislation in this area would be counter-productive. The United States Supreme Court has indicated that matters related to child custody are best left to state courts. The Department of Defense believes that child custody issues related to military service should be addressed at the state level, as federal legislation would be counter-productive. There is no evidence of a trend in family courts to remove custody from servicemembers due to deployment. Most cases involving such allegations result in servicemembers prevailing in litigation against their former spouses. Legislation mandating a specific outcome based on a single factor is not recommended. Effective measures to minimize custody litigation disruptions for deployed servicemembers are crucial. The House Armed Services Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the Department of Defense's report on child custody issues related to military service, specifically concerning the scope of the report and its conclusions. They emphasized the importance of early consultation with non-custodial parents and the need for effective legislation on the state level to address these issues. The Department limited the report scope to cases where military service solely determined custody. Challenges in data gathering were discussed, leading to insufficient data on Armed Forces members losing child custody due to service. The committee acknowledged the Department's efforts to support service members facing custody issues but noted the lack of comprehensive data. The committee supports the need for congressional legislation to protect service members and their children during deployment. Outgoing Secretary Gates withdrew objections to federal child custody legislation without consulting Pentagon judge advocates. Secretary Gates now believes the Department of Defense should consider crafting legislation for a federal uniform standard of protection for service members. Secretary Gates believes the Department of Defense should change its position to consider federal legislation for a uniform standard of protection in child custody cases involving service members. Former Secretary Panetta's support for such legislation was questioned, but he expressed support for amendments on the Senate side. In response to questioning, Secretary Panetta expressed support for amendments on the Senate side regarding federal legislation for a uniform standard of protection in child custody cases involving service members. However, he raised concerns about the House version of the bill, stating that it needed a critical revision to prioritize the best interest of the child in such cases. As a lawyer and former legislator, I am sensitive to avoiding legislation that dictates outcomes in court cases, especially when children are involved. One potential solution is to add \"as the sole factor\" in determining deployment on page 2 of the bill. The American Bar Association opposes federal child custody legislation for military members. The American Bar Association opposes federal legislation on child custody for military members, arguing that it is a state responsibility. They urge states to pass laws preventing denial of child custody to servicemembers. The American Bar Association opposes federal intervention in military family matters, urging states to pass laws prohibiting denial of child custody to servicemembers based solely on military deployment. The National Governors Association also opposes federal involvement in these matters, stating that states are already addressing the challenges faced by military families through legislation. States are addressing family law complexities for deployed parents with legislation, working closely with the Department of Defense. The Adjutants General Association of the United States opposes federal intervention in military family matters. The Adjutants General Association of the United States (AGAUS) opposes federal intervention in military family matters, believing that state laws and court-integrated social services are best for resolving domestic relations issues involving National Guard and other service members. AGAUS is against federal legislation that would interfere with state laws on child custody cases and infringe upon states' sovereign authority in family law matters. The National Military Family Association (NMFA) supports the AGAUS stance against federal intervention in military family matters, advocating for state laws to handle child custody cases involving National Guard and other service members. NMFA emphasizes the importance of state sovereignty in family law matters and opposes federal legislation that could disrupt existing state efforts. The NMFA supports state laws over federal intervention in military family matters, endorsing ABA Resolution 106 and the UDPCVA for uniformity in child custody cases involving deployed parents. The UDPCVA, drafted by the Uniform Law Commission, aims to standardize state statutory law in this area. The Uniform Law Commission provides states with draft legislation to standardize custody rights for military parents who are deployed. Attorney Eric Fish acknowledges the challenges state courts face in determining jurisdiction and visitation rights for deployed parents. The Uniform Law Commission opposes federal legislation in child custody cases, advocating for state laws like the UDPCVA for uniformity. The Uniform Law Commission opposes federal legislation in child custody cases, arguing that family law is a state's rights issue. Representative Turner's bill aims to provide minimum protections for military parents without creating federal jurisdiction for custody matters. Representative Turner's bill aims to protect service members in child custody cases, ensuring their absence due to military service is not used against them. 46 states have military child custody legislation in line with the Uniform Deployed Parents Custody and Visitation act, with exceptions in Alabama, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New Mexico. Legislative action on this issue is ongoing until state courts align with the protections provided by the bill. The issue of military child custody legislation is being addressed by Congress, with 46 states already having some form of legislation in place. There is strong support in the House, but the Senate is cautious about potential federal intrusion on state jurisdiction. The debate will focus on the need for federal involvement in military child custody cases and determining what is in the best interest of the child. The legislation regarding military child custody is being debated in Congress, with 46 states already having laws in place. The focus is on determining the best interest of the child in custody cases, with a bill introduced to protect the custody rights of deployed members of the Armed Forces. The legislation protects the custody rights of deployed servicemembers by reinstating custody orders upon their return, unless not in the child's best interest. Deployment cannot be the sole factor in determining custody. No federal jurisdiction or right of action is created. The legislation protects deployed servicemembers' custody rights by reinstating orders upon return, with no federal jurisdiction or right of action created. State law prevails if it offers higher parent protection standards. Deployment is defined as movement for 60-540 days without family relocation. The table of contents in section 1(b) of the Act is amended to include a new item related to child custody protection. H.R. 1898 and H.R. 4201 are legislative efforts concerning military child custody, with various actions taken in Congress for each bill. The House debated and passed H.R. 4201 on 5/30/2012, with a vote of 390-2. The bill was then sent to the Senate and referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. It was not included in the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act. The bill is related to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which aims to provide protections for servicemembers. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) aims to protect servicemembers during their military service by temporarily suspending judicial and administrative proceedings that may affect their civil rights. It applies to the United States, states, and territories, excluding criminal proceedings. The SCRA applies to judicial and administrative proceedings in any court or agency within the United States, excluding criminal proceedings. It allows for the extension of protection to persons secondarily liable when actions are stayed, postponed, or suspended by the court. The SCRA allows for the stay, postponement, or suspension of obligations or liabilities, extending protection to sureties, guarantors, endorsers, and others. Judgments or decrees can be vacated or set aside, affecting those secondarily liable. Bail bonds are not enforced during military service, and waivers are not precluded by the Act. The SCRA allows for the stay, postponement, or suspension of obligations or liabilities, extending protection to sureties, guarantors, endorsers, and others. Bail bonds are not enforced during military service, and waivers are not precluded by the Act. The court may discharge the surety and exonerate the bail in accordance with principles of equity and justice. Waivers can be invalidated upon entrance to military service. The SCRA provides protections to individuals serving in the military, including waivers that are not valid once military service begins. Citizens serving with allied forces are entitled to relief and protections under the Act. Reserves ordered to report for military service are also granted rights and protections during the period specified. The SCRA provides protections to individuals serving in the military, including waivers that are not valid once military service begins. Reserves ordered to report for military service are entitled to rights and protections under the Act. This includes individuals ordered to report for induction under the Military Selective Service Act. The SCRA provides protections for individuals in the military, including safeguards against default judgments in civil actions where the defendant does not appear. The court must require the plaintiff to file an affidavit regarding the defendant's military status before entering judgment, and may appoint an attorney to represent the defendant if they are in military service. The court may appoint an attorney to represent a servicemember before entering judgment if their military status is uncertain. The attorney's actions will not waive any defense of the servicemember or bind them. If the defendant is later found to be in military service, a bond filed by the plaintiff may indemnify the defendant against any loss from the judgment. The bond remains in effect until the time for appeal expires. The court may issue orders to protect the defendant's rights under the Act, and the requirement for an affidavit can be satisfied by a written statement under penalty of perjury. Making or using a false affidavit is punishable by fine or imprisonment. In cases involving a defendant in military service, the court must grant a minimum 90-day stay of proceedings upon request or its own determination. In cases involving a defendant in military service, the court must grant a minimum 90-day stay of proceedings upon request or its own determination. The stay of proceedings is not controlled by procedures under section 202 and allows for the vacation or setting aside of default judgments entered against a servicemember during their period of military service.
