    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lebanese Adjustment Act\" and provides for the adjustment of status for certain nationals of Lebanon. The \"Lebanese Adjustment Act\" allows certain nationals of Lebanon to adjust their status to that of a lawful permanent resident if they apply within 18 months of the Act's enactment and meet admissibility requirements, excluding specific grounds for inadmissibility. Additionally, aliens with prior exclusion or deportation orders can still apply for adjustment of status under this Act. Aliens who have been excluded, deported, or ordered to depart from the United States can apply for adjustment of status under the Lebanese Adjustment Act without needing to file a separate motion. If the application is granted, the order will be canceled; if denied, the order remains in effect. This provision applies to aliens granted temporary protected status in the U.S. under specific conditions. Aliens granted temporary protected status in the United States under the Lebanese Adjustment Act must meet specific conditions, including being physically present in the U.S. from March 28, 1993, to the date of filing for adjustment of status. They must also have been permitted to voluntarily depart the U.S. before December 9, 1993, to avoid deportation proceedings. Aliens granted temporary protected status under the Lebanese Adjustment Act must prove continuous physical presence in the U.S. from March 28, 1993. They can demonstrate this by showing records of service or business in the U.S. before that date or by applying for benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act prior to March 28, 1993.

They can demonstrate this by showing records of service or business in the U.S. before that date or by applying for benefits under the Immigration and Nationality Act prior to March 28, 1993. The Attorney General shall provide regulations for aliens subject to deportation or removal to seek a stay of such order based on filing an application. Additionally, the Attorney General shall not order removal if the alien has applied for adjustment of status under subsection (a) unless the application is denied. Aliens under the Lebanese Adjustment Act can apply for adjustment of status and work authorization while their application is pending. The Attorney General may authorize employment for aliens whose application has been pending for over 180 days. Additionally, spouses and children of aliens whose status is adjusted to permanent residence can also apply for adjustment of status. The Attorney General can authorize adjustment of status for aliens under the Lebanese Adjustment Act who are spouses, children, or unmarried sons or daughters of aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The alien must apply within 18 months of the Act's enactment, be physically present in the US when applying, and meet admissibility requirements. The Lebanese Adjustment Act allows aliens to apply for adjustment of status if they are physically present in the US at the time of application and meet admissibility requirements. Continuous physical presence must be demonstrated, starting no later than March 28, 1993, with absences not exceeding 180 days in total. Administrative review is available through the Attorney General. The Attorney General provides administrative review for adjustment of status applicants under the Lebanese Adjustment Act, with a limit of 180 days for absences. Judicial review is not allowed for the Attorney General's determination on status adjustment. The Immigration and Nationality Act provisions apply, with exceptions specified in the Act. The Immigration and Nationality Act definitions apply to the administration of the Lebanese Adjustment Act. The Attorney General's powers in enforcing immigration laws are not affected by this section. Eligibility for permanent residence status under this section does not prevent an alien from seeking such status under other applicable laws."
