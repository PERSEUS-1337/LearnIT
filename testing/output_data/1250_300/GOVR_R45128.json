The Agriculture appropriation bill funds USDA, FDA, and excludes the U.S. Forest Service. It includes discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary amounts being the primary focus. The federal budget process treats discretionary and mandatory spending differently, with discretionary spending controlled by annual appropriations acts. Mandatory spending is controlled by budget rules during the authorization process. In FY2018 Agriculture appropriations, discretionary appropriations were 16% ($23.3 billion) of the total, while mandatory spending comprised 84% ($123 billion). The largest discretionary spending items include programs like WIC, rural development, agricultural research, FDA, and farm assistance. Mandatory spending is mainly attributed to programs in the 2014 farm bill. The Agriculture appropriations bill includes funding for programs such as WIC, rural development, agricultural research, FDA, and farm assistance. Mandatory spending makes up the majority of the budget, with key programs like SNAP, child nutrition, crop insurance, and conservation programs. The bill's funding has fluctuated over time, with peaks in FY2010 and increases since FY2013.

It provided more funding for rural development and agricultural research, but made $220 million more in reductions compared to the House-passed bill. FY2018 began without an enacted appropriation, leading Congress to pass CRs to fund the government. The Office of Management and Budget prorates funding to agencies annually during a Continuing Resolution (CR) through apportionment. The first CR for FY2018 maintained FY2017 funding levels with exceptions and anomalies, including a 0.6791% reduction and increased funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program. The CR provided $238 million for the program, including anomalies to maintain caseload and participation based on food costs. Technical corrections were made for the computation of rescission to Section 32 funds and the availability of carryover funds. Several CRs were passed to extend funding deadlines, with waivers for PAYGO rules to prevent sequestration of mandatory spending. Multiple government shutdowns occurred due to the absence of further CRs or appropriations, with extensions granted until March 23, 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123) extended the continuing resolution (CR) to March 23, 2018, raising discretionary spending caps and providing disaster assistance for agriculture.

The FY2018 appropriation does not impose as many changes to mandatory program spending compared to previous years, costing about $740 million against the discretionary limit of the bill. Budget Sequestration is a process of automatic, across-the-board reductions triggered when federal spending exceeds statutory budget goals. It is authorized through FY2021 for discretionary spending and through FY2027 for mandatory spending. Bipartisan Budget Acts in 2013, 2015, and 2018 have raised discretionary budget caps to avoid sequestration, but it still applies to certain mandatory spending accounts. Congress has enacted larger appropriations than allowed under the Budget Control Act (BCA), but sequestration still applies to certain mandatory spending accounts. The sunset on sequestration of mandatory accounts has been extended multiple times, with extensions until FY2027. Some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration. Sequestration on nonexempt mandatory accounts in agriculture continues in FY2018, with a 6.6% reduction rate. This results in a $1.3 billion reduction in authorized mandatory agriculture spending. Sequestration in agriculture reduces accounts by 6.6%, resulting in a $1.3 billion cut from authorized spending in FY2018. Tables show sequestration rates and canceled budget authority."
