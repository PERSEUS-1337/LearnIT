    "content": "During the first session of the 110th Congress, the Administration requested $196.5 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY 2008, with $189.3 billion for military operations and $6.9 billion for international affairs. Congress had approved $86.8 billion for defense and $1.5 billion for international affairs by December 2007. $102.5 billion for defense and $5.4 billion for international affairs are still pending approval. Congress is expected to address these requests in a spring 2008 supplemental appropriations bill. The Administration had initially requested emergency funding for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere in February 2007, followed by additional requests in July and October 2007. Congress began considering FY2008 supplemental appropriations in fall 2007. In fall 2007, Congress approved emergency funding for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army and Marine Corps faced financial strain due to high operational tempo. Without supplemental funding, they risked running out of money by early 2008. The Defense Department had to consider options like transferring funds or slowing down operations to extend their budget. The Army and Marine Corps faced financial strain due to high operational tempo and risked running out of money by early 2008. Congressional approval of a $70 billion \"bridge fund\" temporarily resolved the issue, providing most of the requested funding for Army and Marine Corps operations. Funding from the FY2008 appropriations act is estimated to last until mid-June for personnel and end of June or early July for operation and maintenance. The Defense Department could extend operations for Army military personnel and maintenance beyond June by slowing obligations, transferring funds, or using other authorities. The Administration requested $141.7 billion in emergency supplemental funding for the Defense Department, $3.3 billion for the State Department, and $325 million for other agencies in FY2008. The Administration complied with Section 1008 of the FY2007 national defense authorization act by submitting the defense request along with the President's FY2008 budget. The Defense Department estimated the full-year costs of continuing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, acknowledging it was a rough projection. An additional $5.3 billion was requested for the Department of Defense to procure MRAP vehicles. The White House requested $5.3 billion for the Department of Defense to procure 1,520 MRAP vehicles. Additionally, $45.9 billion was requested for military operations, economic assistance, and embassy security in ongoing conflicts. The total emergency supplemental appropriations requested for FY2008 were $195.6 billion, mainly for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other foreign affairs programs. Congressional debate in early 2007 focused on supplemental appropriations for FY2007. The debate over Iraq policy in 2007 focused on supplemental appropriations for FY2007. The President vetoed an initial bill due to Iraq policy provisions, but a compromise bill was approved providing funding for defense, international affairs, and domestic programs. Congressional action on FY2008 emergency supplemental funding began in September and was finalized shortly before Christmas. Congress quickly provided funds for MRAP vehicles in the defense appropriations act. In November 2007, the House and Senate approved a conference agreement on the FY2008 defense appropriations bill, providing $460 billion for baseline Defense Department activities, including $27.4 billion for Army and $4.8 billion for Marine Corps operations. An additional $11.6 billion in emergency funding was allocated for MRAP vehicles. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill provided $27.4 billion for Army and $4.8 billion for Marine Corps operations, with an additional $11.6 billion for MRAP vehicles. A separate bill, H.R. 4156, allocated $50 billion for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, with provisions for troop withdrawal and limited mission objectives. The Senate failed to pass legislation that aimed to withdraw most troops from Iraq by December 15, 2008, limiting the mission of remaining forces to force protection, training, and pursuit of terrorists. The Senate also rejected a substitute bill that would have provided $70 billion for the Defense Department without requiring withdrawal from Iraq. On November 20, 2007, the Defense Department transferred $4.5 billion to the Army and Joint IED Defeat Organization to extend their operations until February 23. Without additional funding, the Army and Marine Corps would have to halt non-essential operations soon. Congress needed to approve additional funding to avoid furloughs of government employees and contractors. On December 17, 2007, the House approved amendments to the foreign operations appropriations bill, H.R. 2764, providing $485 billion in regular and emergency appropriations for various programs. A second amendment allocated $31 billion in emergency defense appropriations, mainly for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan. Army and Marine Corps funding was limited to OEF operations, except for force protection. On December 18, 2007, the Senate approved $70 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense for overseas operations, without restrictions on where the funds could be used. The House then agreed to this amendment, clearing the bill for the President to sign into law as P.L. 110-161 on December 26, 2007. This resolved a funding dispute and prevented the shutdown of Army and Marine Corps operations. The appropriations bill, P.L. 110-161, was signed into law on December 26, 2007, providing $70 billion for overseas military operations. This funding averted a shutdown of Army and Marine Corps operations until at least June 2008. The bill allocated $35.2 billion for Army and $4.0 billion for Marine Corps operation and maintenance accounts, in addition to funds from the regular FY2008 Defense Appropriations Act. The supplemental funding of $35.2 billion for Army and $4.0 billion for Marine Corps operations, in addition to regular appropriations, will sustain Army operations until the end of June 2008 and Marine Corps operations until the end of August. The Army may exhaust its military personnel account by mid-June, prompting the Defense Department to consider transferring funds or slowing down operations to extend funding. The Department has $11.4 billion available for fund transfers between accounts. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for fund transfers between accounts, which could extend Army operations for another month without slowing down operations. This would reduce financial flexibility for other needs. Congress's agreement on a $70 billion FY2008 bridge fund temporarily resolved the debate but did not settle the underlying controversy. In FY2008, the Defense Department faced challenges in funding day-to-day activities and war-related operations. Congress provided a $70 billion bridge fund, but the underlying controversy remains. Without supplemental appropriations, the Army and Marine Corps would exhaust funds by February and early April, respectively. The Defense Department proposed transferring $4.1 billion to extend operations for a few more weeks. Additional transfers and reduced spending could have extended operations for about another month. The Defense Department faced challenges in funding day-to-day activities and war-related operations in FY2008. Congress provided a $70 billion bridge fund, but without supplemental appropriations, the Army and Marine Corps would exhaust funds by February and early April, respectively. The Defense Department proposed transferring $4.1 billion to extend operations for a few more weeks, but alternative measures like invoking the Feed and Forage Act or using Navy and Air Force funds to support Army operations have limitations and potential disruptive effects. The FY2008 state department, foreign operations appropriations bill, part of the consolidated appropriations act, provides $1,473.8 million for international affairs, including $965 million for the State Department and $508.8 million for foreign operations. $781.6 million is allocated for Diplomatic and Consular Programs in the supplemental funds. Supplemental funds for State Department accounts in the consolidated appropriations act include $781.6 million for Diplomatic and Consular Programs, $468.0 million for Contributions to International Peacekeeping, $12.0 million for International Broadcasting.

The House bill includes funding for various programs in Afghanistan, the West Bank and Gaza, Pakistan, North Korea, and Sudan. It also allocates $200 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance, $100 million for Foreign Military Financing, and $35 million for Peacekeeping Operations. The bill compares funding to the Administration's request and includes a plan to withdraw most U.S. military forces from Iraq by December 2008. The House bill, signed into law on December 26, included a $70 billion emergency funding legislation with no change in Iraq policy. The original House-passed bridge fund required withdrawal of most U.S. military forces from Iraq by December 2008, with a target date of December 15, 2008 for completion. It allowed for a residual force for protection, training, and targeted attacks on terrorist groups, along with requirements for deployed units and prohibitions on torture. The House bill, signed into law on December 26, included a $70 billion emergency funding legislation with no change in Iraq policy. It required withdrawal of most U.S. military forces from Iraq by December 2008, with a target date of December 15, 2008 for completion. The bill allowed for a residual force for protection, training, and targeted attacks on terrorist groups, along with requirements for deployed units and prohibitions on torture. Additionally, H.R. 4156 stated the sense of Congress that the war in Iraq should end quickly and safely, troops should be brought home, and extended prohibitions on torture to all government agencies. It also prohibited the use of funds to deploy any unit abroad unless certified as \"fully mission capable\" by the President, and required an immediate and orderly redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days. The international community aims to bring stability to Iraq by transitioning U.S. armed forces to a limited presence by December 15, 2008. The transition will focus on protecting U.S. facilities, providing training to Iraqi security forces, and conducting targeted counter-terrorism operations. Quarterly reports starting February 1, 2008, will outline plans for the transition. Additional requirements include a regional stability plan for the Middle East by February 15, 2008, and quarterly reports throughout the fiscal year to measure progress in Iraq. Senators proposed an amendment to shift the U.S. mission in Iraq to training and supporting Iraqi security forces by the end of 2008. The Senate failed to approve the measure with a vote of 50-45, falling short of the required 60 votes. The Senate failed to approve an amendment to shift the U.S. mission in Iraq to training and supporting Iraqi security forces by the end of 2008, with a vote of 50-45, falling short of the required 60 votes. Another amendment to withdraw troops from Iraq within 90 days and cut off funding after nine months was also rejected with a vote of 24-71. The approved $70 billion \"bridge fund\" for FY2008 did not include language requiring troop withdrawal but mandated a report on \"Progress Toward Stability in Iraq\" within 60 days. The approved funding for FY2008 did not include language for troop withdrawal from Iraq. Instead, it required the Secretary of Defense to provide regular reports on stability in Iraq. The Administration requested $196.5 billion for military operations and other activities in FY2008, with most of the money already included in the original budget submitted in February 2007. The Administration requested a total of $189.3 billion in FY2008 for military operations abroad, $6.9 billion in supplemental funding for international affairs programs, and $325 million for other agencies. This included requests in February, July, and October for various purposes such as mine resistant ambush protected vehicle procurement and deployment. Table 3 summarizes supplemental funding requests made by the Administration in February, July, and October. The funds were designated as \"emergency\" spending to bypass spending caps in the FY2008 congressional budget resolution. While the resolution exempts emergency funds from spending limits, it also includes restrictions on what can be considered emergency spending, potentially leading to points of order in the Senate for ongoing war-related expenses. The FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill included funds for disaster relief, farm programs, low-income energy assistance, and the SCHIP children's health insurance program. It also raised the minimum wage and was expected to include additional \"emergency\" funds for Hurricane Katrina recovery and other purposes. The FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill included funds for disaster relief, farm programs, low-income energy assistance, SCHIP children's health insurance program, and an increase in the minimum wage. The FY2008 continuing resolution provided additional funding for veterans health programs, community development in Louisiana, FEMA Disaster Relief Fund, and wildfire management. The FY2008 continuing resolution allocated $3 billion for community development in Louisiana, $2.9 billion for FEMA Disaster Relief Fund, and $500 million for wildfire management. Additionally, $16.8 billion was provided for MRAPs in previous bills, with $5.2 billion for production and deployment in the Army and Marine Corps, and $11.6 billion designated as emergency appropriations in the defense appropriations bill. The omnibus appropriations bill included a $70 billion bridge fund with allocations for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance, training and equipping Afghan and Iraqi security forces, and other components. The bill signed by the President on December 26 includes $39 billion for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance, $11 billion for Navy, Air Force, and other components, $1.35 billion for Afghan security forces, $1.5 billion for Iraqi forces, $3.7 billion for the Iraqi Freedom Fund, $4.3 billion for joint IED defense, and $6.1 billion for weapons procurement. It also allows up to $4 billion to be transferred between accounts in the bridge fund, providing flexibility for future Defense Department financing. The $189.3 billion requested for military operations in FY2008 continues the trend of increasing funds provided to the Defense Department through supplemental appropriations. Supplemental appropriations for DOD, including war-related funds, have increased significantly since FY2003, reaching $171.3 billion in FY2007. The funding growth is mainly for repairing or replacing military equipment and upgrading ground forces. Weapons procurement saw the largest increase, from $19 billion in FY2005 to a requested $64 billion in FY2008. Operation and maintenance funding also grew to repair equipment. The largest increases in funding for DOD have been for weapons procurement, which grew from $19 billion in FY2005 to a requested $64 billion in FY2008. Operation and maintenance funding also increased for equipment repair. Funding has also gone towards training and equipping Afghan and Iraqi military forces, reorganizing the Army, and increasing troops by 92,000 by 2011. Force protection and reconstitution have seen the largest funding increases according to DOD's functional breakdown. The Defense Department did not initially support Army requests for funding to reconstitute the force after the war, preferring the term \"reset\" to describe the process. Secretary Rumsfeld argued for refining and potentially reducing funding requirements, suggesting that overseas deployment reductions might impact equipment needs. The Defense Department has now resumed using the term \"reconstitution,\" encompassing the concept of repairing and replacing lost or worn-out equipment. The Defense Department has resumed using the term \"reconstitution\" to encompass upgrades to the force, including fixing equipment shortfalls, adding transportation and communications equipment, and fully equipping units for training. This includes equipping Guard and reserve units with newer weapons and support systems for overseas operations. Congress has generally supported these steps to upgrade the force, explaining the increase in spending. The Defense Department has resumed using the term \"reconstitution\" to encompass upgrades to the force, including fixing equipment shortfalls and fully equipping units for training. Congress has generally supported these steps to upgrade the force, explaining the increase in spending. Funding for MRAPs is the largest single item in the amended defense request, with Congress providing virtually all of the money requested. The amended defense request includes $6.3 billion for troop surge costs in Iraq, $1 billion for Iraqi security forces, $100 million for factory reopening in Iraq, $242 million for Afghanistan's Commanders Emergency Response Program, and $956 million for construction in Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, $8.8 billion was added for reconstitution efforts.

The Bush Administration has been increasingly requesting emergency supplemental funds for international affairs budgets. The Bush Administration has requested $6.897 billion for international affairs spending in FY2008, with nearly half allocated for assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. Critics argue that relying on emergency supplemental funds too heavily is problematic, while the Administration defends the need for unexpected expenses. The original State Department portion of the emergency supplemental request included $1.882 billion for operations in Iraq, which was later amended to add an additional $1.3 billion for various programs. The Bush Administration requested $6.897 billion for international affairs spending in FY2008, with nearly half allocated for assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The Administration did not request security assistance in its regular Defense budget for FY2008. In FY2008, the Administration requested $392 million for Iraq reconstruction under State and Foreign Operations appropriations. Congress rejected this request, leading to the expectation that funding would come from an emergency supplemental measure. The Administration's revised emergency supplemental appropriations request included $4.9 billion for Iraq reconstruction, with $3.7 billion allocated for Department of Defense reconstruction appropriations. This funding would primarily support training Iraqi troops and reconstruction grants under the Iraq Security Forces Fund and Commander's Emergency Response Program. The DOD reconstruction appropriations request totaled $3.7 billion, mainly for training Iraqi troops and reconstruction grants under the ISFF and CERP. The CERP allows military commanders to support local economic activities with small grants, including infrastructure projects like electric generators and sewer systems. The October budget revision added $100 million for the Task Force to Improve Business and Stability Operations in Iraq. The October budget revision added $100 million to the DOD-funded Iraq Freedom Fund for the Task Force to Improve Business and Stability Operations in Iraq. The Task Force aims to stimulate the economy by rehabilitating state-owned enterprises. Challenges include lack of electricity, security issues, and limited interest from U.S. companies. The FY2008 emergency supplemental request would allocate $1.2 billion to Iraq through various accounts. The ESF is a key source of funding for assistance provided by Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Iraq, with $195 million allocated to INCLE, $195 million to MRA, and $80 million to IDFA accounts. PRTs aim to stabilize areas secured by U.S. and Iraqi forces through economic projects, job training, and capacity-building for local government officials. Additionally, ESF supports Ministerial capacity development, agriculture and private sector reform, and democratization efforts at the national level. The ESF supports Ministerial capacity development, agriculture, private sector reform, and democratization efforts. The October budget revision added $25 million to the ESF supplemental request for a new Iraq enterprise fund based on the model created for east Europe and the former Soviet Union. Enterprise funds provide loans or equity investments to small and medium businesses, encouraging growth of the private sector. Some funds have been successful, like the Polish Fund, while others have faced challenges due to poor investment risks or competition from other funding sources. Some funds have been less successful due to poor investment risks or competition from other sources. Observers question the funds' usefulness as their development purpose conflicts with economic profit pressures. The INCLE account would support rule of law and corrections programs, including prison construction and judicial reform. The MRA request aims to address the refugee crisis in the region, with millions of Iraqis displaced due to violence. The IDA program would provide relief to refugees and displaced people, including medical care and shelter. Emergency funds were requested for operational costs for administering reconstruction programs. In FY2008, emergency funds were requested for operational costs for staffing and administering reconstruction programs in Iraq. Congress provided $1.9 billion for security reconstruction aid but rejected most economic assistance, only approving about $250 million for humanitarian programs. Congress approved $250 million for humanitarian programs in Iraq, including funding for demining, refugees, disaster relief, war victims, and Iraqi scholars. This brings total reconstruction funding since 2003 to $44.8 billion. The Administration is seeking an additional $1 billion for emergency reconstruction aid.

Afghanistan's political transition was completed in December 2005, but insurgent threats escalated in 2006, raising concerns about U.S. stabilization efforts. Afghan citizens have started to enjoy new freedoms, particularly in regions previously forbidden under the Taliban. Afghan citizens are experiencing new personal freedoms in the northern and western regions previously forbidden under the Taliban. Women are increasingly participating in economic and political roles. The insurgency led by remnants of the Taliban escalated in 2006, posing a threat to peace and security. Slow reconstruction, corruption, and the Taliban's resurgence in rural areas are ongoing challenges. Political leaders in the stable northern region have raised concerns about reconstruction funding distribution. The Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan, particularly in the south and east, is fueled by various factors such as narcotics trafficking, independent militias, and Taliban commanders operating from across the border in Pakistan. Efforts like the Reconstruction Opportunity Zones aim to stimulate economic activity in underdeveloped regions, while international stabilization measures focus on strengthening the central government and combating insurgent challenges. Weak provincial governance remains a significant obstacle to reconstruction and democratic progress in Afghanistan. The international community has been running PRTs to secure reconstruction in Afghanistan, but weak provincial governance remains a key obstacle to democratic progress. The Administration requested $339 million in ESF for Afghanistan reconstruction assistance in FY2008, with additional funds for embassy operations and security. A total request of $839 million for reconstruction was made in October 2007, including provisions to stabilize Afghanistan and continue economic reconstruction efforts.

The U.S. has pledged $750 million over five years to support this plan, focusing on improving economic and social conditions in the region. President Musharraf imposed emergency rule in 2007, leading to a review of U.S. assistance, but no action was taken. In 2007, President Musharraf imposed emergency rule in Pakistan, leading to a review of U.S. assistance. However, in February 2008, a new civilian government was elected, prompting Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to lift coup-related sanctions on Pakistan. The U.S. pledged $150 million, with a $60 million funding gap addressed through an emergency supplemental request for governance, health, education, and economic development programs. The $60 million emergency supplemental request aims to address funding gaps in governance, health, education, and economic development programs in Sudan. This request is in addition to regular appropriations from various accounts in the FY2008 budget, with a focus on humanitarian and peacekeeping support in the Darfur region. The amended emergency supplemental for Sudan totaled $868.6 million, including support for upcoming national elections as per the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Sudan will support upcoming national elections before July 2009 as per the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The United Nations estimates the elections could cost nearly $400 million due to logistical challenges in a post-conflict environment. Funding includes $70 million from the FY2008 emergency supplemental and $723.6 million for the African Union/United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur. Additionally, $468 million was appropriated in the Consolidated Appropriations. The Mexico and Central America Security Initiative aims to address criminal gang and drug trafficking activities with a $1 billion-plus anti-narcotics package. Mexico would receive $500 million for border security technology and law enforcement, while Central American countries would get $50 million for border security and justice sector improvements.
