    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. Congress finds that nearly 2 million transportation workers are required to carry a TWIC under the MTSA, costing $132.50 and requiring multiple trips for enrollment and renewal every 5 years. The TWIC enrollment process requires workers to make multiple trips to an enrollment center and pay $132.50 for a new card. This process is not mandated by statute or regulation but is driven by a DHS policy decision to align with standards for Personal Identity Verification. The TWIC enrollment process aligns with FIPS-201 standards, but DHS may deviate when necessary. TWIC is a work permit for a mobile private sector workforce, and possession does not grant unescorted access to secure areas without authorization. DHS has flexibility to develop an alternative enrollment process that avoids multiple trips to enrollment centers. The TWIC enrollment process aligns with FIPS-201 standards, but DHS has the flexibility to develop an alternative process that does not require multiple trips to enrollment centers. Other secure Government-issued identity documents, like US passports, can be mailed to applicants. Congress mandated a final rule for TWIC biometric readers by August 2010, but it has not been issued yet. Congress urges reform of the TWIC application process by the end of 2012 to avoid burdens on workers and businesses. The deployment of TWIC readers should be required promptly for security purposes. Port Security Grant funds for TWIC projects should not expire before the final TWIC reader rule is issued. SEC. 3. TWIC APPLICATION REFORM. The Secretary of Homeland Security must reform the TWIC enrollment process to require only one in-person visit, except in special circumstances. Passed by the House of Representatives on June 28, 2012."
