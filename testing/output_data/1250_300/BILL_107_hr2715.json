The Congress finds that the greater Southern California metropolitan region, the second largest urban concentration in the US, lacks sufficient park and recreation lands per population. This deficiency hinders access to nature, leading to health benefits and reduced crime opportunities. The Rim of the Valley Corridor surrounding the San Fernando and La Crescenta valleys offers various benefits like environmental protection, recreational opportunities, and economic assets to Southern California. It includes endangered habitats and ecotones in different mountain ranges, deserving increased protection for public benefit in the future. The Rim of the Valley Corridor, including the San Gabriel Mountains within the Angeles National Forest, contains endangered habitats and ecotones. Privately owned lands in the area are crucial for scenic, environmental, and recreational values and should be protected through voluntary incentives. The State of California has adopted the Rim of the Valley Master Plan for the region. The State of California has adopted the Rim of the Valley Master Plan to protect the unique natural and recreational resources in the area. However, efforts have been hindered by a lack of financial resources, technical assistance, and resource management expertise that could be provided by the Federal Government. The Rim of the Valley Master Plan in California aims to protect natural resources, but lacks Federal support for financial resources and expertise. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a special resource study of the Rim of the Valley Corridor in Southern California to evaluate its national significance and feasibility of becoming part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The study will follow criteria for potential inclusion in the National Park System and involve consultation with relevant advisory committees. The Rim of the Valley Corridor and Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area Advisory Committee is established to advise the Secretary of the Interior on the study and recommend boundaries for a new recreation area. The boundaries should reflect the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and include the lands, waters, and interests of the Rim of the Valley Corridor. The Committee, consisting of 24 members appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, is tasked with submitting a recommendation within 365 days for the boundaries of a Santa Monica Mountains and Rim of the Valley National Recreation Area. Public participation in and comment on the recommendation is encouraged. The Committee, with 24 members appointed by the Secretary of the Interior, includes 17 representatives of local governments in the vicinity of the recreation area, nominated by various city councils and boards of supervisors. The city councils of Calabasas, Burbank, Glendale, La Canada-Flintridge, Pasadena, Sierra Madre, South Pasadena, Santa Clarita, Moorpark, and the board of supervisors of Los Angeles county, along with other officials, represent the East Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor. The Committee consists of representatives from various organizations such as the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, Angeles National Forest, California Department of Parks and Recreation, Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District, Conejo Recreation and Park District, and Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District. The Committee selects a chairperson and vice chairperson from its members. Members receive compensation and expenses.
