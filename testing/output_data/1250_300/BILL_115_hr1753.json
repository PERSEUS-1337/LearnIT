    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Opportunities for Fairness in Farming Act of 2017\". Congress finds that generic checkoff programs are intended to increase demand for agricultural commodities and benefit all producers. However, these programs have been found to use funds to influence policy, leading to conflicts of interest and harming many producers. Strict separation between checkoff boards and policy entities is necessary to prevent misuse of funds. Conflicts of interest in checkoff programs allow special interests to benefit some producers at the expense of others. Prohibiting such conflicts is necessary for lawful operation. Checkoff programs should promote commodities without damaging others or engaging in anticompetitive behavior. Lack of transparency enables abuses, so requiring transparency in fund expenditure is crucial to prevent and uncover misconduct. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"Board\" as an entity for carrying out checkoff programs, and \"checkoff program\" as a promotion and research program for agricultural commodities without specific producers or brands mentioned. It includes programs like the Cotton Research and Promotion Act, Potato Research and Promotion Act, Egg Research and Consumer Information Act, Beef Research and Information Act, Wheat and Wheat Foods Research and Nutrition Education Act, and Floral Research and Consumer Information Act. The curr_chunk lists various agricultural acts such as the Honey Research Act and the Mushroom Promotion Act. The curr_chunk lists agricultural acts including the Lime Research Act, Soybean Promotion Act, Fluid Milk Promotion Act, Fresh Cut Flowers Act, Sheep Promotion Act, Federal Agriculture Improvement Act, Commodity Promotion Act, Canola and Rapeseed Act, and National Kiwifruit Act. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms like \"conflict of interest\" and \"Secretary\" under various agricultural acts such as the Canola and Rapeseed Research Act and the Hass Avocado Promotion Act.
