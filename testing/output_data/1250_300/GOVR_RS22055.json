Senators Grassley and Gregg emphasized the need for the attorneys' fee amendment to prevent abuses of due process rights and ensure taxpayer dollars go towards educating children.

This information includes the name of the child, the child's address and school, or available contact information in the case of a homeless child, a description of the problem, including facts relating to the issue, and a proposed resolution to the problem.

Murphy. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA did not include explicit language authorizing recovery of experts' fees by prevailing parents. The Department of Education declined to add a regulatory provision on the subject."
