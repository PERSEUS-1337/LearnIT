    "content": "The report analyzes forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress through two legislative vehicles, the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill. These provisions focus on managing forested federal land, federal programs for nonfederal lands, and forestry research. The report primarily examines the provisions related to the management of forested federal land by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. This report analyzes forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress, focusing on the management of forested federal land by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. It covers laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act, which authorize specific forest management activities and procedural requirements. The provisions affect project planning, wildland fire management, forest management and restoration programs, and miscellaneous activities on federal lands. The report analyzes forest management provisions enacted in the 115th Congress for forested federal land by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. It covers project planning, wildland fire management, forest management and restoration programs, and miscellaneous activities. Approximately 145 million acres of the 193-million-acre National Forest System consists of forests and woodlands, with a focus on protecting watersheds and providing a continuous timber supply for US citizens. The National Forest System consists of 145 million acres of forests and woodlands, managed to protect watersheds, provide timber, and allow for recreation, grazing, energy development, and wildlife protection. The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 added additional uses like recreation and wildlife protection. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 requires comprehensive land and resource management plans for each unit. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 requires the Forest Service to develop and update land and resource management plans for each National Forest System unit. These plans must involve public input and comply with various laws such as NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. Forest plans outline desired resource conditions but do not authorize specific on-the-ground actions. Projects, such as timber harvests and trail maintenance, implement the forest plans and must align with resource objectives. The Forest Service develops and updates land management plans for National Forest System units, involving public input and complying with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. Projects like timber harvests and trail maintenance must align with resource objectives and be implemented using FS procedures to ensure compliance with applicable requirements. BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands, primarily in the western United States, with 38 million acres being woodlands and forests managed under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield. The 2.6 million acres of Oregon and California Railroad Lands are forested lands managed under a different framework. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) directs the management of Oregon and California Railroad (O&C) Lands and Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) Lands for permanent forest production, timber provision, watershed protection, recreation, and economic stability. BLM must prepare and maintain resource management plans in compliance with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA for on-the-ground activities. Compliance with NEPA involves identifying environmental impacts before final decisions are made. NEPA requires federal agencies to assess environmental impacts of proposed actions, leading to preparation of an EIS or EA/FONSI. Agencies must evaluate impacts and alternatives, including a no-action alternative, to inform decision-making. Categorical exclusions (CEs) cover actions with no significant effects. The EIS or EA/FONSI analysis informs agency decision-making on proposals. Categorical exclusions (CEs) are actions with no significant environmental impact, identified by agencies based on past experience. Some CEs are established by Congress, and agencies determine additional documentation requirements. Each agency lists actions requiring an EIS, EA/FONSI, or CE approval in their NEPA procedures. The decision to approve the proposal as a Categorical Exclusion (CE) is based on agency-specific procedures implementing NEPA. Federal agencies identify actions requiring an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), an Environmental Assessment (EA) resulting in a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), or approval using a CE. Extraordinary circumstances, such as flood plains, endangered species habitats, and archaeological sites, may preclude the use of a CE for certain projects. NEPA serves as a framework to identify environmental impacts and compliance requirements for projects. The NEPA process serves as a framework to identify environmental impacts and compliance requirements for projects, including potential impacts triggering additional environmental review under laws like ESA and NHPA. HFRA aims to expedite planning for hazardous fuel reduction projects on NFS and BLM lands to reduce wildfire risk by removing biomass that fuels fires. HFRA aims to reduce wildfire risk by removing or modifying biomass that fuels fires through specific hazardous fuel reduction projects. Authorized projects cover up to 20 million acres of federal land and include methods like prescribed fire and mechanical measures. An At-Risk Community is defined as an area with infrastructure near federal land at risk of large-scale wildland fire disturbance events. Authorized Hazardous Fuels Reduction Projects (HFRA Projects) aim to reduce wildfire risk through methods like prescribed fire, wildland fire use, and mechanical methods. Fire Regimes and Condition Classes are used to prioritize and assess these projects. HFRA projects can be conducted in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) and areas with moderate or significant departure from historical fire regimes. HFRA projects focus on reducing wildfire risk in specific areas like steep slopes, municipal watersheds, and lands damaged by wind, ice, insects, or disease. Projects must align with land management plans and prioritize thinning, prescribed fire, or tree removal to modify fire behavior while preserving large or old-growth trees. FS must establish an objection process for proposed HFRA projects. The Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA) focuses on reducing wildfire risk by removing small-diameter trees to modify fire behavior and retaining large or old-growth trees for fire resiliency. HFRA mandates an objection process for proposed projects, where objections must be filed within 30 days of the agency's publication of draft decision documents. Judicial review is available if the objector is unsatisfied after the administrative review process, but only issues raised during public comment periods and administrative reviews can be considered. The Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA) mandates an objection process for proposed projects, with objections required to be filed within 30 days of the agency's publication of draft decision documents. Judicial review in federal court is the next step after exhausting the administrative review process. Only issues raised during public comment periods and administrative reviews can be considered during judicial proceedings, unless significant new issues arise. The Agricultural Act of 2014 added a new Section 602 to HFRA, authorizing the establishment of landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the National Forest System (NFS) by state governors and designated by the Chief of the Forest Service. Non-HFRA projects may be declared emergency situations by the Chief of the Forest Service, allowing for direct implementation after the decision document is published. The Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA) mandates an objection process for proposed projects, with objections required to be filed within 30 days of the agency's publication of draft decision documents. The Agricultural Act of 2014 added a new Section 602 to HFRA, authorizing the establishment of landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the National Forest System (NFS) by state governors and designated by the Chief of the Forest Service. FS has designated approximately 74.5 million acres nationwide as insect and disease treatment areas. These areas prioritize projects that reduce the risk or extent of insect or disease infestations and must be developed through a collaborative process with state, local, and tribal government collaboration. Projects planned within the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) under the Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA) require analysis of the proposed action and one action alternative. If the proposed action is within 1.5 miles of an at-risk community, only analysis of the proposed action is needed. Outside of the WUI, the no-action alternative must also be considered. Congress authorized the Forest Service to identify eligible National Forest System (NFS) areas for designation as Insect and Disease (I&D) areas, prioritize projects in those areas, and implement them through an expedited process. In some states, all eligible lands were designated. Congress authorized the Forest Service to identify eligible National Forest System (NFS) areas for designation as Insect and Disease (I&D) areas, prioritize projects, and implement them through an expedited process. As of March 2019, 206 projects across 59 national forests and 18 states have been proposed under these authorities. Some projects are evaluated using different analysis procedures, including a categorical exclusion (CE) for certain projects aimed at reducing insect or disease infestations within I&D areas. The 2018 Farm Bill added hazardous fuels projects as a priority project category eligible for implementation through the Farm Bill CE, exempt from pre-decisional administrative review objections. Projects must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements or consider best available science, retain old-growth trees, and be developed collaboratively. New permanent roads are prohibited, temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years, and projects cannot exceed 3,000 acres. Maintenance and repairs of existing roads are allowed as needed. Projects must be located within designated I&D areas and cannot exceed 3,000 acres. New permanent roads are prohibited, and any temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years. Maintenance and repairs of existing roads are allowed as needed. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 Farm Bill expanded HFRA authorities to include fuel reduction projects and fire breaks. FS policy requires documenting decisions using the Farm Bill CE through a decision memorandum. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 Farm Bill expanded HFRA authorities to include fuel reduction projects and fire breaks, allowing for the planning and implementation of projects within I&D areas. The Farm Bill CE can be used for hazardous fuels reduction projects meeting eligibility requirements. Additionally, new statutory NEPA CE was established, and interagency consultation requirements were affected. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 Farm Bill established new statutory CEs to expedite planning and implementation of specific projects within I&D areas. The Farm Bill CE is available for wildfire resilience projects for FS, while a CE for projects related to sage grouse or mule deer habitat is available for both FS and BLM. These new CEs allow for larger projects up to 3,000 to 4,500 acres. The potential impact of these CEs on project planning, implementation, and forest management goals is uncertain. The new statutory CEs established by the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 Farm Bill allow for larger projects up to 3,000 to 4,500 acres. Some believe that larger project sizes will help achieve landscape-level goals more efficiently, while others are concerned about conducting landscape-scale projects without detailed environmental reviews. A 2014 Government Accountability Office report found that using a CE for environmental review can expedite project planning and implementation, improving agency efficiency. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 Farm Bill established new statutory CEs for larger projects up to 3,000 to 4,500 acres. Concerns exist about conducting landscape-scale projects without detailed environmental reviews. The Wildfire Resilience CE is similar to the Farm Bill CE, requiring projects to be located within designated areas on NFS lands and comply with specific eligibility requirements. The Wildfire Resilience CE allows for projects up to 3,000 acres on NFS lands, prioritizing locations within the WUI or areas with high wildfire hazard potential. Projects must meet specific eligibility requirements, preserve old-growth trees, and involve a collaborative process. Road construction is limited, with temporary roads to be decommissioned within three years. Seven projects were proposed in FY2018 under this authority. The Wildfire Resilience CE requires projects to meet specific location and purpose requirements, including being within designated I&D areas and prioritizing projects within the WUI. It is available for hazardous fuels reduction projects and specifies criteria for projects outside the WUI. The CE also mandates the preservation of old-growth trees and collaboration in project planning. In FY2018, seven projects were proposed under this authority. The Farm Bill CE is available for insect and disease infestation projects, while the Wildfire Resilience CE focuses on hazardous fuels reduction. The 2018 farm bill directs the establishment of a CE for sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat projects on NFS and BLM lands, with specific requirements for applying the CE. The 2018 farm bill establishes a CE for sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat projects on NFS and BLM lands. Projects must protect, restore, or improve habitat in a sagebrush steppe ecosystem for either species, or both if located in both habitats. Specific activities include removal of nonnative vegetation, targeted grazing, and herbicide use. Projects must comply with existing resource management plans and DOI Secretarial Order 3336, and may not occur in designated wilderness areas or be larger than 4,500 acres. The 2018 farm bill establishes a CE for sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat projects on NFS and BLM lands. Projects must protect, restore, or improve habitat in a sagebrush steppe ecosystem for either species, or both if located in both habitats. Specific activities include removal of nonnative vegetation, targeted grazing, and herbicide use. Projects must comply with existing resource management plans and DOI Secretarial Order 3336, and may not occur in designated wilderness areas or be larger than 4,500 acres. The law directs each agency to apply its respective extraordinary circumstances procedures in determining whether to use the CE. In addition, the law directs the agencies to consider the relative efficacy of landscape-scale habitat projects, the likelihood of continued population declines in the absence of landscape-scale vegetation management, and the need for habitat restoration. The agencies must also develop a 20-year monitoring plan prior to using the CE. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to conserve endangered or threatened species and their ecosystems. Administered by FWS and NMFS, it lists species as endangered or threatened based on extinction risk assessments. Once listed, prohibitions apply, but federal agencies can seek exemptions. Agencies must ensure actions do not harm listed species or their habitats and consult with FWS or NMFS if needed. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult with FWS or NMFS to ensure that their actions do not harm listed species or their habitats. This consultation, known as a Section 7 consultation, is not required for actions dictated by statute. If an action is found to jeopardize a species or its critical habitat, the Secretary must suggest alternatives to avoid harm. The majority of consultations result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land and resource management plans in Oregon. It specifies that updating forest plans on certain lands does not require consultation unless specific conditions are met. This does not affect consultation requirements for projects implementing forest plans. The FY2018 omnibus made controversial changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land and resource management plans in Oregon. The changes allow for more flexibility in implementing plans by not requiring consultation for existing plans due to species listing or critical habitat designation, aiming to reduce delays in plan and project implementation. The FY2018 omnibus made controversial changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land and resource management plans in Oregon, allowing for more flexibility in plan implementation without requiring consultation for existing plans due to species listing or critical habitat designation. Critics argue that this could harm species and their habitat, while proponents believe consultation is still required for individual projects under the plan. The federal government's wildland fire management responsibilities include various activities such as fuel reduction, preparedness, prevention, detection, response, suppression, and recovery. Recent legislative changes in the FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill have impacted how funding is appropriated for wildfire suppression and added requirements for wildfire risk mapping and reporting. These changes also affected hazardous fuel reduction programs for the Forest Service and Department of the Interior. Congress provides discretionary appropriations for wildland fire management to both agencies through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Funding for wildland fire management is provided by Congress to the Forest Service (FS) and Department of the Interior (DOI) through discretionary appropriations. The funding is allocated to the Office of Wildland Fire and four agencies within DOI. The Suppression Operations program within FS and DOI's Wildland Fire Management account funds wildfire control on federal land, including firefighter salaries, equipment, and incident support. If suppression funding is depleted, funds can be transferred from other accounts. Appropriations for wildland fire management have increased significantly since the 1990s. Overall, appropriations to FS and DOI for wildland fire management have increased considerably since the 1990s, with a significant portion of the increase related to rising suppression costs. This often leads to fire borrowing when more funds are needed than appropriated, prompting concerns about the impact on other agency programs. Congress has provided supplemental appropriations to repay transferred funds and replenish wildfire accounts, sometimes waiving procedural and budgetary controls. The 115th Congress explored options to provide wildfire spending outside of these constraints. The 115th Congress explored options to provide wildfire spending outside of procedural and budgetary controls. In the FY2018 omnibus, a new mechanism for suppression funding was established, known as the wildfire funding fix. Discretionary spending is currently subject to statutory limits under the Budget Control Act of 2011, with sequestration enforced if limits are exceeded. Certain spending is exempt from these limits for emergency requirements. The FY2018 omnibus established a new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations, exempt from discretionary spending limits. This adjustment applies to emergency and unpredictable aspects of wildland firefighting, including support, response, and stabilization activities. It starts in FY2020 and continues through FY2027, with funding above the FY2015 baseline subject to the adjustment. The new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations, starting in FY2020 and continuing through FY2027, exempts funding above the FY2015 baseline from discretionary spending limits. The adjustment is capped each fiscal year, starting at $2.25 billion in FY2020 and increasing to $2.95 billion in FY2027. Congress can appropriate additional funding for suppression operations above the baseline, effectively outside of the discretionary limits established in the BCA for FY2020 and FY2021. The wildfire funding fix allows for a baseline of $1.39 billion for suppression operations, with the potential for Congress to appropriate an additional $2.25 billion in FY2020, totaling up to $3.64 billion. This adjustment exempts funding above the FY2015 baseline from discretionary spending limits until FY2021, potentially easing budget process barriers for wildfire suppression funds. The wildfire funding fix exempts funding above the FY2015 baseline from discretionary spending limits until FY2021. If new limits are set between FY2022 and FY2027, the wildfire adjustment would still apply. However, if no new limits are enacted, the adjustment would no longer be in effect. Congress may need to provide fire borrowing authority to agencies once the wildfire adjustment starts in FY2020. Congress would be notified if additional funding is needed for wildfire suppression operations, but further action would be required to ensure agencies have access to funds for continued federal services in response to wildfires. The wildfire funding fix raises concerns for Congress regarding accountability, oversight, and inflationary factors. It is a temporary procedural change that does not address various concerns related to suppression costs and wildland fire management. The Fire Modeling Institute developed a Wildfire Hazard Potential index to aid in strategic planning and fuel management decisions. The Fire Modeling Institute developed a Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) index and map to inform strategic planning and fuel management decisions at a national scale. Approximately 226 million acres in the continental United States are classified at high or very high WHP, with 53% being federal land. High or very high WHP reflects fuels with a higher probability of extreme fire behavior. The WHP data can approximate the relative wildfire risk to resources and assets. The FY2018 omnibus directs FS to pair the Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) data with appropriate spatial data to approximate wildfire risk for resources and assets. Section 210 requires FS to develop web-based wildfire hazard severity maps for community use within two years. Reports to Congress on wildland fire management are also mandated by the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill. The omnibus bill requires the Department of the Interior to submit an annual report within 90 days after using the wildfire funding fix. The report must detail specific funding obligations, outlays, and overall wildland fire management spending, including analysis by fire size, costs, and regional location. It should also identify risk-based factors influencing suppression management decisions and analyze a statistically significant sample of large fires for cost drivers and effectiveness. The report will be prepared in consultation with the OMB Director and submitted to relevant House and Senate committees. The 2018 farm bill mandates a report to Congress on wildfire, insect infestation, and disease prevention on federal land, due annually within 180 days of enactment. It includes analysis on various measures like cost drivers, effectiveness of fuel treatments, and preparedness activities. The report must be submitted to specific House and Senate committees and cover the number of treated acres, fire risk levels, and wildfire data. The 2018 farm bill mandates an annual report to Congress on wildfire, insect infestation, and disease prevention on federal land. The report includes data on acres treated, fire risk levels, wildfire impact, federal response time, timber production, road maintenance needs, and measures for water quality and ecosystem resilience. Forest restoration activities aim to enhance resilience and resistance to disturbances like wildfires and infestations by establishing necessary ecological processes. Forest restoration activities aim to enhance resilience and resistance to disturbance events such as insect infestation, wildfire, ice, or windstorm. This may involve thinning trees to reduce density, using prescribed fire to manage vegetation buildup, and facilitating post-fire recovery. The authority for conducting restoration projects comes from laws like FLPMA for BLM and responsibilities outlined in various acts for FS. Congress has also authorized specific forest restoration programs for FS. Forest restoration programs authorized by Congress for FS and BLM aim to secure maximum benefits and promote plant and animal diversity. The 115th Congress established new programs for FS and amended existing ones to allow partnerships with stakeholders for identifying and performing forest management activities. These programs are part of FS's \"Shared Stewardship\" approach to address landscape-scale land management concerns and accelerate forest restoration efforts. The Forest Service's \"Shared Stewardship\" approach includes programs to accelerate forest restoration, mitigate insect infestations, and reduce wildfire risks. These programs offer benefits to surrounding communities, such as supporting local industries and promoting collaboration. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) was established by the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 to fund restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes through transparent and inclusive collaboration processes. Stakeholder support is generally strong, although some concerns have been raised. The law requires collaboratively developed restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes, including NFS lands over 50,000 acres. Proposals must incorporate best available science, maintain old-growth stands, reduce hazardous fuels, and not establish new permanent roads. Annual accomplishments and 5-year status reports are mandated. The law mandates collaboratively developed restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes on NFS lands over 50,000 acres. Proposals must include best available science, maintain old-growth stands, reduce hazardous fuels, and avoid new permanent roads. An annual accomplishments report and 5-year status reports are required. The Secretary of Agriculture can select and fund up to 10 proposals per fiscal year, with a funding commitment of up to $4 million per year for up to 10 years. The program received $40 million annually in appropriations from FY2014 through FY2019. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) received a funding commitment of up to $4 million per year for up to 10 years, but funds cannot be used for project planning. The program was successful in achieving land management objectives, contributing to local economies, and fostering collaboration. The dedicated funding provided stability for project implementation, although it may divert resources from other NFS lands. While the program has economic benefits, it falls short in creating new markets for wood products and reducing treatment costs. Collaboration with stakeholders has been positive, but some feel it has focused on simple issues and made limited progress. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) received funding of up to $4 million annually for 10 years, with limitations on the use of funds for project planning. The program has been successful in achieving land management goals, supporting local economies, and fostering collaboration. However, it has been criticized for not creating new markets for wood products or reducing treatment costs. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023, allowing for potential extension of projects and funding for additional projects if Congress appropriates to the new authorization level. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into good neighbor agreements (GNAs) with state governments for restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands. Activities include treating trees, reducing fuels, and improving forest health. The authorization did not include construction. The 2014 farm bill authorized FS and BLM to enter into good neighbor agreements (GNAs) with state governments for restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands, including tree treatments, fuel reduction, and forest health improvement. The agreements do not cover construction activities and must comply with federal laws like NEPA. Master Agreements (MAs) between states and FS or BLM outline the general scope, while Supplemental Project Agreements (SPAs) detail specific project terms. FS has executed 48 MAs and 105 SPAs in multiple states, covering 82 national forests. The FS has executed 48 MAs and 105 SPAs in multiple states, covering 82 national forests for project implementation. The GNAs focus on specific project types like timber production, wildlife, hazardous fuels management, and other activities. The good neighbor authority has been successful in enhancing state-federal relationships and performing cross boundary restoration work, but some states have concerns about sustained future work. Changes to the good neighbor authority were enacted in the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill, allowing for forest restoration activities to include road construction and other services on defined NFS roads. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill expanded the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) to include federally recognized Indian tribes and county governments for forest restoration activities. Funds from timber sales under GNA projects can be retained by states for additional projects until FY2023. Payments made by counties under GNA projects are not subject to revenue-sharing laws. The expansion of GNA may increase opportunities for cross-boundary restoration work and leverage nonfederal resources, but could also lead to increased administrative demands on agencies like FS or BLM. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) was expanded to include tribes and counties for forest restoration activities, allowing states to retain timber sale funds for projects until FY2023. Concerns include increased administrative demands on agencies like FS or BLM and the distribution of timber sale receipts. Stewardship end-result contracting allows FS and BLM to enter into multi-year contracts to achieve land management goals. FS and BLM can combine timber sale contracts with service contracts to achieve land management goals, such as improving water quality, forest health, and wildlife habitats. Excess revenue from timber sales can be deposited into a Stewardship Contracting Fund for use on other projects without further appropriation. Contracts can be awarded on a best-value basis, considering past performance. Stewardship contracting allows FS and BLM to use excess revenue for other projects without additional appropriation. Contracts can be awarded based on best value, considering past performance and other factors. Annual reports are required on the progress of stewardship contracts, which are generally well-received by stakeholders for increasing restoration goals and collaborative relationships. Some stakeholders note economic benefits, while others express concerns about the removal of ecologically important trees. Some concerns exist regarding the markets for woody biomass and restoration by-products, including the incentive to remove ecologically important trees for funding service work. Issues also arise with the distribution of receipts from stewardship contracts and the upfront financial obligations. Despite improvements in contract integration and record-keeping, a 2015 USDA OIG report highlighted problems with FS' contract administration and record-keeping related to stewardship contracts. The 2015 USDA OIG report identified issues with FS' contract administration and record-keeping for stewardship contracts. New guidance was published in 2016 in response to the report's findings. The FY2018 omnibus authorized FS and BLM to enter into 20-year stewardship contracts in specific fire regime areas, with a procurement preference for innovative forest product use and the inclusion of cancellation ceilings. The law allows FS and BLM to include cancellation ceilings in stewardship contracts, with funds obligated in stages. Excess revenues can be used to cover liabilities from cancelled contracts. Congressional notification is required for cancellation ceilings over $25 million without proposed funding. This provision aims to address concerns about upfront financial obligations and promote market certainty for forest products industries. The NFS has potential benefits in using excess revenue to offset costs and implementing 20-year stewardship contracts. However, there are concerns about inadequate watershed programs, including lack of water quality data and inconsistent national approach. FS is working on developing long-term performance measures and prioritizing watershed management on NFS lands. The Forest Service (FS) has been working on outcome-based performance measures to improve water quality and habitat on NFS lands. They developed a Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) to classify and prioritize watersheds, with plans for restoration actions. However, a 2017 USDA OIG report identified management inadequacies in the WCF program. The 2018 farm bill codified the WCF program, assigning specific responsibilities and priorities to improve watershed management. The 2018 farm bill codified the Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) program, assigning responsibilities for evaluating and classifying watershed conditions, identifying priority watersheds for protection and restoration, and developing restoration action plans. It also allows for emergency designation to prioritize watershed rehabilitation after significant wildfire impact. The 2018 farm bill authorized the establishment of a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing for cooperative agreements for watershed restoration and enhancement purposes. This includes improving fish, wildlife, and other resources on NFS lands within the watershed. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS lands, allowing FS to enter into partnerships to protect and restore municipal water sources. FS can develop a water source management plan with nonfederal partners and conduct forest management activities to protect water supplies and restore forest health. The law authorizes FS to accept cash, donations, and services from partners to implement the plan. The 2018 farm bill authorized FS to accept various forms of investment and assistance from partners to implement water source management plans on NFS lands. It also established a Water Source Protection Fund to match partner donations, with $10 million in annual appropriations authorized through FY2023. Additionally, the bill included provisions related to federal forest land designations, land acquisition, special land use authorizations, Secure Rural Schools Act payments, and forest management on tribal lands. Section 8626 designated new wilderness areas in NFS lands in Tennessee. Section 8626 of the 2018 farm bill designated new wilderness areas in NFS lands in Tennessee, including the establishment of the Upper Bald River Wilderness on the Cherokee National Forest and expansions to existing wilderness areas. These areas are to be managed in accordance with the Wilderness Act, prohibiting most commercial activities and motorized access. The bill also enacted provisions changing how FS and/or BLM acquire, exchange, or dispose of federal land. The 2018 farm bill included provisions that modified specific authorities for FS and BLM regarding the acquisition, exchange, or disposal of federal land. For example, it established new programs for leasing isolated parcels for administrative sites and reauthorized programs for selling or exchanging BLM lands. Additionally, it reauthorized the Forest Service Facility Realignment and Enhancement program and modified the Small Tracts Act. The 2018 farm bill expanded eligibility requirements for the Small Tracts Act program and authorized exchanges or sales for specific parcels. The bill also allowed the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to issue rights-of-way for the use of BLM and NFS lands for various purposes, including water infrastructure, electricity generation, and transportation of liquids and gases. The 2018 farm bill expanded eligibility for the Small Tracts Act program and authorized rights-of-way for various purposes on BLM and NFS lands, including water infrastructure, electricity generation, and transportation of liquids and gases. FS and BLM charge fees for processing applications and annual land use rental fees based on land value and type of use. The 115th Congress enacted provisions directing FS to update their process and fee schedule for issuing special use authorizations for communication sites and established a pilot process for activities within utility ROWs. Concerns about wildfire ignitions within electricity ROWs were addressed, with power line ignitions associated with fires burning larger areas due to weather conditions and vegetation contact. Administrative processes may hinder ROW permit-holders from conducting necessary maintenance activities. Some believe that weather conditions and administrative processes hinder ROW permit-holders from conducting necessary maintenance activities to prevent power line ignitions. The 115th Congress provisions aim to improve the process for obtaining approvals for vegetation management projects on federal lands within ROWs, but concerns remain about balancing project implementation speed with accountability. Provisions also address responsibilities for wildfire suppression costs and liability for damages within ROWs. Some provisions in the 115th Congress address responsibilities for wildfire suppression costs and liability for damages within Rights-of-Way (ROWs) on federal lands. Concerns exist regarding the potential implications for the federal government or others bearing a disproportionate share of the costs. Section 8705 of the 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations revising the process for special use authorizations for communications uses on National Forest System (NFS) lands. Section 8705 of the 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations revising the process for special use authorizations for communications uses on NFS lands. The law specified that the new process must be streamlined, uniform, and standardized, applications must be considered and granted on a competitive and non-discriminatory basis, and lease terms must be a minimum of 15 years. Regulations must establish a fee structure based on processing costs, with fees deposited into a new Treasury account for managing communication sites. Activities include preparing needs assessments or programmatic analyses for communication sites, developing management plans and training, and improving access to communication sites. Section 211 of the FY2018 omnibus amended FLPMA and established a new Section 512 for Vegetation Management, Facility Inspection, and Operation and Maintenance on Federal Land Containing Electric Transmission and Distribution Facilities. The law directed FS and BLM to issue guidance for planning and implementing vegetation management, facility inspections, and operation and maintenance activities within electric transmission and distribution ROWs. Owners can develop and submit plans for approval by the appropriate Secretary and conduct activities within their ROW pursuant to an approved plan. The law in Section 211 of the FY2018 omnibus amended FLPMA to establish regulations for vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance on federal land with electric transmission and distribution facilities. It allows eligible ROW permit holders to develop and submit plans for approval by the appropriate Secretary and conduct activities within their ROW. Owners may also conduct certain management activities without an approved plan in specific circumstances. FS and BLM are directed to identify NEPA categorical exclusions for these activities and develop training programs for employees. The law also addresses ROW permit holder liabilities related to vegetation management activities. The FY2018 omnibus established regulations for vegetation management on federal land with electric transmission facilities. It prohibits strict liability for damages exceeding $500,000 for activities conducted by ROW holders under certain conditions. A pilot program for utility ROW permit holders on NFS land was also established, with specific requirements and a reporting mandate to Congress within four years. The law established a pilot program for utility right-of-way (ROW) permit holders on National Forest System (NFS) lands, allowing them to develop vegetation management plans and conduct projects within and up to 75 feet from the ROW. Participants must adhere to regulations for fire prevention and vegetation removal, and may be responsible for project costs. The Forest Service may contribute funds, and participants must reimburse for wildfire suppression costs and damage to FS resources. The FS is required to submit a program status report to Congress every two years. The pilot program for utility right-of-way (ROW) permit holders on National Forest System (NFS) lands requires participants to submit a program status report to Congress every two years. Participants must reimburse the Forest Service for wildfire suppression costs and damage to FS resources if caused by their operations, with a reimbursement limit of $500,000 in certain circumstances. The program differs from the FY2018 omnibus provisions for electricity ROWs, as it also includes natural gas and related infrastructure. The 2018 farm bill pilot program for utility right-of-way (ROW) permit holders on National Forest System (NFS) lands includes electricity, natural gas, and related infrastructure. Participants have limited responsibilities for wildfire and vegetation management, with capped liability costs. Counties with NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands receive payments based on prior year revenue, with an optional payment system authorized by SRS. SRS payments are allocated among three categories for funding education, roads, projects on jurisdictional lands, and specified county programs. Title II of the 2018 farm bill established Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) to provide advice and recommendations to agencies regarding projects on jurisdictional lands. RACs consist of 15 members representing various interests, and payments were extended through FY2015 at 95% of the previous year's level. Payments were disbursed after the fiscal year ended. The Secure Rural Schools (SRS) payments were extended through FY2015 at 95% of the previous year's level. The last authorized SRS payments were disbursed in FY2016, followed by revenue-sharing payments in FY2017. The FY2018 omnibus reauthorized SRS payments for FY2017 and FY2018, with payments made in FY2018 and FY2019. Counties received a full SRS payment for FY2017, essentially made in two installments. The Secure Rural Schools (SRS) payments were reauthorized for FY2017 and FY2018, with payments made in two installments. The reauthorization also expanded the uses for Title III funds and made changes to the RAC membership requirements. The 2018 farm bill enacted changes to the SRS statute, establishing a pilot program for RAC member appointments in Montana and Arizona. The Tribal Forest Protection Act authorized the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to enter into agreements for forest protection on NFS and BLM lands. The Tribal Forest Protection Act (TFPA) allows the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to collaborate with federally recognized Indian tribes for forest projects on tribal lands or adjacent NFS and BLM lands. The TFPA evaluates tribe requests based on unique tribal factors and the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) enables tribes to manage federal Indian programs through self-determination contracts. The 2018 farm bill authorized federally recognized tribes to enter into self-determination contracts with the federal government for specified federal Indian programs. These contracts allow tribes to perform administrative functions of the TFPA on NFS land, with the Secretary of Agriculture carrying out delegated responsibilities. Congress may oversee implementation of the new laws and consider implications for federal forest management. The 115th Congress forestry provisions address concerns with federal forest management, including a backlog of treatments needed on NFS lands. The Forest Service aims to increase the scale and scope of forest management projects to address hazardous fuels accumulation and administrative process barriers. The Forest Service (FS) aims to increase the scale and scope of forest management projects, including forest restoration treatments. Administrative process barriers, such as agency decision-making processes related to the National Environmental Policy Act, funding levels, and training, hinder progress towards restoration goals. Provisions enacted by the 115th Congress aim to improve agency efficiencies in project planning and review processes. The 115th Congress enacted provisions to improve agency efficiencies in project planning and review processes, aiming to expedite hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration projects. Some stakeholders argue that expanding the use of Healthy Forests Restoration Act authorities could change the legal framework for federal forest management, making citizen participation more challenging and potentially exacerbating environmental impacts. Many stakeholders are concerned about the environmental impacts of expanding authorities under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. Issues regarding forest health and wildfire risks have been ongoing for decades, with various recommendations made to address hazardous fuel levels and improve federal land management strategies. The Forest Service has faced challenges in prioritizing, tracking, and reporting on hazardous fuels reduction projects. Concerns about project implementation have been ongoing, with a significant percentage of fuel management decisions being appealed or challenged. Academic studies suggest that more complex projects are more likely to face challenges. The Forest Service has encountered difficulties in managing hazardous fuels reduction projects, with a high number of decisions facing appeals or objections. Academic studies indicate that complex projects are more prone to challenges. Despite efforts to expedite project implementation through legislation like HFRA, the need for treatment in NFS areas continues to grow, prompting a search for ways to accelerate project pace. The effectiveness of streamlining agency decision-making under HFRA is debated, with some suggesting broader application of the approach. Comparisons of forest-related provisions in recent laws highlight changes in legislation. The forest-related provisions enacted by the FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill are compared to prior law, with a focus on provisions directly affecting forest management. The comparison tables provide a side-by-side overview of the changes in legislation."
