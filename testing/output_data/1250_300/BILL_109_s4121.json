    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PLANS.\" is a section heading related to the treatment of liability for specific multiple employer plans. If an eligible employer elects subsection (b), their liability for the applicable pension plan is determined under subsection (b). If not, it is determined under subsection (c). The employer can elect to spin off liability within 180 days after the enactment of the Act, transferring assets and liabilities to an eligible spunoff plan. The eligible spunoff plan determines the employer's liability for the applicable pension plan, in lieu of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The ongoing funding liability for an eligible spunoff plan is exempt from certain provisions until the plan ceases to be eligible. The employer maintaining the eligible spunoff plan is liable for ongoing contributions on the same terms as under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. This liability is in lieu of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the applicable pension plan. The interest rate for eligible spunoff plans is determined by specific sections of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code, using the third segment rate instead of the usual rate for plan years starting after December 31, 2007. The liability of employers for terminated eligible spunoff plans is determined under specific sections of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code. If a plan terminates before December 31, 2010, the employer's liability is determined according to certain assumptions and methods, in lieu of any other liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or the applicable pension plan. If an applicable pension plan is terminated under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, an eligible employer not electing spinoff will be liable to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in an amount equal to the adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities of the plan as of December 31, 2005. Adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities refer to the unfunded benefit liabilities of the plan. The term \"adjusted unfunded benefit liabilities\" refers to the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities of a plan, with interest assumptions based on specific rates. The term \"fractional portion\" represents the employer's required contributions to a pension plan for specific plan years. The \"portion\" is a fraction representing the employer's contributions to a pension plan for specific years. An \"applicable pension plan\" is a single employer plan established in Alaska with multiple contributing sponsors. The \"allocable portion\" is the ratio of liabilities and assets for eligible employers making an election. The \"allocable portion\" is the ratio of liabilities and assets in an applicable pension plan for eligible employers who participated in an eligible multiple employer plan after January 1, 2000."
