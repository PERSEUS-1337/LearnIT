    "content": "The \"Polar Bear Seas Protection Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes findings related to the protection of polar bear habitats. Congress finds that Americans value healthy oceans and wildlife, especially in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas of Alaska, which support a variety of endangered species. These ecosystems are crucial for the survival of Alaska Native cultures and are being impacted by climate change. The Arctic is experiencing significant changes due to climate change, impacting vital sea ice habitat for species like polar bears, walrus, and seals. In 2007, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act due to projected loss of sea ice. In 2008, the Department of the Interior missed a deadline to decide on providing protections to the polar bear, while also moving forward with oil and gas leasing in the Chukchi Sea Lease Sale 193 area, a polar bear habitat. The Department of the Interior must decide on listing the polar bear under the Endangered Species Act by May 15, 2008. Reports project a significant decline in polar bear population by the middle of the 21st century due to sea ice loss. Global warming poses a major threat to polar bears. The observed decline in Arctic sea ice may be underestimated by current models, impacting the future status of polar bears. Global warming is a major threat, with potential oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas posing additional risks to polar bears and marine life. The harsh environment of these seas makes oil recovery difficult, and the leasing plans overlap with vital polar bear habitat. The environmental impact statement for Lease Sale 193 in the Chukchi Sea highlights the risks of a large oil spill to polar bears, whales, and walruses. Onshore industrial activities to support offshore oil and gas development can harm important habitats and disturb denning polar bears and other wildlife. Oil and gas development threatens subsistence resources, public health, and wildlife survival. Tribal governments oppose offshore oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas due to threats to subsistence resources, public health, and cultural survival. Prohibition on leasing in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas. Prohibition on leasing in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas includes a restriction on offering or approving leasing, preleasing, or related activities in the Chukchi or Beaufort Sea marine and coastal ecosystems until missing information on living marine resources is identified by the National Research Council. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of establishing baseline information and determining potential impacts of oil and gas activities on plant and animal species, marine environments, and Alaskan Native communities. It also mentions the need for reports on the adequacy of environmental, public health, and cultural studies in providing this information. The curr_chunk discusses the evaluation of ongoing and completed studies by the Alaska environmental studies program to provide missing information on the impact of oil and gas activities. It also addresses the listing of polar bears as endangered species and the designation of critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act. The curr_chunk discusses the Secretary's actions regarding oil spill response gap analysis for arctic oil operations, including setting standards for oil recovery within 30 days. The Secretary's actions require oil recovery within 30 days after release, achieving 85 percent recovery before leasing or exploration, closing areas with response gaps, and setting requirements for oil operations. The Secretary's actions mandate oil spill prevention systems, operational restrictions, and wildlife impact assessments for oil and gas activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas. The Secretary mandates oil spill prevention systems, operational restrictions, and wildlife impact assessments for oil and gas activities in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas. Mitigation measures to avoid risks are identified, and response gap analysis calculates response operating limits for spill response systems. The analysis assesses local response capabilities, oil spill contingency plans, and factors that could limit a response in a specific location. It calculates the frequency, duration, and timing of limiting factors that may prevent achieving the oil spill recovery standard. The text chunk discusses the quantification of the percentage of time local conditions exceed spill response system limits to achieve the oil spill recovery standard."
