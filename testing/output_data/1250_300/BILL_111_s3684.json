    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cavernous Angioma CARE Center Act of 2010\". Cavernous angioma, also known as cerebral cavernous malformations, affects 1,500,000 people in the US. It is a blood vessel disease with vascular lesions in the brain and spinal cord. Detection is costly, and symptoms include neurological deficits, seizures, and stroke. Limited research means surgery is the only treatment option, leaving some individuals without options. Cavernous angioma, a blood vessel disease affecting 1,500,000 people in the US, has no treatment other than brain and spinal surgery. Some individuals are not surgery candidates, leading to a lack of treatment options. New Mexico has the highest population density of cavernous angioma due to a specific mutation, affecting tens of thousands. Other states with high rates include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, expresses concern over the disease. The National Institutes of Health supports biomedical research through extramural centers of excellence to understand complex biomedical systems and translate discoveries into clinical applications. There is a need for a Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center to address the public health threat posed by cavernous angioma in New Mexico and the US. A Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center is needed in New Mexico and the US to provide model medical care, facilitate research for a cure, and enhance medical care nationwide. The University of New Mexico is proposed as the location for the first centralized center due to existing programs and expertise. A Cavernous Angioma Care Center is established under SEC. 409K as part of the Public Health Service Act to provide specialized medical care and research opportunities. The University of New Mexico is proposed as the first location for this center. The Director of NIH will establish a Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico to conduct research and provide medical care for individuals with cavernous angioma. The center will include researchers, clinicians, and medical staff with expertise in various specialties such as headache, epilepsy, psychiatry, neuropsychology, and dermatology. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico will include specialists such as headache, epilepsy, psychiatry, neuropsychology, dermatology, nurse practitioners, nurse coordinators, research coordinators, clinical nurses, radiology specialists, vascular fellows, postdoctoral fellows, and genetic counselors. The center must be affiliated with a university medical center with an accredited medical school providing education and training in neurological diseases. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico offers education and training in neurological diseases, diagnosis, and treatment of cavernous angioma. It includes programs for postdoctoral research training, recruitment of researchers and clinicians, continuing medical education, patient advocacy, outreach, and public awareness campaigns. The Cavernous Angioma CARE Center aims to educate patients and healthcare professionals, organize conferences, develop communication tools, collaborate with research institutions, and establish an advisory board. The CARE Center, headed by a Director with expertise in cavernous angioma, aims to promote understanding and treatment of the condition. It will facilitate translational projects, collaborations for clinical trials, and establish an advisory board composed of individuals with relevant expertise. The Director of the CARE Center promotes understanding and treatment of cavernous angioma by providing high-quality care, encouraging participation in research studies, and developing the center as a model facility. The advisory board must report on activities biannually. The advisory board of the CARE Center must submit biannual reports to the Secretary, detailing progress, expenditures, and outcomes of the center. $2,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2011 to establish and operate the Care Center."
