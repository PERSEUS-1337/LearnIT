    "content": "The consent of Congress is given to an interstate forest fire protection compact known as \"THE GREAT PLAINS WILDLAND FIRE PROTECTION AGREEMENT.\" The purpose of this compact is to promote effective prevention and control of forest fires in the Great Plains region by providing for reciprocal aid in fighting forest fires among member states including South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, and Colorado. The interstate forest fire protection compact allows member states to cooperate in forest fire prevention and control. Each state appoints a compact administrator responsible for coordinating efforts with other states. Member states can request aid from each other in combating forest fires while ensuring protection at home. \"ARTICLE V of the interstate forest fire protection compact outlines the procedures for member states to request aid from each other in combating forest fires.\" \"Member states rendering outside aid under this compact have the same powers, duties, and immunities as comparable employees of the state receiving aid. They are not liable for any actions or equipment use while providing aid. The requesting state assumes all liability arising from the aid request. The aiding state must be reimbursed for any losses or expenses incurred during the operation.\" The compact ensures that member states providing aid will be reimbursed for any losses or expenses incurred during the operation. Workers compensation benefits must be available to all employees and contract firefighters sent to a requesting state. The term \"employee\" includes volunteers or auxiliaries within the forest fire fighting forces of the aiding state. Compact administrators may establish procedures for claims. The compact ensures reimbursement for losses incurred during operations. Procedures for claims and reimbursement will be formulated by compact administrators in accordance with member state laws. ARTICLE VI of the compact states that ratification does not allow any member state to reduce their forest fire fighting forces, equipment, or services. Each state must maintain adequate resources for fire protection as if the compact was not in place. The compact does not limit a state's power to prevent, control, and extinguish forest fires or enact laws for fire prevention. It also does not affect any cooperative relationships with the United States Forest Service. ``ARTICLE VII states that representatives of the United States Forest Service may attend meetings of the compact administrators. ARTICLE VIII allows for reciprocal aid in combating forest fires between states party to this compact and other regional compacts. ARTICLE IX specifies that the compact remains in force until a state takes action to withdraw, with a six-month notice period.''"
