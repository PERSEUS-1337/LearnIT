    "content": "One of the most controversial issues in U.S. foreign assistance is restrictions on funding for abortion and family planning activities abroad. The debate revolves around questions of whether recipients of U.S. aid perform abortions or engage in coercive practices with U.S. funds, and the impact of withholding funds on population growth and reproductive health services in developing countries. Congressional debates on these issues have been ongoing since the Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973. Members of Congress have introduced legislation to prohibit abortion in the U.S. and attach provisions to appropriations measures. Since Roe v. Wade, Congress has debated legislation to prohibit abortion in the U.S. and restrict federal funding for the practice. The controversy has extended to U.S. foreign assistance, leading to restrictions on abortion and family planning activities abroad. President Reagan implemented the \"Mexico City policy\" in 1984, requiring foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to refrain from performing or promoting abortion. The Mexico City policy, also known as \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance,\" requires foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they will not perform or promote abortion. The policy has been rescinded and reinstated by various Administrations, most recently by President Trump in 2017. Congressional debates continue on abortion and family planning restrictions in foreign assistance. City policy, known as \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" (PLGHA), or its reversal, is a controversial issue in federal funding for abortion and family planning activities in foreign assistance. This report examines legislative and executive branch policies that restrict U.S. funding of abortion or voluntary family planning activities abroad, including restrictions in foreign aid authorizations and appropriations. Legislation authorizing foreign aid establishes, continues, or modifies programs for a fixed or indefinite period. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) is the cornerstone of permanent foreign aid authorization law, divided into parts authorizing different types of assistance. Congress has routinely amended the FAA since 1961 but has not comprehensively reauthorized most programs since 1985, often due to debates on controversial issues like abortion and family planning. Since 1985, subsequent authorization bills for the FAA have often stalled due to debates on controversial issues like abortion and family planning. Congress annually considers appropriations measures to set spending levels for foreign assistance, with increasing significance in influencing how U.S. foreign aid is disbursed. These measures may include family planning or abortion-related restrictions. The links among the requirements and restrictions are complex, with some provisions added to other legislation for emphasis or to apply to additional categories of foreign aid not covered under the FAA. The Helms and Biden provisions are added to foreign assistance legislation for emphasis or to cover additional aid categories. Some restrictions stand alone, while others clarify existing ones. The Leahy amendment defines \"motivate\" in the Helms amendment, and the Livingston amendment clarifies prohibitions in the DeConcini amendment. Enacted legislative restrictions on U.S. funding of abortion and requirements for family planning programs abroad are listed chronologically. The Helms amendment prohibits the use of U.S. funds for abortions or coercion. Introduced in 1973 by Senator Jesse Helms, it was added to the FAA to prevent federal funds from being used for overseas abortions. Introduced by Senator Jesse Helms in 1973, the Helms amendment prohibits the use of U.S. funds for abortions overseas. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA and has been periodically enacted in foreign operations appropriations measures since FY1980. The Helms amendment prohibits the use of U.S. funds for abortions overseas. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA and has been periodically enacted in foreign operations appropriations measures since FY1980. In addition, Congress passed an amendment in 1978 specifying that U.S. foreign assistance cannot fund involuntary sterilizations or coercion of sterilizations. This provision is included in the FAA and State-Foreign Operations appropriations acts. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes an abortion restriction on Peace Corps funding, allowing exceptions for cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the mother's life. Funding for medical evacuation of Peace Corps volunteers for abortions is not restricted. Peace Corps covers the cost of evacuation to locations where abortions are legally permissible. The Biden amendment prohibits the use of funds for biomedical research related to abortion or involuntary sterilization. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA. Representative Mark Siljander introduced an amendment in 1981. The Siljander amendment, introduced in 1981, prohibits the use of U.S. funds for lobbying for or against abortion in foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA. This provision has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations acts, most recently in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. Additionally, in 1985, Congress enacted a provision specifying that the U.S. would only fund family planning projects that offer a range of family planning methods and services. Congress enacted a provision in the FY1986 Foreign Assistance and Related Programs Appropriations Act to fund family planning projects offering a variety of methods and services, in response to a Reagan Administration policy favoring \"natural\" family planning. The provision, introduced by Senator Dennis DeConcini, aims to reduce reliance on abortion in developing nations. This requirement has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations legislation since 1985, most recently in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The FY1986 Foreign Assistance and Related Programs Appropriations Act included a provision to fund family planning projects in response to a Reagan Administration policy. The provision aims to reduce reliance on abortion in developing nations and has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations since 1985. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act incorporates a provision that restricts the use of funds for countries or organizations that violate regulations related to abortions or involuntary sterilizations. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in 1985, prohibits funds from being used for organizations supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. It was a response to concerns about the UNFPA's program in China. This provision has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations since its inception. The UNFPA's program in China has been scrutinized for its involvement in coercive family planning programs. The US has withheld funding for UNFPA in 16 out of the past 34 years due to violations of the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act requires a determination on UNFPA's funding within 6 months of enactment, with evidence and criteria provided. The Obama Administration supported funding for UNFPA, emphasizing a commitment to international family planning. The George W. Bush Administration redirected funds from UNFPA to other foreign aid activities. The Obama Administration backed U.S. funding for UNFPA, emphasizing support for international family planning and women's health. Currently, the U.S. is not providing funding to UNFPA under Kemp-Kasten due to concerns about coercive practices in China. Congress has imposed conditions on U.S. funding for UNFPA, including restrictions on funds for programs in China. The U.S. has imposed conditions on funding for UNFPA, including restrictions on funds for programs in China. Funds for UNFPA cannot be used for a country program in China, and U.S. contributions must be kept separate from other accounts. UNFPA cannot use U.S. funding for abortions, and the Secretary of State must report on funds budgeted for China programs. If funds are allocated for China, they will be deducted from UNFPA's budget for that fiscal year. The Livingston amendment, introduced in 1986, prohibits the US from discriminating against organizations based on their religious or conscientious commitment to natural family planning when awarding grants. It is related to the DeConcini amendment, which mandates that family planning projects must offer a range of methods and services. This ensures that organizations supporting natural family planning methods cannot be discriminated against when receiving grants. The DeConcini amendment mandates that family planning projects offer a range of methods and services without discrimination. The Leahy amendment clarifies the Helms amendment regarding funds for abortions as a method of family planning. The Leahy provision addresses concerns about violating the Helms amendment by allowing information and counseling on all pregnancy options in foreign operations appropriations. It has been included in various forms since FY2018 and applies to all related Department of State funding legislation. In October 1998, Congress enacted the Tiahrt amendment as part of the FY1999 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. This amendment directs voluntary family planning projects supported by the United States to comply with specific requirements, including not implementing quotas or incentives for family planning acceptors. The Tiahrt amendment prohibits the use of incentives or rewards for family planning acceptors, ensures access to benefits regardless of family planning decisions, requires comprehensive information on chosen methods, and limits experimental contraceptives to scientific studies with informed consent. The Tiahrt amendment prohibits incentives for family planning, ensures access to benefits regardless of decisions, requires comprehensive information on methods, and limits experimental contraceptives to scientific studies with informed consent. Representative Tiahrt introduced the amendment in response to reports of forced sterilizations in Peru, where poor women were provided little information on alternative contraception methods, leading to complications and even death. The Tiahrt amendment was introduced to prevent incentives for meeting sterilization quotas and ensure access to comprehensive information on family planning methods. USAID issued guidance on implementing the requirements and reported violations in Peru, Guatemala, and the Philippines. An audit in 2007 found no further violations, and the amendment was included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The Tiahrt amendment, included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, aims to prevent sterilization quotas and ensure access to family planning information. The Mexico City policy restricts U.S. family planning assistance to foreign NGOs involved in abortion activities, with implementation and reversals typically done by the executive branch. The Trump Administration recently expanded the policy to cover all global health assistance. The Mexico City policy, issued by the executive branch, restricts U.S. family planning assistance to foreign NGOs involved in abortion activities. Republicans generally support the policy while Democrats oppose it. The policy was first issued by President Reagan in 1984 and has remained a controversial issue in U.S. foreign assistance. The Mexico City policy, issued by the executive branch, restricts U.S. family planning assistance to foreign NGOs involved in abortion activities. President Reagan first issued the policy in 1984, and it has been a contentious issue in U.S. foreign aid. President George H. W. Bush maintained it, President Clinton rescinded it in 1993, President George W. Bush reinstated and expanded it in 2001 and 2003, with exceptions for certain cases. President Obama revoked President Bush's policy in January 2009, citing overly broad conditions on grants and assistance awards that undermined efforts to promote safe family planning programs in foreign nations. In January 2017, President Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy, expanding it to include global health assistance and directing departments to ensure U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations supporting coercive abortion programs. The Trump Administration implemented the \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy in May 2017 to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not support organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization programs. This policy applies to approximately $8.8 billion in international health funding for programs addressing various health issues. It excludes assistance to governments, international organizations, and humanitarian relief activities. The \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy, implemented by the Trump Administration in May 2017, excludes humanitarian assistance and applies to $8.8 billion in international health funding. A six-month review in May 2018 highlighted challenges in implementation, including some recipients refusing to agree to the policy terms and the need to improve understanding and compliance. The \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy, implemented by the Trump Administration in May 2017, excludes humanitarian assistance and applies to $8.8 billion in international health funding. A six-month review in May 2018 highlighted challenges in implementation, including some recipients refusing to agree to the policy terms. One of the key challenges identified was the need to improve understanding of the policy's intent, implementation, compliance, and oversight. The department plans to conduct a further review of implementation by December 15, 2018. Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) on voluntary sterilization (VS) was issued by USAID in September 1982 to ensure that voluntary sterilization services funded by the U.S. government protect the needs and rights of individuals. PD-3 outlines requirements for USAID voluntary sterilization services, including informed consent. Voluntary sterilization services funded by USAID must adhere to specific guidelines, including obtaining informed consent from individuals seeking the procedure, ensuring access to other family planning methods, and prohibiting incentive payments for sterilization. Payment to service acceptors, providers, and referral agents must be reasonable and not considered incentives. The PD-3 guideline provides specific guidance on payments to VS service acceptors, providers, and referral agents. Payments must be reasonable and not considered incentives, based on country- and program-specific circumstances. VS acceptors may receive recompense for extra expenses, providers for per-case payment and related items, and referral agents for informing or referring clients. PD-3 applies to family planning assistance funded by USAID, including U.S. NGOs, foreign NGOs, public international organizations, and governments."
