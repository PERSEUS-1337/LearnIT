    "content": "The Act titled \"National Death Penalty Moratorium Act of 2000\" establishes a moratorium on the death penalty. Congress finds that death sentences are disproportionately imposed on the poor and certain racial and ethnic groups, with African-Americans being overrepresented in executions and on death row. No state meets ABA standards for indigent prisoners' legal representation. The death penalty system in the Federal system shows racial disparities, with a high percentage of white victims in death penalty cases. Studies have shown that a majority of defendants selected for capital prosecution are African-American or Hispanic American. The General Accounting Office reported racial disparities in charging, sentencing, and imposition of the death penalty. Prisoner appeals have been limited, increasing the risk of imprisoning and executing innocent individuals. The Supreme Court has restricted death row prisoners' rights to appeal convictions and sentences in Federal courts, even with compelling evidence of innocence. Legislation in 1996 limited Federal court review of death penalty appeals and reduced public funding for legal aid services for death row prisoners. The Federal Government and States are prohibited from carrying out the death penalty until Congress reviews the final findings and recommendations of the National Commission on the Death Penalty. This moratorium will remain in place until legislation is enacted based on the Commission's guidelines and procedures.
