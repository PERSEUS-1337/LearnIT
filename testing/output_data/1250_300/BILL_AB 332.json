The task force will consider various design options, including eligibility, enrollment, benefits, financing, administration, and interaction with publicly funded resources like Medi-Cal.

The proposed long-term care insurance program aims to provide benefits to working adults with functional or cognitive limitations, allowing for voluntary premium contributions and a mandatory enrollment with a voluntary opt-out option. It also includes purchasing nonmedical services and supports to help individuals remain in their communities and offset costs for those with chronic conditions. The program will evaluate how benefits can be coordinated with existing private health care coverage and address the demands on the long-term care workforce in California.

The task force will recommend options for a statewide long-term care insurance program and provide an actuarial report on the feasibility of these options by July 1, 2018. The commissioner may seek private funds for implementation. The commissioner may seek private funds for implementing this section, which will be in effect until January 1, 2019, unless extended by a later statute enacted before that date."
