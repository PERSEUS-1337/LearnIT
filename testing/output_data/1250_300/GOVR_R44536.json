Recent congressional interest has focused on the regulations' impact on farms storing oil. Legislation from the 113th and 114th Congresses has altered the SPCC regulations' applicability to farms, with stakeholders citing financial burdens as a key concern. The financial impact of SPCC regulations on farms has been a key concern, with stakeholders arguing that mandated infrastructure improvements could cost farmers tens of thousands of dollars. However, EPA has determined that the benefits of SPCC regulations outweigh the costs, as compliance costs are lower than the costs of oil spill cleanup and penalties. EPA's 2015 study found that farms have similar oil storage conditions to other facilities, warranting no specific exemptions. The report also provides background on EPA's SPCC program and legislative developments. The report provides background information on EPA's SPCC program and legislative developments, including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1970 and 1972. President Nixon established regulations to prevent oil and hazardous substance discharges from vessels and facilities. President Nixon established regulations in 1970 to prevent oil and hazardous substance discharges from vessels and facilities. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was created to enforce these regulations. The Coast Guard has jurisdiction over vessels, while multiple agencies have jurisdiction over different types of facilities. EPA has jurisdiction over non-transportation-related onshore and offshore facilities, Department of Transportation has jurisdiction over transportation-related onshore facilities, and Department of the Interior has jurisdiction over offshore facilities. The Department of the Interior has jurisdiction over offshore facilities and associated pipelines located seaward of the coast line. States can impose their own requirements for oil spill prevention. EPA's SPCC regulations in 40 C.F.R. Part 112 mandate certain facilities to prepare and implement SPCC plans, including secondary containment for oil-storage units. Certification by a licensed professional engineer is required for SPCC plans unless specific conditions are met. SPCC regulations require secondary containment for oil-storage units and certification by a licensed professional engineer, unless specific conditions are met for self-certification. Facilities with no reportable discharge history storing 10,000 gallons or less can self-certify their SPCC plans, with a higher threshold of 20,000 gallons for farms. EPA issued SPCC regulations in 1973, with amendments in 2002 and compliance deadline extensions until November 10, 2011. The EPA extended the compliance date for farms to May 10, 2013, and Congress enacted a law prohibiting enforcement of SPCC provisions at farms until September 22, 2013. Despite these deadlines, owners must maintain and implement SPCC plans for facilities storing oil. The SPCC regulations apply to non-transportation facilities that could discharge oil into navigable waters. The definition of \"navigable waters\" has been a contentious issue. The definition of \"oil\" under the Clean Water Act (CWA) has been a controversial topic, with recent revisions by the Army Corps of Engineers and EPA. The CWA Section 311 defines oil broadly to include petroleum-based and non-petroleum-based oils, such as animal and vegetable oils. EPA's SPCC regulations apply to facilities storing oil products that could potentially discharge into navigable waters. The EPA's SPCC regulations define oil broadly to include oils from animal and vegetable sources. Facilities storing oil are subject to the rule if they meet certain capacity thresholds. Oil and gas production facilities make up the largest percentage subject to the regulations, followed closely by farms. Approximately 152,000 farms are estimated to be subject to the SPCC requirements. The largest percentage of facilities subject to SPCC regulations are involved in oil and gas production (29%), followed closely by farms (27%). Recent SPCC issues have focused on program scope and applicability, especially in relation to farms. Changes to the SPCC regulations for farms were made in the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014, altering the applicability based on storage capacity. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 changed SPCC regulations for farms. Farms with storage capacities below certain thresholds are exempt from SPCC regulations or can self-certify their SPCC plan. EPA was directed to consider lowering the threshold based on oil risk. EPA was directed to consider lowering the threshold for SPCC regulations for farms with storage capacities below 1,000 gallons. The agency concluded that the threshold should be decreased to 2,500 gallons instead of 6,000 gallons due to the significant risk of oil discharge to water. Despite the scheduled release of a proposed rule in August 2016, EPA has not published it yet. The Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN, P.L. 114-322) signed in December 2016 modifies SPCC regulations for farms, exempting smaller containers from the aggregate storage capacity limit and SPCC regulations. The WIIN Act exempts smaller containers on farms from SPCC regulations, regardless of breaching storage capacity thresholds. The term \"separate parcels\" is key but unclear in EPA interpretation. The definition of facility includes parcels but lacks clarity in SPCC regulations. EPA's 2008 modification broadened the facility definition to encompass various oil-related activities, with boundaries determined by site-specific factors. The SPCC regulations do not delegate enforcement to states and are enforced by EPA regional offices. States may have their own oil storage regulations, but they do not replace EPA's authority. Enforcement of the SPCC program is a concern for policymakers, as highlighted in a 2012 EPA inspector general report. Many states have their own regulatory programs for oil storage units, but these do not replace EPA's authority. Enforcement of the SPCC program is a concern for policymakers, as highlighted in a 2012 EPA inspector general report that found many facilities were out of compliance. No recent reports on enforcement activities are available."
