The law retained Senate language on the renewal of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline right of way. The FY2003 budget allocated funds for energy and minerals programs, including permitting and rights of way processes. The law retained Senate language on the renewal of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline right of way, but dropped language regarding the Cadiz Groundwater Storage and Dry-Year Supply Program. Funds in the bill were barred from being used for energy leasing activities within national monuments, except where allowed by presidential proclamations. The FY2003 law prohibits funds in the bill from being used for energy leasing activities within national monuments, except where allowed by presidential proclamations. This provision was enacted in FY2002 as well. Additionally, no funds were included in the FY2003 funding bill for potential energy development within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Section 1003 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act currently prohibits oil and gas production on ANWR lands without authorization from Congress. The FY2003 Interior appropriations bill prohibits funds for energy leasing activities within national monuments, except as allowed by presidential proclamations. It also does not allocate funds for energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), as Section 1003 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act prohibits oil and gas production on ANWR lands without congressional authorization. The bill's language has been interpreted as potentially allowing funds for preliminary work related to development in ANWR, despite the ongoing prohibition. The FY2003 Interior appropriations bill prohibits funds for energy leasing activities within national monuments and does not allocate funds for energy development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) due to ANILCA. Grazing permits and leases are automatically renewed until the renewal process is completed, and $47.6 million was enacted for land use planning in FY2003.

In 2002, an estimated 276 million people visited park units. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated $2.25 billion for the NPS, a decrease from the previous year. The President aimed to eliminate the maintenance backlog, enhance security, and involve more non-government groups in park support. The Senate approved $2.29 billion, while the House approved $2.40 billion for the NPS operations. The National Park Service's budget for park operations accounts for two-thirds of the total NPS budget. The FY2003 appropriations law provided $1.57 billion, slightly above the previous year's level. An environmental coalition and some Members of Congress sought a $280 million increase for science, resource protection, and education programs. The Senate agreed to continue efforts to increase funding for NPS operations and eliminate deferred maintenance backlog by FY2007. The President's request included funds for a Cooperative Conservation Initiative. The President's request for the National Park Service included funds for a proposed Cooperative Conservation Initiative (CCI) to address deferred maintenance backlog. The Senate rejected the idea of the CCI, citing existing unmet needs. Congress did not fund the Initiative, but retained $5 million for the NPS Challenge Cost Share Program in FY2003. The Administration requested $851.8 million for construction and maintenance in FY2003, a decrease of $15.1 million from FY2002. The FY2003 appropriations law provided $850.7 million for these activities.

The Administration requested $200 million for Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) state assistance in FY2003, including $50 million for grants under the Cooperative Conservation Initiative. The Recreational Fee Demonstration Program (Fee Demo) allows federal land management agencies to retain and spend entrance and user fees for projects, with at least half of the receipts used for deferred maintenance. The program was started in FY1996 and the Administration intended to propose legislation to make it permanent in FY2003. The Administration's FY2003 budget aimed to make the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program permanent, removing it from the appropriations process. Various bills in the 107th Congress proposed fee program permanence, but none were enacted. Citizens have objected to paying fees for recreation in national forests. The Everglades Restoration project, including the Modified Water Delivery Project, is in its early stages and has faced controversy over land acquisition for flood protection. The controversy surrounding the Everglades Restoration project involves land acquisition for flood protection within the 8.5 Square Mile Area. Some landowners are unwilling to sell their land, leading to legal action. The U.S Army Corps of Engineers has the authority to acquire land from unwilling sellers through condemnation. The FY2003 law authorizes the Corps to implement a flood protection plan (Alternative 6D) with conditions for acquiring necessary lands. The Corps can acquire residential property for Alternative 6D with conditions for land acquisition in the 8.5 SMA. Financial assistance is provided for acquisitions, and funds from the Everglades National Park Protection Act and DOI are used. Failure to acquire the land hinders the Modified Water Delivery Project and parts of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Authorization for CERP requires completion of the Modified Water Delivery Project before certain projects can proceed. Authorization for CERP mandates completion of the Modified Water Delivery Project before certain projects can proceed. The controversy surrounding the implementation of Alternative 6D led to its removal from the House version of the FY2003 Interior appropriations bill. However, the Senate passed an omnibus appropriations bill authorizing the Corps to implement flood protection under Alternative 6D for the 8.5 SMA. For more information on the project, refer to CRS Report RS21331. The Historic Preservation Fund, administered by the NPS, provides grants for protection and restoration of historic sites. Grants are typically funded on a 60% federal- 40% state matching share basis. Funding also supports cultural heritage projects for Indian tribes, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. Programs were reauthorized through FY2005 by The National Historic Preservation Act Amendments of 2000. The Historic Preservation Fund, reauthorized through FY2005, provides funding for cultural heritage projects for Indian tribes, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. The FY2003 budget allocated $69.0 million, with grants-in-aid to states and territories at $34.0 million. Save America's Treasures initiative, funded alongside the Historic Preservation Fund, preserves nationally significant artifacts and historic structures. The Save America's Treasures initiative, part of former President Clinton's Millennium initiative, grants funds to preserve nationally significant artifacts and historic structures. Projects funded include restoration of the Star Spangled Banner, Rosa Parks Museum, Mark Twain House, and the Declaration of Independence. Criticized for lack of geographic diversity, projects now require formal approval by House and Senate Committees on Appropriations and a 50% cost share. The FY2001 Interior appropriations law (P.L. 106-291) mandated project recommendations to be approved by House and Senate Committees on Appropriations before funds distribution. Projects need a 50% cost share and cannot receive multiple grants. Save America's Treasures received $30.0 million in FY2003. Historic Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) have received preservation grants in the past. Funding for HBCUs was not available in FY2002 and was eliminated in the FY2003 budget due to expended authorized funding. The National Trust for Historic Preservation lost its federal funding due to expended authorized funding. It was chartered by Congress in 1949 to protect historic American sites. Despite not receiving regular federal funding since FY1998, it received a one-time appropriation in FY2002 for an endangered properties endowment. The Trust still offers financial assistance programs like the Preservation Services Fund and the National Preservation Loan Fund. The National Trust for Historic Preservation offers financial assistance programs such as the Preservation Services Fund and the National Preservation Loan Fund. In FY2002, $2.5 million was appropriated for the Historic Sites Fund endowment, matched with non-federal funds. The FY2003 budget recommended eliminating the one-time grant, but the final appropriation provided $2.0 million for the endowment.

The FY2003 budget for the Minerals Management Service (MMS) is $270.7 million, with $137.6 million for OMM and $83.3 million for MRM programs. Mineral leasing revenue estimates were revised downward by 40% in FY2003 compared to FY2002, with current estimates at $5.1 billion for FY2002 and $4.2 billion for FY2003 due to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas. The FY2003 budget for the Minerals Management Service (MMS) is $270.7 million, with $137.6 million for OMM and $83.3 million for MRM programs. Mineral leasing revenue estimates were revised downward by 40% in FY2003 compared to FY2002, with current estimates at $5.1 billion for FY2002 and $4.2 billion for FY2003 due to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas. Oil prices that were in the $26-$30 per barrel range dropped to $20-$22 per barrel in 2001, while natural gas prices also fell significantly. Royalties from natural gas production have accounted for 40%-45% of MMS receipts over the past decade, with oil accounting for no more than 25%. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 requires a 5-year leasing program specifying time, location, and size of lease sales, with the new 5-year program (2002-2007) starting on July 1, 2002. MMS will conduct 20 oil and natural gas lease sales during this period, with sales in the Western or Central Gulf of Mexico, Eastern GOM, and around Alaska. Sales in the Eastern GOM are contentious, with industry groups advocating for more sales due to resource potential, while environmental groups and some state officials oppose them. The FY2003 appropriations law continues the moratorium in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico outside Lease Sale 181. A breach-of-contract lawsuit was filed by nine oil companies seeking $1.2 billion in compensation for their undeveloped leases. The companies claim that MMS failed to conduct consistency determinations required by the court. The Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 was amended in 1990 to allow for consistency determinations. In 1999, the MMS extended 36 out of the 40 leases at issue by granting lease suspensions. However, in June 2001 the Ninth Circuit Court struck down the MMS. The state of California is determining the consistency of oil and gas lease development with the coastal zone management plan. The Ninth Circuit Court struck down MMS lease suspensions in 2001, leading to appeals by the Bush Administration. A three-judge panel upheld the decision in 2002, giving the Department of the Interior 90 days to appeal to the Supreme Court. The FY2003 appropriations law includes a provision barring funding for exploration and development of the 36 extended leases. The FY2003 appropriations law includes a provision barring Interior bill funding for exploration and development of 36 extended leases. Legislation sought a permanent prohibition on new drilling in the contested area. Senators Boxer and Landrieu proposed legislation to compensate companies for surrendering undeveloped leases off California's coast with financial credits to acquire oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico, potentially up to $3 billion. The Administration announced plans to buy back oil and gas leases from Chevron, Conoco, and Murphy oil. The Administration announced plans to buy back oil and gas leases from Chevron, Conoco, and Murphy oil companies off California's coast with financial credits of up to $3 billion. Additionally, buybacks were planned in areas like Destin Dome and Everglades National Park, requiring approval from Congress. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement ensures coal-mined land is restored, funded by the Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) fund. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) oversees the restoration of coal-mined land through the Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) fund. The FY2003 budget for OSM saw a decrease in funds, with the Senate-passed total of $297.1 million being enacted. The budget has two components: Regulation and Technology programs, and AML. The FY2003 budget for the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) included $105.4 million for Regulation and Technology programs, with an increase of $2.3 million from the previous year. Additionally, $191.7 million was allocated for the Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) fund, a reduction from the previous year's funding. In FY2003, Congress allocated $191.7 million for the Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) fund, with the Senate Committee recommending more funding to restore cuts made by the Administration for State and Tribal AML grants. The omnibus appropriations legislation approved these levels, with grants to states based on coal production levels. In FY2003, Congress approved $191.7 million for the Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) fund, with grants to states based on coal production levels. \"Minimum program states\" with significant AML problems but low coal production receive a minimum funding level of $2 million. Despite state objections, Congress has allocated $1.5 million to these states since FY1996. The unappropriated balance of AML collections is expected to be $1.65 billion by the end of FY2003.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provides various services to federally recognized tribes, including government operations, law enforcement, social programs, education, and economic development. BIA's FY2002 direct appropriations were $2.22 billion, with a proposed increase to $2.25 billion for FY2003. Congress ultimately approved approximately $2.27 billion for FY2003, representing a 1.2% increase over the request and a 2.7% increase over the FY2002 appropriation. The FY2003 appropriations for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) totaled approximately $2.27 billion, which is a 1.2% increase over the requested amount and a 2.7% increase over the FY2002 appropriation. The Senate approved a $31.9 million increase for trust management improvement programs, while the House approved $1.6 million for the Branch of Acknowledgment and Research. Congress enacted the House-approved amount. The FY2003 appropriations for the Bureau of Indian Affairs totaled $2.27 billion, a 2.7% increase over FY2002. The House approved an additional $0.55 million, a 52% increase, while the Senate agreed with the Administration's request for an additional $0.05 million. Congress enacted the House level of $1.6 million. Key issues include reorganization of trust asset management functions and greater tribal influence on BIA programs. The FY2003 appropriations for the Bureau of Indian Affairs increased by 2.7% over FY2002. Key issues include the proposed reorganization of trust asset management functions, greater tribal influence on BIA programs, and problems in the BIA school system. The BIA historically mismanaged Indian trust funds and assets, leading to legislative reforms in 1994 and a court case in 1996. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) historically mismanaged Indian trust funds and assets, leading to legislative reforms in 1994 and a court case in 1996. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) was created in 1994 to oversee trust management reform, with trust fund management transferred to the OST in 1996. The BIA still manages trust assets, and along with the OST and other offices, is implementing a trust management improvement project initiated by the Secretary of the Interior Norton. This project includes improvements in trust asset systems, policies, procedures, historical accounting, backlog reduction, and maintenance of the improved system. The project replaced an earlier High-Level Implementation Plan (HLIP) created under the Clinton Administration. A new computerized trust asset management system drew criticism, leading to a review by Electronic Data Systems, Inc. (EDS) in 2001. EDS recommended a single executive for trust reform. The Secretary proposed splitting off BIA's trust asset management responsibilities into a new Bureau of Indian Trust Asset Management (BITAM) in late 2001. The reprogramming request for FY2002 funds was not approved, and a consultation process with Indian tribes took place in 2002 through a joint tribal-DOI Trust Reform Task Force. Many tribes opposed the BITAM proposal. The Secretary consulted with Indian tribes in 2002 regarding the BITAM proposal. The majority of tribes opposed the proposal and offered alternative plans. The Senate Appropriations Committee forbade the implementation of the BITAM proposal in FY2003. In December 2002, a new proposed reorganization of BIA and OST trust management structures was announced, which was criticized by tribes and tribal organizations. The BIA and OST will reorganize trust management, with trust officers at regional and agency offices overseeing operations. Tribes have been advocating for greater control over federal Indian programs since the 1970s, through tribal contracting, compacting, and Tribal Priority Allocations within the BIA budget. In FY2002, Tribal Priority Allocations (TPA) accounted for a significant portion of the BIA's operation of Indian programs, including funding for tribal governments' operations, human services, courts, natural resources, and community development. Contract support costs, authorized under the Indian Self-determination Act, fund non-operational and overhead costs incurred by tribes in administering programs. Issues with contract support costs include consistent shortfall in appropriations and rate-setting methods. The BIA funds 185 elementary and secondary schools, educating about 48,000 students in 23 states. Tribes operate 121 of these institutions. BIA schools face challenges with low student achievement and inadequate facilities. The Administration proposes a \"School Privatization Initiative\" to improve academic performance by either tribal operation or privatization by FY2007. The Administration proposes a \"School Privatization Initiative\" for BIA schools to improve academic performance by either tribal operation or privatization by FY2007. However, some Indian tribes and organizations have expressed doubts about the proposal, citing funding issues and concerns about inadequate resources. The Senate and House Committees opposed the privatization initiative and removed its funding, with no funding included in the FY2003 appropriations law. Many BIA school facilities are old and dilapidated, with a backlog of $942 million in education facility repairs in 2001. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) faces a backlog of $942 million in education facility repairs. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) oversees tribal gaming operations. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) was established in 1988 to regulate tribal gaming operations. Its budget comes from fees assessed on tribes' gaming activities. In 1998, the NIGC's budget was increased to $8 million to accommodate the growing demand for oversight, especially in California. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) was established in 1988 to regulate tribal gaming operations, funded by fees from tribes' gaming activities. In FY2003, the Administration proposed $2 million in appropriations for the NIGC, in addition to $8 million in fee receipts. Congress did not enact NIGC appropriations for FY2003 but increased the fee ceiling to $12 million for FY2004. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians oversees the reform of Interior Department management of Indian trust assets. The Office of Special Trustee (OST) was established in 1994 to oversee the reform of Interior Department management of Indian trust assets. In 1996, trust fund management was transferred from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the OST due to severely inadequate management. The FY2002 funding for the OST was $110.2 million, including $99.2 million for federal trust programs and $11.0 million for the Indian land consolidation pilot project aimed at reducing the costs of managing allotted Indian trust lands. The Office of Special Trustee (OST) oversees the reform of Interior Department management of Indian trust assets. In FY2002, the OST received $110.2 million for federal trust programs and the Indian land consolidation pilot project. For FY2003, the Administration proposed $159.0 million for the OST, with $151.0 million for federal trust programs and $8.0 million for the land consolidation project. The Senate approved $162.0 million for the OST, including $3 million for the land consolidation project. The House approved $149.3 million for FY2003, with $141.3 million for trust programs and $8.0 million for land consolidation. Congress enacted the House figures for FY2003. The House approved $8.0 million for land consolidation but cut $9.8 million for trust programs to $141.3 million. Indian trust funds consist of tribal funds worth $3.1 billion and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts worth $400 million. The controversy includes a class action lawsuit for historical accounting of IIM funds. The IIM lawsuit involves a historical accounting for funds owed to plaintiffs. The DOI was directed to develop a sampling methodology for the accounting, but plaintiffs object to it. The court held the Secretary of the Interior in contempt for trust management issues. The district court held the Secretary of the Interior and the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs in contempt for trust management issues. Both parties submitted plans for future trust management and historical accounting by January 6, 2003. The House Appropriations Committee added provisions to the FY2003 Interior appropriations act related to the IIM lawsuit, including limiting the time period for historical accounting and capping the compensation of court-appointed officials monitoring trust reform. The House Appropriations Committee added provisions to the FY2003 Interior appropriations act related to the IIM lawsuit, including appointing a new OST advisory board, authorizing the Interior Secretary to help employees with legal costs, and setting a limit on the time period for historical accounting. The Senate did not agree to these provisions, but they were included in the FY2003 appropriations law. Funding for the Office of Insular Affairs consists of permanent appropriations and discretionary funding, with a total of $353.0 million in FY2002 and a request of $343.5 million for FY2003. For more information on the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians, visit http://www.ost.doi.gov/. The Office of Insular Affairs funding for FY2003 was approved at $349.6 million, with permanent appropriations totaling $252.4 million. This includes payments to freely associated states and fiscal assistance to U.S. territories. The Office of Insular Affairs funding for FY2003 was approved at $349.6 million, with permanent appropriations totaling $252.4 million. The remaining balance of the budget consists of discretionary and current mandatory funds. The Bush Administration's FY2003 request aimed to reduce the discretionary portion of the budget to $91.0 million, but the appropriations law included slightly higher funding at $97.2 million. Funding for the Assistance to Territories account is set at $76.2 million, and for the Compact of Free Association assistance account, $21.0 million. Congress continues to monitor economic development and fiscal management in the insular areas. Congress continues to monitor economic development and fiscal management in the insular areas. The Forest Service budget for FY2003 is $3.98 billion, which is $153.7 million less than FY2002. Fire funding and protection programs were a major issue during the FY2003 Interior appropriations bill. The House passed the FY2003 Interior appropriations bill, excluding a $500 million fire supplemental. The debate focused on fire funding, protection programs, and the National Fire Plan in response to severe fire seasons in 2000 and 2002. Discussions included funding levels, fire protection treatments, logging's impact on fire control, and challenges hindering fuel reduction activities. The FY2003 funding debate focused on wildfires, with attention to the National Fire Plan proposed after severe fire seasons in 2000 and 2002. The plan allocated $1.8 billion for fire control on BLM and Forest Service lands, with total appropriations reaching $2.89 billion for FY2001. Funding increases continued in FY2002, but decreased in some areas due to a less severe fire season in 2001. The FY2003 funding for the National Fire Plan was proposed at $2.02 billion by the Bush Administration, with an enacted appropriation of $2.03 billion, which was $204 million less than the FY2002 level. The funding included allocations for fire suppression, preparedness, and other operations on BLM and Forest Service lands. The FY2003 enacted appropriation for fire suppression included $160.4 million for BLM and $420.7 million for FS, with slight decreases from FY2002 levels. Fire preparedness funding for BLM matched the President's request at $277.2 million, while FS received $616.0 million, splitting the difference between House and Senate enactments. Other BLM fire operations received approximately $216 million in funding. The FY2003 enacted appropriation for fire suppression included $160.4 million for BLM and $420.7 million for FS, with slight decreases from FY2002 levels. The appropriation for other BLM fire operations roughly matched the request and House and Senate enactments. The FY2002 fire season was severe, with wildfires burning 7,112,733 acres. Congress debated including supplemental funds in the FY2003 appropriation to repay funds borrowed for firefighting in FY2002. In FY2003, Congress and the Administration debated whether to include supplemental funds for FY2002 firefighting efforts. Ultimately, $825 million was enacted to repay funds borrowed for fire suppression in FY2002, with $636 million for FS and $189 million for BLM. The House had initially added $700 million for fire suppression, and the Administration later requested $825 million to supplement the efforts. Senator Byrd offered an amendment to add the Administration's request to the Interior bill, while a draft substitute sought $1.25 billion for fire suppression. In the Senate, efforts were made to add the Administration's request for fire suppression funds to the Interior bill, but no agreement was reached. Amendments were debated from September 5 to September 25, with no resolution. The Senate discontinued debate on the Interior appropriations bill due to lack of agreement on wildland fire funding. Stewardship Contracting was also discussed in FY2003. The 107th Congress saw debates on Byrd and Craig/Domenici amendments, with the House Resources Committee considering related authorizing legislation. Stewardship Contracting was extended through 2013, allowing BLM and FS to require fuel reduction in timber sale contracts. Congress also reviewed funding for other Forest Service programs, including the proposed termination of the Economic Action Program. The Administration proposed terminating the Economic Action Program (EAP) and Pacific Northwest economic assistance program, but the FY2003 appropriations law allocated $31.4 million for EAP. Land acquisition funding was cut by $15.9 million (11%) compared to FY2002 levels. Infrastructure Improvement funding was also reduced by $10.1 million (17%). The FY2003 budget request proposed reducing Infrastructure Improvement by $10.1 million (17%) to address deferred maintenance backlog. A new Emerging Pest and Pathogens Fund of $12.0 million was included to control invasive species. The Administration proposed $49.5 million, a $16.4 million (49%) decrease. The FY2003 appropriations law did not include funding for Expedited Consultations. The Administration proposed increases in funding for the Forest Stewardship Program and the Forest Legacy Program, but the final appropriations were lower than requested. The Tongass National Forest had legislative language included in the FY2003 appropriations law. The FY2003 appropriations law provided $3.8 million more than FY2002 appropriations for the Tongass National Forest in Alaska. Congress approved the agency's decision to recommend no additional wilderness in the forest, prohibiting administrative appeals and judicial review. Some groups had advocated for more wilderness designations and restrictions on road building and timber harvesting. For more information on the U.S. Forest Service, visit http://www.fs.fed.us/. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated $624.9 million for Fossil Energy R&D, a 7% increase from FY2002. For more information on the Department of Energy, visit http://www.energy.gov/. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated $624.9 million for Fossil Energy R&D, a 7% increase from FY2002. Funding differences were seen in fuel cells, transportation fuels, natural gas, and petroleum production technologies. The Clean Coal Power Initiative received $150.0 million, with $87 million in deferrals for the Clean Coal Technology Program in FY2003. The program aims to fund advanced research and development as well as joint government-industry-funded demonstrations of new technologies. The CCTP in FY2003 received $150.0 million for the CCPI, a cooperative cost-shared industry/government program for advanced research and development in coal-fired power generators. The Administration had requested a $2 billion ten-year commitment but did not recommend deferral from previously appropriated funds. The CCTP was retained as a separate program with $40.0 million in FY2003 from previously deferred budget authority for active projects. The CCTP in FY2003 received $40.0 million from previously deferred budget authority to continue active projects. The Senate and House supported funding for CCPI, with the Senate recommending a deferral of $60 million for CCTP. Research and development funding for natural gas and petroleum programs varied between the Administration's request and the Senate and House approvals. The Senate and House approved varying funding amounts for natural gas and petroleum programs in FY2003, with the Administration requesting a phased-out funding for the Fuels program. The FY2003 law allocated $68.9 million for the Energy Technology Center and $40.2 million for sequestration R&D, testing new methods for greenhouse gas capture. The FY2003 law allocated $40.2 million for sequestration R&D, an increase from FY2002 but a decrease from the Administration's request. The Fossil Energy Infrastructure program was proposed to be transferred to the Department of Transportation, but the Senate and House supported keeping it within Fossil Energy. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve consists of caverns in Louisiana and Texas. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in 1975 to store over 570 million barrels of crude oil in caverns in Louisiana and Texas for emergency use. The Clinton Administration authorized exchanges and swaps of oil from the SPR, as well as a program to accept oil as royalty-in-kind payments. President Bush ordered actions regarding the SPR in November 2001. President Bush ordered the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to be filled to capacity with oil acquired through royalty-in-kind (RIK) in mid-November 2001. The fill rate is expected to average 55,000 barrels per day between December 2002 and the end of FY2003. The FY2003 appropriation law allocated $180.9 million for the SPR, with funds for facilities, operation, management, transportation of RIK oil, and leasing of storage facilities. The FY2003 budget request for the SPR was $187.7 million, an increase of $8.7 million from the previous year. The FY2003 budget request for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was $187.7 million, with allocations for storage facilities development, operations management, transportation of RIK oil, and the Northeast Heating Oil Reserve. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $189.9 million, with adjustments to the SPR Petroleum Account to support injection of oil into the Reserve. The Senate approved $190.9 million for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), including funds for storage facilities development, operations management, and transportation of RIK oil. The omnibus appropriations legislation also included $7 million for the SPR Petroleum Account and $6 million for the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR), totaling $185.9 million. Permanent authorization for the SPR was granted, with a directive to fill it to capacity as soon as possible. For more information, visit http://www.fe.doe.gov/programs/reserves/spr. The 107th Congress adjourned, and the Naval Petroleum Reserves program saw changes with the sale of the federal interest in the Elk Hills oil field to Occidental Petroleum Corporation. Most of the Naval Oil Shale Reserves were transferred to the Department of the Interior, with NOSR-2 returned to the Ute Indian Tribe. The program now includes two small oil fields in California and Wyoming, expected to generate revenue of $7.2 million in FY2003. The Naval Petroleum Reserves program underwent changes with the sale of the federal interest in the Elk Hills oil field to Occidental Petroleum Corporation. The program now includes two small oil fields in California and Wyoming, expected to generate revenue of $7.2 million in FY2003. The FY2003 budget request included an advance appropriation of $36.0 million for the Elk Hills settlement. The FY2003 budget included an advance appropriation of $36.0 million for the Elk Hills School Lands Fund, with payments spread over five years. The Energy Efficiency Program aims to produce substantial benefits for the nation, but changes are proposed to align with findings from the National Energy Policy Report and the President's Management Agenda. For more information on Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves, visit http://www.fe.doe.gov/programs/reserves/npr. The DOE proposed to decrease conservation funding under DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) from $912.8 million in FY2002 to $901.6 million in FY2003. The House-approved level for the DOE Energy Conservation Program in the 107th Congress would have increased funding by $71.9 million, or 8%, over FY2002, and by $83.0 million, or 9%, compared to the Administration's request. The House-approved level for the DOE Energy Conservation Program in the 107th Congress included $250.0 million for weatherization grants, $50.0 million for state energy grants, $687.6 million for R&D, and a $3.0 million general reduction. The Senate-passed bill in the 108th Congress contained $884.3 million for the program, $37.4 million less than recommended in the 107th Congress. The enacted FY2003 bill included $897.6 million, cutting $4.0 million compared to the Administration's request. The FY2003 bill includes $897.6 million for the DOE Energy Conservation Program, with cuts in various areas such as weatherization grants, R&D, and transportation R&D. Industry R&D falls by $10.6 million, while Power Technologies increases by $6.8 million. Buildings Research and Standards falls by $2.6 million, but Energy Star sees an increase of $1.2 million. The House Committee on Appropriations proposed $1.0 million in new funding for program reviews by the National Academy of Sciences. The House Committee on Appropriations proposed $1.0 million in new funding for program reviews by the National Academy of Sciences to measure potential program success. The FY2003 law allocates $500,000 for this purpose. The House report directs EERE to adopt procurement practices for full and open competition. The Senate Committee on Appropriations directed EERE to revise and restructure budget request documents for FY2004. The conference report does not add any further provisions.

The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides medical and environmental health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives through a system of federal, tribal, and urban programs. IHS operates hospitals, health centers, and health stations, while tribes also operate facilities under IHS contracts. For more information, visit the agency's website. The Indian Health Service (IHS) is a key source of healthcare for American Indians and Alaska Natives, providing services through various facilities. IHS funding is divided into services and facilities categories, with appropriations for FY2003 totaling $2.868 billion, slightly higher than the President's request. The FY2003 appropriations for the Indian Health Service (IHS) total $2.868 billion, with 87% allocated for health services and 13% for health facilities. IHS also receives reimbursements from private health insurance and federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid, estimating an additional $450 million in FY2003. Clinical services, preventive health services, and other services are included in the IHS service budget. The House allocated $1.996 billion for FY2003, slightly above the Administration's request, while the Senate recommended $1.949 billion. The Indian Health Service (IHS) FY2003 appropriations totaled $2.868 billion, with clinical services receiving $1.22 billion for hospitals and clinics, dental health, mental health, and substance abuse treatment. Contract health care received $478.1 million, and preventive health services were allocated $103.3 million. Congress enacted $1.987 billion, slightly above the request and 5% over FY2002 levels.

Congress allocated $402.1 million for other health-related activities, $31.5 million for off-reservation urban health projects, and $2.4 million for tribal management grants. The House and Senate differed in funding amounts for scholarships to Indian health professionals. The House and Senate disagreed on funding amounts for scholarships to Indian health professionals in the FY2003 appropriations for the Indian Health Service. The Senate recommended $31.3 million and directed IHS to recruit health professionals from the general population, while the House recommended $35.4 million. Congress enacted the Senate amount. Additionally, there were differences in funding for IHS direct operations and self-governance funding. The Senate recommended $57.2 million for direct operations and $10.1 million for self-governance, while the House recommended slightly less for both. Congress ultimately allocated $60.6 million for direct operations and $1.1 million for self-governance. The Senate and House disagreed on funding for Indian health scholarships in FY2003. The Senate recommended $31.3 million, while the House recommended $35.4 million; Congress enacted the Senate amount. Differences also arose in funding for IHS direct operations and self-governance. The Senate proposed $57.2 million for direct operations and $10.1 million for self-governance, while the House suggested slightly lower amounts. Congress allocated $60.6 million for direct operations and $1.1 million for self-governance. Contract support costs for tribes under the Indian Self-Determination Act were also addressed, with both chambers proposing $270.7 million, which was enacted. The Senate opposed the President's proposed reductions in staffing levels and other costs for IHS operations. Additionally, the Senate expressed concern about the Administration's plan to transfer IHS's Office of Legislative Affairs. The Senate Committee on Appropriations expressed concern about the Administration's proposal to transfer and consolidate IHS's Office of Legislative Affairs into the Department of Health and Human Services. The Committee noted that the IHS office handles complex Native American and Alaskan Indian health service issues that require expertise and attention.

The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) was reauthorized for FY1995-2000 by P.L. 104-301. The 1974 relocation legislation (P.L. 93-531, as amended) resolved a dispute between the Hopi and Navajo tribes over land. Most relocatees are Navajo, with some families still in the process of acquiring replacement housing. ONHIR's main activities include housing and land acquisition, and certifying families' eligibility for relocation benefits. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) is involved in housing and land acquisition for families relocating from Hopi partitioned land. In FY2002, ONHIR received $15.1 million in appropriations, which decreased to $14.5 million in FY2003. Negotiations and litigation have taken place among the Navajo Nation, Hopi Tribe, Navajo families, and the federal government regarding various issues, including Hopi Tribe claims. In 1995, a settlement agreement was reached between the United States and the Hopi Tribe, which included 75-year leases for Navajo families on Hopi partitioned land. The Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act of 1996 approved this settlement agreement. The Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act of 1996 approved a settlement agreement between the Hopi Tribe and Navajo families for 75-year leases on Hopi partitioned land. Despite some opposition, most Navajo families signed accommodation agreements by September 1999. The Hopi Tribe has called for enforcement of relocation against Navajo families without leases, but ONHIR is prohibited from evicting them without providing replacement homes under the FY2003 appropriations law. The Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act of 1996 allowed for 75-year leases on Hopi partitioned land for Navajo families. ONHIR cannot forcibly relocate Navajo families without providing replacement homes. The Hopi Tribe has the option to take action against the United States if Navajo families do not relocate or sign accommodation agreements. The Tribe has not yet filed a claim for \"quiet possession\" of the land. The Smithsonian Institution is a museum, education, and research complex with 16 museums and galleries, the National Zoo, and research facilities. It receives 70% of its funding from the federal government. The ongoing debate in Congress is whether federal support for arts and culture is appropriate and how it should be shaped. The Smithsonian Institution receives 70% of its funding from the federal government. In 2001, it had 42 million visits, with the National Zoo, Museum of Natural History, and National Air and Space Museum being the most visited. The FY2003 appropriations law provided $548.5 million for the Smithsonian, with $449.1 million allocated for Salaries and Expenses. The National Museum of the American Indian received $16.0 million for construction. The FY2003 enacted appropriation provides $16.0 million for the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) for completion of construction of the Mall museum. Private donations totaling $36.7 million, including $15 million from the Indian community, covered one-third of the estimated cost of $110 million for the project. The FY2003 enacted appropriation provides $83.4 million for repair, restoration, and alteration of facilities at the Smithsonian, including critical repairs at the National Zoo, renovation of the Patent Office Building and the National Museum of Natural History. Work has begun on the National Museum of Natural History and the Patent Office Building, with a projected total cost estimate of $151 million. The Smithsonian Institution is responsible for over 400 buildings with approximately 8 million square feet of space. A study by the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) confirms that funding for repair and renewal of SI's facilities has not kept pace with need, requiring over $1.5 billion for repairs over the next decade. The NAPA report highlights the need for over $1.5 billion to repair and improve the Smithsonian's facilities. The institution receives trust funds from private sources and government grants, including designated funds from individuals, foundations, and corporations. In FY2001, private contributions for designated projects totaled $178.8 million. In FY2001, private contributions for designated projects totaled $178.8 million, with a projected total of $80 million for FY2002. A significant $60 million donation was pledged by private donor Steven F. Udvar-Hazy for the National Air and Space Museum's Dulles Center. Government grants and contracts, separate from regular appropriations, are also provided for specific projects. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a plan for tracking trust fund expenditures in FY2003. The Congress is concerned about trust fund expenditures at the Smithsonian, with discrepancies in approved budgets and actual expenditures. The House Committee on Appropriations is worried about controversies with benefactors' control over properties and exhibits, including the renaming of the Air and Space Theater. They recommend reopening negotiations and reviewing benefactor agreements. Additionally, they want a review of compensation practices for Smithsonian leadership. The Smithsonian resolved controversies regarding the proposed closure of research centers in Virginia. An independent Science Commission was established to review the decision. Concerns remain about the institution's research priorities. Smithsonian's appropriations for FY2002-2003 included funding for anti-terrorism measures. For more information, visit http://www.si.edu/. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, which includes the NEA and NEH, operates with temporary authority since 1993. The Institute of Museum and Library Services was established by the 104th Congress. NEA's FY2003 appropriation is $116.5 million, with $17 million for the Challenge America Arts Fund. The House approved $126.5 million for NEA. The FY2003 appropriation for NEA is $116.5 million, including $17 million for the Challenge America Arts Fund. The House approved a total of $126.5 million for NEA, with a floor amendment to increase NEA by $10 million and NEH by $5 million. NEA's direct grant program supports approximately 1,600 grants, with state arts agencies receiving over 40% of grant funds. The NEA administers the Challenge America Arts Fund for arts education and community activities in rural and underserved areas. The NEA administers the Challenge America Arts Fund, a program of matching grants for arts education, outreach, and community arts activities in rural and underserved areas. The NEH supports grants for humanities education, research, preservation, public humanities programs, regional humanities centers, and state humanities councils. NEH also has a Challenge Grant program to stimulate private donations for humanities institutions. The Office of Museum Services' appropriation moved to the Departments of Labor, HHS, and Education bill in FY2003. In FY2003, the Office of Museum Services' appropriation shifted to the Departments of Labor, HHS, and Education bill for easier bookkeeping. The FY2003 appropriation for IMLS is $245.5 million, with approximately $30 million allocated to the OMS portion. The Office of Museum Services provides grants to museums for leadership, conservation, assessment, and General Operating Support. The Office of Museum Services provides grants to museums for leadership, conservation, assessment, and General Operating Support. Congress debates the federal role in funding arts and humanities, with opponents calling for the abolition of NEA and NEH, while proponents argue for federal support citing a long tradition of cultural support since 1817. Private sector representatives express concerns about filling the gap left by the loss of federal funds for the arts. Some argue that abolishing NEA and NEH would eliminate programs of national significance like touring theater and dance companies. Previous controversies include debates over questionable grants for potentially obscene artwork, although no projects have been deemed obscene by courts. The NEA has faced controversies over potentially obscene artwork, but no projects have been deemed obscene by courts. In 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that the NEA can consider general standards of decency when judging grants for artistic merit. Congress enacted reforms, including increased funding allocations to states and under served populations, and a 15% cap on funds allocated to each state. In FY2003, 40% of NEA funds were allocated to states for arts grants, with a focus on under served populations. A 15% cap was placed on funds allocated to each state, except for grants with a national impact. Members of Congress were added to the National Council on the Arts. NEA and NEH were given authority to solicit and invest funds. Funding priorities and restrictions on grants were retained, with no grants for seasonal support or individuals, except for specific fellowships. Beginning with FY2003, the Office of Museum Services is included in the appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor-HHS-Ed and Related Agencies. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is authorized at $900 million annually through FY2015 and is used by land management agencies for land acquisition and recreational development. For more information on NEA, NEH, and IMLS, visit their respective websites. The LWCF funds acquisition and recreational development by state and local governments through a grant program. It is authorized at $900 million annually through FY2015. Actual appropriations have been $12.5 billion out of a possible $25.4 billion. Appropriations for federal acquisitions are earmarked, while the state grant program is rarely earmarked. Funding for land acquisition has increased in recent years, reaching $573 million in FY2002. The FY2003 appropriation is lower than in previous years. The LWCF funding from FY2000 to FY2003 varied, with appropriations for land acquisition and other purposes. Congress allocated funds for different initiatives, including a Cooperative Conservation Initiative. The total funding for LWCF in recent years has been significant, with varying amounts allocated for different purposes. The FY2003 LWCF funding saw a decrease to $414 million, significantly less than previous years. The Cooperative Conservation Initiative was not funded, and priorities shifted post-9/11. The Bush Administration's request for full funding was not met, with Congress providing less than in FY2002. The FY2003 LWCF funding was reduced to $414 million, which is significantly less than previous years. The amount enacted is also less than the House and Senate-passed totals, as well as the Administration's request. One example of a reduction is a $15 million earmark for land acquisition in Florida, lower than the $20 million initially proposed. Additionally, some of the Fund is allocated to other programs like the FWS's Landowner Incentive Program and Stewardship Grants Program. In FY2003, the Bush Administration requested $200 million for the state grant program portion of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The Administration sought $50 million for a proposed Cooperative Conservation Initiative, which aimed to promote conservation through partnerships. Congress did not fund this proposed Initiative, despite strong interest in the concept. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees created the Conservation Spending Category (CSC) in the FY2001 Interior appropriations law, combining funding for resource protection programs including the LWCF. The FY2001 law appropriated $1.21 billion for FY2001, a substantial increase from the preceding year. Total spending under the category was authorized to grow each year. The FY2001 Interior appropriations law allocated $1.21 billion for resource protection programs, with funding set to increase annually to reach $2.4 billion by FY2006. In FY2002, the Bush Administration requested $1.26 billion, and Congress appropriated $1.30 billion. The FY2003 budget request was estimated at $1.32 billion, with the House-passed bill providing $1.44 billion. The Conservation Spending Category (CSC) was not utilized due to expired budget legislation. Total funding for FY2003 was subject to the appropriations process. The House-passed bill for FY2003 provided $1.44 billion in funding. The CSC was not used due to expired budget legislation, with total funding meeting projections for the CSC. The appropriations law and conference report did not contain specific calculations for CSC funding, but programs previously funded under that category continued in FY2003. Various reports on conservation and natural resource protection were also mentioned. The Everglades Restoration plan, authorized by Congress in 1996, aims to restore and protect the South Florida ecosystem. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) involves federal, state, local, and tribal entities in collaborative efforts to address environmental deterioration caused by human alterations to the natural flow of water. The plan, completed in 1999, is being implemented by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as part of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. The federal government, along with state, local, and tribal entities, is collaborating to restore the South Florida ecosystem through the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). CERP aims to redirect excess freshwater to restore natural hydrological functions without impacting water needs of agricultural and urban areas. The federal government covers half of the $7.8 billion cost for 68 projects to be implemented over 36 years, with Congress appropriating funds for restoration work. The federal government collaborates with state, local, and tribal entities to restore the South Florida ecosystem through CERP. Congress has appropriated over $1.9 billion for restoration projects in the region, with an average annual federal cost of $286 million expected for the next 10 years. In FY2003, $260 million was requested for restoration activities, including $46 million for CERP implementation. In FY2003, the administration requested approximately $260 million for restoration activities in the South Florida ecosystem, with over $180 million appropriated for Everglades restoration. The Department of the Interior (DOI) requested $96.1 million for CERP and non-CERP activities in Southern Florida through various agencies. The Department of the Interior requested $96.1 million for restoration activities in the South Florida ecosystem, with allocations for land acquisition, construction, research, refuges, ecological services, and water projects on tribal lands. Other agencies also received appropriations for restoration projects in the region. The Department of the Interior requested $96.1 million for restoration activities in the South Florida ecosystem, including funding reductions for the Modified Waters Delivery Project and land acquisitions by the FWS in FY2003 compared to FY2002. In FY2003, funding for restoration activities in the South Florida ecosystem was approximately $30 million less than in FY2002. Key reductions included funding for the Modified Waters Delivery Project and land acquisitions by the FWS. The FY2003 appropriations law also authorized the implementation of a flood control plan as part of the Modified Water Delivery Project. The FY2003 appropriations law allocated funding for restoration activities in Southern Florida, including $2.5 million for the Fish and Wildlife Service and $8.1 million for surveys and research by the USGS. The House and Senate provided similar funding levels for the National Park Service, with some differences in allocations for land acquisitions by the FWS. The FWS sought to acquire lands to benefit restoration activities in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). The FWS and BIA received funding for restoration activities in Southern Florida, including land acquisitions near the Pelican Bay National Wildlife Reserve. The House provided $0.3 million for water quality studies on the Seminole Indian Reservation. Detailed information on restoration activities can be found in agency budget justifications and a cross-cut budget prepared by the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Program. The USGS funds water resources investigations and biological research. More information can be found in agency budget justifications and a cross-cut budget by the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Program.

It includes adjustments for retirement accruals, across-the-board reductions, and supplemental funding for firefighting efforts. The enacted figures do not reflect specific cuts and emergency funding for wildland fire emergencies. The FY2003 budget figures do not include a specific 0.65% cut as outlined in the omnibus appropriations law. Additionally, $825.0 million is allocated for wildland fire emergencies, with $189.0 million for BLM and $636.0 million for the Forest Service to repay amounts transferred for fire fighting in FY2002. The conservation spending category was established in the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for FY2001, including specific activities for land preservation. The conservation spending category was established in the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for FY2001, including specific activities for land preservation. The current and proposed distribution of conservation funds is presented, with some programs not receiving separate funding for FY2001-FY2003. The Administration is seeking $3.0 million under the DOI Departmental. The joint explanatory statement of the conference report on the enacted measure stated that no funds in the law are derived from the CSC, but most programs previously funded under that category are continued in FY2003. The Administration is seeking $3.0 million under the DOI Departmental Management (DM) line item for the Shivaist Indian water settlement Act of 1999, which authorizes LWCF funds for the Paiute Tribe in Utah. Subtotals and totals may not add due to rounding. $50 million of this total is part of a new Cooperative Conservation Initiative, and the remaining $150 million would be distributed to states using an allocation formula developed by the administration for traditional land acquisition and site development activities. Additionally, in FY2003, four additional programs are proposed to be funded from LWCF. In FY2003, four additional programs are proposed to be funded from LWCF: FWSCooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund; FWS North American Wetlands Conservation Fund; FS Forest Legacy; and FS Forest Stewardship. Funds for FS, Forest Stewardship were not considered part of the CSC in FY2001 and FY2002 so funds in those years are not counted in the column totals. Beginning in FY1996, appropriations for the territories and other insular areas were consolidated within the Departmental Offices account. Funding for Challenge America Arts Fund is included in the total figure. In FY2003, the Office of Museum Services is included in the appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor-HHS-Education. Funding for Challenge America Arts Fund is part of the National Endowment for the Arts total. Figures do not reflect a 0.65% cut in the FY2003 omnibus appropriations law. $825.0 million is allocated for wildland fire emergencies to repay amounts transferred for fire fighting in FY2002."
