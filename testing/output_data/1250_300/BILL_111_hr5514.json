    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Activity Based Total Accountability Act of 2010\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The Congress finds that the Federal Government sends billions of dollars to states annually for various sectors like health care, transportation, housing, education, and agriculture. States receive funds through different means and spend money on common activities. It is important for taxpayers, legislators, and agencies to have access to objective data for comparing government performance and costs effectively. The purpose of this Act is to improve government accountability at the State level by requiring annual accountings in a format that uses total accountability measures, including unit-cost data. This will allow taxpayers, legislators, and agencies to objectively compare performance measurements and identify the true cost of government activities. States demonstrating efficiency with tax dollars will serve as models for others, promoting accountability and ensuring taxpayers get the best value for their money. State governments receiving Federal financial assistance must submit a State fiscal accounting report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget before the end of the Federal fiscal year. The report includes a one-page summary of total funding and expenditures for each budget entity, along with a unit-cost summary. The Director will publish these reports on their website within 30 days of receiving them. Additionally, the Act aims to standardize State fiscal accounting reports to improve government accountability and allow for objective comparisons of performance measurements and costs. The Director will standardize State fiscal accounting reports for comparison purposes. State governments must submit program descriptions to the Director within 180 days of the Act's enactment. A classification system will be established for agency activities based on the submitted descriptions and relevant data. The Director will establish a uniform system for classifying agency activities, identify conduct for each activity unit, and define performance measures for each agency activity. The Director will establish a uniform system for classifying agency activities and defining performance measures. The unit-cost summary for a budget entity of a State government must be one page long and include a statement of funds available, a line-item listing for each agency activity, and a reconciliation of funds available with adjusted expenditures. SEC. 6. STATEMENT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE. A statement of funds available must identify all sources of funds for expenditure by the budget entity, including State appropriations, Federal financial assistance, and other sources as determined by the Director. SEC. 7. AGENCY ACTIVITY LINE ITEM LISTINGS. The agency activity line item listing must identify the activity, total funds expended, activity units, and unit cost. It should also describe conduct, purposes, and beneficiaries of the activity. Special rules apply for determining expenditures for certain activities. Special rules apply for determining expenditures for agency activities where no method of measuring accomplishment exists. Expenditures must be allocated to similar activities with measurable methods. Total funds expended should include payments to contractors or subordinate entities. Unit-cost of agency activities is determined by a specific formula. The formula in section 8 defines UC as the unit-cost of the agency activity, m as the amount, and q as the number. It outlines the reconciliation of funds available with adjusted expenditures, identifying and explaining any differences. Adjusted expenditures are determined by a specific formula. The formula in section 8 defines adjusted expenditures (AE) as the sum of all expenditures (EXP) for agency activities, pass-throughs (PT), and reversions (REV). A budget entity can identify pass-throughs and reversions based on criteria set by the Director. Noncompliance with filing State fiscal accounting reports may result in a 10% withholding of Federal financial assistance for the next fiscal year. Rules are outlined in section 10. The Director is authorized to make rules necessary for this Act. Definitions include State government, budget entity, agency activity, and Federal financial assistance."
