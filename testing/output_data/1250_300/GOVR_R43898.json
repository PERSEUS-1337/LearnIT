    "content": "Recent legislation has extended certain expiring provisions in the Internal Revenue Code, making some temporary provisions permanent. The American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) reduced tax policy uncertainty by permanently extending most tax cuts and indexing the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for inflation. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 retroactively extended provisions that expired in 2013 through 2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 made permanent or temporarily extended all tax provisions that expired in 2014. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 signed into law on December 18, 2015, extended all tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2014, making some permanent and others temporarily extended. These temporary tax provisions, known as \"tax extenders,\" have been regularly extended by Congress. The debate in the 114th Congress focused on whether expired tax provisions should be made permanent or temporarily extended. Making some provisions permanent reduced uncertainty in the tax code, but there are still tax extenders set to expire at the end of 2016. The tax code has been made more certain by reducing the number of temporary provisions set to expire, but there are still tax extenders scheduled to expire at the end of 2016. Debate in the 114th Congress may address whether these provisions should be extended. Additional information on specific extender provisions can be found in other CRS reports. The Consolidated Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113) included the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act), which extended or made permanent various tax provisions that had expired in 2014. It also made permanent enhancements to child tax credit, American Opportunity Tax Credit, and earned income tax credit. Additionally, the PATH Act included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax and other tax-related provisions. The Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 extended expiring tax provisions for one year, while other legislation in the 113th Congress proposed extensions and permanent changes to certain tax provisions, including tax credits for renewable energy and deductions for oil refineries. In the 114th Congress, legislation was proposed to make certain tax provisions permanent, including the R&D tax credit and increased expensing allowances. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 aimed to extend temporary provisions that expired in 2014 for two years. The tax code currently includes numerous temporary tax provisions, with past legislation referred to as the \"tax extender.\" The tax code contains temporary tax provisions that have expired in recent years. These provisions, often referred to as \"tax extenders,\" are typically extended by Congress for short periods of time. The number of these temporary provisions has grown over time, with Congress enacting them for various reasons such as evaluating effectiveness or providing relief during economic downturns or disasters. Temporary tax provisions are used by Congress to evaluate effectiveness, provide relief during economic weakness or disasters, or for budgetary reasons. The rationale for temporary provisions is to assess before extension, but this is undermined if extensions are done without review. An expiration date can force policymakers to consider costs and benefits, but this has not been effective in practice. In practice, temporary tax provisions are often extended without review, undermining the rationale for expiration dates to force policymakers to consider costs and benefits. While most provisions are extended, some, like tax incentives for ethanol, have not been renewed due to duplicative benefits. Congress may choose not to extend provisions if the benefits do not exceed the costs. Tax policies can be used for economic stimulus or disaster relief, with measures like bonus depreciation and casualty loss deductions. Temporary provisions, like mortgage forgiveness during the housing crisis, may expire once the situation is resolved. Congress may enact temporary tax policies for budgetary reasons, with a review to ensure benefits exceed costs. It is argued that temporary tax provisions should be allowed to expire once the situation is resolved. Congress may enact temporary tax policies for budgetary reasons, as it is easier to offset short-term extensions rather than long-term ones. The Congressional Budget Office assumes that temporary tax cuts expire as scheduled, so if they are routinely extended, it could overstate projected revenues. Temporary tax benefits act as federal subsidies that favor certain activities and influence economic behavior. Temporary tax provisions, known as extenders, impact economic behavior by providing subsidies to encourage specific activities. Evaluating extenders involves considering their impact on economic efficiency, equity, and simplicity. While they may improve economic welfare in some cases by remedying market failures, policymakers must prioritize economic objectives when deciding on their use. Ultimately, extenders can influence how resources are allocated in the economy. Tax extenders can impact economic efficiency and fairness by addressing market failures and influencing the distribution of the tax burden. They can be more effective than direct subsidies in stimulating desired activities but may result in unequal treatment of individuals with similar incomes. Fairness in taxation also involves considerations of horizontal and vertical equity. Tax extenders can impact economic efficiency and fairness by addressing market failures and influencing the distribution of the tax burden. They can be more effective than direct subsidies in stimulating desired activities but may result in unequal treatment of individuals with similar incomes. Fairness in taxation involves considerations of horizontal and vertical equity, with vertical equity requiring tax burdens to be distributed fairly among people with different abilities to pay. Tax extenders are often seen as inequitable as they benefit those with greater ability to pay taxes, reducing the progressivity of the tax system.

Teachers in different tax brackets receive varying deductions for classroom-related expenses, with higher-income taxpayers benefiting more. The complexity of the tax code and the costs associated with administering it are increased by temporary tax provisions, leading to higher costs for both the government and individual taxpayers. Individuals spend more time on tax preparation and are more likely to hire paid preparers. Temporary tax provisions that expired in 2014 were extended in P.L. 114-113. These provisions fall into categories such as individual, business, charitable, or energy. The above-the-line deduction for classroom expenses incurred by school teachers is the longest-standing individual extender provision. Other provisions that have been extended include the deduction for state and local sales taxes.

Business provisions that expired in 2014, such as the research tax credit and New Markets Tax Credit, had been extended multiple times. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit, Qualified Zone Academy Bond allocation limitation, and active financing exception under Subpart F expired at the end of 2014. The New Markets Tax Credit, bonus depreciation, and enhanced expensing allowances also expired in 2014. Some business-related extender provisions were made permanent, while others were extended through 2019 or 2016. Four charitable provisions that expired in 2014 were made permanent. The renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) and other energy-related tax provisions that expired at the end of 2014 were extended through 2019 or 2016. Some provisions were first enacted in response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and were made permanent in P.L. 114-113. The tax incentives for alternative technology vehicles and energy efficiency improvements for existing homes were extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113. The alternative motor vehicle credit for fuel cell vehicles expired in 2014. Other incentives for alternative motor vehicles expired earlier. The credit for two-wheeled plug-in electric vehicles expired in 2013 but was extended in the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015. The tax incentives for alternative technology vehicles and energy efficiency improvements were extended through 2016 in P.L. 114-113, costing $628.8 billion between 2016 and 2025. One-third of this cost is due to provisions scheduled to expire in 2017. Between 2016 and 2025, the cost of extending tax provisions in P.L. 114-113 is estimated at $426.8 billion, with $202.1 billion attributed to provisions scheduled to expire in 2017. Permanent extensions account for 89% of the total cost, amounting to $559.5 billion. The cost of making certain temporary tax provisions permanent is $361.4 billion, while a small portion of $17.7 billion is for a two-year extension. Legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to make certain temporary tax provisions permanent. Before P.L. 114-113 was passed, legislation in the 114th Congress aimed to make certain temporary tax provisions permanent. The Senate Finance Committee reported legislation in 2015, the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946), to retroactively extend expired tax provisions for two years through 2016. The JCT estimated the cost of extending these provisions at $86.6 billion over a 10-year budget window, with potential economic growth from provisions affecting businesses. The cost estimate for extending certain expired provisions affecting businesses, as proposed in S. 1946, is $86.6 billion over a 10-year budget window. The JCT expects economic growth from these provisions, leading to a lower cost estimate when macroeconomic effects are included. The CBO provides estimated costs of extending all tax provisions scheduled to expire before 2025. According to CBO's estimates, extending expiring tax provisions before 2025 would cost $897.9 billion over the 2016-2025 budget window. This includes costs for bonus depreciation, Section 179 expensing, and expansions to various tax credits. Most of the provisions set to expire had already expired by 2014, with extensions or permanency granted in recent legislation. CBO's revenue projections do not account for expected extensions, resulting in higher revenue estimates than actual levels. The cost of extending expiring tax provisions is not included in CBO's revenue baseline, leading to higher revenue projections than actual levels. Short-term extensions are cheaper than extending provisions through the budget window. CBO scores provide a more accurate measure of the long-term budget impact of temporary tax provisions. JCT scores reflect the budget impact of temporary extensions relative to current law. Expired provisions may have lower 10-year revenue costs compared to 2015 due to tax deferrals or timing provisions like bonus depreciation. The cost of extending expiring tax provisions is not included in CBO's revenue baseline, leading to higher revenue projections than actual levels. Short-term extensions are cheaper than extending provisions through the budget window. Bonus depreciation is an example of a timing provision that shifts cost recovery forward, resulting in revenue losses in earlier years. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $223.6 billion over the 10-year budget window. Legislation in the 114th and 113th Congresses considered making certain expired tax provisions permanent or temporarily extending them. The Senate Finance Committee reported the Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 to retroactively extend expired tax provisions through 2016.

The credit for electric-drive motorcycles was not extended in recent legislation. Incentives for alternative technology vehicles have mostly expired, with only plug-in electric vehicles still eligible.
