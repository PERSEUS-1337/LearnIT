    "content": "The \"Rate Payer Recovery Act of 2007\" may provide disaster assistance for power transmission and distribution facilities. The \"Rate Payer Recovery Act of 2007\" may provide disaster assistance for privately-owned or investor-owned power facilities that provide electric or natural gas service to retail customers under State or local jurisdiction, including leased facilities. Contributions are subject to specific conditions outlined in the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. The \"Rate Payer Recovery Act of 2007\" allows for disaster assistance to private or investor-owned power facilities damaged by a major disaster for repair and associated expenses. Conditions for assistance include defining a previous major disaster. The President may provide assistance to private or investor-owned power facilities damaged by a major disaster, with conditions including a previous disaster where repair costs exceeded $2,500 per retail customer. The President may provide assistance to private or investor-owned power facilities damaged by a major disaster if the total costs of repair, restoration, or replacement of the facilities exceeded $500,000,000 in the previous disaster, and if 25 percent or more of the population in the affected areas had taxable income below the Federal poverty level. Private or investor-owned power facilities that had taxable income below the Federal poverty level in the year before the previous major disaster can apply for Federal assistance within 30 days of the disaster declaration or after contributing $10,000,000 towards repair costs. Private or investor-owned power facilities affected by a major disaster can request Federal assistance for eligible costs exceeding $10,000,000. The President must approve or disapprove applications within 30 days of receipt. The President must approve or disapprove applications for assistance from private or investor-owned power facilities within 30 days. Additionally, the Federal share for such facilities under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act has been expanded to include private or investor-owned power facilities. In cases where it is deemed not in the public welfare to repair or replace the facility, the owner may opt for a contribution instead. If it is determined that repairing or replacing a private or investor-owned power facility is not in the public welfare, the owner may choose to receive a contribution equal to 75 percent of the Federal estimate cost. This contribution can be used for repairing other power facilities, constructing a new facility, or funding hazard mitigation measures. The amendment allows for funding hazard mitigation measures for private or investor-owned power facilities affected by a major disaster. Eligible costs now include private or investor-owned power facilities in addition to public and private nonprofit facilities. The Secretary of Homeland Security must create regulations within 180 days of this Act's enactment to implement the Act and its amendments. The Act and its amendments will take effect 60 days after enactment, with Section 3 taking effect immediately."
