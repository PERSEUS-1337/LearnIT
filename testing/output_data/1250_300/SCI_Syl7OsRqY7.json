The CFC improves accuracy by 3.1% and F1 by 3.0% on the TriviaQA task. It encodes sequences using bidirectional GRUs and utilizes coattention and self-attention to compare support documents and queries with candidates. The Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network (CFC) utilizes coattention and self-attention to compare support documents and queries with candidates. It computes affinity matrices between documents and queries, defines support and query summary vectors, and generates a coattention context through feature-wise concatenation. The coattention context is summarized using hierarchical self-attention, creating a fixed-length summary vector through a multi-layer perceptron. The CFC utilizes a multi-layer perceptron to compute scores for positions in the coattention context. These scores are normalized and used to calculate a weighted sum. Self-attention is applied to generate a summary conditioned on the query, followed by another self-attention layer to produce a fixed-length summary vector of support documents. This vector is multiplied with the candidate answer summary to determine the coarse-grain score. The fine-grain module in the CFC utilizes coreference resolution to find specific context in supporting documents where the candidate occurs. Each mention is summarized using self-attention, and coattention is computed between mention representations and the query to produce a fine-grain summary for scoring the candidate. The CFC's fine-grain module uses coreference resolution to summarize mentions of the candidate in support documents using self-attention. Coattention is computed between mention representations and the query to score the candidate. The model combines coarse-grain and fine-grain scores to produce a final score vector for evaluation.
