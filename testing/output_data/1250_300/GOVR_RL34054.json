    "content": "The FCC prepared to auction 62 MHz of radio frequencies in the 700 MHz band to comply with the Deficit Reduction Act. They proposed creating a public-private partnership to build a nationwide broadband network for public safety users by pairing 10 MHz of public safety spectrum with 10 MHz of auctionable spectrum. The FCC proposed a nationwide broadband network by pairing 10 MHz of public safety spectrum with auctionable spectrum, aiming to meet public safety needs and benefit from shared network facilities with commercial users. The FCC proposed a nationwide broadband network by pairing 10 MHz of public safety spectrum with auctionable spectrum. The D Block license, intended for commercial use, attracted only one bidder at Auction 73, failing to meet the FCC's reserve price of $1.3 billion. As a result, the FCC decided not to proceed with the re-auction of the D Block to allow for further consideration of options. The FCC initiated a review of its rules for licensing and structuring partnerships for the D Block. New auction rules were prepared, maintaining a single nationwide license for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. Public safety associations requested local networks to operate on the public safety spectrum. The PSBL allows local public safety networks to manage access to the public safety spectrum, while a national licensee ensures common standards and interoperability. Congressional policy debates combining public and private spectrum ownership for national public safety communication support. The FCC and DHS pursue separate paths for communication development without aligning goals. Funding solutions for the program are being considered, including levies on commercial partners or public sector funding. The FCC is considering funding solutions for the public safety network program, including levies on commercial partners or public sector funding. There is a proposal for the federal government to temporarily act as the commercial partner to ensure network construction and later sell the business to the private sector. Sharing spectrum and network facilities with commercial users is seen as beneficial for public safety, providing new funding sources, economies of scale, and access to additional spectrum during emergencies. The consensus is to achieve the goal of resource sharing between the public and private sectors. The report discusses the need for sufficient spectrum, a source of funds, and a management structure for a public-private partnership in the public safety network program. The FCC outlines key elements for a public-private partnership in the public safety network program, including a Public Safety Broadband Licensee, a network sharing agreement, and incentives for commercial partners to meet public safety standards. The debate over the unsuccessful auction of the D Block license has raised questions about future steps to assign the license. The public debate surrounding the unsuccessful auction of the D Block license includes discussions on modifying auction rules to attract bidders and considering alternatives to achieve an interoperable public safety broadband network. Suggestions include eliminating FCC requirements that may deter bidders, maintaining the public-private partnership structure, and allowing public safety to negotiate independently for partnerships. The public debate on the D Block license auction includes suggestions to attract bidders by eliminating network sharing requirements and empowering public safety to negotiate partnerships independently. Options include using federal funds, auctioning the license without public safety requirements, and choosing a different organizational structure for a public safety network. Congressional action may be required for these solutions, which are not mutually exclusive and can be combined. The FCC seeks comments on various options for the D Block license auction, including rule changes to attract bidders and establish a public-private partnership for public safety. Commissioners support re-auctioning the D Block with modifications to requirements for the winning bidder. The FCC intends to increase its oversight role in supervising the partnership. Changes could include adjustments to the reserve price, network sharing agreement, or terms for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. The FCC is considering various options for the D Block license auction, including rule changes to attract bidders and establish a public-private partnership for public safety. Suggestions include re-auctioning the D Block without encumbrances, modifying requirements for the winning bidder, and using surplus funds from auctions to build a public safety network. Some proposals aim to eliminate the network sharing agreement and offer the D Block as a commercial license under terms similar to other blocks assigned through Auction 73. FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin mentioned the Public Safety Interoperability Implementation Act in oral testimony. Many suggest using surplus funds from auctions to build a public safety network, with FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin referring to the Public Safety Interoperability Implementation Act as an example. He and Commissioner Michael J. Copps prefer a solution using federal funds for a nationwide, interoperable network. Without federal financial support, the FCC seeks to use private sector funds. Recommendations for funding a nationwide interoperable network lack details on fund distribution. Some propose a different structure for managing a shared network, reducing the role of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. Some solutions propose a cooperative organization involving multiple public safety and commercial partners to build an interoperable backbone at 700 MHz. The financial commitment from the commercial partner would be smaller, with state and local agencies playing a greater role in building and controlling access to their parts of the network. Funds for public safety could be distributed through existing grant programs, with the commercial network likely taking the lead in investment and technology decisions. Multiple commercial partners could be involved instead of a single D Block partner with a national license. The public safety network at 700 MHz could involve a cooperative organization with multiple commercial partners. The public safety partner would lead in designing the network and choosing technology standards. Federal funds could be used to build parts of the interoperable backbone, with the federal government playing a minimal role in structuring the agreement. The public safety network at 700 MHz could involve a federally chartered corporation or not-for-profit organization to operate the network with funding from various sources. The FCC's role in assigning the D Block would be replaced by laws governing corporate conduct and congressional oversight. The FCC seeks opinions and information on creating a broadband network for public safety at 700 MHz with the assistance of Congress. Without additional authority from Congress, the FCC is limited to directing outcomes through modifications to spectrum band plans, auction rules, service rules, and network sharing agreements. Topics include provisions for using the Public Safety Broadband License, revising public-private partnerships, structuring the auction of the D Block, and other opportunities for providing broadband. The FCC seeks opinions on creating a broadband network for public safety at 700 MHz with the assistance of Congress. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust would borrow $197 million for capital expenditures, excluding operating costs. The FCC is exploring funding sources for operating costs, including the Universal Service Fund and the Telecommunications Development Fund. The FCC is considering funding options for the operating costs of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, including the Universal Service Fund and the Telecommunications Development Fund. The USF is funded through telephone bill assessments and may require Congressional amendments, while the TDF provides capital to small businesses in the telecommunications industry through interest accrued on FCC deposits. This relates to steps taken before Auction 73 and potential changes to FCC provisions. The FCC established auction procedures for Auction 73, including financial requirements for bidders and service rules for license use. Service rules for advanced wireless services may include requirements for license utilization within a specific timeframe and can specify technologies, uses, or users. For Auction 73, the FCC expanded service rules to mandate spectrum sharing between public safety and commercial licensees, with the commercial licensee building a network to serve both public safety and commercial needs. The FCC mandated spectrum sharing between public safety and commercial licensees in the 700 MHz band, establishing a public-private partnership. This partnership includes a Public Safety Broadband Licensee, a commercial partner holding the D Block license, and a Network Sharing Agreement to build and manage a shared network. Regulatory framework sets and enforces rules for organization, performance, and compliance. The FCC mandated spectrum sharing between public safety and commercial licensees in the 700 MHz band. Licensee holds 10 MHz of spectrum at 700 MHz, while the commercial partner won the D Block license for 10 MHz of spectrum. A Network Sharing Agreement is required to build and manage a shared network, with contracts and legal agreements needing FCC approval. The FCC allocated 24 MHz of spectrum for public safety as part of the transition to digital television. The FCC allocated 24 MHz of spectrum within the 700 MHz band for public safety use, transitioning from analog to digital television. The Public Safety National Coordination Committee (NCC) developed standards and management structures for the 700 MHz band. The band plan was revised to accommodate two licensing approaches, with one block designated for narrowband applications. The FCC revised the band plan in the 700 MHz spectrum to accommodate two licensing approaches - one for narrowband and one for broadband applications. Narrowband operations will use 12 MHz of paired spectrum, while broadband communications will utilize 10 MHz of frequencies. States and localities will administer narrowband channels, while a Public Safety Broadband Licensee will oversee broadband frequencies and guard bands. Financing for narrowband networks will come from a mix of local, state, and federal funds. The FCC revised the band plan in the 700 MHz spectrum to accommodate narrowband and broadband applications. The frequencies at 763 - 768 MHz and 793 - 798 MHz will be assigned to the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, responsible for guard bands at 768 - 769 MHz and 798 - 799 MHz. Public safety network operators may need to modify equipment for the new band plan, with costs covered by the commercial D Block licensee. The public safety licensee must meet requirements including forming a not-for-profit corporation, establishing standards, and compliance. The cost of building the national network using the spectrum would be covered by the commercial partner. The FCC selected the Public Safety Broadband Licensee based on criteria such as not-for-profit status, absence of commercial interests, and broad representation of public safety entities. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust Corporation was formed in anticipation of receiving the public safety license and hired Cyren Call Communications Corporation as its advisor. The PSST was awarded the nationwide Public Safety Broadband License, with representation on the Board of Directors consisting of members from named organizations representing public safety. Representation on the Board of the Directors of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee consists of members from named organizations representing public safety. The FCC initially designated 11 organizations to appoint board members, with two at-large members, totaling 13 members. Later, the board composition was changed to add three representatives from named organizations, increase at-large members to four, and have four at-large members selected jointly by FCC bureaus. The National Public Safety Telecommunications Council was removed as a named member due to membership overlap. PSST, as the selected licensee, must submit quarterly financial reports to the FCC and relevant bureaus. The FCC requires the Public Safety Broadband Licensee to submit quarterly financial reports and meet specific criteria for corporate governance. The FCC will provide oversight to ensure compliance with these requirements. The FCC has the authority to re-assign the commercial license if necessary and revoke the license awarded to the Public Safety Broadband Licensee under certain circumstances. Requests for reassignment or re-auction of the D Block license were rejected. The FCC reserves the right to re-assign or revoke commercial licenses if necessary. The public safety license is valid for ten years and renewable. The licensee must negotiate a Network Sharing Agreement, administer network access, represent public safety interests, and negotiate purchase agreements with vendors. The licensee is responsible for managing network access for public safety users, negotiating purchase agreements with vendors, approving equipment and applications, coordinating frequencies, overseeing user relocations, and deciding on federal agency access. They also review requests for wideband networks in areas not covered by the broadband network. The FCC ruled that eligible bidders for Block D in Auction 73 would receive a bidding credit based on their small business status. The D Block designates frequencies at 758 - 763 MHz and 788 - 793 MHz, totaling 10 MHz, and was offered as a single, nationwide license in Auction 73. The FCC set a reserve price of $1.33 billion for the D Block license in Auction 73. The winning bidder had to meet specific requirements, including a Network Sharing Agreement with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. Negotiations for the NSA were to begin after the winning bidder filed its long form application, with completion required within six months. The FCC required the completion of a Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) within six months of the winning bidder filing the long form application for the D Block license. The agreement included provisions for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee to have right of first refusal and the option to purchase network assets at fair market value if the D Block license is cancelled. Negotiations were to be actively pursued, with monthly reports required after three months and FCC staff present as neutral observers. The FCC required detailed monthly reports on negotiations for the D Block license. Two FCC staff members would observe negotiations, and separate legal entities were required for holding the license, owning network assets, and operating the network. These entities must be \"bankruptcy remote\" and approved by the FCC, with a corporate structure comprised of quasi-independent companies. The commercial partner in the public-private partnership for the D Block license must have a corporate structure with quasi-independent companies, all approved by the FCC. These entities are responsible for building out the shared network as per the Network Sharing Agreement and FCC rules. Failure to meet obligations could result in license revocation and penalties. The D Block license is valid for ten years unless revoked. The D Block license holder would be penalized 10% of the auction price if defaulted, valid for ten years from February 17, 2009. License renewal possible if FCC rules are followed. A commercial corporation must build the public safety network as per FCC requirements and Network Sharing Agreement. Benchmarks set for population-based build-out, reaching 75% in four years and 95% in seven years. The FCC established benchmarks for a population-based build-out, with coverage reaching 75% of the population in four years, 95% in seven years, and 99.3% in ten years. The D Block licensee must meet these benchmarks or face license cancellation. Additionally, to improve coverage in rural areas, the licensee must offer a handset with integrated satellite solution for public safety use. The D Block licensee must meet population coverage benchmarks set by the FCC or risk license cancellation. To enhance coverage in rural areas, they must provide a handset with integrated satellite solution for public safety use. The Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) serves as the foundation of the public-private partnership, with rules ensuring service reliability and performance for public safety users. The FCC oversees the NSA components and prohibits the licensee from discontinuing or degrading service without approval. The FCC requires adherence to the Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) for commercial and public safety licensees. The agreement must meet various requirements, including network coverage, broadband mobile voice, video, and data capabilities, interoperability, signal coverage reliability, and robustness for public safety standards. The FCC requires network coverage, reliability, and capacity to meet public safety standards, including robustness in harsh conditions and backup power. The network must prioritize public safety communications in real-time, with capabilities like push-to-talk and encryption technologies. The FCC mandates network coverage, reliability, and capacity to meet public safety standards, including features like push-to-talk. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee has operational control over the network to ensure public safety requirements are met, including approving equipment specifications and purchasing subscriber equipment. The D Block Licensee must provide integrated handsets for public safety use. A common standard for nationwide broadband interoperability is required for all public safety users. Guidelines and obligations for the Network Sharing Agreement are set by the FCC, including fee structure and duration. Both licensees must negotiate in good faith. The FCC rules mandate network coverage, reliability, and capacity for public safety standards. The Network Sharing Agreement includes fee structure guidelines, such as specifying service fees and negotiating \"reasonable rates\" in good faith. The agreement should have financial incentives for the commercial licensee and affordable rates for public safety. Priority access fees should protect public safety participants from unforeseen payment obligations. The FCC's Network Sharing Agreement outlines guidelines for a reasonable pricing structure, including affordable rates for public safety. The agreement is in effect for up to ten years and may be renewed along with the D Block license. Any modifications to the agreement must be approved by the FCC Commissioners or the Chiefs of the Wireless Bureau and Public Safety and Homeland Security. The FCC requires approval for any modifications to agreements in the public-private partnership structure, involving the NSA or other entities. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee can lease frequencies exclusively to the D Block licensee on a secondary basis, allowing commercial use only when there is no demand from primary public safety users. This privilege is part of the interlocking agreements in the partnership. The FCC requires a spectrum manager leasing arrangement for the D Block licensee in the public-private partnership. The licensee must ensure no interference with public safety users and prioritize first responders. Public safety has emergency access to the spectrum licensed to the D Block. The FCC requires a spectrum manager leasing arrangement for the D Block licensee in the public-private partnership to prioritize first responders. Public safety has emergency access to the spectrum licensed to the D Block for immediate preemption or exclusion from commercial users. In situations not covered by the NSA, the public safety licensee could appeal to the FCC for access to D Block frequencies in emergencies. The FCC revised the band plan for public safety networks to accommodate both narrowband and broadband networks. The FCC made decisions regarding public safety networks in the 700 MHz band, including moving networks, requiring technical adjustments, capping reimbursement at $10 million, prohibiting new narrowband systems, and limiting wideband networks. The new band plan created separate paired spectrum blocks for narrowband and broadband communications. Some states have already begun utilizing the unencumbered spectrum for public safety use. The FCC has designated frequencies in the 700 MHz band for narrowband and broadband communications. States are building narrowband networks using the unencumbered spectrum for public safety. Base stations and radios may need modifications for the new broadband network. Motorola provided a cost estimate for rebanding equipment, with the FCC requiring the D Block licensee to cover costs but implementing measures to control expenses. Motorola estimated the cost of rebanding at $9.45 million, with the FCC setting a cap of $10 million for reimbursements. To control costs, only systems and radios in operation by August 30, 2007, would be covered. The FCC aimed to keep costs around $6 million by limiting the number of devices needing reprogramming. Additionally, new operations on affected frequencies were prohibited after the cut-off date. Rules were established for calculating actual costs and reimbursements to manage relocation expenses. The FCC set a $10 million cap for relocation expenses and prohibited new operations on affected narrowband frequencies after August 30, 2007. Rules were established for calculating costs and reimbursements, requiring public safety and commercial licensees to reach agreements on relocation plans and costs within 30 days. Displaced public safety network operators must provide accurate information on devices and base stations to receive reimbursement. The D Block licensee is responsible for reimbursing only the minimum cost for necessary changes to base stations, mobiles, and portables. The FCC does not require the licensee to cover costs related to reassigning channels or other changes to Regional Planning Committee plans. Reimbursement for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee's costs related to the rebanding program may be possible. The D Block licensee and public safety licensee must agree on total costs not exceeding $10 million for changes necessitated by rebanding, which must be submitted to the FCC as part of the required relocation plan. The winning bidder for the D Block license must reimburse the Public Safety Broadband Licensee for necessary changes related to rebanding, not exceeding $10 million. The agreed amount must be submitted to the FCC as part of the relocation plan, and once approved, paid into a trust account by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. Payments can only be made after the D Block license is conferred to the winning bidder. To operate wideband systems, a waiver is required, which must include an application for authorization, confirmation from the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, agreed-upon conditions of operation, a transition plan to the broadband network, and certification of no reimbursement sought from the D Block licensee. Waivers are only granted for wideband operations within narrowband frequencies, with devices needing to be interoperable with the broadband network. Licenses for wideband operations are valid for five years. The FCC has taken on the role of safeguarding public safety interests, emergency communications, and interoperable networks under the Communications Act. The FCC has positioned itself as the protector of public safety interests, emergency communications, and interoperable networks. It will regulate the actions of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and oversee the operation of a network with a significant asset value. The FCC plans to enforce existing rules and create new ones as needed for the public-private partnership. The FCC, as the protector of public safety interests, plans to enforce rules for the public-private partnership. Congress would guide FCC commissioners through various means. Two bills in the 110th Congress aim to address issues in creating a shared network, including funding for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. Additional funds would promote the establishment of a nationwide, interoperable broadband public safety communications network. The FCC plans to provide grants for a nationwide public safety communications network, with additional funds authorized by Congress. The RESPONDER Act aims to create a trust fund for purchasing interoperable radios for first responders, linked to the auction of the D Block spectrum. The RESPONDER Act aims to create a trust fund for purchasing interoperable radios for first responders using proceeds from the D Block Auction and future auctions, extending auction authority for revenue-producing auctions."
