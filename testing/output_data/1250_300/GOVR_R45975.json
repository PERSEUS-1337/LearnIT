This led to the establishment of the World Health Organization's Expanded Programme on Immunization in 1974. Currently, the U.S. government is a major donor to global vaccination efforts, providing significant funding for organizations like GAVI. Congressional oversight and coordination of funding for global child vaccination are ongoing concerns, along with the promotion of U.S. foreign policy and health security through these efforts. Global child vaccination campaigns, supported by donors, have reduced mortality in poor countries. In the early 1990s, U.S. assistance led to an 80% immunization rate for DTP3. Progress stalled in the late-1990s due to various challenges. In 2000, GAVI was launched to address declining global momentum for vaccinations. Since its launch in 2000, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) has supported the immunization of 700 million children, with the United States providing funding and holding a rotating seat on GAVI's board. Vaccinations are cost-effective in preventing infectious diseases, with WHO recommending 10 vaccines for all children. These immunizations save around 3 million lives annually, especially in low- and middle-income countries with limited vaccine coverage. According to UNICEF, childhood vaccines save around 3 million lives per year globally. Vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) cause high morbidity and mortality, especially in low- and middle-income countries with limited vaccine coverage. Some high-income countries like France and the United States have seen increases in VPD cases due to vaccine hesitancy. GAVI reports that 760 million children were immunized against VPDs from 2000 to 2018, with 66 million children immunized in 2018. Approximately 100 million children are immunized annually, but 20 million infants and children worldwide have not received the full schedule of recommended vaccines. Full vaccination coverage could prevent one in seven deaths in under-5 children, as over 1.5 million children die annually from VPDs, with nearly 60% of these deaths occurring in 10 countries. From 1990 to 2017, child deaths decreased from 12.7 million to 5.8 million due to global immunization campaigns. Measles vaccination coverage prevented 15.6 million deaths from 2000 to 2017. While global vaccine coverage has increased, DTP3 vaccination rates have stagnated. GAVI attributes this to challenges faced by some high-performing countries. Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are particularly dangerous for neonates, new mothers, and pregnant women. Maternal and neonatal tetanus cases have significantly decreased since 2000. Maternal and neonatal tetanus (MNTE) has been almost eliminated globally, with an 85% reduction in newborn deaths from tetanus since 2000. MNTE remains present in 14 countries as of March 2019. In 2018, 86% of children under one received all three doses of the DTP3 vaccine. Child deaths are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, with four out of every five under-5 child deaths occurring in these regions. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) aim to end preventable deaths of newborns and under-5 children by 2030. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) aim to end preventable deaths of newborns and under-5 children by 2030. International efforts led by organizations like WHO, UNICEF, and GAVI, with U.S. support, focus on decreasing vaccine-preventable deaths among children. UNICEF plays a key role in supporting global immunization programs, vaccine supply, quality monitoring, innovation, and disease eradication programs. UNICEF plays a crucial role in global immunization programs by providing vaccinations, ensuring vaccine supply quality, and supporting disease eradication efforts. They align their goals with WHO targets and procure vaccines for GAVI-supported programs. WHO focuses on promoting new vaccines and technologies to extend immunization achievements and protect populations from vaccine-preventable diseases. The Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) for 2011-2020 aligns with WHO's strategic goals to develop new vaccines, establish norms, and ensure quality. WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) provides evidence-based policy recommendations. GAVI, a public-private partnership, aims to expand global access to vaccines and prevent deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. GAVI, founded in 2000 by the United States, WHO, UN, World Bank, and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, aims to expand global vaccine access and prevent VPD deaths. The Phase IV strategy for 2015-2020 aligns with GVAP goals, setting a goal to immunize 300 million children by 2025. Factors affecting global immunization coverage include vaccine hesitancy, stigma, geographic location, country capacity, and poverty. Concerns over VPD resurgence highlight challenges of vaccine hesitancy and stigma, with measles and polio cases persisting. In 2019, some countries saw a resurgence of measles due to vaccine hesitancy. The WHO reported a 300% increase in global measles cases compared to 2018, with surges in the Americas, Middle East, and Europe. Vaccine hesitancy was listed as a major global health threat, fueled by corruption, authoritarian governance, and social discrimination. Nigeria struggled to eliminate polio due to conspiracy theories and vaccine stigma. Geographic distance from health centers also impacted vaccination efforts. Vaccine stigma, geographic distance from health centers, poverty, socioeconomic status, and social determinants of health all contribute to disparities in vaccination coverage. Low-income countries have lower vaccination rates compared to high-income countries, with underfunded medical systems unable to reach all children. Inequities in vaccination coverage exacerbate disease spread, especially in rural areas where coverage is significantly lower than in urban areas. In low-income countries, underfunded medical systems struggle to vaccinate enough children due to inequities in coverage linked to socioeconomic factors. Children born into poverty face higher mortality rates, with unequal access to vaccines being a significant factor. Fragile health care infrastructure in conflict settings further hinders vaccination efforts, with 40% of unvaccinated children residing in countries affected by armed conflict or humanitarian challenges. In conflict-affected areas, armed conflict hinders health workers from carrying out vaccinations and proper disease treatment. Humanitarian settings like refugee camps can also lead to the rapid spread of infectious diseases. Countries with low vaccine coverage, such as the Central African Republic and Syria, have experienced conflicts or emergencies. Congress supports global child vaccination programs to eradicate infectious diseases. The U.S. Congress funds global immunization activities through agencies like CDC, USAID, and GAVI to eradicate infectious diseases worldwide. They work with country governments to strengthen immunization programs and align with global health initiatives. The CDC and USAID support global immunization programs by enhancing surveillance, laboratory capacity, and public health workforce. They align with various global health initiatives and partnerships to provide routine immunizations worldwide. CDC also funds research for new vaccines and plays a key role in controlling vaccine-preventable diseases. The CDC's Global Immunization Program focuses on polio, measles, and other vaccine-preventable diseases. Global vaccination campaigns have significantly reduced polio cases worldwide. The program is guided by the 2016-2020 Strategic Framework for Global Immunization, with goals to control, eliminate, or eradicate vaccine-preventable diseases and strengthen partnerships. Funding details are provided in Table 2. The Global Immunization Program aims to control, eliminate, or eradicate vaccine-preventable diseases globally through strategic goals. The CDC collaborates with various stakeholders to implement the framework aligned with national and global vaccination plans. Funding for global immunization programs in FY2019 exceeded the Administration's request, supporting efforts towards polio eradication, measles, and rubella. The Administration's FY2019 and FY2020 budget requests aimed to reduce funding for global immunization activities, focusing on polio eradication, measles, and rubella elimination in high burden countries. USAID works with ministries of health and GAVI to strengthen routine immunization campaigns and disease surveillance. The agency supports capacity building for foreign health systems to prevent child and maternal deaths. The United States provides significant support for multilateral immunization programs through international organizations and GAVI. The United States provides substantial support for multilateral immunization programs, including contributions to GAVI. GAVI, a public-private partnership founded in 2000, aims to expand global access to vaccines and prevent deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. The US plays a central role in GAVI's governance, funding, and strategic planning, with nearly $2 billion donated since its inception. Congress appropriates funding for GAVI through USAID's Global Health Programs. The United States is the third largest donor to GAVI, providing nearly $2 billion since its founding. Congress appropriates funding for GAVI through USAID's Global Health Programs. The Trump Administration proposed cuts to GAVI funding, but Congress has consistently supported child vaccinations for VPDs overseas. Congress has allocated $290 million for GAVI, maintaining the same level as in FY2018. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of global vaccination campaigns in preventing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and mumps, which could threaten U.S. public health. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) recently held a hearing to discuss these issues. The CDC reports that outbreaks in the United States are mainly caused by travelers from Europe and abroad, along with domestic vaccine hesitancy. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions held a hearing to address preventable disease outbreaks linked to international travelers. Congress may consider oversight of vaccine issues, misinformation campaigns, and foreign aid programs supporting immunization. The Trump Administration requested cuts to global health funding, including for vaccination campaigns, to focus funds on specific countries and populations. The Trump Administration requested cuts to global health funding for vaccination campaigns, aiming to focus on specific countries and populations with the highest disease burden. Experts warn that stagnation in vaccination coverage and resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases are concerning, highlighting the need for increased support for global vaccine campaigns. This raises questions about burden sharing and the efficacy of efforts to boost vaccination rates globally."
