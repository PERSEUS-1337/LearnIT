    "content": "The House and Senate Armed Services Committees annually review national defense authorization bills with provisions affecting military personnel, retirees, and their families. Differences between the House and Senate versions are resolved by a conference committee. This report highlights personnel-related issues in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 and compares House and Senate versions. The FY2016 NDAA was passed by the House and Senate, signed by the President after vetoing an earlier version due to exceeding defense spending caps. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 raised spending caps for both defense and nondefense spending. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 raised spending caps for both defense and nondefense spending, leading to the modification of the FY2016 NDAA to comply with the revised caps. The amended version of the NDAA was passed by the House and Senate and signed by the President. The authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 were increased in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but Congress began reversing these increases in anticipation of troop withdrawals and budget constraints. In response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, authorized active duty end-strengths increased after FY2006 but began declining in anticipation of troop withdrawals and budget constraints. By FY2015, end-strengths were: Army (490,000), Navy (323,600), Marine Corps (184,100), and Air Force (312,980). The Army plans to reduce active personnel to 420,000-450,000 by FY2017, while the Marine Corps plans to reduce to 175,000-182,000 by FY2019. The Administration's request proposed reductions for the Army but level or increased strengths for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. The final bill authorizes end-strengths for the armed forces, with the exception of the Air Force which is higher than the Administration's request. Section 402 of the initial Senate-passed bill would have repealed minimum end-strengths for the armed forces and allowed reductions in personnel numbers. The final bill authorizes end-strengths for the armed forces, with the exception of the Air Force which is higher than the Administration's request. It allows reductions in personnel numbers for the National Guard and Reserve, as well as the active component and Selected Reserve. Section 402 of the bill adjusted the minimum end-strengths required by 10 USC 619 downward, expanding the authority of the Secretary of Defense to decrease these minimum strengths by up to 2%. The authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 5% over the past 14 years, with significant reductions in Navy Reserve strength. Between FY2001 and FY2015, the largest shifts in authorized end strength have occurred in the Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve. Authorized end strength reductions have occurred in the Navy Reserve (-35.5%), Air Force Reserve (-9.8%), and Coast Guard Reserve (-12.5%). Smaller changes were seen in the Air National Guard (-2.8%) and Army Reserve (-1.6%). The Army National Guard and Marine Corps Reserve have remained largely unchanged. The Administration proposed reductions for Army National Guard, Army Reserve, and Marine Corps Reserve, while increases were proposed for Navy Reserve, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve. No change was proposed for the Coast Guard Reserve. The enacted bill matched the Administration's request. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) matched the Administration's request for end-strengths. Concerns about military personnel costs and pay raises have led to a focus on the annual increase in basic pay, which is currently set at 2.3% unless Congress or the President specifies otherwise. The FY2016 President's Budget requested a 1.3% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.3%. The FY2016 President's Budget requested a 1.3% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.3%. Department of Defense plans to limit increases in basic pay through FY2020, with projected pay raise percentages of 1.3% in FY2017, 1.5% in FY2018 and FY2019, and 1.8% in FY2020. The initial House bill did not specify the rate of increase in basic pay, but there is support for a 2.3% military pay raise for fiscal year 2016 to keep pace with current law. The committee supports a 2.3 percent military pay raise for fiscal year 2016 to keep pace with the private sector. President Obama set the pay raise at 1.3% invoking 37 U.S.C. 1009(e). The final bill froze the basic pay of generals and did not include a general pay raise provision. The final bill for fiscal year 2016 froze the basic pay of generals and admirals at 2014 levels, while President Obama's specified 1.3% pay raise remained in place. The military retirement system is a noncontributory, defined benefit system that provides a monthly annuity to servicemembers after 20 years of qualifying service. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 established a commission to modernize pay and benefits for the armed services. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) was established by the NDAA for FY2013 to provide recommendations on modernizing pay and benefits for the armed services. The final report was delivered to Congress on January 29, 2015, and many proposed changes were included in the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356). The bill changes the retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service. The new system for the Thrift Savings Plan implements a reduced multiplier for the defined benefit to 2.0% from 2.5% and authorizes continuation pay at 12 years of service. Existing servicemembers and those entering the military before January 1, 2018 will be grandfathered into the current system, while those with less than 12 years of service on December 31, 2017 can elect the new system. Cost of Living Allowance adjustments enacted by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 are repealed by this Act. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 repealed Cost of Living Allowance adjustments and the FY2014 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military highlighted issues of unwanted sexual contact and social retaliation. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses concerns about retaliation and male victims of sexual assault, enhancing the Special Victims' Counsel Program and modifying requirements for judicial proceedings, reporting, and sentencing in sex-related offenses. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified a need for the DOD to improve care for male sexual assault victims. On January 24, 2013, the Department of Defense rescinded the Direct Combat Exclusion Rule to allow women in combat roles. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter later announced that all military occupations were open to women with no exceptions. Congress has established requirements for gender-neutral occupational standards in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994. The Carl Levin and Howard P. ''Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 emphasized the need for performance standards in the military to be related to actual duties and individual capabilities. The FY2016 NDAA added criteria for combat unit readiness standards, requiring validation efforts. DOD must notify Congress of changes to assignment policies for females, with a shortened review period under the enacted bill. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) shortens the waiting period for Congress to review changes in assignment policies for females to 30 calendar days. This change provides a more definitive timeline for DOD implementation and reduces the in-session time needed for Congress to act on proposed changes. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission found weaknesses in financial literacy programs for military servicemembers, potentially affecting servicemembers, military families, and overall readiness. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) identified weaknesses in financial literacy programs for military servicemembers, which could have adverse effects on servicemembers, military families, and overall readiness. Enhancing financial management training programs could lead to significant cost savings for the DOD and reduce the number of troops separated due to financial distress. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes provisions for financial literacy training at various career points and life transitions. The statutory requirements for enlistment in the active component and reserve components differ slightly under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7504 and 10 U.S.C. \u00a712102. Section 504 allows exceptions for enlistment in the national interest, such as the MAVNI program. Section 12102 specifies that an enlistee must be a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. The Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) program allows enlistment in the national interest if the Secretary determines it is vital. Enlistees must be U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or have previous military service. The enacted bill did not link eligibility requirements for the reserve and active components. The Post-9/11 GI Bill provided more generous educational benefits than REAP, leading to a recommendation to terminate REAP by the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission. The Senate-passed bill established a sunset date for REAP four years after the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, allowing only those currently using REAP to continue until then. The Senate provision in H.R. 1735 would entitle individuals leaving the Armed Forces to a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" one year after the Act's enactment. This card would identify the bearer as a veteran and include their name and photograph. Requests for an official identification card have been made by veterans and advocacy groups. The Senate provision in H.R. 1735 would entitle individuals leaving the Armed Forces (other than as the result of a punitive discharge as part of a court-martial) beginning one year from the enactment of the Act to a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" that identifies them as veterans. The card would include their name and photograph, and the Secretary of Defense may negotiate with national retail chains for its acceptance. Additionally, honorably discharged veterans can use state-issued ID cards or obtain proof of military service through the joint DOD-VA eBenefits web portal. Members of the Uniformed Services can obtain an ID card through the DOD-VA eBenefits web portal or by demonstrating military service with a DD-214. President Obama signed the Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015 into law, requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide identification cards to veterans. Congress is interested in recruiting and retaining high-quality personnel in the armed forces, using bonuses and incentives like educational benefits. Section 531 of H.R. 1735 authorizes service secretaries to provide recruitment incentives for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel. Section 531 of H.R. 1735 authorizes service secretaries to develop recruitment incentives for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel, subject to congressional review. When reservists are called into active federal service, they are eligible for legal protections, including the right to reemployment under USERRA. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994 grants the right to reemployment for those leaving civilian jobs for military service, with a five-year limit on cumulative service. Certain types of duty, such as reservist activations under Full Mobilization, Partial Mobilization, and Presidential Reserve Call-Up, are exempt from this limit. New mobilization authorities created in 2011 allow for 120-day activations for disaster response and 365-day activations for preplanned missions. Activations under these new authorities currently count towards the five-year limit. Section 565 of H.R. 1735 aims to exempt military duty under the new reserve activation authorities from counting towards the limit. The new reserve activation authorities created in 2011 allow for 120-day activations for disaster response and 365-day activations for preplanned missions. Activations under these authorities currently count towards the five-year limit on military service for reemployment protection under USERRA. Section 565 of H.R. 1735 aims to exempt military duty under these new authorities from the cumulative five-year limit. An individual must have \"active military, naval, or air service\" to be considered a veteran for most VA benefits. Active service includes full-time service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Additional circumstances of service are outlined in law (38 U.S.C. 101). Members of the National Guard and reserves who are never activated for active duty military service may not be considered veterans for VA benefits. Members of the National Guard and reserves who do not have active duty military service may not meet the statutory definition of a veteran, even if they qualify for reserve retirement after 20 years of service. The initial House-passed bill honored reservists as veterans but did not confer additional benefits. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 established a pilot Career Intermission Program (CIP) allowing servicemembers to take time off from their military career for up to 3 years. The program was created as a retention initiative for 20 officers and enlisted personnel per year. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) allows servicemembers to take up to 3 years off from their military career for work/life balance or broadening opportunities. Participants must return to active duty in a later year group and accept additional service obligations. The program aims to retain high-performing servicemembers and increase retention rates. DOD must submit a final assessment to Congress by March 1, 2016. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) allows servicemembers to take up to 3 years off for work/life balance or broadening opportunities, with a maximum six-year follow-on obligation. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) removes restrictions on program participation for military personnel. Congress aims to improve recruitment, retention, and career management for the acquisition workforce by providing incentives for high-performing military personnel and enhancing professional military education in acquisition. Military acquisition professionals oversee funding for defense programs worth billions of dollars. The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 created incentives for officers to be educated and experienced in joint matters, tying joint professional military education and service in joint assignments to promotions. The enacted bill extends joint duty credit to include service in acquisition-related assignments and allows officers to pursue a dual career track in combat arms and acquisition. NDAA conferees encouraged the Secretary of Defense to ensure Phase II joint professional military education includes acquisition matters for successful performance. The NDAA extends joint duty credit to include acquisition-related assignments and allows officers to pursue dual career tracks in combat arms and acquisition. The Secretary of Defense is encouraged to include acquisition matters in Phase II joint professional military education. Current DOD policies prohibit military servicemembers from carrying personal firearms on military bases, except for personnel engaged in assigned duties. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) would give more flexibility to commanders of military installations to establish protocols for servicemembers to carry firearms for force protection measures. This follows recent active shooter incidents on military bases, prompting a reevaluation of current DOD policies. The Purple Heart is awarded to Armed Forces members killed or wounded in action. Servicemembers in the Oklahoma City bombing are ineligible for the Purple Heart. Supporters argue they should be eligible due to being victims of terrorism. The Purple Heart eligibility criteria were expanded in the FY2015 NDAA to include servicemembers wounded and killed in the 2009 terrorist attacks at Little Rock, AR and Fort Hood, TX. Some debated whether these acts should be considered terrorism due to the Muslim perpetrators' motives. The Purple Heart eligibility criteria were expanded in the FY2015 NDAA to include servicemembers wounded and killed in the 2009 terrorist attacks at Little Rock, AR and Fort Hood, TX. Section 571 of the NDAA redefined what constitutes an attack by a \"foreign terrorist organization\" for Purple Heart eligibility. The provision in Section 583 of the initial House-passed bill was not adopted, meaning victims of the Oklahoma City bombing are not eligible for the Purple Heart under the enacted bill. The issue of military working dogs (MWDs) has received congressional and media attention over the years with Congress enacting laws related to the transfer and adoption of MWDs. In November 2000, Congress passed \"Robby's Law\" (P.L. 106-446) to end the euthanizing of MWDs and facilitate their adoption by law enforcement agencies and former handlers. The NDAA for FY2012 expanded eligibility to adopt MWDs to include handlers, family members, and siblings of deceased handlers. The NDAA for FY2012 expanded eligibility to adopt MWDs to include handlers, family members, and siblings of deceased handlers. The NDAA for FY2013 allowed retiring MWDs to be transferred for adoption. Current law does not require DOD to transfer retired MWDs overseas back to the United States. Congress passed a bill requiring DOD to transfer retiring MWDs located overseas to the United States and give adoption priority to former handlers. The House-passed bill (H.R. 1735) and Section 352 of the initial Senate-passed bill require DOD to transfer retiring MWDs located overseas to the United States and prioritize adoption for former handlers. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) changes \"may\" to \"shall,\" mandating that all military working dogs be retired only after being returned to the United States. Critics argue that the lack of appropriated funds for the transfer of retiring MWDs from abroad will make this process costly. The President's FY2015 and FY2016 budget proposals included cuts to the Defense Commissary System, with reductions in subsidies for commissaries. The FY2015 NDAA restored funding and required a study of cost reductions. The reduced subsidies could lead to fewer operating days and increased costs for goods and services for authorized patrons. The reduced subsidies for commissaries could lead to fewer operating days and increased costs for goods and services for authorized patrons, including active duty military members, retired personnel, and disabled veterans. The enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for budget-neutrality by March 1, 2016, focusing on customer service satisfaction and sustaining discount savings for eligible patrons by October 1, 2018. The Defense Secretary must submit a plan by March 1, 2016, to achieve budget-neutrality by October 1, 2018, focusing on customer service satisfaction, high product quality, and sustaining discount savings for eligible patrons. The plan should include potential modifications to the commissary and exchange systems, pricing constructs, and the impact on Morale, Welfare, and Recreation programs. This report should consider Section 634 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 and previous reports and studies. The Defense Secretary must submit a plan by March 1, 2016, to achieve budget-neutrality by October 1, 2018, focusing on customer service satisfaction, high product quality, and sustaining discount savings for eligible patrons. The plan should include potential modifications to the commissary and exchange systems, pricing constructs, and the impact on Morale, Welfare, and Recreation programs. Section 652 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program to be submitted to the Committees on Armed Services within 180 days. TRICARE is a health care program for uniformed servicemembers, retirees, and their dependents. The Administration proposed changes in FY2016 budget, but only pharmaceutical copays were adopted. Recommendations for TRICARE changes were also made in the MCRMC final report, but not endorsed by the President. The Administration proposed changes to TRICARE in the FY2016 budget, but only pharmaceutical copays were adopted. Recommendations for TRICARE changes were made in the MCRMC final report, but not endorsed by the President or adopted in H.R. 1735. Congress may consider major changes to TRICARE in the future, but a deliberate approach is recommended to understand the implications and unintended consequences. Provisions in the Act aim to improve access to care, deliver better health outcomes, enhance the care experience, and control healthcare costs. The Act recommends provisions to improve access to care, deliver better health outcomes, enhance the care experience, and control healthcare costs within the Department of Defense. It lays the foundation for comprehensive TRICARE modernization and reform legislation in the near future, aiming to improve access, quality, and the experience of care for all beneficiaries while ensuring the long-term viability and cost-effectiveness of the military health care system. The current system is deemed inadequate and in need of modernization to meet future needs. To modernize the military healthcare system, all elements must be reevaluated, including potential fee and co-pay increases. TRICARE beneficiaries have access to various pharmacy options, with active duty servicemembers receiving free medications from military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order, and retail network pharmacies. TRICARE beneficiaries can get free medications from military pharmacies, TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery, or TRICARE retail network pharmacies. Military pharmacies offer a 90-day supply of formulary medications for prescriptions from civilian and military providers. Non-formulary drugs are generally not available. The 2015 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase in pharmacy copays and mandated refills for maintenance drugs to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies. The Administration's FY2016 budget proposed annual copayment increases from 2016 to 2025. Section 702 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes smaller copayment increases than initially proposed. Section 702 of the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes a one-time increase in pharmacy copayments for prescriptions filled at retail and mail-order pharmacies. The copay for generic drugs at retail pharmacies increases from $8 to $10, and for formulary brand name drugs from $20 to $24. Mail-order copays for formulary drugs increase from $16 to $20, and for non-formulary drugs from $46 to $49. This change is estimated to reduce direct spending by about $1.5 billion over 10 years. The military health system underwent a review resulting in an action plan ordered by then-Secretary of Defense Hagel. Some Members of Congress are interested in the follow-up plan's implementation. The initial Senate bill would have required actions to increase visibility of health quality metrics, costing about $95 million over 2016-2020. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) is less demanding and presumably less costly. Access to contraception remains a concern, as reported by the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Service in their 2014 annual report. Access to contraception remains a concern, with TRICARE covering various forms of birth control but not condoms or nonprescription spermicidal products. The enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to establish clinical practice guidelines for contraception methods within one year. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires the Secretary of Defense to establish clinical practice guidelines for contraception methods within one year, ensuring all women in the Armed Forces have access to comprehensive counseling on contraception."
