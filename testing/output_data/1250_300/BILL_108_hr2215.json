    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act.\" It includes findings related to the issue. Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States annually, caused by inadequately treated sewage containing harmful bacteria and viruses. Swimming in contaminated waters can lead to illnesses such as gastroenteritis and hepatitis, resulting in significant economic losses and beach closures. Many sewer systems lack proper monitoring for detecting contamination. Public health authorities are not routinely notified of sewer overflows that threaten public health, leading to economic losses estimated at $28,000,000,000 annually in the United States. Better monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sewer overflows could prevent millions of Americans from getting sick each year. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nDefines \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow, spill, release, or diversion of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups caused by building blockages. \n\nSEC. 4. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SEWER OVERFLOWS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include requirements for publicly owned treatment works to alert, notify, and report sanitary sewer overflows to the public and relevant authorities within 24 hours of awareness. Publicly owned treatment works must notify public health authorities and other affected entities of any sanitary sewer overflow that may endanger human health within 24 hours. They must provide oral or electronic reports to the Administrator or State within 24 hours of awareness and a written report within 5 days detailing the overflow's magnitude, duration, and suspected cause. Publicly owned treatment works must report all sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State, including details such as the magnitude, duration, suspected cause, steps taken to reduce recurrence, and impact mitigation measures. They must also report the total number of overflows in a calendar year, regardless of reaching waters of the United States, with specifics on wastewater released, overflow duration, and location. Publicly owned treatment works must report all sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State, including details such as magnitude, duration, suspected cause, steps taken to reduce recurrence, and impact mitigation measures. States must report annually to the EPA on reported overflows within their jurisdiction. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sanitary sewer overflows. Additionally, the authorization of appropriations is set at $2.2 billion for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2008."
