The \"Save America's Jobs Act of 2002\" amends the definition of domestic for corporations and partnerships under the Internal Revenue Code. It states that a corporation or partnership is considered domestic if created or organized in the United States, unless specified otherwise by the Secretary. In a corporate expatriation transaction, the acquiring corporation is treated as domestic. A corporate expatriation transaction occurs when a nominally foreign acquiring corporation obtains substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation, with over 80% of the acquiring corporation's stock held by former shareholders of the domestic corporation. The acquiring corporation in a corporate expatriation transaction is held by former shareholders of the domestic corporation, with a lower stock ownership requirement in certain cases. This applies if the nominally foreign corporation lacks substantial business activities in the foreign country where it is created or organized. The term 'corporate expatriation transaction' includes transactions where a nominally foreign corporation acquires properties of a domestic partnership. The term 'corporate expatriation transaction' involves a foreign corporation acquiring properties of a domestic partnership, with specific ownership requirements for the acquiring corporation. The term 'corporate expatriation transaction' involves a foreign corporation acquiring properties of a domestic partnership, with specific ownership requirements. Special rules apply, treating related transactions as one and excluding stock held by the acquiring corporation's affiliated group. Definitions include 'nominally foreign corporation' and 'expanded affiliated group.' The term 'expanded affiliated group' refers to an affiliated group without certain restrictions. The Secretary of the Treasury will adjust tax rates to offset revenue changes due to the amendment.

It applies to corporate expatriation transactions after September 11, 2001, and also to transactions before that date for acquiring corporations starting after December 31, 2003."
