    "content": "The \"Public Domain Enhancement Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. The findings section of the Act is also included. The Congress finds that the copyright clause in the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to promote the progress of science and arts by securing exclusive rights to authors for limited times. This serves to provide economic incentives for creators and promote the free flow of ideas and information in society. Both commercial and noncommercial creators rely on copyright protection. The public domain is essential for both commercial and noncommercial creators, as it provides raw material for new productions and educational materials. Various entities like book publishers, schools, museums, and media sources benefit from the public domain's freedom of content. Under current law, copyright protection is granted to works published as early as 1923, but the majority of older works are no longer commercially available. Only 2 percent of works between 55 and 75 years old retain commercial value. This prevents entities from building upon, cultivating, and preserving abandoned works, even though they can be useful to historians, artists, and teachers. The existing copyright system does not align with the original intent of the Constitution and the Copyright Act, as it prevents abandoned works from entering the public domain, despite their potential usefulness to historians, artists, and teachers. It is necessary to establish a mechanism for abandoned American copyrights to enter the public domain. SEC. 3. MAINTENANCE FEE FOR PUBLISHED UNITED STATES WORKS. The definition of \"United States work\" in section 101 of title 17, United States Code, is amended for sections 306 and 411. Section 302 of title 17 is amended for works created on or after January 1, 1978, and section 303(a) is amended for works created but not published or copyrighted before January 1, 1978. Section 303(a) of title 17, United States Code, is amended to include provisions related to copyright and section 306. Subsection (a) of Section 304 is also amended to include references to section 306 for subsisting copyrights. The text chunk discusses amendments related to copyright maintenance fees under section 306 of title 17, United States Code. It includes details on inserting specific language in paragraphs and subsections to clarify the fee structure. Section 306 of title 17, United States Code, introduces a maintenance fee of $1 for published US works to keep the copyright valid. The fee is due 50 years after first publication or by December 31, 2004, and every 10 years thereafter. Failure to pay the fee within a 6-month grace period will result in copyright expiration. Ancillary or promotional works related to the main work will also be covered under this fee. The maintenance fee for published US works under Section 306 of title 17, United States Code, is $1 to keep the copyright valid. Ancillary or promotional works related to the main work are also covered under this fee. The fee must be accompanied by a prescribed form and additional material as required by the Register of Copyrights. The Register of Copyrights must establish procedures to ease the submission of maintenance fee forms for published US works under Section 306 of title 17, United States Code. Additionally, they must ensure that the information from these forms is easily accessible to the public within 12 months of the Act's enactment."
