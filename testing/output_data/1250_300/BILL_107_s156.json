    "content": "The \"After School Education and Anti-Crime Act of 2001\" aims to improve academic and social outcomes for students, reduce juvenile crime, and provide productive activities during after school hours to prevent youth from becoming victims of crime. Congress finds that today's youth face increased social risks, spend more time unsupervised, and are most at risk of violence between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Academic failure consequences are more severe in 2001. After school programs are effective in addressing youth social issues, with support from governors, police chiefs, and prosecutors. Over 450 police chiefs, sheriffs, and prosecutors, along with police officer associations, have urged public officials to provide after school programs for children and teens in the US, emphasizing the importance of safe and positive learning environments during those hours. The goals of the Act include increasing academic success, promoting safe after-school environments, providing alternatives to negative activities, and reducing juvenile crime. The Act also amends the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act to increase program authorization from 3 to 5. Section 10904 of the Century Community Learning Centers Act is amended to require recipients to provide a certain percentage of the annual cost of activities from sources other than federal funds. This contribution can be in cash or in kind, and not more than 25% of the cost can come from funds provided by the Secretary under other federal programs. The recipient must contribute a percentage of the annual cost of activities from non-federal sources, with a limit on the use of funds from other federal programs. SEC. 7. USES OF FUNDS.

The 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act allows grants for community learning centers offering activities like job skills preparation, drug prevention, health counseling, and after school programs with mentoring, academic assistance, and recreational activities. At least 2/3 of the funds must be used for after school programs, which may also include expanded opportunities for children and youth. SEC. 8.
