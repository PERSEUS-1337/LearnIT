{"title": "ByEtPiAcY7", "content": "Knowledge extraction techniques aim to make neural networks more understandable by converting them into symbolic descriptions. The challenge is to find explanations that are simpler than the original model but still accurate. Some believe that the complex nature of deep networks makes it impossible to explain their hidden features in a way that humans can understand. However, this paper proposes a knowledge extraction method using \\textit{M-of-N} rules to address this issue. The paper proposes a knowledge extraction method using \\textit{M-of-N} rules to map the complexity/accuracy landscape of rules in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Results show an optimal trade-off between comprehensibility and accuracy, with rules in the first and final layers being highly explainable, while those in the second and third layers are less so. This sheds light on the feasibility of rule extraction from deep networks. The results highlight the feasibility of rule extraction from deep networks and emphasize the value of decompositional knowledge extraction for explainability in Artificial Intelligence. There is a growing interest in explainable AI due to the lack of explainability in neural network models, particularly deep networks. These models rely on distributed representations and are not easily interpretable compared to symbolic AI or symbolic Machine Learning. Knowledge extraction aims to increase the explainability of neural networks by uncovering implicit knowledge in their weights. This involves translating trained neural networks into symbolic rules or decision trees, similar to symbolic AI and Machine Learning approaches. Rule extraction techniques have been developed over decades to translate trained neural networks into symbolic rules or decision trees, similar to symbolic AI and Machine Learning approaches. These techniques take either a decompositional or pedagogical approach, with the major challenge being the complexity of the extracted rules. Extractive summarization: Knowledge extraction from neural networks can be challenging due to the distributed representations found in the networks, where important concepts are represented by patterns of activity over many neurons. This distributed nature is believed to play a significant role in the capabilities of neural networks. The distributed nature of neural networks, identified as a fundamental property of connectionism, has led to the conclusion that explaining latent features using symbolic knowledge extraction is a dead end. Distillation methods are suggested instead for improving robustness, although their efficacy is debated. Some approaches focus on guarantees of network behavior or visualizations to explain individual features. In this paper, a method is developed to empirically examine the explainability of latent variables in neural networks by using rule extraction to analyze the behavior of a network. The approach involves searching through a space of rules to measure error and complexity, allowing for a trade-off between complexity and accuracy in capturing network behavior. This method is applied to a standard 4-layer CNN. The behavior of a network is analyzed using rule extraction on a 4-layer CNN trained on fashion MNIST. A 'critical point' on the rule extraction landscape reveals an ideal M-of-N rule for each latent variable. The accuracy of rules varies between layers and architectures, with convolutional layers showing more complex rules extracted without penalty. The fully connected layers had simpler rules compared to the convolutional layers, with complexities over 0.4 in the convolutional layers and under 0.2 in the fully connected layers. Rules from the first and final layer had near 0% error, while those from the second and third layers had up to 15% error. The paper provides an overview of previous algorithms, defines accuracy and complexity for M-of-N rules, and presents experimental results on rule extraction for accuracy/complexity mapping. The experimental results of rule extraction process for accuracy/complexity mapping are discussed. Knowledge extraction methods like KBANN and algorithms generating binary trees for M-of-N rules are mentioned. Recent algorithms for rule extraction involve creating binary trees where each node represents an M-of-N rule. These algorithms select rules based on maximum information gain from input units, treating the model as a black box for data generation. Other methods combine pedagogical and decompositional approaches. Various methods have been developed to solve the 'black-box' problem of neural networks, including pedagogical and decompositional approaches. Most techniques focus on input/output relationships rather than explaining the latent features of deep networks. Explaining hidden features in deep networks requires producing a hierarchy of rules. Some layers of deep networks may have explainable rules that can clarify the network's behavior in terms of certain features, despite the complexity of hierarchical rule extraction. This challenges the impracticality of using decompositional techniques to explain deep network features end-to-end. The network's behavior can be explained by extractable rules, offering insight into latent feature similarities. Logical rules in programming are defined as A \u2190 B, with A as the head and B as the body. Disjunctions in the body can be modelled as multiple rules with the same head in logic programs. When explaining a neural network using rules, literals represent the states of neurons. For binary neurons, a literal X is True if x = 1 and False if x = 0. For neurons with continuous activation values, a literal X is True if x > a, and False otherwise. In neural networks, a latent variable is not well described by a single conjunctive rule. In neural networks, a latent variable is poorly described by a single conjunctive rule. M-of-N rules soften the conjunctive constraint by requiring only M variables to be true. This approach is commonly used in rule extraction. M-of-N rules offer a compact representation that reflects input/output dependencies in neural networks. They are a subset of propositional formulas and share structural similarity with neural networks, acting as 'weightless perceptrons'. M-of-N rules are represented by perceptrons in neural networks, with the output neuron as the head and visible neurons as the body. Setting bias and weights accordingly allows for encoding M-of-N rules. This approach has been used in knowledge extraction and is now being revisited for explainability in neural networks with continuous activation values. To define literals for rule extraction in neural networks with continuous activation values, splitting values are chosen for each neuron based on information gain. The splitting values are selected to maximize the decrease in entropy of the network outputs on test examples. Input literals are then generated from the inputs to the target neuron being explained. The input literals are generated from the inputs to the target neuron by choosing splits that maximize information gain. Each target literal in a layer will have its own set of input literals, corresponding to the same input neurons but with different splits. In convolution layers, each feature map corresponds to a group of neurons with different input patches. Only the neuron with the optimal split that maximizes information gain with respect to the network output is tested, resulting in a single rule. The rule extraction process focuses on maximizing information gain for each feature map in a neural network. Accuracy and comprehensibility are key metrics in this process, with accuracy defined in terms of the difference between rule predictions and network outputs. By computing the state of neurons in the network, we can determine the truth of rules and use the network to validate them. The process of rule extraction aims to maximize information gain for each feature map in a neural network. Accuracy is measured by comparing rule predictions with network outputs, while comprehensibility is assessed based on the complexity of rules. The discrepancy between rule predictions and network outputs is evaluated using a set of input configurations, and the average error of the rules is calculated over a test set. The complexity of a rule is determined by the length of its body in disjunctive normal form (DNF), measured relative to a maximum complexity normalized with respect to the number of input variables. The complexity of a rule is determined by the length of its body in disjunctive normal form (DNF), measured relative to a maximum complexity normalized with respect to the number of input variables. In order to control for growth, the logarithm is taken to give a normalized complexity measure. An example is provided with a simple perceptron and a rule h = 1 \u21d0\u21d2 1-of{x 1 = 1, \u00ac(x 2 = 1)}, showing an error of 0.25. A 1-of-2 rule is considered the most complex for 2 variables. The loss function for a rule R is defined as a weighted sum with a parameter \u03b2 determining the trade-off between soundness and complexity. By using a brute force search procedure with various values of \u03b2, the relationship between the allowed complexity of a rule and its maximum accuracy can be explicitly determined. For \u03b2 = 0, the rule with the minimum loss will be the one with minimum error regardless of complexity, while for large \u03b2 values, the rule with the minimum loss will have 0 complexity, such as a 1-of-1 rule or trivial rules that always predict true or false. The loss function for a rule R is defined as a weighted sum with a parameter \u03b2 determining the trade-off between soundness and complexity. A neuron h j with n input neurons x i generates splits for each neuron using a technique to give a set of literals H j and X i. The search through M-of-N rules minimizes L(R) by reordering variables based on the weight magnitude. The search procedure relies on considering rules for different values of N and M. The search procedure for generating splits in a neural network relies on the ordering of variables. A neuron with n input neurons has O(2^n) possible M-of-N rules, making exhaustive search intractable. The procedure maximizes information gain to define literals for each neuron. The search procedure for generating splits in a neural network relies on the ordering of variables. It assumes that the most accurate M-of-N rules use the literals corresponding to neurons with the strongest weights. The conditional independence of hidden units is valid except for the final layer due to the softmax function. Ordering literals by weight rather than information gains seems to yield high accuracy in experimental results. Ordering literals by weight reduces search space from exponential to polynomial, but remains computationally challenging with many examples and neurons. Rule extraction implemented in Spark on IBM cloud for efficiency. Accuracy measured using training set examples for evaluating rules against network output. By running the search in parallel, we can map the accuracy/complexity graph for about 50 hidden neurons in the second and third layer in several hours. Increasing the number of examples used in the accuracy calculation greatly increases the time taken, so only 1000 examples are used. The extraction process for the first hidden feature in the CNN trained on the fashion MNIST data set is demonstrated by selecting 1000 random input examples from the training set. The CNN trained on the fashion MNIST dataset selects 1000 random input examples from the training set to compute neuron activations and predicted labels. Neuron 96 with an information gain of 0.015 at split value 0.0004 corresponds to a 5x5 image patch. Neuron 96 corresponds to the image patch centered at (3, 12) with a split value of 0.0004. Input splits are chosen for maximum information gain with respect to variable H. Optimal M-of-N rules are determined for explaining H with different error/complexity tradeoffs. Three different rules are extracted as complexity penalty increases. The optimal M-of-N rules for explaining neuron 96 are visualized in Figure 1. The most complex rule is a 5-of-13 rule with a 0.025 error, agreeing with the network output 97.5% of the time. Adding a penalty to complexity changes the optimal rule. Training a feed forward network with a single hidden layer of 100 nodes, the relationship between complexity and error in the first layer is exponential, suggesting an ideal complexity/error tradeoff. This is demonstrated on the DNA promoter dataset, similar to the Fashion MNIST dataset. In a feed forward network with a single hidden layer of 100 nodes, there is an exponential relationship between complexity and error, showing an ideal tradeoff. The output layer rule 1-of-{H39, H80} achieves 100% fidelity. The hidden layer splits are based on information gain with respect to the output, allowing for M-of-N rules extracted from the input layer to describe each literal in the output layer rule. The output of the network can be predicted by hierarchical rules that aim to reduce errors when stacking layers. To achieve this, a single set of splits for each layer must be chosen by moving down one layer at a time. In order to provide an idealized complexity/error curve for rule extraction with M-of-N rules, experiments are conducted layer by layer independently. This approach helps in evaluating the rule extraction landscape of a neural network trained on a practical example. The rule extraction landscape of a neural network was tested on a basic CNN trained on fashion MNIST in tensorflow. The CNN had a standard architecture with convolutional and max pooling layers, followed by a fully connected layer. 1000 random inputs from the fashion MNIST training data were used to test the extracted rules against the network. In the rule extraction process of a neural network, features were tested on image patches with maximum information gain. 50 features were randomly chosen for the third layer, with a limit of 1000 literals for rule searching. The final layer output was tested with 10 one-hot neurons, each undergoing rule searching. The search procedure was repeated for 5 different values of \u03b2, resulting in 5 sets of extracted rules with varying error/complexity trade-offs. The rule extraction process involved testing features on image patches with maximum information gain. Different values of \u03b2 were used to extract rules with varying error/complexity trade-offs for each target neuron, resulting in a graph mapping out the error/complexity landscape for rules extracted from each layer. The first and final layers produced accurate rules with minimal errors, while the second and third layers showed a trade-off between accuracy and complexity. The third layer's minimum error cannot be improved with more complex rules, while the second layer performs worse with trivial rules. Despite having more input nodes, the third layer performs similarly to the second layer. The final layer provides accurate rules with less complexity compared to the first layer. The results show a consistent pattern in the rule extraction landscape. The results suggest a critical point where error increases rapidly as complexity penalty rises, indicating a natural set of rules for explaining latent features. Current rule extraction algorithms do not consider complexity in optimization. This paper introduces a novel approach to rule extraction algorithms by incorporating rule complexity into the optimization process. The analysis highlights the importance of considering complexity in the extraction algorithm and emphasizes the need for empirical evaluation of popular extraction algorithms. The limitations and potential of rule extraction algorithms are also discussed, particularly in cases where there are no simple explanations for features. The CNN presents challenges in explaining features, with complex rules having a 15% error rate. However, simpler rules in the final layer can accurately capture output neuron behavior with near 0% error. Selective use of decompositional algorithms depending on the layer can help address the black box problem in neural networks. The black box problem of neural networks hinders their integration into society, as the need for explainability grows. Knowledge extraction from large neural networks remains challenging, with critics highlighting the distributed nature of neural networks as a barrier to interpretation. The distributed nature of neural networks hinders the specific method of decomposition rule extraction. A novel search method for M-of-N rules reveals that latent features can be described by an 'optimal' rule with an ideal error/complexity trade-off. Rule complexity is included as a measure in the search for extracted rules, showing a large trade-off discrepancy between neurons in different layers and architectures. The distributed nature of neural networks complicates rule extraction, with varying complexities across different layers and neurons. While rule extraction may not provide comprehensive descriptions for all latent variables, simplifying explanations without sacrificing accuracy can still be valuable. Decompositional rule extraction remains a crucial tool for understanding network behavior, especially when dealing with easily understandable features. Further research is needed to explore the impact of different transfer methods on accuracy and interpretability. The effects of using different transfer functions, data sets, architectures, and regularization on the accuracy and interpretability landscape are being examined."}

{"title": "SkgGCkrKvH", "content": "Decentralized training of deep learning models using communication compression, specifically Choco-SGD, enables data privacy, on-device learning, and efficient scaling to large compute clusters. The approach achieves linear speedup with high compression ratios on non-convex functions and non-IID training data. Practical performance is demonstrated in training scenarios over decentralized user devices and in datacenters. Distributed machine learning allows training models using optimization algorithms on user devices connected in a peer-to-peer network or in a datacenter. It offers computational scalability and data-locality, enabling joint training while keeping data local. Recent theoretical results show decentralized schemes can be as efficient as centralized approaches in terms of convergence of training loss. Gradient compression techniques have been proposed for distributed training to reduce data sent over communication links. Tang et al. (2018) introduced DCD and ECD algorithms for decentralized training of deep neural networks, allowing for communication compression. The CHOCO-SGD algorithm, introduced for convex problems, allows for high compression ratios and improved generalization performance on test sets compared to previous algorithms. This study departs from focusing solely on training performance and evaluates the algorithm on standard machine learning benchmarks. The CHOCO-SGD algorithm shows speed-ups over decentralized baselines in challenging peer-to-peer and datacenter settings, improving scalability and communication efficiency for large tasks like ImageNet training. Decentralized algorithms struggle to match the performance of centralized schemes on large tasks like ImageNet training. These findings highlight the limitations of current decentralized training schemes and call for further research in this area. The CHOCO-SGD algorithm demonstrates faster convergence rates in non-convex smooth settings. CHOCO-SGD algorithm converges at rate O 1 / \u221a nT + n /(\u03c1 4 \u03b4 2 T ) on non-convex smooth functions, showing linear speedup in the number of workers n. A version with momentum is analyzed for practical performance on on-device training and peer-to-peer social networks, reducing bandwidth requirements for joint training. Decentralized schemes and gradient compression methods have been proposed for training in communication restricted settings, aiming to reduce bandwidth requirements for joint training in deep learning models. The performance of decentralized schemes when scaling to a larger number of nodes is systematically investigated, highlighting shared difficulties encountered by current approaches. In this paper, the focus is on combining decentralized SGD schemes with gradient compression, specifically emphasizing approaches based on gossip averaging. This approach is advocated for learning over decentralized data, as seen in federated learning literature for centralized algorithms. Decentralized SGD approaches, such as gossip averaging, rely on the spectral gap of the mixing matrix for convergence rate. Lian et al. (2017) combine SGD with gossip averaging, showing convergence at a rate of O(1/\u221anT + n/(\u03c1^2T)). The spectral gap mainly affects smaller terms, with similar results observed in related schemes. Quantization for communication compression in deep learning has gained popularity, with theoretical guarantees established for unbiased and biased compression schemes. Error correction schemes show the best practical and theoretical performance. Proximal updates and variance reduction are also being studied in combination with quantized updates. Decentralized optimization with quantization has been studied, showing that gossip averaging may not converge in the presence of quantization noise. Adaptive schemes with increasing compression accuracy have been proposed, converging at the expense of higher communication cost. Reisizadeh et al. (2018) introduced an algorithm that can still converge, albeit at a slower rate than the exact scheme. The CHOCO-SGD algorithm can handle high compression rates and has been analyzed for convex functions, showing a convergence rate of \u03b4 > 0. Another method, DeepSqueeze, also converges with arbitrary compression ratio. The decentralized optimization algorithm CHOCO-SGD achieves higher test accuracy with high compression rates. It introduces the decentralized optimization problem, compression operators, and the gossip-based stochastic optimization algorithm. The decentralized optimization algorithm CHOCO-SGD achieves higher test accuracy with high compression rates by using local distributions for sampling data and communication with local neighbors defined by a weighted graph. The weights are based on local node degrees to ensure positive values and can be computed locally on each node. Compression operators are used in decentralized optimization algorithms like CHOCO-SGD to transmit compressed messages without the need for unbiased quantization operators. This approach allows for a larger class of compression operators to be utilized, as discussed in various studies. Compression operators, such as those discussed in (Koloskova et al., 2019), are crucial in decentralized optimization algorithms like CHOCO-SGD. Algorithm 1 outlines the process where each worker updates its private variable using stochastic gradient and gossip averaging steps to preserve averages despite quantization noise. Communication between nodes involves updating variables for neighbors using compressed updates. In decentralized optimization algorithms like CHOCO-SGD, compression operators are essential for updating variables for neighbors using compressed updates. The communication and gradient computation can be executed in parallel, with each node only needing to store 3 vectors at most, regardless of the number of neighbors. A momentum-version is also proposed. The momentum-version of CHOCO-SGD is proposed in Algorithm 2 for decentralized optimization. The analysis is extended to non-convex problems with technical assumptions on bounded variance of stochastic gradients. The convergence rate is denoted by c, showing linear speed-up compared to SGD on a single node. The momentum-version of CHOCO-SGD in Algorithm 2 for decentralized optimization shows linear speed-up compared to SGD on a single node. The experiments compare CHOCO-SGD to relevant baselines using commonly used compression operators and leveraging momentum in all algorithms. In Algorithm 1, weight decay factor \u03bb and momentum factor \u03b2 are introduced, along with local momentum memory. The setup involves using a ring topology with 8 nodes to train ResNet20 on the Cifar10 dataset. DCD and ECD with momentum are implemented for decentralized optimization. The study implements various optimization algorithms with momentum, fine-tuning learning rates, and decaying them at specific epochs. Hyper-parameter tuning is conducted for CHOCO-SGD and DeepSqueeze, with details in Appendix F. The study implements hyper-parameter tuning for compression schemes applied to every layer of ResNet20. Two unbiased compression schemes involve quantization and sparsification, while two biased schemes involve selecting weights based on magnitude. Top-1 test accuracy is evaluated separately on each node over the dataset. The study evaluates hyper-parameter tuning for compression schemes in ResNet20, including unbiased quantization and sparsification, and biased schemes like selecting weights based on magnitude. DCD and ECD are only analyzed for unbiased schemes, while CHOCO-SGD and DeepSqueeze are studied for biased schemes. Both unbiased compression schemes can be adjusted to meet specifications. Results show that unbiased compression schemes like ECD and DCD perform well at low compression ratios but struggle at higher ratios. DCD with biased top sparsification outperforms random sparsification, although not supported by theory. CHOCO-SGD demonstrates good generalization across scenarios. CHOCO-SGD demonstrates good generalization in all scenarios with minimal accuracy drop. Sign compression achieves high accuracy with significantly fewer bits per weight. Decentralized real-world scenarios pose challenges for centralized methods due to local training data on each device. In decentralized real-world scenarios, each device has limited access to local data, communication bandwidth is restricted, global network topology is unknown, and a large number of devices are connected. Privacy is a key motivation for this fully decentralized setting, allowing training data to remain private on each device. Training data is permanently split between nodes, with each node having a distinct part of the dataset. In a decentralized setting, each node has a unique part of the dataset for training. The study focuses on decentralized deep learning with sign compression on the Cifar10 dataset. Centralized methods like all-reduce are not efficient in this scenario, so the comparison is made with a centralized baseline where updates are routed to a central coordinator for aggregation. The combination of CHOCO-SGD with sign compression is used for comparison. In the comparison, CHOCO-SGD with sign compression is evaluated alongside decentralized SGD without compression and centralized SGD without compression. The scaling properties of CHOCO-SGD are studied on 4, 16, 36, and 64 nodes using different network topologies. Learning rates are kept constant and tuned separately for each method, with the consensus learning rate tuned for CHOCO-SGD. The results are summarized in tables 1 and 2. The testing accuracy of CHOCO-SGD is compared with CentralizedSGD on different numbers of nodes, showing slower performance due to graph topology and communication compression. Train and test performance are similar, indicating slower convergence rather than a generalization issue. In the real decentralized scenario, the goal is to reduce communication costs by fixing the number of transmitted bits to 1000 MB. CHOCO-SGD outperforms CentralizedSGD, with slight degradation as the number of nodes increases. In experiments on a real social network graph, training models on user devices connected by a social network showed that torus topology is beneficial for large numbers of nodes due to good mixing properties. Decentralized and Centralized SGD require more bits for reasonable accuracy, with CHOCO-SGD outperforming CentralizedSGD in reducing communication costs. We utilized the Davis Southern women social network with 32 nodes to train a ResNet20 model on the Cifar10 dataset for image classification and a three-layer LSTM architecture for language modeling on WikiText-2. Exponentially decaying learning rate schedule was used, and detailed experimental setup can be found in Appendix F. Results are presented in Figures 2-3 and Table 3. For image classification, the decentralized algorithm outperforms the centralized and quantized decentralized in training accuracy, but the centralized scheme has the highest test accuracy. CHOCO-SGD performs best in test accuracy with less transmitted data compared to exact decentralized and centralized schemes. In language modeling, both decentralized schemes face challenges. In language modeling, CHOCO-SGD outperforms centralized SGD in test perplexity. When considering perplexity for a fixed data volume, CHOCO-SGD performs best among decentralized and centralized algorithms. Large-scale training with Resnet-50 on ImageNet-1k shows benefits of CHOCO-SGD, especially when scaling to more nodes. Decentralized optimization methods, like those described by Lian et al. (2017) and Assran et al. (2019), show potential for addressing scaling issues in well-connected environments. Assran et al. (2019) demonstrated significant speedups in training on 256 GPUs with all nodes accessing training data. Their algorithm differs from CHOCO-SGD with asynchronous gossip updates, time-varying communication topology, and exact communication. We train ImageNet-1k with Resnet-50 on 8 machines with 4 Tesla P100 GPUs each. Communication is fast within machines and decentralized with compressed communication between machines in a ring topology. Mini-batch size on each GPU is 128. CHOCO-SGD, a decentralized and parallel training scheme, shows faster training time than all-reduce with a slight 1.5% accuracy loss. The consensus stepsize for CHOCO-SGD was not heavily tuned due to computational resource limitations. Training loss and top-1 test accuracy are depicted in Figure 4 in terms of epochs and time. Our study demonstrates a 20% time-wise gain over the common all-reduce baseline on commodity hardware clusters. We suggest using CHOCO-SGD for decentralized deep learning training in bandwidth-constrained environments, with theoretical convergence guarantees in the non-convex setting and linear speedup in the number of nodes. Our study shows a 20% time-wise gain with CHOCO-SGD for decentralized deep learning training in bandwidth-constrained environments, demonstrating linear speedup in the number of nodes. The algorithm performs well in various settings for image classification and language modeling tasks, especially in communication-restricted environments with locality constraints on training data. The curr_chunk discusses the proof of Theorem 4.1 in the context of decentralized schemes for high communication compression in fully decentralized deep learning. The proof follows a structure similar to Koloskova et al. (2019) by showing Algorithm 1 as a special case of a more general class of algorithms. Decentralized algorithms like Algorithm 3 involve stochastic gradient updates and averaging among nodes, with convergence shown for linear averaging schemes. The proof of Theorem 4.1 in decentralized deep learning follows a structure similar to previous work by Koloskova et al. Decentralized SGD with arbitrary averaging is presented in Algorithm 3, which involves a blackbox averaging/gossip scheme. The algorithm assumes that the averaging scheme preserves iterates' average and converges linearly with a parameter 0 < c \u2264 1. An example is given for Exact Averaging, which achieves consensus averaging with a mixing matrix W and converges at a rate determined by the eigengap \u03c1 of W. The eigengap \u03c1 of mixing matrix W is crucial in Algorithm 3, leading to the recovery of D-PSGD algorithm. Choosing CHOCO-GOSSIP as the consensus averaging scheme allows for the retrieval of CHOCO-SGD. The order of communication and gradient computation parts in Algorithm 1 can be interchanged without affecting convergence rate. The convergence rate of Algorithm 3 with constant stepsize \u03b7 is not affected by changing initial values. The iterates satisfy a recursion verifying a condition, leading to a linear speedup compared to SGD on one node. The averaging scheme affects the convergence rate. The averaging scheme affects the convergence rate of Algorithm 3 with constant stepsize \u03b7. It leads to a linear speedup compared to SGD on one node. The rate of convergence for CHOCO-SGD with CHOCO-GOSSIP averaging scheme is discussed, showing a dependency on the eigengap of the mixing matrix W. The theorem provides guarantees for the averaged vector of parameters x in a decentralized setting, where averaging all parameters across machines is costly. Similar guarantees can be obtained for individual iterates x_i. The text discusses guarantees on individual iterates x_i in a decentralized setting, with convergence rates and conditions for Algorithm 3.

Nesterov momentum can be analogously adapted for our decentralized setting. To better understand how does CHOCO-SGD work, we can interpret it as an error feedback algorithm (Stich et al., 2018; . We can equivalently rewrite CHOCO-SGD (Algorithm 1) In CHOCO-SGD, quantization errors are saved in internal memory and added to the compressed value in the next iteration. The value transmitted is the difference x (t) i \u2212 x (t\u22121) i, representing the evolution of local variable x i at step t. Internal memory is added and updated before compressing the value, correcting for errors. In this section, model training and hyper-parameter tuning are discussed. The comparison includes CHOCO-SGD with sign compression, decentralized SGD without compression, and centralized SGD without compression. Two models are trained: ResNet20 for image classification on Cifar10 dataset and a three-layer LSTM architecture for language modeling on WikiText-2. For the language modeling task on WikiText-2, a three-layer LSTM with hidden dimension of size 650 is used. The loss is averaged over all examples and timesteps, with a BPTT length set to 30. Gradient clipping (0.4) and dropout (0.4) are applied, and both ResNet20 and LSTM are trained for 300 epochs with a per node mini-batch size of 32. The learning rate of CHOCO-SGD follows a linear scaling rule. The learning rate of CHOCO-SGD follows a linear scaling rule, proportional to the node degree. Momentum is only applied to ResNet20 training. The learning rate is gradually warmed up from 0.1 to the initial rate for the first 5 epochs, then decayed by a factor of 10 at 50% and 75% of training epochs. The optimal learning rate per sample is determined by a linear scaling rule. The learning rate in CHOCO-SGD is determined by a linear scaling rule based on node degree. The optimal parameters are searched in a predefined grid to ensure best performance. Fine-tuned hyperparameters for training ResNet-20 on Cifar10 and a social network topology are reported in tables. The hyperparameters for training ResNet-20/LSTM on a social network topology with 32 nodes are tuned for CHOCO-SGD. The training data is split between nodes without shuffling, with a mini-batch size of 32 per node and a maximum node degree of 14. The learning curve for the social network topology is also plotted. Each node can only access a subset of the dataset. The local mini-batch size is 32, and each node can only access a disjoint subset of the dataset. Plots show training and test accuracy for the datacenter experiment. Towards the end of optimization, local models reach consensus, with individual test performances matching the averaged model. Local models initially diverge from the averaged model before reaching consensus. The local models diverge from the averaged model, decreasing only with a decrease in stepsize, as reported in Assran et al. (2019)."}

{"title": "ryvxcPeAb", "content": "Deep neural networks excel in various applications but are susceptible to adversarial examples, where small malicious changes to inputs can deceive models. These perturbations can transfer between models, allowing attackers to exploit black-box systems. In this work, adversarial perturbations are decomposed into model-specific and data-dependent components, with the latter contributing significantly to transferability. A new approach using noise reduced gradient (NRG) to craft adversarial examples enhances transferability across various ImageNet classification models. Low-capacity models show stronger attack capability compared to high-capacity models with similar test performance. These findings offer a principled approach to improving adversarial attacks. Recent works have shown that adversaries can manipulate inputs to fool neural network models, creating adversarial examples. These insights can guide the design of effective defense approaches against black-box attacks in real-world applications like speech recognition and computer vision. Adversarial examples can transfer across different models, posing a challenge for defending against them effectively. Transferability allows attacks on black-box systems. The vulnerability to adversarial examples was first studied as an optimization problem solved by box-constraint L-BFGS. The presence of adversarial examples in deep neural networks is attributed to strong nonlinearity. Different methods like FGSM, DeepFool, and iterative gradient sign attacks have been proposed to exploit this vulnerability. Transferability of adversarial examples has been analyzed, leading to ensemble-based approaches. The transferability of adversarial examples was discussed, showing that high-confidence misclassified examples have stronger transferability. Various defense mechanisms were proposed, such as defensive distillation, adversarial training, and image transformation to mitigate adversarial perturbations. In this work, the transferability of adversarial examples is explained, highlighting the decomposition of adversarial perturbation into model-specific and data-dependent components. The model-specific component is attributed to the model architecture and random initialization, contributing noise to the data manifold. The transferability of adversarial perturbations is mainly influenced by the data-dependent component, which approximates the ground truth on the data manifold. A noise-reduced gradient (NRG) method is proposed to construct adversarial examples by utilizing this component, leading to improved performance on the ImageNet validation set. The proposed noise-reduced gradient enhances black-box attack success rates on ImageNet by considering model-specific factors like capacity and accuracy. Models with higher accuracy and lower capacity are more effective at attacking unseen models, guided by transferability principles. The model function f : R d \u2192 R K is used to minimize empirical risk over the training set. The high dimensionality of the model makes it vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, where small imperceptible changes can lead to adversarial examples. This study focuses on deep neural networks and their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. Adversarial examples exist in various models like support vector machines and decision trees. Non-targeted attacks aim to misclassify x by the model, while targeted attacks aim to produce a specific wrong label. In a black-box attack, the adversary has no knowledge of the target model and cannot query it. Crafting adversarial examples in a black-box attack involves constructing adversarial perturbations on a local model and deploying them to fool the target model. This process is based on optimizing a loss function to measure the prediction-ground truth discrepancy. The metric to quantify perturbation in crafting adversarial examples is the truth; for image data, x adv \u2208 [0, 255] d with d as the number of pixels. The commonly chosen loss function is cross entropy, but BID2 introduced a loss function that manipulates the output logit directly. Distortion is measured using \u221e and 2 norms, with human eyes being the ideal metric. Ensemble-based approaches, like using a large ensemble of models, are suggested by BID8 to improve the strength of adversarial examples. Ensemble-based approaches, like using a large ensemble of models suggested by BID8, involve averaging predicted probabilities of source models. The objective for non-targeted attacks can be written as DISPLAYFORM1 with ensemble weights w i = 1. Various optimizers, including the normalized-gradient based optimizer, can be used to solve the problem. The Fast Gradient Based Method (BID5) attempts to solve the objective by performing a single step iteration. The Fast Gradient Based Method (FGBM) aims to solve the objective with a single step iteration using a normalized gradient vector. It is shown to be fast and has good transferability, making it a simple yet effective optimizer. The Iterative Gradient Method performs normalized-gradient ascent for k steps with a projection operator to enforce constraints. The normalized gradient is used in the fast gradient based method for attacks, with different variations like IGSM and q-attack. Understanding why adversarial examples transfer between models is crucial for black-box attacks and defenses. Transferability may stem from similarities in decision boundaries between source and target models. The transferability of adversarial examples between different models is influenced by the similarity in their decision boundaries. Models with high performance on the same dataset are likely to have learned a similar function on the data manifold, but their behavior off the data manifold can differ due to architectural differences and random initializations. The transferability of adversarial examples between different models is influenced by the similarity in their decision boundaries, which are affected by the architectures of the models and random initializations. Perturbations can be decomposed into data-dependent and model-specific components, with the former contributing more to transferability due to shared data-dependent information. Model-specific components have different behaviors off the data manifold for different models. The transferability of adversarial examples between different models is influenced by the similarity in their decision boundaries. Adversarial perturbations can mislead both model A and B, with a data-dependent component attacking model B easily. Model-specific perturbations contribute little to transfer between models. The NRG method aims to increase success rates of black-box adversarial attacks by reducing model-specific noise in the gradient, enhancing the data-dependent component for fooling different models. The NRG method reduces model-specific noise in the gradient to enhance the data-dependent component for fooling different models. By applying local average, noisy information is removed, resulting in a smoother and more data-dependent gradient. The NRG method reduces model-specific noise in the gradient to enhance the data-dependent component for fooling different models. Attacks using \u2207f in Eq.(8) drive the optimizer towards more data-dependent solutions, improving generalization. Noise-reduced Iterative Sign Gradient Method (nr-IGSM) and noise-reduced fast gradient sign method (nr-FGSM) are variations of this approach. The noise-reduced fast gradient sign method (nr-FGSM) is a method that reduces model-specific noise in the gradient to enhance the data-dependent component for fooling different models. It can be applied to various optimizers and is effective in enhancing transferability. The study uses ImageNet dataset for validation, selecting 5,000 images for each attack experiment. For targeted attack experiments, random wrong labels are assigned to each image. Pre-trained models from PyTorch like resnet and vgg are used. Various models are employed to increase experiment reliability, with a selection made for specific experiments to save computational time. In targeted attack experiments, random wrong labels are assigned to images. The white-box attack performance is evaluated using Top-1 success rate. The cross entropy 2 is used as the loss function, and distortion is measured by \u221e norm and scaled 2 norm. In targeted attack experiments, random wrong labels are assigned to images. The white-box attack performance is evaluated using Top-1 success rate. The loss function used is cross entropy 2, and distortion is measured by \u221e norm and scaled 2 norm. Distances are evaluated using RMSD, and optimizers FGSM and IGSM are considered. The effectiveness of noise-reduced gradient technique is demonstrated by combining it with commonly-used methods, showing that nr-FGSM outperforms original FGSM consistently and dramatically in various blackbox attacks. The effectiveness of noise-reduced gradient technique is demonstrated by combining it with commonly-used methods, showing that nr-FGSM outperforms original FGSM consistently and dramatically in various blackbox attacks. Additionally, nr-IGSM generates adversarial examples that transfer more easily than those generated by IGSM, indicating the superiority of noise-reduced techniques in enhancing transferability. The noise-reduced gradient (NRG) in nr-IGSM guides the optimizer to explore data-dependent solutions, transferring more easily than IGSM. Large models like resnet152 are more robust to adversarial transfer. Model-specific components also contribute to transfer across similar architectures. IGSM generally generates stronger adversarial examples than FGSM, except for attacks against alexnet. Our observation contradicts previous claims about adversarial examples generated by FGSM transferring more easily than IGSM, except for attacks against alexnet. The higher confidence adversarial examples have in the source model, the more likely they will transfer to the target model. Inappropriate hyperparameter choices may lead to underfitting, making the target model significantly different from the source models. The AlexNet is different from source models in architecture and accuracy, leading to overfitting with IGSM iterations. Trust in the objective function is cautioned against as it may cause overfitting to source model-specific information. A noise-reduced gradient technique is proposed to remove model-specific information, allowing for better cross-model generalization. In this section, the NRG method is applied to ensemble-based approaches with a focus on reducing computational costs. Evaluation is done on a set of 1,000 images for non-targeted attacks using FGSM and IGSM. Results show saturated success rates for IGSM attacks, with improvements demonstrated in Top-5 rates. Results for FGSM and nr-FGSM attacks can be found in Appendix C. For targeted attacks, generating adversarial examples predicted by unseen target models is emphasized. Generating targeted adversarial examples predicted by unseen target models is challenging and requires a large step size for optimization. Single-model based approaches are ineffective for this task, as demonstrated by BID8. More detailed analysis on the sensitivity of targeted attacks to step size can be found in Appendix A. The Top-5 success rates of ensemble-based approaches show that NRG methods outperform normal methods by a large margin in both targeted and non-targeted attacks. In this section, the sensitivity of hyper parameters m and \u03c3 in NRG methods for black-box attacks is explored using the nr-FGSM approach. Larger m leads to higher fooling rates due to better gradient estimation, while an optimal value of \u03c3 results in the best performance. In exploring NRG methods for black-box attacks, it is found that an optimal value of \u03c3 induces the best performance. The optimal \u03c3 varies for different source models, being around 15 for resnet18 and 20 for densenet161. Additionally, the robustness of adversarial perturbations to image transformations is being investigated, which is crucial for determining if adversarial examples can survive in the physical world. The influence of image transformations on adversarial examples is quantified using the destruction rate, which measures the fraction of misclassified images that are correctly classified after a transformation. Densenet121 and resnet34 are chosen as source and target models, with rotations, Gaussian noise, Gaussian blur, and JPEG considered as transformations. The study evaluates the robustness of adversarial examples generated by NRG methods compared to vanilla methods using image transformations like rotation, Gaussian noise, Gaussian blur, and JPEG compression. Decision boundaries of different models are analyzed, with Resnet34 as the source model and nine target models considered. The \u2207f is estimated with specific parameters, and each point in a 2-D plane corresponds to image perturbations. The study evaluates the robustness of adversarial examples generated by NRG methods compared to vanilla methods using image transformations. Each point in a 2-D plane corresponds to image perturbations, with Resnet34 as the source model and nine target models considered. The direction of sign \u2207f is as sensitive as sign (\u2207f \u22a5 ) for Resnet34, while other target models are more sensitive along sign \u2207f. The study shows that penalizing the optimizer along the model-specific direction can prevent overfitting and poor transfer to other models. Larger models require a greater distance to produce adversarial transfer compared to smaller models, explaining why big models are more robust. In experiments, it was found that big models are more robust than small models. Adversarial examples crafted from alexnet generalize worst across models, while attacks from densenet121 consistently perform well for any target model. Different models can exhibit different performances in attacking the same target model. This phenomenon guides the selection of a better local model for generating adversarial examples. The study found that different models have varying performances in attacking target models. VGG19 bn and ResNet152 were selected as target models for FGSM and IGSM attacks. Results showed that models with powerful attack capabilities have lower fooling rates, while models with larger test errors and parameters have higher fooling rates. This observation can guide the selection of a better local model for generating adversarial examples. The study found that models with smaller test errors and lower capacity have stronger attack capabilities. This is explained by the model's ability to approximate the ground truth and the complexity of the model. Models with small \u2207f \u22a5 and large \u2207f can provide strong adversarial examples that transfer more easily. In this study, it was found that models with smaller test errors and lower capacity are more effective in generating strong adversarial examples. The adversarial perturbation can be broken down into model-specific and data-dependent components, with the latter contributing more to the transferability of adversarial examples. The proposed noise-reduced gradient (NRG) based methods for crafting adversarial examples are shown to be more effective than previous approaches. In future research, NRG-based methods may be combined with adversarial training to defend against black-box attacks. The transferability of attacks is data-dependent and low-dimensional, making black-box attacks potentially defensible. White-box attacks, originating from high-dimensional space, are more challenging to defend against. Future studies may focus on learning stable features. Future research may focus on incorporating the NRG strategy to learn stable features for transfer learning, reducing model-specific noise for more accurate information on the data manifold. The influence of hyperparameters in IGSM for targeted black-box attacks, such as number of iterations and step size, is explored. Success rates are evaluated on 1,000 randomly selected images using resnet152 and vgg16 bn as target models, with performance measured by the average Top-5 success rate over three ensembles. In the experiment, the optimal step size for the attack is very large, around 15, compared to the allowed distortion of 20. Both too large and too small step sizes can harm the attack performance. A small step size with a large number of iterations can lead to worse performance due to overfitting, while a large step size encourages exploration of more model-independent areas, resulting in better performance with more iterations. The experiment showed that a large step size is optimal for the attack, leading to better performance with more iterations. Additional experiments on the MNIST dataset confirmed that low-capacity models have stronger attack capabilities compared to large-capacity models. In experiments, a large step size is optimal for attacks, improving performance with more iterations. Low-capacity models are found to have stronger attack capabilities compared to large-capacity models. Top-1 success rates of FGSM and IGSM attacks against resnet152 are shown in Figure 9, with a distortion chosen as \u03b5 = 15."}

PBGC insures single-employer and multiemployer pension plans, providing a specified monthly benefit at retirement. PBGC insures single-employer and multiemployer pension plans. In FY2018, PBGC insured about 25,000 DB pension plans covering 37 million people and paid benefits to 1.4 million individuals. PBGC is the trustee of 4,919 single-employer plans and provided financial assistance to 78 multiemployer pensions. Most workers receive the full pension benefit they earned. Among participants in multiemployer plans that were terminated, 49% have a benefit below the PBGC maximum guarantee and 51% have a benefit larger than the PBGC maximum guarantee. PBGC is a government-owned corporation with a three-member board of directors chaired by the Secretary of Labor. The Director of PBGC is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141) made changes to the governance structures of PBGC, including setting the PBGC Director's term at five years, requiring the Board of Directors to meet at least four times a year, and establishing a Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate within PBGC. The PBGC is required to be self-supporting and receives no appropriations from general revenue. Its revenue comes from premiums set by Congress, assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from companies. Some Members of Congress are hesitant to provide financial assistance to PBGC. The PBGC is self-supporting and funded through premiums, assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from companies. Sponsors of pension plans pay various premiums to PBGC, including flat-rate per-participant premiums for single-employer and multiemployer plans, and additional premiums for underfunded single-employer plans. Terminated pension plans also pay per-participant premiums for three years. The sponsors of single-employer DB pension plans pay various premiums to PBGC, including a flat-rate per-participant premium of $80 for each participant in the plan. In addition, underfunded plans pay an extra premium of $43 for each $1,000 of unfunded vested benefits, with a limit of $541 per participant. Terminated plans pay a termination premium of $1,250 per participant per year for three years. DB pension plans pay various premiums to PBGC, including a flat-rate per-participant premium of $80 for single-employer plans and $29 for multiemployer plans in 2019. Terminated plans pay a termination premium of $1,250 per participant per year for three years. PBGC only covers DB plans that meet qualification requirements of Section 401 of the IRC. DC plans like 401(k) and 403(b) plans are not insured by PBGC. To receive tax benefits, a pension plan must meet IRC Section 401 requirements. Employer contributions are tax-deductible, and plan earnings are not taxable to participants. When participants receive income, it is taxed as ordinary income. Qualified pension plans must be permanent, provide definite benefits, and not favor highly compensated employees. The PBGC insures pension plans that meet specific criteria, including providing determinable benefits, not favoring highly compensated employees, and covering a minimum number of employees. Certain pension plans are excluded from PBGC insurance, such as governmental plans, church plans, and plans for professionals with 25 or fewer participants. PBGC operates separate insurance programs for single-employer and multiemployer plans, each with its own reserve fund. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes the trustee of terminated, underfunded DB pension plans, placing assets in a trust fund for participants to receive benefits. In the multiemployer program, PBGC provides loans to insolvent pension plans unable to pay participant benefits. An employer can terminate a single-employer pension plan voluntarily in standard or distress termination. PBGC may involuntarily terminate an underfunded plan if the sponsor can't fund pension obligations. If a company ends its pension plan voluntarily with sufficient assets to cover liabilities, PBGC doesn't pay benefits to participants but confirms termination requirements are met. Benefit liabilities include all earned benefits for participants, vested and nonvested. The pension plan provides benefits to participants, including vested and nonvested benefits, early retirement supplements, and subsidies. Benefit liabilities may also include contingent benefits. Assets cover benefit liabilities, and the plan distributes benefits through annuity contracts or lump-sum distributions. The employer may recover excess assets through an asset reversion, subject to an excise tax. The excise tax is 20% if a qualified replacement plan is established, otherwise 50%. Underfunded plan terminations may result in PBGC receivership. The PBGC takes control of plan assets and assumes liabilities. Payments are made from plan assets and recovered employer assets. Distress terminations require specific criteria to be met for termination. The PBGC may terminate a plan if every member of the sponsor's controlled group has filed for bankruptcy or similar insolvency proceedings, or if the bankruptcy court determines that plan termination is necessary for the employer to continue in business. The PBGC may terminate a plan if all members of the sponsor's controlled group have filed for bankruptcy or if the bankruptcy court deems termination necessary for the employer to stay in business. Requirements for plan termination were added by SEPPAA in 1986 and modified by P.L. 100-203 and RPA in 1994 to ensure underfunded plan liabilities remain the employer's responsibility unless strict financial need standards are met. PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if it does not meet minimum funding standards, cannot pay benefits, has a substantial owner with a large distribution, or poses a long-term financial risk to PBGC. The PBGC may terminate a plan if it cannot pay benefits currently due, to protect participants' interests, or to prevent unreasonable financial deterioration. From FY1974 to FY2016, PBGC became trustee of 4,769 single-employer DB pension plans. Following the termination of a pension plan, the plan sponsor and every member of the sponsor's controlled group are jointly and severally liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall, which is the different between the plan's liabilities and assets at the termination date. Following the termination of a pension plan, the plan sponsor and every member of the sponsor's controlled group are jointly and severally liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall. This liability is generally payable in cash or negotiable securities to PBGC on the termination date. Failure to pay may result in a lien on the property of the contributing employer's controlled group. If the plan sponsor is in bankruptcy, PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited as it has the same legal standing as other creditors. When an underfunded pension plan terminates, PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited. PBGC guarantees retirement benefits up to statutory limits, including vested benefits and certain death, survivor, or disability benefits. Recovery depends on the terminated plan's assets and employer contributions. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits in monthly installments, with certain conditions for early retirement benefits. Contingent benefits are guaranteed if the triggering event occurs before plan termination, with phased guarantees under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits in monthly installments with conditions for early retirement benefits. The maximum pension guarantee for workers aged 65 in single-employer plans terminating in 2019 is $67,295 annually, adjusted for national wage growth. This amount is adjusted annually and may decrease if benefits start before age 65 or if the plan offers non-standard payment forms. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits in monthly installments with conditions for early retirement benefits. The maximum pension guarantee for workers aged 65 in single-employer plans terminating in 2019 is $67,295 annually, adjusted for national wage growth. The benefit increases if received after age 65, with reductions for early payments in different forms. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits with conditions for early retirement. The reduction in maximum guarantee for benefits paid in forms other than straight-life annuity depends on benefit type, survivor's benefit percentage, and age difference. Only basic benefits are guaranteed, including benefits at normal retirement age, early retirement, disability benefits, and benefits for survivors. Vested benefits are insured, with an average monthly benefit of $606 for retirees in FY2015. The PBGC ensures retirement benefits with specific conditions. Over 80% of recipients in single-employer plans receive full benefits, with an average reduction of 28% for those whose benefits are reduced. Assets of terminated plans are allocated based on a priority schedule, with some nonguaranteed benefits paid before guaranteed benefits. PBGC also pays a portion of unfunded, nonguaranteed benefits based on asset recovery ratios. PBGC insures plan insolvency for multiemployer plans, not just plan termination. A plan is considered insolvent when resources are insufficient to pay benefits for the year or if the sponsor determines resources won't cover future benefits. PBGC insures plan insolvency for multiemployer plans, not just plan termination. If available resources are insufficient to pay benefits, PBGC will provide additional resources as a loan, rarely repaid. Loans may be provided year after year, with repayment required if the plan recovers. Only one multiemployer plan has repaid any financial assistance. PBGC guarantees benefits to multiemployer plans with a different guarantee ceiling. The benefit guarantee ceiling for participants in multiemployer plans is determined by a formula based on years of service. PBGC estimated that 79% of participants in plans receiving financial assistance received their full benefit. Among ongoing plans, the average benefit is almost twice as large as in terminated plans, indicating potential benefit reductions for participants in plans that may need PBGC financial assistance in the future. PBGC's net financial position is a key measure of its financial status. PBGC's net financial position at the end of FY2018 was -$51.4 billion, with assets of $112.3 billion and liabilities of $163.7 billion. Its main assets include the trust fund and revolving funds, while its main liabilities are estimated obligations. PBGC's net financial position has been in deficit since FY2002, with a deficit of $23.3 billion in the single-employer program by the end of 2004. The weak economy in 2001, especially in the steel and airline industries, led to costly plan terminations. The PBGC reported a deficit of $23.3 billion in the single-employer program by the end of 2004. The multiemployer program had a surplus from FY1982 to FY2002 but has since reported deficits. PBGC projects that the multiemployer program will likely become insolvent in FY2025. Both programs are on the GAO's list of high-risk government programs. Approximately 825,000 participants received monthly payments from PBGC in FY2015. In FY2015, 825,000 participants received monthly payments from PBGC. The average monthly payment was $536, with retiree payees receiving $606 on average and beneficiary payees receiving $307. Around 40,000 participants received a lump-sum payment averaging $2,054. PBGC's single-employer program had a surplus in FY1996, peaking at $9.7 billion in FY2000. In FY2018, PBGC's single-employer program showed a surplus of $2.44 billion, attributed to factors like investment income and increased premium income. Data from FY1995 to FY2018 shows financial assistance provided to 78 multiemployer plans. The financial condition of the multiemployer insurance program has been deteriorating, with a deficit that increased from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $65.1 billion in FY2017, before decreasing to $53.8 billion in FY2018. Approximately 62,300 multiemployer plan participants received financial assistance in FY2018, with 27,800 expected to receive benefits in the future. The deficit of the multiemployer insurance program increased from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $65.1 billion in FY2017, before decreasing to $53.8 billion in FY2018. PBGC's budgetary cash flows are based on premium income, interest income, benefit outlays, and trust and revolving funds interactions. Trust fund holds pension plan assets, while revolving funds contain plan sponsor premiums and trust fund transfers for participant benefits. PBGC manages assets of terminated pension plans in a nonbudgetary trust fund, not reflected in the federal budget or balance sheet. The trust fund's assets are invested with a 30% allocation to equities and 70% to fixed income, totaling $70.2 billion. PBGC manages trust fund investments totaling $70.2 billion, with 30% in equities and 70% in fixed income. Three revolving funds are used by PBGC, funded by premiums and trust fund transfers to pay benefits. Revolving funds are invested in U.S. Treasury securities, with assets of $1.8 billion at the end of FY2018. The PBGC manages trust fund investments totaling $70.2 billion, with 30% in equities and 70% in fixed income. Three revolving funds, totaling $33.2 billion, are used to pay benefits and are invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Increases or decreases in the revolving funds appear as on-budget federal receipts and outlays, with gross outlays including benefit payments and administrative expenses. Premiums paid, interest on federal securities, and reimbursements from the trust fund are included in receipts. Some stakeholders criticize recent PBGC premium increases as they are seen as increases in federal revenue. PBGC projected a $26 billion surplus for the single-employer program in 10 years, with the multiemployer program running out of money by FY2025. Critics argue that recent premium increases are used to offset federal spending and may discourage employers from maintaining their DB pension plans. PBGC projected a $26 billion surplus for the single-employer program in 10 years. There is a high probability of the multiemployer program becoming insolvent by 2026 due to the likely insolvency of large pension plans. The multiemployer program's potential financial assistance exposure is estimated at $53.8 billion, and current premium levels may not be sufficient to support insolvent plans, risking PBGC's ability to guarantee benefits. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows insolvent plans to reduce benefits to sustain through premium collections only, avoiding the need for financial assistance from PBGC. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created a new joint select committee, The Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans, in response to concerns from policymakers and stakeholders. This committee aims to address uncertainties in how benefit suspensions and plan partitions allowed by the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act would impact PBGC's financial condition. The Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans was created by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 to improve the solvency of multiemployer pension plans and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. However, the committee did not release any recommendations or legislative language by the deadline. Historical data on premium levels for both single-employer and multiemployer programs is provided in tables A-1 and A-2."}

It establishes the Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing Program. The Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing program, established by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, guarantees loans for brownfield redevelopment and urban renewal projects. Eligibility requirements include applications from local governments and redevelopment agencies. The Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing program requires local governments, redevelopment agencies, or BRAC redevelopment projects to submit a master plan and certification from the Environmental Protection Agency for loan guarantees. The Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing program requires environmental remediation for redevelopment projects under a master plan. Loans guaranteed under the program must be used for brownfield site acquisition, remediation, and urban renewal projects. The Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing program prohibits loan guarantees for projects where the applying agency caused contamination on the brownfield site to be redeveloped. The Program limits the number of outstanding loans guaranteed to one for local governments, redevelopment agencies, or BRAC redevelopment projects. The loan's principal amount must be between $25,000,000 and the lesser of the total project cost or $150,000,000. The loan amount can range from $25,000,000 to a maximum of $150,000,000. The interest rate is negotiable between the lender and borrower, with a repayment term of 20 to 30 years. No repayment of principal or interest is required within the first 10 years after the loan is issued. The loan repayment must start within 15 years of issuance. The master plan must detail the brownfield redevelopment project, including activities, budget, and project description. The brownfield redevelopment project must demonstrate major economic and environmental benefits for the community, including non-Federal funds commitment, job creation, environmental remediation, and overall environmental and economic impact. The brownfield redevelopment project must show economic and environmental benefits for the community, including affordable housing, reduced vehicle congestion and emissions, green technology integration, improved air quality, and complete streets planning. The selection criteria for receiving loan guarantees under the Program include incorporating complete streets planning and transit-oriented development, demonstrating commitments of investment from non-Federal entities, and having an approved remediation action plan by the Environmental Protection Agency. The selection criteria for receiving loan guarantees under the Program include considering information required under subsection (c)(2) and providing favorable consideration to existing BRAC redevelopment projects with Federal grants or commitments. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to guarantee payments, which are conclusive evidence of eligibility for such guarantees. The Federal Government guarantees payments for loans under the Program, protecting against liability for environmental remediation. The Secretary processes and approves loan guarantee requests. To qualify for a loan guarantee under this section, applicants must show a viable repayment schedule and provide sufficient collateral. The approval process mirrors that of loan guarantees under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The Secretary may not require a pledge of grants as collateral for loan guarantees under this section. Congressional oversight is required before final approval of any loan guarantee. Definitions for the section include \"BRAC redevelopment project\" and \"brownfield.\" The former refers to redeveloping sites designated as Base Realignment and Closure Sites by the Secretary of Defense, while the latter is defined as specified in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act.

{"title": "RL32165", "content": "China maintained a currency peg to the U.S. dollar at an exchange rate of 8.28 yuan to the dollar from 1994 to July 21, 2005. The Chinese central bank controlled the peg by buying or selling dollar-denominated assets to balance demand for the yuan. This kept the exchange rate stable despite economic changes. The yuan's exchange rate to the dollar was pegged by China at 8.28 yuan to the dollar from 1994 to July 21, 2005. The peg was later modified to be adjustable based on market supply and demand, with reference to a currency basket including the dollar, yen, euro, and others. The Chinese government adjusted the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the yuan from 8.28 to 8.11, appreciating by 2.1%. The yuan was allowed to fluctuate daily against a currency basket, but remained not fully convertible in international markets. China maintained tight restrictions on capital transactions, describing the situation as a \"managed float\" where market forces determined the yuan's movement, but the government controlled its rate of appreciation. Since July 2005, China has allowed the yuan to appreciate slowly, accumulating foreign reserves rapidly. China's foreign exchange reserves grew from $403 billion in 2003 to $1.7 trillion in March 2008, with a large trade surplus of $262 billion in 2007. The yuan has risen 16% against the dollar since the 2005 reforms, indicating a significant shift in the economic environment between China and the United States. The yuan has appreciated 16% against the dollar since 2005 reforms, causing concerns in the United States about the falling dollar. Despite the increase in the yuan's value, worries persist. This paper reviews economic issues related to China's currency policy, including concerns raised by the United States, China's reluctance to change its currency, the fixed exchange rate regime in China, studies on China's real exchange rate, trends in the U.S.-China trade imbalance, and the economic consequences of China's currency policy. The economic consequences of China's currency policy for both China and the United States, including China's massive accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and purchases of U.S. federal debt instruments. Policy options for the United States to induce China to reform its currency policy, with many U.S. policymakers, business people, and labor representatives arguing that China's currency is significantly undervalued, affecting trade between the two countries. Many argue that China's undervalued currency has led to a significant U.S. trade deficit, impacting various manufacturing sectors. Analysts believe this policy also influences other East Asian countries to keep their currencies weak against the dollar to compete with Chinese goods. Several groups are urging the Bush Administration to pressure China to revalue its currency or allow it to float freely in international markets. President Bush and officials have criticized China's currency policy, advocating for market-determined exchange rates. Initially, the Administration rejected calls to directly pressure China but aimed to encourage financial system reform instead. The Bush Administration sought to encourage China to reform its financial system and adopt a more flexible currency policy. The Administration's stance on China's currency peg toughened in April 2005, with growing complaints from Members and the introduction of currency bills. During the 109th congressional session, the Senate failed to reject an amendment imposing a tariff on Chinese goods if China didn't appreciate its currency. Senate Republicans negotiated to allow a vote on a similar bill sponsored by Senator Schumer. During the 109th Congress, sponsors of the amendment agreed not to offer similar amendments to other bills. Supporters of S. 295 threatened to bring the bill up for a vote on two separate occasions in 2006 but were convinced not to by Administration and Chinese officials. Several other currency bills were introduced. Significant events regarding China's currency policy included a 4.1% increase in import prices from China from April 2007 to April 2008, the largest 12-month increase since December 2003. The index was first published in December 2003. U.S. imports from China rose by 1.8% in the first three months of 2008. The exchange rate with the dollar was 7.00 yuan on May 8, 2008. China's foreign exchange reserves reached $1.68 trillion in March 2008. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) was launched on September 29, 2007 with an initial capitalization of $200 billion. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) was established with $200 billion in capital to manage foreign exchange reserves. CIC announced a $5 billion investment in Morgan Stanley on December 15, 2007. China stated on August 13, 2007, that it had no plans to sell its dollar assets in response to rumors of potential sanctions. Regulations requiring domestic firms were also eliminated. The government eliminated regulations for domestic firms to convert foreign exchange holdings into yuan. The IMF clarified currency manipulation as policies affecting exchange rates to increase exports. 42 House Members filed a petition over China's currency practices. The USTR's office declined a petition regarding China's currency practices, as required by the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act. Treasury Department annually reports on exchange rate policies of countries with large surpluses and trade with the US to determine currency manipulation. The Treasury Department reports on exchange rate policies of countries with large surpluses and trade with the US to determine currency manipulation. China was cited for manipulating its currency in the past due to a dual exchange rate system and restrictions on foreign exchange access by domestic firms. No country has been designated as a currency manipulator since 1994. Since 1994, the Treasury Department reports have increasingly focused on China's currency policy and reforms. Following China's currency reform in July 2005, the Treasury praised the initial changes but criticized the lack of full implementation in making the exchange rate mechanism more flexible and market-driven. China's new managed float exchange rate regime was described as based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. The Treasury Department's report in June 2007 stated that China's currency mechanism, described as based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies, did not significantly influence the daily closing level of the yuan. Despite this, the trading behavior suggested that the new mechanism was still a tightly managed currency peg against the dollar. Treasury decided not to label China as a currency manipulator due to assurances from Chinese officials about commitment to market-determined currency flexibility and promoting domestic growth through financial reform. The Treasury Department's reports in June and December 2007 addressed China's currency manipulation concerns, urging China to accelerate the appreciation of the RMB's exchange rate to minimize risks for China and the world. Treasury continues to press Chinese officials on the exchange rate regime. Many Members criticize Treasury's decision not to label China as a currency manipulator despite its interventions to control the exchange rate with the dollar and trade surpluses with the United States. Calls for legislation to revise criteria for currency manipulation determination or estimate yuan's misalignment against the dollar. Chinese officials argue for their currency policies. Chinese officials defend their currency policy, stating it is for economic stability and investor confidence. They fear changing the policy could lead to an economic crisis and harm export industries during ongoing economic reforms. Chinese officials are concerned about rising unrest in rural areas due to income disparities and government corruption. They argue that appreciating the currency could lower farmers' income and exacerbate tensions. They also believe the banking system is not equipped to handle speculative pressures with a fully convertible currency. Chinese officials were considering currency reform but decided against it after the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. They believed that China's currency peg helped protect the economy from crisis. China's currency peg was seen as a shield against crises, but U.S. officials urge faster reforms for a more flexible currency system. Fixed exchange rates have a historical context, including the Bretton Woods system and the gold standard. China operated a fixed exchange rate system until July 2005, where the central bank maintained a constant yuan-dollar exchange rate. This system contrasted with a floating exchange rate, like the one the United States has with the Euro area, where market forces determine the exchange rate. Under a floating exchange rate system, the exchange rate of the euro to the dollar is determined by the relative demand for goods and assets of the Euro area and the United States. If demand for Euro area goods or assets increases, the euro rises in value to restore equilibrium. In a fixed exchange rate system, the central bank does not need to take action to maintain the peg if it is equal to the market rate. Economic circumstances change over time, affecting the relative demand for a country's currency. In a fixed exchange rate system, the central bank must adjust currency supply to match market demand, as economic changes impact the relative demand for a country's currency. This is achieved by increasing or decreasing foreign exchange reserves to maintain the peg. The central bank adjusts currency supply to match market demand in a fixed exchange rate system by increasing or decreasing foreign exchange reserves to maintain the peg. Net investment income and unilateral transfers between the United States and China are small, making the current account balance close to the trade balance. Excess demand for yuan has led to an increase in foreign exchange reserves to maintain the exchange rate peg. Since 2005, the Chinese central bank has maintained a prevailing exchange rate peg by increasing foreign reserves through buying dollars. China has become the world's largest holder of foreign exchange reserves by accumulating them rapidly. China surpassed Japan as the world's largest holder of foreign exchange reserves, with reserves growing significantly from $75 billion in 1995 to $1.53 trillion in 2007. Despite a 43% increase in foreign exchange holdings from 2006 to 2007, China has allowed the yuan to appreciate against the dollar, leading to a 16% increase by April 2008. This shift in policy reflects a move towards a \"managed float\" system where market forces play a role in determining exchange rates. The Chinese government maintains a \"managed float\" system for the yuan, allowing market forces to influence its movement while intervening to slow its appreciation against the dollar. This strategy is similar to other countries like Malaysia and Japan, who also manage their currency values. The rapid growth of foreign reserves suggests that if the yuan floated freely, it would appreciate even more. The Chinese government accumulates foreign exchange reserves to finance international trade and protect against currency speculation. The rapid growth of reserves in China has outpaced GDP and imports, indicating a potential strategy to prevent the yuan from appreciating further against the dollar. The nature of China's foreign reserves is not well-known, including the share held in U.S. assets and the reasons for annual increases. Economic activity is influenced by the real exchange rate, not just the nominal rate. The United States and China had similar overall price level increases from 1994 to 2003. In 2003, China had a higher inflation rate than the United States, causing the real and nominal exchange rates to diverge. This led to an appreciation of the real exchange rate from China's perspective, making their exports more expensive. However, from 1997 to 2003, the real and nominal exchange rates converged as China's inflation rate was lower than the U.S. inflation rate. This resulted in the Chinese exchange rate reaching its lowest level since 1994 in real terms in 2003, making their exports progressively less expensive. The yuan has appreciated since 1997, bringing it almost back to its 1998 level in real terms. If the demand for Chinese goods increases, the floating yuan would appreciate until the trade balance stabilizes. The fixed exchange rate would lead to a trade surplus with the United States, as Chinese exports would be relatively inexpensive and U.S. imports would be expensive. This surplus is equal to the capital flowing from China to the United States, including purchases of U.S. assets by private Chinese citizens. The purchase of U.S. assets by private Chinese citizens and the accumulation of dollar reserves by the Chinese central bank lead to an increase in yuan supply, causing inflation in China. This inflation leads to a rise in prices, making exports more costly and imports less costly, eventually returning the trade surplus to its equilibrium value. Despite the fixed nominal exchange rate, the real exchange rate adjusts to market rates due to the rise in prices. Undervaluing a fixed exchange rate does not provide any permanent benefits. When a country undervalues a fixed exchange rate, it does not give a lasting competitive advantage to its exporters and import-competing industries. Floating exchange rates return to equilibrium value faster than fixed rates, allowing for quicker price adjustments. Using monetary policy to influence currency value limits the ability to use monetary and fiscal policy to counteract changes in the business cycle. For example, a peg would prevent a country from lowering interest rates during an economic downturn, leading to capital outflows. When a country fixes its exchange rate, it may lose monetary autonomy during an economic downturn. Capital could flow out of the country, putting pressure on the currency peg. This loss of autonomy is more costly when tied to a partner with different business cycles. China maintains monetary autonomy despite a fixed exchange rate by using capital controls. The currency is convertible for trade but not for financial flows, and Chinese enterprises must exchange foreign currency for yuan. China retains monetary flexibility through capital controls, regulating foreign exchange purchases. The yuan's value has remained stable since 1994, with uncertainty on its potential appreciation due to limited data on current account balance sensitivity to imports and exports. Estimates of yuan's undervaluation sensitivity to exchange rate changes were made until June 2005. The report evaluates estimates derived by authors, categorized into \"fundamental equilibrium exchange rate\" and \"purchasing power parity\" methods. The fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER) method is used to estimate misalignments in exchange rates based on the belief that current account balances are temporarily out of line with their \"fundamental\" value. This method calculates how much the exchange rate must change to achieve the desired current account adjustment. Many economists may disagree with the idea that current account balances are misaligned worldwide. Ernest Preeg estimated that the yuan was undervalued by 40% in 2003, based on rule-of-thumb estimates. This claim is not backed by formal analysis but is derived from observations on Chinese foreign exchange reserves and trade surplus. In 2002, there was a decrease in net foreign direct investment flows. A 1% decline in the dollar could lead to a $10 billion decline in the trade deficit in the United States. The dollar would need to decline by 40% to eliminate the trade deficit, which was about $400 billion in 2002. The Chinese trade surplus plus net FDI flows equaled 100% of the increase in foreign exchange reserves. The Institute for International Economics (IIE) estimates that the yuan was 15%-25% undervalued in 2003 and argues that the surplus should be reduced by $50 billion to return to equilibrium, resulting in a deficit of 1%-1.5% of GDP in equilibrium. The Institute for International Economics (IIE) estimates that the yuan was 15%-25% undervalued in 2003 and argues that the surplus should be reduced by $50 billion to return to equilibrium, resulting in a deficit of 1%-1.5% of GDP. IIE Fellow Morris Goldstein testified that estimates of yuan misalignment can be obtained either by solving a trade model for RMB appreciation or by gauging the RMB appreciation that would contribute to reducing global payment imbalances, especially the U.S. current-account deficit. Goldman Sachs Economic Research Group has estimated the yuan revaluation needed for a more sustainable level of the U.S. current-account deficit. Goldman Sachs Economic Research Group estimates that the yuan was 9.5%-15% undervalued in 2003. They suggest a 9.5%-15% revaluation to achieve equilibrium in the current account. Virginie Coudert and Cecile Couharde argue that China has an underlying current account deficit of 1.5%-2.8% of GDP. Goldman Sachs estimates the yuan was 9.5%-15% undervalued in 2003, suggesting a revaluation to achieve equilibrium. Coudert and Couharde argue China has a current account deficit of 1.5%-2.8% of GDP, with the yuan being 44%-54% undervalued against the dollar. These estimates are not based on economic models but on general observations. The estimates of the yuan's undervaluation are not based on economic models but on \"back of the envelope\" calculations. The main source of contention is defining an \"equilibrium\" current account balance, with no consensus on what equilibrium would be. The authors base equilibrium on personal opinion, with some using arbitrary assumptions and others more sophisticated ones. Changing the assumed equilibrium current account balance significantly affects estimated undervaluation. Different saving and investment rates lead to countries lending and borrowing from each other for long periods of time. The Preeg, IIE, and Goldman Sachs estimates suggest a less favorable equilibrium for China's current account balance, allowing for FDI inflows but still resulting in a deficit. Choosing a balance instead of a deficit as the benchmark would lead to smaller estimates of the yuan's undervaluation. China's capital flows are constrained by capital controls, making it unclear why requiring Chinese borrowing from the world is any more sustainable than the current lending situation. Increasing foreign reserves is necessary to prevent a rise in China's foreign indebtedness, with measures limiting the accumulation of reserves for exchange rate manipulation. Determining China's equilibrium current account balance is challenging due to capital controls, especially post-currency reform. If China were to eliminate capital controls after currency reform, the economic situation would change entirely. Private Chinese citizens could now engage in persistent borrowing or lending with the rest of the world, leading to a corresponding trade deficit or surplus. This could result in an equilibrium where private citizens lend as much to the United States as the Chinese central bank currently does. If China were to eliminate capital controls after currency reform, the equilibrium market exchange rate would be equal to the current fixed rate. Private capital outflows exceeding foreign reserves would lead to yuan depreciation. It is uncertain if China would be a net borrower or lender if their currency floated and capital controls were abolished due to high national saving and investment rates. The equilibrium exchange rate in China is considered \"market determined\" due to capital controls restricting portfolio investment flows. China's high internal saving rate allows it to offset FDI inflows with official outflows in the form of foreign reserve accumulation. Foreign reserve accumulation should not be seen as proof of undervaluation. Some argue that China's equilibrium current account surplus may be larger than the actual surplus, suggesting the yuan is overvalued. The FEER approach suggests that revaluing the yuan could reduce the unsustainable U.S. trade deficit. It argues that the dollar is incorrectly valued against most trading partners. Estimates show the yuan is 54% undervalued, with the dollar being 35% overvalued in 2003. If markets are rational, the dollar's value and trade size will adjust accordingly. The sustainability of the U.S. trade deficit is not widely agreed upon, but evidence suggests it is not unsustainable in the medium term. The trade deficit has persisted for several years without hindering economic growth or causing significant declines in the dollar. The U.S. trade deficit has not caused significant declines in the dollar. If China stopped buying U.S. assets, the overall U.S. trade deficit may not decrease proportionally. Even if China's trade surplus is eliminated, it could still have a bilateral surplus with the U.S. The U.S. trade deficit has not caused significant declines in the dollar. Even if China's trade surplus is eliminated, it could still have a bilateral surplus with the U.S. International experience suggests that the Chinese current account balance in equilibrium could be similar to other East Asian countries. Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, countries like Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan have consistently maintained large current account surpluses. This trend, along with their significant foreign exchange reserves, indicates a challenging environment for developing world borrowing. Additionally, other countries in the region, including China, exhibit similar patterns of current account surpluses and foreign exchange reserves. China's current account balance is in line with its neighbors. Estimates of yuan undervaluation based on purchasing power parity suggest a 56% undervaluation in February 2007. The Economist's Big Mac Index is a lighthearted guide to exchange rates but has drawbacks. The Big Mac Index is a lighthearted guide to exchange rates, comparing the price of a Big Mac in China and the US to determine undervaluation. However, it has drawbacks as it only applies to tradeable goods, not considering the services associated with the hamburger. Li Ong estimates that 94% of the Big Mac's value comes from these services, which are determined by local factors. The Big Mac Index compares the price of a Big Mac in different locations to determine undervaluation based on purchasing power parity. However, this method has limitations as it only considers the tradeable portion of the Big Mac's value, not the services associated with it. Despite its simplicity in theory, the Big Mac Index has been proven to be unreliable in reality, as prices are consistently lower in developing countries compared to industrialized ones. Some economists estimate the yuan's value by controlling for predictable divergences from PPP. However, PPP only predicts exchange rates in the long run and may not reflect changes in trade deficits. Economist Jeffrey Frankel suggests regressing income level on the exchange rate. Economist Jeffrey Frankel argues that income level can be regressed on the exchange rate to find a predictable relationship based on PPP. He estimates China's exchange rate was undervalued by 36% in 2000, with speculation that undervaluation has increased since then. Coudert and Couharde estimate the yuan to be undervalued by 41%-51% in 2003. Frankel acknowledges caveats to this analysis, noting that PPP only holds over the long run and financial flows can impact exchange rates. Economist Jeffrey Frankel argues that income level can be regressed on the exchange rate to find a predictable relationship based on PPP. He emphasizes the impact of financial flows on exchange rates and cautions against sudden adjustments in exchange rates. Frankel also highlights the need for a theoretical rationale when linking income levels to exchange rate values to avoid spurious correlations. The \"Balassa-Samuelson\" effect predicts that as countries get richer, their exchange rates will appreciate due to productivity growth being faster for tradeable goods. Using income levels as a proxy for productivity growth can lead to inaccurate results if the proxy is not reliable. Another proxy, the ratio of consumer price index to producer price index, estimated the yuan to be 18% undervalued in 2003. In 2003, different studies estimated the yuan to be undervalued by varying percentages. Wang's regression suggested modest undervaluation, while Benassy-Quere et al. found a 47% undervaluation. Concerns were raised about the accuracy of the price index proxy for China and the impact of labor and capital restrictions on the Balassa-Samuelson effect. Cheung et al. were able to replicate these findings. Cheung et al. question the undervaluation estimates of the yuan, noting they lack statistical significance and are not robust. Adjusting for serial correlation reduces the estimated undervaluation. Dunaway et al. show that adding explanatory variables to the PPP model affects the results. The Treasury Department's December 2006 report on exchange rates discusses the use of economic models and methodology to estimate a currency's \"misalignment\" or what the fair market rate exchange rate should be. It notes that there is no single model that accurately explains exchange rate movements and that their conclusions can vary when additional explanatory variables are added to the PPP model. The Treasury Department's report on exchange rates highlights the limitations of economic models in predicting currency misalignments. It suggests focusing on serious misalignments using real effective exchange rates and multiple models to understand exchange rate movements. Additionally, it recommends supplementing model judgments with empirical data, indicators, policies, and institutional factors to verify currency misalignments. The Treasury Department's report on exchange rates emphasizes the need to focus on serious misalignments using real effective exchange rates and multiple models to understand currency movements. Critics of China's currency peg often cite the U.S.-China trade imbalance as evidence of the yuan being undervalued, but bilateral trade balances reflect structural causes and exchange rate effects. Other factors also play a significant role in analyzing bilateral trade. China's trade surplus with the United States in 2007 was $256 billion, but its overall surplus was $262 billion. The yuan's undervaluation against the dollar does not explain all trade imbalances, as China also runs deficits with other countries like Taiwan and South Korea. In 2007, China had a $256 billion trade surplus with the United States, contributing to its overall surplus of $262 billion. The U.S. also had deficits with Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. Despite the rising trade deficit with China, U.S. exports to China increased significantly, making it the third largest U.S. export market in 2007. In 2007, China surpassed Japan to become the third largest U.S. export market. A significant portion of imports from China contributing to the U.S. trade deficit comes from export-oriented multinational companies, particularly from East Asia, that have relocated production to China for its low-cost labor. Data shows a substantial increase in the share of China's exports produced by foreign-invested enterprises, rising from 1.9% in 1986 to 40.7% in 1996, and further to a higher percentage by 2007. In 2007, China surpassed Japan to become the third largest U.S. export market. The share of China's exports produced by foreign-invested enterprises rose from 1.9% in 1986 to 40.7% in 1996, and further increased to 57.1% by 2007. FIEs also accounted for a significant portion of China's imports, rising from 5.6% in 1986 to 58.5% in 2007. China tends to run trade deficits with East Asian countries and trade surpluses with countries like the United States due to importing raw materials for assembly and exporting final products. This has contributed to the rising U.S. trade deficit with China. The rising U.S. trade deficit with China is due to China becoming a production platform for foreign companies, rather than unfair trade policies. Foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) play a significant role in China's trade, with FDI growing rapidly from $1.9 billion in 1986 to $74.8 billion in 2007, mainly in export-oriented manufacturing. In 2007, a large portion of China's FDI went to export-oriented manufacturing, with a significant share exported to the United States. FIEs import about 80% as much as they export, having little impact on China's overall trade balance. Foreign multinational companies shifted production to China from other East Asian countries in one industry. In 2000, Japan was the top foreign supplier of U.S. computer equipment, but by 2007, China became the largest supplier with a 51.5% share. Japan's ranking fell to 4th place, with a significant drop in shipments. China's computer equipment exports to the U.S. increased by 436% in seven years, far outpacing the global growth in imports of these commodities. China's computer production has increased significantly, with a large share attributed to foreign companies moving manufacturing facilities to China. The undervalued yuan benefits Chinese exports to the United States by making them cheaper, boosting China's export industries and attracting foreign investment. The undervalued yuan increases China's attractiveness for foreign investment in export-oriented production facilities, benefiting Chinese exporting firms but hurting non-exporting Chinese firms reliant on imports. This policy may hinder efficient resource allocation in the long run. In the short run, a revaluation of the yuan could impact China's economy by reducing aggregate spending through increased imports and decreased exports. The debate on whether this is beneficial depends on the current state of the Chinese economy, with some arguing for revaluation to prevent overheating and inflation, while others highlight the potential disruption to underemployed labor in rural areas. Many economists argue that China's currency policy hinders the government's ability to use monetary policy for stable economic growth. They believe this policy has led to an overreliance on fixed investment and exports, which is unsustainable in the long run. Additionally, they suggest that the policy may be increasing the risk of non-performing loans in the banking system due to easy credit. China's currency policy has led to an inflow of \"hot money\" into speculative ventures like real estate and the stock market. Banks are unable to use interest rate policies effectively to regulate investments, as raising rates could attract more foreign capital. This accumulation of foreign exchange reserves may hinder the efficient allocation of capital and lead to overproduction in certain sectors. The accumulation of large foreign exchange reserves by China may facilitate a quicker move towards a fully convertible currency. However, it also comes with opportunity costs as these funds could be used for infrastructure, education, social safety nets, and bank recapitalization, which may offer higher returns to the economy than holding U.S. Treasuries or Chinese bonds. The accumulation of foreign reserves by China has higher returns to the economy than U.S. Treasuries or Chinese bonds. This can lead to a decrease in the value of the yuan, making Chinese exports cheaper and U.S. exports more expensive, causing a rise in the U.S. trade deficit and reducing aggregate demand in the short run. Many affected firms are in the manufacturing sector. China's exports to the United States, mainly labor-intensive consumer goods, do not directly compete with domestic producers. However, some U.S. industries, such as makers of machine tools and furniture, are concerned about the growing competitive challenge. The undervalued Chinese currency poses a competitive challenge for U.S. industries like tool and die makers. While it may reduce their output, U.S. computer firms benefit from lower prices on imported parts from China, increasing their competitiveness in global markets. Many imports from China are produced by U.S.-invested enterprises, further benefiting from the undervalued yuan. An undervalued yuan benefits U.S.-invested enterprises by allowing more capital investment in plant and equipment through Chinese investments in U.S. assets, leading to increased capital investment and lower U.S. interest rates. Lower U.S. interest rates due to capital inflow from China benefit private firms and households, leading to increased spending and economic growth. Chinese investments in U.S. assets, particularly U.S. Treasury securities, contribute to this capital flow. China is the second largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities, with $397 billion as of September 2007. If the U.S. trade deficit with China is eliminated, the U.S. government would need to find other buyers for its securities at higher interest rates, increasing the budget deficit. The undervalued yuan allows the United States to increase consumption of goods through improved terms-of-trade. This boosts the purchasing power of U.S. consumers in the long term. The rise of the yuan against the dollar may also have an impact. The rising prices for raw materials and the value of the yuan are impacting Chinese product prices in the U.S. Import prices from China increased by 4.1% from April 2007 to April 2008, the largest 12-month increase since 2003. U.S. imports from China rose by 1.8% from January to March 2008. Critics argue that the low value of the yuan has led to job losses in the U.S. manufacturing sector. In the U.S. manufacturing sector, 2.7 million factory jobs have been lost since July 2000. However, there is no clear link between job losses and imports from China. Manufacturing output is at an all-time high, but employment has fallen due to productivity growth. The trade deficit is not limited to China, and there is a long-term trend of shifting employment from manufacturing to the service sector. The shift away from manufacturing towards the service sector in the U.S. has led to a decrease in manufacturing employment over the years. This trend is driven by changing technology and comparative advantage in a globalized economy. Trade leads to more manufacturing abroad and less in the United States, regardless of China's currency policy. Alan Greenspan stated in 2005 that an increase in the value of the Chinese renminbi would not significantly boost manufacturing activity and jobs in the U.S. An undervalued yuan does not impact aggregate demand in the U.S. An undervalued yuan does not affect aggregate demand in the United States but leads to a shift in U.S. production towards firms benefiting from lower interest rates due to Chinese capital inflows. This shift is expected to have no significant impact on U.S. employment or unemployment in the medium- or long-run. Despite the widening trade deficit with China, the overall unemployment rate in the U.S. has decreased from 6.3% in 2003 to around 5% in 2008. The trade deficit has led to uneven gains and losses in employment and production across regions and sectors of the economy. While the compositional shift in output does not negatively impact overall U.S. output and employment in the long run, there may be short-term adverse consequences. If output in the trade sector declines faster than the output of U.S. recipients of Chinese capital rises, aggregate spending and employment could temporarily decrease, potentially leading to a decline in the inflation rate. A decline in aggregate spending could lead to a temporary decrease in inflation rate, especially if the economy is already sluggish. Government policy adjustments and market forces can offset any output decline in the trade sector by boosting other elements of demand. Shifting U.S. output towards a higher capital base may result in a larger economy in the long run, but U.S. citizens may not benefit from returns on Chinese-owned capital. In the United States, U.S. workers using Chinese-owned capital would see higher productivity and wages. China accounts for a significant portion of U.S. imports, but a domestic imbalance between saving and investment has led to a trade deficit for the U.S. over the past two decades. The United States has experienced a decline in saving as a share of GDP over the past two decades. Despite high productivity growth and strong economic fundamentals, there is a low household saving rate and a negative government saving rate due to the budget deficit. This leads to foreigners financing profitable investments in the U.S., resulting in a trade deficit. Foreign-owned capital returns go to foreigners instead of Americans, while U.S. labor sees benefits from using Chinese-owned capital. China's gross national saving as a percent of GDP is significantly higher than the U.S., with a lower rate of private consumption. China also maintains a higher rate of gross fixed investment compared to the United States. China's gross national saving is 118% of its gross national investment, compared to 68% in the United States. This difference results in China having excess saving to invest overseas, while the United States needs to borrow from abroad. The current account balances as a percent of GDP are 9.0% for China and -6.2% for the United States, indicating a need for both countries to adjust their saving and investment patterns to reduce trade imbalances. Some analysts believe China is already moving in this direction based on statements from high-level officials. China is transitioning towards boosting consumer spending, as indicated by high-level officials. The Treasury Department's report in November 2005 highlighted China's commitment to sustainable domestic growth through modernizing the financial sector. However, it may take years for China to shift from exports and domestic investment to consumption for GDP growth. Government policy can only indirectly influence long-term consumption patterns. The United States has a trade deficit with some countries and a trade surplus with others due to comparative advantage. Concerns for the US include its low saving rate, which makes it reliant on foreign financing for investments. The United States has a trade deficit and low saving rate, relying on foreign financing for investments. The dollar's depreciation stimulates exports and reduces demand for imports, but some economists fear potential disruptions in economic activity. Some economists fear that the large trade deficit could lead to a sudden and severe depreciation of the dollar, causing disruptions in the U.S. economy. This adjustment may happen rapidly if investors realize that significant dollar depreciation is inevitable. Some economists fear a sudden and severe dollar depreciation due to the large trade deficit, leading to disruptions in the U.S. economy. This scenario, though unlikely, could cause significant dislocations in financial markets. The primary reason for the dollar's stability since 2002 is the accumulation of foreign reserves by central banks in China and other developing countries. Some Asian and oil-producing countries have built up foreign reserves to prevent their currency from appreciating against the dollar. This policy may continue as long as China does it, as other Asian countries see their exports competing with China. The support for the dollar by China and other developing countries has helped maintain investor confidence in U.S. assets despite the trade deficit. If these countries stop intervening in currency markets, the dollar could experience a significant drop. The United States could pressure China for currency reforms to avoid a potential crisis. Options include making the yuan fully convertible, allowing gradual appreciation, reducing intervention in currency markets, widening fluctuation bands, and financial sector reforms for greater flexibility. Options to induce China to reform its exchange rate regime, including proposed legislation, have sparked a policy debate. Some Members of Congress are frustrated with the Treasury Department's failure to designate China as a currency manipulator, believing it would increase pressure on China to reform its currency practices. The Treasury Department's November 2005 currency report states that identifying countries' currency practices as manipulation is complex. Proposed legislation aims to identify \"fundamentally misaligned currencies\" instead of manipulated ones. S. 1677 would require Treasury to cite a country for currency manipulation regardless of intent. Proposed legislation aims to identify \"fundamentally misaligned currencies\" instead of manipulated ones, requiring Treasury to cite a country for currency manipulation regardless of intent. This could increase pressure on China to reform its currency policy, with the U.S. government having the discretion to label the yuan as misaligned with the dollar. President Bush and Administration officials believe China's currency policy is detrimental to its economy. The United States has been working to assist China in reforming its financial sector and currency policy to promote domestic consumption and reduce dependence on exports. China has been invited to attend G-7 meetings since 2004, recognizing its growing importance in the global economy. China has been invited to G-7 finance meetings since 2004 due to its growing economic importance. The United States has pressured China to make its currency more flexible, with a joint statement from G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors emphasizing the need for adjustments in China's exchange rates. The US may seek to rally more support within the G-7 to increase pressure on China. States could build consensus within the G-7 to pressure China on currency reform or persuade China to engage in talks with East Asian economies. Other countries fear their exports would suffer without China's cooperation. The United States could also press for reforms. The United States could pressure China to reform its currency and work with the International Monetary Fund to promote more balanced economic growth. China needs to understand the risks of relying too heavily on exports and domestic investment. The U.S. could use trade sanctions as leverage to push for changes in China's exchange rate system. The United States could pressure China to reform its currency by imposing trade sanctions if it does not appreciate its currency to fair market levels. Legislation like H.R. 1002 proposes additional tariffs on Chinese imports unless currency reform occurs. Proponents believe threats of tariffs were effective in the past, while opponents argue sanctions may violate WTO rules and backfire. Some proposals aim to impose sanctions on China for its currency policy, which could violate WTO rules. Critics argue that China's currency policy breaches WTO regulations. The U.S. could consider measures like denying certain countries access to government procurement and cutting off financing through OPIC. Critics claim China's currency policy violates WTO rules. The US could take the issue to the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body, which could direct China to change its policy. If China refuses, the US may impose trade sanctions. Using the WTO allows for a multilateral approach, but there is no guarantee of a favorable ruling. The US could use Section 301 of U.S. trade law to address China's trade barriers and discriminatory practices. Failure to use WTO dispute resolution procedures may lead to China filing a WTO case against the US. In 2004, the Bush Administration rejected two Section 301 petitions on China's exchange rate policy. The Bush Administration rejected two Section 301 petitions on China's exchange rate policy, one by the China Currency Coalition and one by 30 Members of Congress. Both petitions aimed to bring a case before the WTO against China for violating WTO rules with its currency peg. Despite a later petition by 42 House Members, the USTR declined to pursue a trade dispute case in the WTO, expressing doubts about winning such a case. H.R. 321, H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 796, S. 1607, and S. 1677 propose bringing a case against China over its currency policy, with H.R. 321 also calling for WTO rules on currency manipulation to be updated. U.S. countervailing laws allow relief from imported products through higher duties. The Commerce Department pursued a countervailing case against Chinese subsidized products, imposing duties ranging from 11 to 20% in March 2007. Commerce Department imposed duties ranging from 11 to 20% on Chinese subsidized products. China's economic reforms have made some sectors relatively market-based, allowing identification of government subsidies. Some Members argue that China's currency policy is an export subsidy actionable under U.S. countervailing laws. Proposed bills would apply countervailing laws to non-market economies and address currency misalignment. Several Members argue that China's currency policy is considered an export subsidy under U.S. countervailing laws. Proposed legislation aims to make currency misalignment or manipulation actionable under these laws, although critics raise concerns about the difficulty of determining the subsidy level conveyed by China's currency. Additionally, possible U.S. countervailing measures against China's currency could face challenges in the WTO. Critics of currency policy argue that undervaluing the yuan affects Chinese exports to the U.S., harming U.S. industries. Proposed legislation would factor in currency impact on export prices for antidumping duties, but challenges include determining undervaluation and WTO compatibility. Utilizing U.S. trade remedy laws is another option. One option to address the impact of Chinese exports on U.S. industries is to utilize U.S. trade remedy laws, such as safeguard provisions, to impose restrictions on imported Chinese products causing market disruption to domestic producers. This could provide temporary relief for affected U.S. firms, particularly in the textile and apparel sector. The Bush Administration invoked special safeguards to restrict textile and apparel imports from China, reaching an agreement in 2005 to limit certain exports. However, relief was not extended to various industries under the China-specific safeguard. H.R. 782 and S. 796 propose considering exchange rate misalignment by China in determining market disruption under the safeguard. Several policy analysts have advised against pressuring China too much on its currency policy, as it may not benefit the U.S. economically and could be ineffective. They suggest addressing China's currency policy as part of a broader U.S. trade strategy to encourage economic and trade reforms. This approach seems to be the Administration's policy in the SED talks, where U.S. officials have urged China to make changes. The Administration's policy in the SED talks involves urging China to boost domestic consumption and make its currency policy more flexible to address global trade imbalances. U.S. trade policy focuses on pressing China to comply with WTO commitments, including market access, protection of intellectual property rights, and addressing industrial policies that favor domestic content over imports. China's banking system is a key focus in U.S. trade policy towards China. The U.S. aims to leverage China's WTO commitments to push for economic liberalization and market opening. This approach is seen as more effective than pressuring China to reform its currency regime. Concerns have been raised about China's large holdings of U.S. federal debt and the potential for it to be used as a political tool. China's large holdings of U.S. federal debt have raised concerns about its potential use as a political tool. A recent article in the Telegraph cited Chinese officials suggesting that China could make the dollar collapse by selling off its U.S. Treasuries if trade sanctions were imposed. This threat was seen as a bargaining chip by U.S. policymakers, including Senator Charles Grassley. In response to concerns about China's large holdings of U.S. federal debt, Senator Charles Grassley asked the Chinese government to confirm that their comments did not reflect official policy. The Chinese ambassador reassured that there was no plan to drastically adjust their foreign reserves, with an official from the People's Bank of China stating that U.S. government securities were an important component of China's investment portfolio. China reassured that their foreign reserves would not be drastically adjusted, with U.S. government securities being an important component in their investment portfolio. Liquidating dollar-denominated assets could impact the value of the dollar but is unlikely due to potential negative consequences for China and the U.S. economy. The Chinese government launched the China Investment Corporation (CIC) in 2007 to manage its foreign exchange reserves, initially overseeing $200 billion. There are concerns that China may diversify away from dollar-denominated assets like Treasury securities. If China allows its currency to be determined by market forces, it could lead to a boost in U.S. exports and a decline in the bilateral trade deficit. This would also mean that the Chinese central bank would no longer need to purchase U.S. assets to maintain the peg. U.S. borrowers, including the federal government, would then need to find new sources of funding. The falling dollar could lead to a drop in the value of the dollar, potentially destabilizing the U.S. economy. This would result in reduced spending on interest-sensitive purchases, impacting capital investment, housing, and consumer durables. The decrease in investment spending would shrink the U.S. capital stock in the long run. The rising inflation in the United States could lead to an increase in the value of the yuan, causing import prices to rise and adding to inflationary pressures. A move to a floating exchange rate would result in the depreciation of the currency, reversing the effects. Floating exchange rates fluctuate frequently and significantly, typically accompanied by the elimination of capital controls. China opposes a floating exchange rate due to fears of large private capital outflow caused by unsafe deposits in state banks. This could lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate, reducing U.S. exports and increasing the trade deficit. China could attempt to float its exchange rate while maintaining capital controls to prevent private capital outflow and depreciation of the currency. This solution may make it harder to impose effective capital controls due to the profit incentive for evasion. Another option is to maintain the status quo. Maintaining the status quo could lead to a slow rise in the nominal exchange rate, causing the real rate to adjust over time as inflation rates diverge between countries. The adjustment would decrease the U.S. bilateral trade deficit and benefit U.S. exporters and import-competing firms. However, this process would take time, and pressures on the U.S. trade sector would persist in the meantime. China's high saving rate and the US's low saving rate contribute to their trade imbalances. Despite a floating exchange rate, persistent trade deficits can occur at the bilateral level. China's low-cost labor and productivity gains continue to drive export growth to the US, regardless of exchange rate fluctuations. The significant appreciation of the yuan since 2005 has not reduced the US trade deficit with China. The debate over China's currency policy is linked to concerns about the growing trade deficit, decline in US manufacturing employment, and China's economic rise. Most economists agree that China's currency would appreciate against the dollar if allowed to float. The yuan's appreciation since 2005 has not reduced the US trade deficit with China. There is debate over the potential effects of a yuan appreciation on the US economy, as it may benefit some sectors while harming others and consumers. The trade deficit with China has not impacted US full employment. The impact of U.S. trade with China on manufacturing employment is complex, with various factors at play such as productivity growth, shifts to the service sector, and the overall trade deficit. It is unclear if production has shifted specifically from the U.S. to China or to other low-wage countries. The involvement of foreign multilateral corporations in China's exports further complicates the issue of who benefits and the implications of the rising U.S. trade deficit with China. The implications of a rising U.S. trade deficit with China include concerns about the effects of an appreciating yuan and the potential destabilizing effects of the falling dollar. There is debate over policy options to promote U.S. economic interests in light of China's accumulation of U.S. assets. Chinese officials plan to gradually make the currency more flexible and eventually adopt a floating currency to avoid disruptions to the economy. However, the current currency policy may be undermining these efforts by expanding the money supply. China's currency policy, while aiming for flexibility, may be hindered by the expansion of the money supply. This could lead to easy credit policies, non-performing loans, and government directives limiting bank loans in certain sectors, potentially undermining the establishment of a market-based financial system. The policy also acts as a de facto subsidy, benefiting some export industries but hindering resource distribution efficiency in the economy. China's exchange rate reforms are criticized by U.S. officials for being overly cautious and hindering global trade adjustments. Both countries agree on the need for major economic reforms to boost domestic consumption and savings. This could potentially undermine world economic growth and hurt China's export-dependent economy. China officials aim to boost economic development in the hinterland and increase spending on social security, healthcare, and education. Legislation in the 110th Congress on China's currency policy, such as H.R. 321, would require the Treasury Department to determine if China manipulated its currency and impose tariffs on Chinese products accordingly. The bill calls for action against China's currency policy, including filing a WTO case and modifying rules on currency manipulation. H.R. 782/S. 796 would apply U.S. countervailing laws to products from non-market economies like China and address exchange rate misalignment. The bills aim to address China's currency misalignment by making it actionable under U.S. countervailing law, requiring the Treasury Department to report on misaligned currencies to Congress, restricting Department of Defense purchases from China if misalignment disrupts U.S. defense industries, and imposing additional tariffs on Chinese goods unless China stops manipulating its currency. The President certifies that China is no longer manipulating its currency. H.R. 2942 and S. 364 would apply countervailing laws to nonmarket economies and address undervalued currency as a factor in determining antidumping and countervailing duties. Treasury would identify fundamentally misaligned currencies for priority action. If consultations fail, USTR would take action in the WTO.

If the designated country fails to adopt appropriate policies within 180 days, the U.S. would take measures such as making currency undervaluation a factor in determining antidumping duties and banning federal procurement from the designated country.

Senator Schumer pushed for consideration of S. 295 after disappointment with China's currency reforms in July 2005. The Senate agreed to consider the bill by March 31, 2006. Schumer and Graham later delayed taking up S. 295 due to China's apparent commitment to reform. However, Schumer expressed disappointment with China's progress on currency flexibility in September 2006 and requested the Senate to take up S. 295. On September 28, 2006, Senators Schumer and Graham announced they were persuaded by President Bush to delay a vote on S. 295 to allow more time for negotiations with China on currency policy. H.R. 3283 (English) passed in July 2005, applying U.S. countervailing laws to non-market economies like China and requiring the Treasury Department to define currency manipulation.

{"title": "107_hr5241", "content": "The Act titled \"Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2002\" amends the Public Health Service Act by adding a new section on Lifespan Respite Care. This section includes findings and purposes related to respite care services. Congress finds that millions of individuals in the United States provide care for family members with chronic illnesses or disabilities, including children with special needs and those living with relatives due to parental inability or unwillingness to care for them. Approximately 165,000 children with disabilities in the US live with foster care parents, while nearly 4,000,000 individuals of all ages with mental retardation or developmental disabilities reside with their families. Additionally, around 25% of the elderly population in the country have multiple chronic disabling conditions, requiring assistance with daily needs. Each year, about 600,000 Americans pass away at home, many of whom rely on extensive family support. Approximately 600,000 Americans pass away at home each year, with many relying on extensive family caregiving before their deaths. 42 percent of individuals in the US needing daily living assistance are under age 65, and there are insufficient resources to replace family caregivers with paid workers. The cost of replacing family caregivers with paid services would be around $200 billion annually, and while the role is rewarding, it can lead to emotional, physical, and financial hardship. Approximately 75 percent of family caregivers are women and often struggle to find information about available respite care. The existing respite care programs are insufficient, primarily targeting lower-income populations and the elderly, leaving many family caregivers without adequate support. Limited availability and recruitment challenges further hinder the effectiveness of these programs. The purposes of this title are to encourage States to establish respite care programs, improve information dissemination to family caregivers, provide respite care services, and promote innovative approaches to respite care delivery and worker recruitment. The purpose of this section is to support respite care programs by providing training for caregivers, promoting research on effective services, and disseminating findings to alleviate caregiver strain. Training programs for family caregivers aim to assist them in making informed decisions about respite care services.

{"title": "R42113", "content": "Corporate tax revenues have declined since the post-World War II era, currently generating revenue equal to approximately 1.3% of GDP. Projections suggest that the corporate tax could raise revenue over 2.4% of GDP in the future. Overall federal tax revenues have remained stable, averaging around 17.7% of GDP since 1946. The corporate tax revenue has declined significantly since the post-World War II era, currently accounting for only 1.3% of GDP. In contrast, payroll tax revenue has increased to 6.0% of GDP, while excise tax revenue has decreased to 0.5% of GDP. The individual tax remains stable at around 8.1% of economic output. Overall, the corporate tax has decreased in importance relative to other revenue sources. The corporate tax revenue has declined significantly, now only accounting for 8.9% of federal tax revenue. Factors such as tax rate and tax base size impact revenue collection. Factors like the number of firms and corporate profitability can affect the tax base. The decline in corporate tax revenues is attributed to a decrease in both corporate tax rates and the corporate tax base. The effective corporate tax rate has dropped from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010, contributing to lower revenue generation. The effective corporate tax rate has decreased due to a reduction in the top statutory rate, leading to lower corporate tax revenue. Since 2004, corporations have been able to claim the Section 199 deduction for certain activities, reducing the effective corporate tax rate below the statutory rate. This deduction primarily benefits the domestic manufacturing industry. The Section 199 deduction, like the investment tax credit, reduces the effective tax rate on corporate income. Changes to depreciation rules also played a role in lowering effective tax rates, with bonus depreciation temporarily enhancing depreciation in 2002 and 2009 to stimulate the economy. According to research by economists Alan Auerbach and James Poterba, factors like inflation, foreign tax credit, and other corporate tax credits have had small effects on falling effective corporate tax rates. The main drivers of the decrease in effective rates have been accelerated depreciation and the investment tax credit. Despite a general decline over time, there were spikes in the effective tax rate above the 35% statutory rate around 2000 and 2007. During economic recessions in 2000 and 2007, businesses faced losses and higher taxes due to limitations on carrying back losses for tax refunds. This resulted in struggling corporations paying higher taxes than they would with a longer carryback period. In response to higher taxes during economic recessions, Congress extended the carryback period from two years to five years in 2002 and 2008 to stimulate the economy. The decline in corporate tax revenue is not solely due to lower effective tax rates but also because of a shrinking nonfinancial corporate tax base as more business income is generated by partnerships and S corporations not subject to corporate income tax. The distribution of business income in the United States has shifted from C corporations to partnerships and S corporations, known as \"pass-throughs.\" In 1980, C corporations generated 78% of all business income, but by 2007, they only accounted for 44%. Meanwhile, partnerships' share rose from 3% to 28%, and S corporations' share rose from 1% to nearly 17%. This shift has led to a smaller corporate tax base. The shift in business income distribution from C corporations to partnerships and S corporations has led to a smaller corporate tax base. C corporations accounted for 17% of all businesses in 1980 but only 6% by 2007. S corporations became more popular after the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which set lower tax rates for individuals and corporations, incentivizing businesses to organize as S corporations. Legislation increased the S corporation shareholder limit from 35 to 100, making the S corporation form more attractive. By 2007, S corporations represented 12% of businesses, up from 4% in 1980. The reduction in profitability of firms in the corporate sector has impacted the tax base. Profitability is often measured by the ratio of profit to net assets. The profit to asset ratio in the corporate sector has decreased significantly since 1966. Economists Auerbach and Poterba found that this decline in profitability has had a greater impact on corporate taxes than changes in tax rates. This raises the question of why nonfinancial profitability has decreased. The decline in nonfinancial corporate profitability since 1966 has impacted corporate taxes more than changes in tax rates. Possible reasons for this decline include a shift to more volatile industries, a younger age profile of corporations, and potential profit shifting by American corporations. The decline in nonfinancial corporate profitability since 1966 has impacted corporate taxes more than changes in tax rates. Possible reasons for this decline include a shift to more volatile industries, a younger age profile of corporations, and profit-shifting behavior among American corporations to lower tax liability. Researchers have found evidence of profit-shifting among multinational corporations, leading to discrepancies in reported income for tax purposes compared to financial accounting purposes. Corporate tax revenues have been declining for the last six decades due to three primary factors: decreasing effective corporate tax rate, increase in pass-through business structures, and erosion of the corporate tax base. The decline in corporate tax revenues is attributed to the erosion of the corporate tax base, falling corporate sector profitability, and decreasing effective corporate tax rate. The focus of the tax reform debate is on reducing statutory rates and broadening the tax base by eliminating deductions and credits. A revenue-neutral reduction of the top statutory corporate tax rate may be possible by broadening the tax base and repealing corporate tax expenditures. Reducing the rate from 35% to 25% would require reforms to business taxation, including changes to tax preferences for noncorporate businesses. Business activity may shift back to the corporate sector with these reforms, naturally broadening the base. Other reforms may involve changes to the taxation of American multinationals. The text discusses possible business tax reforms, including changes to the taxation of American multinationals operating overseas. It also provides an overview of the calculation of the average effective tax rates for corporations."}
{"title": "RS21824", "content": "During debates over the 1998 HEA amendments, campus crimes, particularly drug-related incidents, were a major concern for Congress. Despite a general decrease in campus crime rates, the number of drug-related incidents on campuses was on the rise. Representative Souder highlighted the growing epidemic of drug abuse and proposed student eligibility provisions as a crucial first step in addressing this issue. During debates over the 1998 HEA amendments, campus crimes, particularly drug-related incidents, were a major concern for Congress. Representative Souder proposed student eligibility provisions as an important first step in dealing with the growing epidemic of drug abuse. Congress added a provision to eliminate student eligibility for financial assistance for those convicted of drug-related crimes under P.L. 105-244. The legislation specifies that students convicted of drug offenses are ineligible for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA, with the period of ineligibility determined by the type and recency of the conviction. The legislation specifies that students convicted of drug offenses are ineligible for federal student assistance under Title IV of the HEA based on the type and recency of the conviction. A student becomes indefinitely ineligible if they have more than two convictions for possession or more than one conviction for selling a controlled substance. The period of ineligibility begins on the date of the charge and ends after a specified interval for each offense. According to the legislation, students convicted of drug offenses face ineligibility for federal student assistance based on the type and recency of the conviction. The ineligibility period varies for possession and sale of controlled substances, with indefinite ineligibility for multiple offenses. Convictions prior to turning 18 or overturned convictions are not considered for eligibility determination. A student who is indefinitely ineligible for federal financial assistance must complete a drug rehabilitation program to regain eligibility. The program must meet specific requirements outlined in the regulations. A student who is indefinitely ineligible for federal financial assistance must complete a drug rehabilitation program from a licensed provider. The program must include at least two unannounced drug tests and reduces the ineligibility period based on the number of convictions. Upon completion of a rehabilitation program for any conviction, the student self-certifies completion. Over 180,000 students have been denied federal aid due to this provision, representing less than .25% of applicants. California and Texas have been significantly impacted. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended a provision regarding eligibility for federal student aid based on drug convictions. California and Texas have had a high number of students declared ineligible. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 amended provisions for federal student aid eligibility based on drug convictions. The period of ineligibility depends on the type and recency of the conviction, as well as the number of prior convictions. Legislative proposals are being considered to modify the existing drug conviction provision under Title IV of the HEA. During the 1998 reauthorization discussions, policymakers debated adding a provision to student eligibility requirements due to concerns about drug usage on college campuses. The growing number of drug-related crimes reported by institutions prompted this consideration. During the 1998 reauthorization discussions, policymakers debated adding a provision to student eligibility requirements in response to the increasing number of drug-related crimes reported by institutions. Critics argue that singling out drugs for financial aid eligibility consequences is unfair, while supporters justify it by citing the higher likelihood of drug-related crimes on college campuses. The loss of financial aid eligibility for students convicted of drug-related crimes may be considered during reauthorization. The existing provision does not differentiate between misdemeanor or felony convictions, resulting in a loss of eligibility regardless of jail time served. Separate ineligibility periods and allowable convictions for selling versus possession of controlled substances are also factors to consider. The difference between selling and possession of controlled substances is acknowledged in relation to eligibility for student aid after drug convictions. Congress may also discuss the impact of felony versus misdemeanor drug convictions on aid eligibility."}

Analysts and officials believe that using data more effectively in acquisition decision-making could save billions, allocate resources efficiently, and improve military operations. The National Defense Industrial Association emphasized data as a critical step in reforming defense acquisitions. The Defense Industrial Association emphasized the importance of data in improving defense acquisitions. Congress has taken various steps to enhance DOD's efficiency, including requiring auditability and incorporating acquisition reform provisions in legislation. Congress may consider increasing oversight and enabling DOD to conduct more effective data analysis. The report focuses on how DOD uses data for decision-making in defense acquisitions. It also discusses critical elements for improving data usage, recent efforts to enhance data utilization, and potential questions for Congress. Related CRS reports are mentioned for further context. In light of advances in information technology, data analysis is crucial for informed policy decisions and managing government programs. Sufficient data allows decisionmakers to measure program effectiveness, inform policy decisions, and provide transparency. A lack of data can lead to incorrect conclusions. The importance of data analysis for informed policy decisions and managing government programs is highlighted. Insufficient data can lead to incorrect conclusions, resulting in wastage of resources and ineffective government programs or military operations. Reports have shown instances where lack of data access and tracking led to excess inventories and wasted taxpayer dollars. The Army's audit readiness was at risk due to unreliable data in the appropriations status report. Mismanagement of the supply chain in Afghanistan hampered distribution of supplies and equipment to the warfighter, affecting operations. DOD lacked consolidated databases to track money spent on reconstruction and contracting in Afghanistan after almost 10 years of war. Despite the lack of data tracking money spent on contracting in Afghanistan, government officials and analysts agree that the Department of Defense (DOD) does not effectively use data in decision-making. Major policy decisions, such as economic development programs and weapon system choices, are often made without substantive data, leading to decisions based on assumptions rather than concrete information. Retired Air Force General Norman Schwartz highlighted the importance of incorporating relevant data in program reviews for measuring success. In the private sector, decisions are data-driven, which also applies in government settings. Congress passed the DATA Act in 2014 to improve government operations by establishing data standards for financial transparency. The DATA Act, passed in 2014, aims to establish Government-wide data standards for financial data and improve the quality of data submitted to USASpending.gov. Senator John McCain highlighted the importance of accurate data for addressing management problems, particularly within the Department of Defense. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates emphasized the need for basic data to understand and diagnose issues. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates highlighted the challenges of obtaining accurate information within the Department of Defense, leading to inefficiency, wasted resources, and harm to national security. This lack of data hinders the ability to measure the results of national security policies, assess military priorities, and make informed decisions. The Department of Defense faces challenges in using data effectively, including the lack of information systems, comprehensive and accurate data, and data-informed decision-making. The Joint Staff, for example, lacked a database to manage weapon system portfolios, hindering their ability to make informed decisions. The lack of a database for managing weapon system portfolios hinders decision-making for multibillion dollar programs. Manual processes are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to errors, preventing leaders from fully utilizing valuable program information. A system, if it exists, should be capable of providing authoritative and searchable information sources. The Department of Defense (DOD) faces challenges with its financial management systems, which have been found to be fundamentally flawed. Despite ongoing efforts to improve these systems, completion is not expected until 2017. Having a single, agreed source for analyzing specific data sets is crucial for effective decision-making within DOD. The Department of Defense (DOD) is working on improving its data systems for analyzing acquisition data. There are concerns about conflicting data in multiple IT systems, leading to calls for better architecture and reliable information. The Department of Defense (DOD) is facing challenges with unreliable and incomplete data in various data sets, including contract obligations, workforce, contractor performance, and costs. The Federal Procurement Data System\u2014Next Generation (FPDS) and Operations and Support costs highlight the issues with data reliability. FPDS is a crucial database for government-wide procurement information. The FPDS database is a key source of information for the federal government's contracting spending. It is used by Congress, the executive branch, analysts, and the public for decision-making and analysis. Concerns have been raised about the accuracy and reliability of the data in FPDS, with the GAO noting limitations in utility, accuracy, and completeness. The General Services Administration (GSA) is overseeing a significant overhaul of data systems, including FPDS, to improve reliability and usefulness. This multiyear process involves gathering feedback from stakeholders to enhance the information contained in the systems. The General Services Administration is overseeing a major overhaul of data systems, including soliciting feedback to improve data reliability and usability. Upgrades are expected to be implemented in 2017 or 2018. The Department of Defense's tracking of Operations and Support costs was found to be inconsistent and unreliable in 2012, hindering effective oversight. The Department of Defense lacked reliable data to analyze operations and support cost growth for major systems. Incomplete and inconsistently reported O&S data hindered cost analysis and control. DOD components did not consistently track O&S costs against final estimates after systems were fielded. The office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics is working on consistent use of units for calculating O&S costs, but building a data bank will take time. The Department of Defense faces challenges with data access, quality, and availability throughout the acquisition process. Decision-making processes may lack reliable data, leading to policies and decisions driven by perceptions or anecdotal evidence. According to a recent RAND report, there are institutional and cultural barriers to sharing data within the Department of Defense. These barriers include a stovepiped structure that limits visibility and information sharing, as well as bureaucratic incentives to restrict data access. Policy and guidance further exacerbate the issue, resulting in challenges to data sharing that are not solely based on security concerns. The Department of Defense faces challenges in data sharing due to policy restrictions and a conservative bias. Decisionmakers struggle to use existing data effectively, with a lack of personnel capable of complex data analysis. Some senior leaders within DOD are not adept at utilizing data for decision-making. Accuracy and relevance of data are crucial for effective use, but unchecked statistics and slick presentations can hinder this process. Some officials caution against relying on unchecked statistics and slick presentations for decision-making, emphasizing the importance of understanding data limitations. Concerns include avoiding data collection for its own sake and the tendency to gather data without a clear purpose. Some caution against collecting data without a clear purpose, as it may lead to data being gathered for its own sake. There is a need to ensure that the benefit of data analyses outweighs the cost of collecting and analyzing data. Spending two years and $100 million dollars to build an IT system to inform a decision of whether to invest $75 million dollars in a one-time project may be considered a poor use of resources. Some argue that striving for more data can hinder effective analysis, as data do not need to be perfect to be useful. Decisionmakers should focus on whether sufficient data exist to draw reasonable conclusions. When working with data, critical questions to ask include what useful analysis can be developed, how to model correctly, and understanding the uncertainty bounds of the data. Imperfect data can still be useful, and even perfect data may not yield perfect analysis. Cost estimating for large programs is imprecise but can aid in understanding. Estimates for large programs are imprecise but can help decision-makers allocate resources and develop test plans. From FY2007 to FY2013, DOD spent over $80 billion on contracts in Afghanistan, yet accurate tracking data was lacking. This led to uncertainty in determining the amount of money spent in Afghanistan over the past decade. The Department of Defense (DOD) lacked the IT systems to effectively track the amount of money spent on reconstruction and contracting in Afghanistan over the past decade. This hindered the distribution of supplies and equipment to the warfighter, impacting operations and limiting DOD's visibility. The Department of Defense (DOD) faced challenges in tracking spending on reconstruction and contracting in Afghanistan, impacting the distribution of supplies to the warfighter and limiting oversight of the supply chain. Multiple conflicting IT systems in Afghanistan led to wasteful spending and poor data sharing between agencies. The reliability of data in IT systems for reconstruction projects in Afghanistan was questionable, with incomplete and unreliable data often being sent to the central database. Only 14% of records contained all required elements, leading to challenges in tracking spending and distribution of supplies. Data in IT systems for reconstruction projects in Afghanistan was not accurately tracked until 2009, with only about 10% of all data records eventually put into the central database. The error rate of data in the system was approximately 50%, leading to challenges in tracking spending and distribution of supplies.Officials who should have had certain information were not always aware that the data existed due to inexperienced personnel being assigned tasks. Many military and civilian personnel involved in developing COIN contracting strategies were unaware of existing data sources related to contracting in Afghanistan, such as the Central Command quarterly contractor census and FPDS. DOD officials acknowledged data shortcomings and worked to improve reliability. DOD has made progress in identifying data needed for better contract decisions and may leverage existing data systems from Afghanistan for future operations. However, there are significant gaps in data availability and reliability, hindering informed decision-making. Efforts are underway to improve IT systems. The Department of Defense (DOD) is working on improving IT systems and gathering data for policy decisions. Analysts believe that integrating data into the organization's culture is crucial for success. Leadership is seen as key to changing the culture in DOD, with a report by IBM emphasizing the importance of using data for decisions. Leadership support is crucial for a successful analytics program in the Department of Defense. Senior acquisition officials have emphasized the need for a data-informed decision-making process, as seen in initiatives like the annual report Performance of the Defense Acquisitions System. The Department of Defense has been analyzing acquisitions over a 30-year period, with annual reports providing comprehensive data-driven analyses. Senior leadership is pushing for a more data-driven approach to supply chain management, investing billions in IT systems and tools for decision-making. Efforts are also underway to improve data quality within DOD and the federal government. The government is working to improve data quality, with systems like FPDS undergoing overhaul. DOD is enhancing operations and support data consistency. An analytics center was established in 2013 to analyze acquisitions and craft policy using data. The Cost Analysis and Program Evaluation office (CAPE) is working on the CADE project to consolidate historical acquisition data into an online system for decision-makers and cost analysts. The military services are also integrating data into decision-making processes, with the Navy reassessing IT systems to determine necessary data. The Air Force has set up the Air Force IT Business Analytics Office to identify potential cost savings, amounting to over $500 million. Congress has been credited with helping the Department of Defense focus on using data for decision-making. The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act improved DOD's use of data in decision-making by focusing on early acquisition process decisions, strengthening cost estimates, and requiring root cause analysis of cost, schedule, and performance issues. The FY2010 NDAA requires DOD to ensure its financial statements are audit-ready and improve management information accuracy. Auditability aims to enhance awareness and control of business operations for greater efficiency in deploying resources, although success is not guaranteed. To improve data-based decision-making in DOD, success is not guaranteed. Past efforts to enhance efficiency and management have had mixed results, with some successes like the Navy's Air System Command but also failures like the Air Force's cancelled ERP system after spending $1 billion. It will take years for DOD to implement and improve data systems and foster a data-driven decision-making culture. To improve data-based decision-making in DOD, it may take years to affect decisions with data due to sparse historic data. Building a robust historical database is crucial to understand long term trends and avoid knee-jerk reactions to short term events. Former Under Secretary of Defense Robert Hale emphasized promoting efficiency in data systems. Former Under Secretary of Defense Robert Hale emphasizes the importance of promoting efficiency in data systems within the Department of Defense. Congressional action plays a key role in supporting the use of data for decision-making, including allocating resources and passing legislation like the Weapons System Acquisition Reform Act of 2009. Congress should consider further actions to improve defense acquisitions. Congress may need to allocate resources to build analytical capability within the Department of Defense, including investing in IT systems and increasing the capacity of relevant offices. It should consider whether DOD has a clear strategy for data needs and deployment. The Department of Defense (DOD) needs a clear strategy for understanding data needs, deploying technology, and analyzing data. It must assess its in-house capability for data analysis and consider hiring qualified personnel. Building a culture that values data-driven decisions is crucial for effective data utilization throughout the organization. The Department of Defense (DOD) needs a culture that values data-driven decisions and integrates data gathering and analysis into standard routines. Congress could consider legislation to promote data use in decision-making within DOD, examining the organization's culture, incentives, and steps to incorporate data processes. The recent RAND report highlighted inefficiencies in access to acquisition data within the Department of Defense (DOD). Government personnel often face challenges in obtaining timely and relevant data, raising concerns about information security. Congress may question how DOD can balance the benefits of data-sharing for efficiency with the need to protect sensitive information."}

{"title": "RL34130", "content": "The 2008 farm bill expanded on renewable energy policies established in the 2002 farm bill, which was the first to include an energy title. This title authorized funding for research on agriculture-based renewable energy and promoted the adoption of renewable energy systems. Interest in renewable energy has since increased due to rising petroleum prices. The 2008 farm bill, influenced by rising petroleum prices, supported biofuels production, particularly ethanol and biodiesel, as a response to energy import dependence. It provided federal support through tax incentives, loans, grants, and regulatory programs, reflecting the increased role of biofuels mandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The 2008 farm bill reflects the increased role for biofuels mandated by the expansion of the renewable fuels standard (RFS) in EISA. It emphasizes facilitating production of biofuels from cellulosic feedstocks and includes a significant expansion of the overall RFS to 36 billion gallons by 2022. There are carve-outs for biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol, with an implicit cap on corn starch ethanol. This shift towards cellulosic ethanol is driven by concerns about economic and environmental issues associated with corn starch-based ethanol. The increase in corn used for U.S. ethanol production has led to higher prices and competition with petroleum in the marketplace. Ethanol's profitability is influenced by both petroleum and corn prices, with rising petroleum prices driving up demand for ethanol and corn. The \"food versus fuel\" debate intensified during the 2008 farm bill debate as food price inflation accelerated both in the U.S. and globally, highlighting potential problems with replacing gasoline consumption with corn-based ethanol. Several federal programs supporting renewable energy production, including the RFS, are outside the USDA's purview and have legislative origins outside the farm bill. The RFS, federal tax credits, and farm bills have been key legislative measures supporting biofuels production and use. The 2008 farm bill significantly expanded programs for biofuels, building on previous legislation like the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The 2008 farm bill, similar to the 2002 farm bill, includes an energy title (Title IX) focusing on biofuels such as corn starch-based ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, and biodiesel. Research provisions for renewable energy are in Title VII, while tax and trade provisions are in Title XV. The structure of Title IX remains the same as in the Senate-passed version, with 3 sections including 13 new provisions in section 9001. The 2008 farm bill includes 13 new provisions replacing those in the 2002 bill, focusing on biofuels infrastructure and renewable fertilizer. Key provisions involve a new cellulosic ethanol production tax credit, promotion of cellulosic feedstocks production, marketing infrastructure, and refinery development, along with grants and loan guarantees for biofuels research and production. The 2008 farm bill introduces new provisions to support biofuels infrastructure and renewable fertilizer, including incentives for cellulosic ethanol production, feedstock production, market studies, federal procurement of bio-based products, energy efficiency in rural areas, and biodiesel education. It also includes tax credit reductions for corn-based ethanol. The 2008 farm bill energy title provides $1 billion in financial incentives and support to encourage the production of advanced biofuels, mainly cellulosic. Grants and loan guarantees leverage industry investments in new technologies, infrastructure, and cellulosic feedstock production. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) supports dedicated crop and forest cellulosic feedstocks and provides incentives for post-production collection, harvest, storage, and transport. The 2008 farm bill energy title provides financial incentives for advanced biofuels production, including cellulosic ethanol. Programs like the Biorefinery Assistance program and the Agricultural Bioenergy Feedstock and Energy Efficiency Research Initiative support the development of commercial-scale refineries and advanced biofuels research. Cellulosic ethanol is produced from cellulose and hemicellulose. Cellulosic ethanol is produced from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin derived from plants. Various agricultural products like prairie grasses and fast-growing woody crops are viable feedstock for cellulosic ethanol production. Native prairie grasses like switchgrass offer environmental benefits. Cellulosic ethanol, derived from plants like switchgrass, offers environmental benefits over corn-based ethanol. Production is limited, with only a few small refineries starting in 2010. The slow progress has led the EPA to reduce RFS mandates significantly. The 2008 farm bill extends tax credits and tariffs on ethanol, promoting cellulosic ethanol with a producer tax credit of $1.01 per gallon for qualifying feedstocks. The ethanol blender tax credit of $0.51 per gallon was reduced. The ethanol import tariff was reduced to $0.45 per gallon in January 2009 and extended to the end of 2010 by the farm bill. The tariff benefits the U.S. ethanol industry by protecting it from lower-cost imports and offsets the blender tax credit. The Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the ethanol blender tax credit and import tariff until the end of 2011. The tariff exceeds the blender tax credit by nine cents, imposing a punitive duty on imported ethanol. The impact of increased ethanol production on agricultural and rural economies was debated during the farm bill process. The farm bill includes provisions for reports on the impact of ethanol production on the farm economy, environment, and food prices. Studies such as the Comprehensive Study of Biofuels and Biofuels Infrastructure Study will be conducted by various government agencies. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program also requires an assessment of the economic impacts of expanded biomass production on local economies. The 2008 farm bill authorizes over $1 billion in mandatory funding for various programs related to biorefinery expansion and conversion, including the Biorefinery Assistance Program, Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, Rural Energy for America Program, and Biomass Research and Development Act. The 2008 farm bill authorizes over $1 billion in mandatory funding for biorefinery expansion and conversion programs, including the Biorefinery Assistance Program, Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, Rural Energy for America Program, and Biomass Research and Development Act.

Research shows a strong link between diet and health, with diet-related diseases starting early in life. Increased caloric intake is a key factor contributing to the rise in obesity in the United States, where 2/3 of adults are overweight or obese. Obesity also increases the risk of diabetes and heart disease. Over the past 2 decades, there has been a significant increase in meals prepared or eaten outside the home, with a third of calories and almost half of total food dollars spent on restaurant food. Excess saturated fat intake is a major risk factor for obesity-related health problems. The annual cost of obesity in the United States is $117 billion. Excess saturated fat intake is a major risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. Heart disease also leads to disability among working adults and has a significant economic impact, costing $142 billion in healthcare expenditures and lost productivity in 2005. Increased sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure, which can lead to cardiovascular disease, including stroke. The proportion of adults with high blood pressure is 45%. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 requires food manufacturers to provide nutrition information on packaged foods, but restaurant foods are exempt unless a nutrient content or health claim is made. Approximately 75% of adults use food labels on packaged foods, leading to healthier diets. Approximately half of people change their minds about buying food products due to nutrition information on labels. Consumers find it difficult to limit calorie intake at restaurants without nutrition information. Studies show consumers want nutrition information when ordering food to make educated decisions.

{"title": "110_s1199", "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nanotechnology in the Schools Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. Congress finds that nanotechnology is rapidly growing and will benefit society by improving design and manufacturing processes. Nanotechnology is expected to have a positive impact on security, economy, and health in the United States. To maximize these benefits, the US must maintain leadership in the field. To maintain world leadership in nanotechnology, the US faces competition from other nations. Foreign students on temporary visas earned a significant percentage of science and engineering doctorates in 2003, with many intending to return to their home countries after completing their studies.

{"title": "R41612", "content": "The United States has been a major provider of food aid globally for over 55 years, with a historical focus on agricultural development. However, funding for agricultural assistance has decreased from 20% of U.S. official development assistance in 1980 to around 5% in 2007. Critics argue that this decline has reduced the U.S.'s capacity to provide such aid. President Obama made alleviating global hunger a top priority in his inaugural address, especially in response to the global food price crisis of 2007-2008. In 2009, the Obama Administration pledged $3.5 billion over three years for a new global hunger and food security initiative called Feed the Future. Its objectives include promoting agricultural development, increasing food production, and improving food security and nutrition, especially for vulnerable populations like women and children. This initiative is seen as a critical moment in U.S. foreign assistance history, particularly in agriculture development. Some argue for reform of American food aid and foreign assistance, emphasizing the need for innovative approaches with local buy-in and private sector engagement to achieve global food security objectives effectively and sustainably. Congress plays a central role in funding and oversight of agricultural development programs for global food security, involving various U.S. agencies and international organizations. The 112th Congress may consider legislation to authorize and fund aspects of the food security initiative, building on similar efforts in the previous Congress. Bills introduced included provisions to increase support for agricultural development assistance, international agriculture research, and food security safety net assistance. Legislation to revise the authorizing statute for U.S. foreign assistance could also impact the global food security initiative. The 112th Congress may consider legislation to authorize and fund aspects of the food security initiative, building on similar efforts in the previous Congress. The primary objectives of this report are to provide a context for the state of food insecurity in the world, overview the Obama Administration's global hunger and food security initiative, and highlight issues that the 112th Congress may consider in relation to agricultural development and global food security. The global food crisis in 2009 led to over 1 billion people being undernourished, with the number decreasing to 925 million in 2010. The proportion of hungry people increased due to food and economic crises, even before the recent events. According to FAO data, the number of undernourished people globally had been increasing steadily for the past decade. Hunger reduction gains were reversed in Latin America and the Caribbean due to food and economic crises. The recent food and economic crises have reversed the declining trend in the proportion of undernourished people globally, according to the U.N. Secretary General's Millennium Development Goals report. Progress in meeting the goals of reducing hunger, alleviating poverty, and improving health for the world's poor has slowed as a result. The global trend of reducing hunger, alleviating poverty, and improving health for the world's poor has slowed or reversed. The majority of undernourished people are in developing countries, with significant numbers in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Near East, North Africa, and developed countries. The 2010 hunger report showed a 9.6% decline from 2009, with the most significant reduction in Asia. In 2010, there was a decrease in the number of people going hungry compared to 2009. Sub-Saharan Africa had a smaller drop, with about 12 million still undernourished. The Global Health Index (GHI) for 2010 showed improvement from 1990 to 2010, with the score falling from 19.8 to 15.1. Two-thirds of the world's undernourished population live in seven countries. The GHI score decreased in sub-Saharan Africa by 14%, in South Asia by 25%, and in the Near East and North Africa by 33%. Southeast Asia and Latin America saw a significant decrease of over 40% in GHI scores. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest regional GHI scores, but South Asia has made more progress since 1990. The causes of hunger in these regions differ, with factors like low nutritional, educational, and social status of women contributing in South Asia. In Asia, low nutritional, educational, and social status of women contribute to high prevalence of underweight children under five. In sub-Saharan Africa, factors like low government effectiveness, conflict, political instability, and high rates of HIV and AIDS lead to high child mortality. Most countries with high GHI scores are in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where progress in reducing the GHI has been slower compared to Latin America. Many countries have reduced their Global Hunger Index (GHI) scores by 50% or more in the past few decades. One-third of countries made modest progress, reducing their GHI scores by 25% to 49.9%, while another third decreased their scores by 0% to 24.9%. However, nine countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, saw an increase in their GHI scores, with The Democratic Republic of Congo experiencing a more than 65% increase due to conflict and political instability. Swaziland's high prevalence of HIV and AIDS, along with inequality, has also impacted food security. The prevalence of HIV and AIDS, along with high inequality, has negatively affected food security despite higher national incomes. In the Gambia, undernourishment increased due to lower social protection spending for vulnerable households. In Zimbabwe, economic collapse has led to more underweight children and child mortality. Some countries like Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Vietnam have made significant progress in improving their Global Hunger Index scores between 1990 and 2010. Ghana stands out as the only country in sub-Saharan Africa to show notable improvement. Ghana was the only country in sub-Saharan Africa among the top performers in improving their Global Hunger Index (GHI) score since 1990. President Obama pledged $3.5 billion over three years for global agricultural development and food security at the G8 Summit in Italy. The Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security was launched to combat hunger and poverty. The G8 summit established a goal of mobilizing $20 billion over three years for Agriculture and Food Security to combat hunger and poverty. The initiative focuses on promoting sustainable production, productivity, and rural economic growth through five principles including supporting comprehensive strategies and improving coordination among donors. The G8 leaders pledged sustainable funding to enhance world production capacity and reverse the trend of decreasing official development assistance for agriculture. The initiative aims to support country and regional agricultural strategies through country-led efforts. The Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) guides the implementation of country and regional agricultural strategies through country-led coordination processes. Developing and donor countries, along with multilateral and bilateral development institutions, have committed to reforming the way development aid is given and spent. In sub-Saharan Africa, the G8 has agreed to support comprehensive efforts for sustainable funding to enhance world production capacity. The G8 in sub-Saharan Africa supports the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) to target resources for food security, nutrition, and increasing smallholder farmers' incomes. CAADP aims to raise agricultural productivity by 6% annually and increase public investment in agriculture to 10% of national budgets per year. The L'Aqulia declaration leverages the Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) of the U.N. High Level Task Force on Global Food Security Crisis, focusing on immediate needs of vulnerable populations and longer-term global food security. The CFA proposes enhancing emergency food assistance, boosting smallholder farmer food production, and increasing public investment in agriculture to 10% of national budgets per year. The Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) focuses on nutrition interventions, safety nets, boosting smallholder farmer food production, adjusting trade and tax policies, and managing the macroeconomic situation. For long-term food security, it calls for expanding social protection systems, sustaining smallholder farmer-led food availability growth, improving international food market accessibility, and developing an international biofuels consensus. The G20 Summit in 2009 endorsed the L'Aquila food security initiative and proposed the establishment of a World Bank Food Security Trust Fund for agricultural productivity investments. At the G20 Summit in 2009, countries pledged $22 billion to support the Global Partnership for agricultural productivity. The United States collaborated with private sector actors for food security efforts. FAO convened a World Summit on Food Security in Rome with 60 heads of state and government. At the World Summit on Food Security in Rome, 60 heads of state and government endorsed the Global Partnership to reduce hunger by half by 2015. FAO reported the need for a 70% increase in agricultural output to feed a population of over 9 billion by 2050. The U.S. State Department led the global hunger and food security initiative. The Administration's global hunger and food security initiative, led by the U.S. State Department, issued a Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative Consultation Document outlining priorities and strategy. In May 2010, the initiative was officially launched as \"Feed the Future\" (FtF) Initiative, with a new guiding strategy document and implementation documents released by the State Department. The FtF strategy guide was developed through a consultative process within the U.S. government and with the global community. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative, led by the U.S. State Department, collaborates with various stakeholders to promote sustainable food security. It is based on principles established at L'Aquila and focuses on gender, environment, and climate change. The initiative aims to accelerate inclusive agriculture sector growth and improve nutritional status in specific countries. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative, led by the U.S. State Department, focuses on interventions to improve agricultural productivity, expand markets, develop policies, and infrastructure for smallholder farmers. Progress will be measured through changes in agricultural production and income levels of farmers in rural areas. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative, driven by country-owned plans, aims to improve income levels of men and women farmers in rural areas. It also focuses on strengthening links between agriculture and nutrition outcomes, coordinating with governments and partners to implement country-specific nutrition strategies. Progress in nutrition improvement will be measured through changes in prevalence. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative aims to measure progress in nutrition improvement through changes in stunted and wasted children, and underweight women. It includes investments in regional programs, the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, partnerships with countries like Brazil, India, and China, and global research and innovation. FtF does not explicitly include traditional U.S. food aid funding but emphasizes the U.S.'s commitment to providing emergency and humanitarian food assistance. The Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative focuses on providing emergency and humanitarian food assistance in 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. These countries were selected based on criteria such as chronic hunger, potential for agricultural-led growth, regional synergies, host government commitment, and resource availability. FtF investments will occur in two phases depending on the country's needs. Phase 1 countries are preparing their country investment plans (CIPs) with assistance in capacity-building, technical support, stakeholder consultations, and policy improvement. Phase 2 countries have completed CIPs outlining priority areas, financial projections, targets, and desired results. The Phase 2 countries have completed their country investment plans (CIPs) which include financial projections, defined targets, desired results, beneficiary analysis, gender assessment, technical feasibility, and implementation plan. They must also commit their own resources and establish a policy environment for agricultural development and improved nutrition. Additionally, partnerships with selected countries and stakeholders will assist in developing and implementing CIPs. The Administration's FY2011 budget request includes $1.64 billion for FtF activities, which is about 3% of the total international affairs budget. The FY2011 request for FtF by country is given in Table 3. The U.S. State Department notes that $200 million for nutrition activities funded through the GHCS account are part of the food security effort. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for the Feed the Future initiative is 40% higher than the estimated FY2010 allocation, with a significant portion going towards a new multilateral trust fund for global food security at the World Bank. The FY2010 estimate does not include Haiti-related supplemental appropriations, which focus on emergency food aid and debt cancellation, not covered under Feed the Future. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for Feed the Future includes only a portion of foreign assistance for food and agriculture activities. Additionally, there is a separate request for $4.2 billion for humanitarian and emergency assistance, with a significant portion allocated to food security and agricultural development programs. During the 111th Congress, there was a push to reform U.S. foreign aid to better address national security challenges and development needs. Criticisms included inefficiency and lack of alignment with national interests. The Obama Administration attempted to address these issues through potential reforms. The Obama Administration attempted to address issues with foreign aid through potential reforms, including the launch of the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) in 2009. Led by the Secretary of State, the QDDR aimed to develop a whole-of-government approach to U.S. development policy. Despite delays, Secretary Clinton released the findings in a strategy document titled \"Leading Through\" in 2010. The QDDR, released in December 2010, outlined a strategy to enhance American civilian power in partnership with the military. It established foreign policy and development objectives, recommended strategies to achieve them, and proposed organizational reforms. Additionally, the Administration launched the Presidential Study Directive on Global Development Policy (PSD-7) in August 2009. The PSD-7, initiated in August 2009, authorized a U.S. government-wide review of global development policy to determine the roles and advantages of various agencies. Led by key officials, the review aims to enhance the effectiveness of U.S. development policy. Key NSC staff are involved in the process. The PSD-7 review, initiated in August 2009, prioritizes economic growth and democratic governance in U.S. foreign policy. The draft of PSD-7 titled \"A New Way Forward on Global Development\" emphasizes the importance of development as a key pillar. The Administration's approach is widely discussed in the development community, with the QDDR expected to contribute to the PSD by assessing broader interagency coordination. The PSD-7 review, initiated in August 2009, prioritizes economic growth and democratic governance in U.S. foreign policy. President Obama announced a new Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development in 2010, emphasizing the importance of development as a core pillar of American power. The completion of the PSD-7 process has been delayed, with uncertainty on whether final outputs will be publicly released. Global Food Security is highlighted in the President's Policy Directive, along with Climate Change and Global Health. The directive states that the national security staff will coordinate the interagency in implementing the Presidential Policy Directive. In November 2010, the USAID Administrator announced the establishment of a new Bureau for Food Security (BFS) at USAID, responsible for driving food security efforts and leading a whole-of-government effort to implement President Obama's Feed the Future initiative. The Bureau for Food Security (BFS) at USAID will coordinate interagency efforts to implement President Obama's Feed the Future initiative, expanding partnerships with the private sector and NGOs. The 112th Congress may face issues regarding agricultural development, global food security, and U.S. foreign aid reform, with a pledge of $3.5 billion over three years to support the Global Agriculture and Food Security Partnership. Congress is considering FY2011 appropriations for agricultural development and food security within the Feed the Future Initiative. The House bill included $1 billion for food security and agricultural development, 38% less than the Administration request. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a FY2011 State-Foreign Operations funding bill with $54.22 billion, $2.61 billion below the Administration's request. The bill included $1.3 billion for food security and agriculture development programs, $344 million less than the Administration's request. No regular appropriations bills for FY2011 were enacted, and funding for the federal government was done through continuing resolutions. The federal government's funding has been extended through continuing resolutions, with the latest one (P.L. 111-322) continuing funding at FY2010 levels until March 4, 2011. There may be further debate on funding priorities for food security and agricultural development due to the current fiscal situation and changes in congressional leadership. The G8's commitment to the Global Partnership, totaling $22 billion over three years, is met with skepticism in the international community. The G8's pledge to the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program Trust Fund is doubted by the international community due to the shortfall in funds received compared to the total pledged amount. Concerns have been raised about the lack of strong leadership at USAID for global development efforts. The Obama Administration faced criticism for delays in appointing key positions at USAID, leading to a leadership vacuum. This allowed other federal agencies to take on a larger role in development activities typically overseen by USAID. Some critics question the effectiveness of USAID's development approach, suggesting it is divided among different federal agencies and may undermine USAID's authority and resources. Concerns have been raised by senior government officials about the decline in staff capacity at USAID over the past few decades. Secretary Gates highlighted the imbalance and inadequate capacity in the United States' national security apparatus, attributing it to the consequences of the 1990s when key instruments of U.S. power abroad were neglected. This included the freezing of new Foreign Service officer hires by the State Department and the decline in staff capacity at USAID. The U.S. Agency for International Development has seen a significant decrease in permanent staff members, with only 3,000 today compared to 15,000 during the Vietnam War. Testimony revealed that USAID had 2,000 permanent foreign officers in 1980, which dropped to about 1,000 by 2008. Currently, in 2008, USAID only has two engineers, 16 agriculture experts, and 17 education experts. Staff cuts have impacted USAID's effectiveness on the ground. The decrease in staff capacity at USAID has led to the closure of overseas missions and a shift towards contracting out foreign aid programs. This change has resulted in less coherence, effectiveness, flexibility, and leverage with other funders. USAID struggles with managing numerous small projects in agricultural development. USAID has hired additional agriculture foreign-service officers to address staff shortages in managing its agricultural development portfolio. The U.S. government collaborated with land-grant universities in the 1950s and 1960s to create counterpart institutions in developing countries. In 1975, the Title XII amendment was passed to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Since the 1990s, USAID's role in capacity building has declined, with a significant decrease in post-graduate training support. Support for agricultural research has also been reduced, leading to weaker institutional capacity. USAID has acknowledged the importance of long-term institutional building for aid effectiveness, but funding for training and capacity-building programs, especially in agriculture, has not been restored. Questions remain about the institutional capacity in both the United States and developing countries. Some have noted the weak scientific foundation for modern agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa and the reluctance of African governments and donors to invest in science, technology, and training for increased agricultural productivity. Various U.S. agencies, including USAID, the State Department, and USDA, are involved in formulating and implementing agricultural development and food security assistance programs. The key U.S. agencies involved in agricultural development and food security assistance include USAID, State Department, USDA, MCC, Treasury Department, and USTR. Interagency coordination is crucial in providing assistance, as noted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. The Chicago Council recommended creating an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture within the Executive Office of the President to provide leadership and maintain consistent priorities among U.S. government agencies. The Government Accountability Office highlighted coordination issues between USDA, USAID, and MCC in providing food and development aid. The Feed the Future initiative aims to improve U.S. food security efforts through a \"whole-of-government\" approach. Some see it as a chance to enhance interagency coordination, while others see fragmentation as a constraint. USAID is designated as the lead implementation agency, but coordination with other government entities is still unclear. Funding implications of this approach are also uncertain. The Administration has not clearly articulated the funding implications of a whole of government approach. Bills in the 111th Congress aimed to enhance the U.S. role in addressing global hunger through interagency coordination. The need for coordination was recognized in the late 1990s to harmonize strategies and activities among donors and aid agencies. The priority of these issues in the 112th Congress remains uncertain. The United States works with other countries to harmonize international aid strategies and activities. It coordinates with donors like Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union. The US also leads discussions within international bodies like the United Nations and the OECD's Development Assistance Committee. Global summits, such as those in Rome, Paris, and Accra, play a key role in donor coordination. Global summits in Rome, Paris, and Accra have been crucial for donor coordination, setting development goals, and creating new aid mechanisms. Donors aim to increase aid predictability and flexibility, aligning with other countries to support recipient countries' needs. This has implications for U.S. bilateral assistance, including USAID's involvement in African agriculture. The Administration's global food security initiative endorses principles from U.N-sponsored forums like the Accra Agenda for Action. Some believe aid reform is progressing too slowly, while others argue for U.S. independence from other donors. The Feed the Future Guide emphasizes country-led planning for foreign assistance activities to ensure country ownership and sustainability of impacts. Some Members of Congress are concerned that this approach diminishes donor control and oversight, while others worry about developing countries lacking capacity for strategic planning. Some countries lack capacity for robust strategic plans and accountability measures required by donors. Concerns exist that country-led planning may become government-led, excluding civil society and private sector actors. Coordination of U.S. food aid with Feed the Future is not mentioned, despite Food for Peace Title II aid being a significant component of U.S. food security assistance. Title II food aid is a significant component of U.S. food security assistance, with the Administration's FY2011 request including $1.69 billion for Food for Peace Title II food aid. The United States is implementing U.S. food aid programs in the 20 Feed the Future focus countries. Key questions include how U.S. commodity food aid will be coordinated with Feed the Future activities at the country level and if food aid will reinforce the objectives of Feed the Future. Additionally, the Feed the Future strategy emphasizes cross-cutting initiatives such as gender and global health. The Feed the Future strategy emphasizes cross-cutting initiatives such as gender, global health, environmental sustainability, and climate change. However, it is unclear how these issues will be integrated into country plans, the resources needed, progress tracking metrics, and coordination with other USG initiatives. The Administration is working on components of the FtF results framework and key indicators for progress. It is unclear which agency will be responsible for monitoring progress and when results will be realized. It is also uncertain if FtF will achieve MDG1 in the 20 countries and how often Congress will receive updates."}

{"title": "rJfW5oA5KQ", "content": "Recent works have shown that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) suffer from lack of diversity or mode collapse, as powerful discriminators cause overfitting while weak discriminators cannot detect mode collapse (Arora et al., 2017a). In contrast to previous findings on GANs, this paper demonstrates that GANs can learn distributions in Wasserstein distance or KL-divergence with polynomial sample complexity by using discriminators with strong distinguishing power against specific generator classes. Discriminators are designed for various generator classes, such as mixture of Gaussians and neural networks, to approximate the Wasserstein distance and/or KL-divergence. The paper shows that GANs can learn distributions in Wasserstein distance or KL-divergence with polynomial sample complexity using discriminators designed for specific generator classes. Preliminary experiments suggest that the lack of diversity in GANs may be due to sub-optimality in optimization rather than statistical inefficiency. Various ideas have been proposed to improve the quality of learned distributions and training stability in GANs, but concerns about mode collapse and lack of diversity persist. The paper discusses how mode collapse in GANs can be alleviated by designing discriminators with strong distinguishing power against specific families of generators, focusing on the Wasserstein GAN formulation. The F-Integral Probability Metric is defined to measure the difference between distributions. Wasserstein GAN aims to learn data distribution p by setting up generators G and discriminators F. The objective is to solve for the Wasserstein-1 distance when F consists of all 1-Lipschitz functions. Parametric families like neural networks are used to approximate Lipschitz functions for empirical optimization via gradient-based algorithms. One main concern with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is \"mode collapse,\" where the learned distribution generates high-quality but low-diversity examples. This issue arises from the weakness of the Integral Probability Metric (IPM) compared to the Wasserstein-1 distance. The problem occurs when a distribution q can fool IPM but not Wasserstein-1, leading to mode-dropped distributions. The weakness of the Integral Probability Metric (IPM) compared to the Wasserstein-1 distance leads to mode collapse in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Increasing the strength of the discriminator to larger families like all 1-Lipschitz functions is a proposed solution, but the Wasserstein-1 distance may not have good generalization properties according to Arora et al. (2017a). The lack of diversity in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a dilemma due to powerful discriminators causing overfitting and weak discriminators leading to diversity issues. Empirical observations show that even when learning succeeds, it cannot be inferred from the empirical version of the Wasserstein distance. This paper proposes a solution to the lack of diversity in Generative Adversarial Networks by designing a strong discriminator class F against a specific generator class G. The discriminator class F has restricted approximability with respect to G and the data distribution p, distinguishing them approximately as well as all 1-Lipschitz functions can. The focus is on monotone nonnegative functions \u03b3 L (t) = t \u03b1 with 1 \u2264 \u03b1. The paper focuses on designing a discriminator class F with restricted approximability against a generator class G to approximate the Wasserstein distance W 1 for data distribution p and any q \u2208 G. The framework allows for both realizable and non-realizable cases. The framework allows for non-realizable cases by designing a discriminator class F with restricted approximability to avoid mode collapse and transition from population-level guarantees to empirical-level guarantees. This resolves the dilemma by relating capacity bounds to Wasserstein distances. The complexity of F relates W F (p, q) to W F (p n ,q m ). By expanding on eq. (5), we can understand the statistical properties of Wasserstein GANs. The inequalities address diversity, generalization, and the reverse guarantee. This is the first theoretical framework for GANs with polynomial samples, focusing on statistical theory. The paper focuses on developing techniques for designing discriminator class F with restricted approximability for various generator classes, including simple classes like mixtures of Gaussians and more complex classes like distributions generated by invertible neural networks. Properly chosen F provides diversity guarantees such as inequalities eq. (5) for Gaussian distributions and exponential families. In Section 4, the paper explores distributions generated by invertible neural networks. Special neural network discriminators with an extra layer compared to the generator ensure restricted approximability, leading to diverse modes and exponential growth. The invertibility assumption in distributions generated by invertible neural networks produces distributions supported on the entire space. However, natural images are believed to reside on a low-dimensional manifold, leading to challenges in matching distributions with Lebesgue measure-zero support. The KL-divergence plays a crucial role in the invertible case, but can result in infinity if the support of the estimated distribution does not coincide with the support of the original distribution. The paper focuses on approximating Wasserstein distance by IPMs for generators with low-dimensional supports, showing the advantage of GANs over MLE in learning distributions with low-dimensional supports. The main proof technique involves developing tools for approximating the log-density of a distribution. The paper develops tools for approximating the log-density of a smoothed neural network generator to measure diversity and quality of learned distributions. It suggests using the IPM as an alternative when KL-divergence or Wasserstein distance is not measurable in complex settings. The paper introduces tools for approximating the log-density of a neural network generator to assess diversity and quality of learned distributions. It highlights the challenge of optimizing GANs on real datasets and suggests that sub-optimality of the optimization process may limit diversity in experiments. Various empirical tests have been developed to assess diversity, memorization, and generalization in GANs, indicating that lack of diversity is a common issue. Arora et al. (2017a; b) formalized theoretical sources of mode collapse from a weak discriminator, demonstrating this phenomenon convincingly. Various architectures and algorithms have been proposed to address mode collapse in GANs, with varying success. While some solutions have shown guarantees for training GANs with specific conditions, there are no provable solutions for more general cases. Zhang et al. (2017) demonstrated that the IPM is a proper metric under certain conditions, offering insights into addressing this issue. Our work provides statistical guarantees in Wasserstein distance for distributions like injective neural network generators, which do not have proper density. Liang (2017) discusses GANs in a non-parametric setup, highlighting that the sample complexity for learning GANs improves with the smoothness of the generator family. The sample complexity for learning GANs improves with the smoothness of the generator family. The rate derived is non-parametric and exponential in dimension unless the Fourier spectrum decays extremely fast. Invertible generator structure used in Flow-GAN observes that GAN training increases KL on real dataset. Successful GAN training implies learning in KL-divergence when data distribution can be generated by an invertible neural net. Our theory suggests that real data cannot be generated by an invertible neural network. If data can be generated by an injective neural network, we can bound the closeness between learned and true distribution in Wasserstein distance. The notion of IPM includes statistical distances like TV and Wasserstein-1 distance. The F-IPM, or neural net IPM, involves distances between distributions like KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance. The Rademacher complexity of a function class is defined using empirical distributions of i.i.d. samples. The Rademacher complexity of a function class is defined using empirical distributions of i.i.d. samples. The training IPM loss for the Wasserstein GAN is governed by the quantity R n (F, G), which determines generalization. Neural networks with ReLU activation can distinguish Gaussian distributions with restricted approximability guarantees. The discriminators consider Gaussian distributions with bounded mean and well-conditioned covariance. The IPM induced by these discriminators has restricted approximability. The IPM induced by discriminators for neural networks with ReLU activation has restricted approximability w.r.t. Gaussian distributions in G. The upper and lower bounds differ by a factor of 1/ \u221a d, which is not improvable without using more sophisticated functions than Lipschitz functions of one-dimensional projections of x. Linear combinations of sufficient statistics in exponential families can serve as discriminators with restricted approximability. The proof for this result is deferred to Appendix C. Linear discriminators in exponential families are defined by a family of linear functionals over features. If the log partition function satisfies certain conditions, then the discriminators have a complexity bound. The assumptions require the curvature to have specific bounds. The Fisher information matrix has bounds, with geometric assumptions needed for the Wasserstein distance. The proof of eq. FORMULA15 is straightforward, while eq. (8) requires further development in Section 4. Discriminators with restricted approximability for neural net generators are designed in this section. In Section 4.1, invertible neural networks generators with proper densities are considered. Section 4.2 extends the results to injective neural networks generators, allowing latent variables of lower dimension than observable dimensions. Generators parameterized by invertible neural networks are discussed in this section. The text discusses invertible neural networks with parameters \u03b8 and hidden factors. The variances are non-spherical, allowing each hidden dimension to impact the output distribution differently. The family G consists of standard feedforward nets with invertible layers. The activation function is assumed to be invertible. Assuming parameters as constants, neural networks G \u03b8 are invertible with activation function \u03c3 being twice-differentiable. The hidden factors' standard deviation \u03b3 i \u2208 [\u03b4, 1]. The inverse of the neural net is also a feedforward net with activation \u03c3 \u22121. Smoothed Leaky ReLU satisfies activation function conditions. The activation functions for neural networks must satisfy certain conditions to prevent pseudo-random functions. A neural network with at most + 1 layers and O( d 2 ) parameters can compute log p \u03b8. The family F of neural networks with activation functions of at most + 2 layers contains all functions {log p \u2212 log q : p, q \u2208 G}. The family F of neural networks with activation functions of at most + 2 layers contains all functions {log p \u2212 log q : p, q \u2208 G}. The proof involves the change-of-variable formula and the observation that G \u22121 \u03b8 is a feedforward neural net with layers. The log-det of the Jacobian involves computing the determinant of the weight matrices. The computation for a given G \u03b8 is non-trivial, but it can be simplified by adding a bias on the final output layer. This eliminates the need for structural assumptions on weight matrices. The discriminator class F has restricted approximability with respect to G. The proof of Theorem 4.2 relates the KL divergence to the invertible-generator distributions in G. The proof of Theorem 4.2 connects the KL divergence to the IPM using a lemma that links log densities to discriminators. It outlines a proof sketch and defers the full proof. The discriminator class chosen implements log p \u2212 log q for any p, q \u2208 G, and aims to bound the Wasserstein distance. To establish lower and upper bounds on the Wasserstein distance, transportation inequalities by Bobkov-G\u00f6tze and Gozlan are used. The invertible generator case involves proving that if a function is Lipschitz, then the inequality holds. The upper bound is obtained by bounding the Wasserstein distance. The upper bound on the Wasserstein distance is achieved by either using a truncation argument to get a W 1 bound or a W 2 bound that requires the Lipschitz constant to grow linearly in x 2. This is an extension of a previous result. If training is successful with small expected IPM, the estimated distribution q is close to the true distribution p. The training process aims to minimize the expected IPM between the estimated distribution q and the true distribution p. Efficient algorithms are needed to achieve a small training error, which remains an open question for future work. In this section, injective neural network generators are discussed for generating distributions on a low dimensional manifold, which is more realistic for modeling real images. A novel divergence between distributions is designed, sandwiched by Wasserstein distance and optimized as IPM. The neural network generators are invertible only on the image of G \u03b8, a k-dimensional manifold in R d. Our key idea is to design a variant of the IPM that approximates the Wasserstein distance by convolving distributions with a Gaussian distribution. The smoothed F-IPM between p, q can be optimized as W F with an additional variable \u03b2. Certain discriminator classes can approximate the Wasserstein distance for distributions generated by neural nets in G. The theorem states that if the discriminator family F has restricted approximability with respect to the generator family G, mode collapse will not occur. The IPM W F (p, q) is bounded by certain conditions. The IPM W F (p, q) is upper and lower bounded by the Wasserstein distance W 1 (p, q) given the restricted approximability in GAN training. Specific discriminator classes are designed to ensure this, with the theory suggesting it holds more generally. Synthetic experiments confirm the theory, showing correlation between IPM and Wasserstein / KL. In experiments, IPM is correlated with Wasserstein distance, indicating optimization difficulty in GAN training rather than statistical inefficiency. In this section, synthetic experiments with WGANs are conducted to train GANs that learn various curves in two dimensions, such as the unit circle and a \"swiss roll\" curve. The IPM is well-correlated with the KL divergence, indicating optimization difficulty in GAN training. The study uses WGANs to train GANs on curves like the unit circle and Swiss roll. The IPM correlates with the KL divergence, showing optimization challenges in GAN training. The Wasserstein distance is used to measure the generator's quality. The ground truth distributions are a unit circle or Swiss roll curve. Standard two-hidden-layer ReLU nets are used as the generator and discriminator. The study uses two-hidden-layer ReLU nets for both the generator and discriminator in WGANs. The generator has an architecture of 2-50-50-2, while the discriminator has an architecture of 2-50-50-1. The RMSProp optimizer is used with a learning rate of 10^-4 for both. Two metrics, neural net IPM W F (p, q) and Wasserstein distance W 1 (p, q), are compared between the ground truth distribution p and the learned distribution q during training. The Wasserstein distance W1 (p, q) is computed on fresh batches using the POT package, providing a good proxy of the true distance. Results show that the learned generator closely matches the ground truth distribution at iteration 10000. The neural net IPM and Wasserstein distance are well correlated, although at iteration 500, the generators have not fully learned the true distributions yet. The first polynomial-in-dimension sample complexity bounds for learning various distributions using GANs with convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance or KL divergence are presented. The analysis technique involves designing discriminators with restricted approximability tailored to the generator class, aiming to prevent mode collapse. The techniques presented aim to extend to other distribution families with tighter sample complexity bounds by designing discriminators with better restricted approximability. The goal is to explore and generalize approximation theory results in the context of GANs, hoping for rich and satisfying outcomes similar to vanilla functional approximation settings. The text discusses the proof of Theorem 3.1 in the context of designing discriminators with restricted approximability for GANs. It focuses on establishing upper and lower bounds for the discriminator family, utilizing the concept of symmetrization and mean distance recovery. The goal is to improve sample complexity bounds for distribution families in GANs. The text discusses the proof of Theorem 3.1 in designing discriminators with restricted approximability for GANs, focusing on establishing upper and lower bounds using symmetrization and mean distance recovery. Neuron distance between two Gaussians is computed, showing that at least one term is greater than a certain value. The supremum quantity is further bounded. The quantity in the supremum is bounded using perturbation bound, resulting in a lower bound with c = 1/(2 \u221a 2\u03c0). The W 2 distance is used to bridge the KL and F-distance for two Gaussian distributions. The text discusses bounding the growth of \u2207 log p 1 (x) 2 for distributions with parameters \u03b8 i = (\u00b5 i , \u03a3 i ) \u2208 \u0398. By using the Rademacher contraction inequality, the right hand side can be directly bounded. This is important for KL bounds in exponential family distributions. The proof of Theorem 3.2 establishes KL bounds for exponential family distributions by utilizing properties of the exponential family and Wasserstein bounds. The Rademacher complexity is computed for generalization purposes. The Rademacher complexity is computed for generalization purposes in the context of learning mixture of k Gaussians using a neural network. The Gaussian concentration result is utilized in the proofs for convenience. The Rademacher complexity is used to show the upper and lower bounds for approximability in learning mixture of k Gaussians with a neural network. The upper bound is proven by demonstrating that each discriminator is D-Lipschitz, while the lower bound is established by considering the regularity properties of the distributions in the Bobkov-Gotze sense. The Gaussian concentration lemma is applied to show that each component is 1-sub-Gaussian, leading to the conclusion that f(X) is at most something. The Rademacher complexity is used to bound the Rademacher process of a neural network with one hidden layer. By showing that each f(X) is 1-sub-Gaussian, it is concluded that X satisfies the Bobkov-Gozlan condition with \u03c3^2 = D^2 + 1. The Rademacher complexity of f \u03b8 for \u03b8 is bounded, and Y \u03b8 is shown to be Lipschitz in \u03b8. The expected supremum over a covering set is then bounded. The expected supremum of the max over a covering set is bounded by the product of each separate covering. For each individual process Y, the term \u03b5 i log is shown to be 1-subGaussian, leading to sub-Gaussian maxima bounds. The text discusses upper bounding f-contrast by Wasserstein, with conditions on distributions p and q, and bounds on the gradient of f. Truncation arguments and dual formulations are used to prove the results. The proof involves a truncation argument and dual formulation to bound f-contrast by Wasserstein distance. It utilizes Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and Lipschitzness of f to establish the result. Additionally, it extends a proposition from a previous study by Polyanskiy & Wu (2016). The W 2 distance is defined by a coupling (X, Y) \u223c \u03c0 where X \u223c P, Y \u223c Q. By taking expectations, we can bound the distance. The inverse of x = G \u03b8 (z) can be computed with a feedforward net. Representing log p \u03b8 (x) with a neural network involves the density \u03c6 \u03b3 of Z \u223c N(0, diag(\u03b3 2)). The inverse network G \u22121 \u03b8 has layers. The inverse network G \u22121 \u03b8 has layers and parameters in each layer, with \u03c3 \u22121 as the activation function. By adding branches, the log determinant of the Jacobian can also be computed recursively. By adding branches from each layer of the inverse network and using the log \u03c3 \u22121 activation, we can compute log p \u03b8 (x) with no more than + 1 layers and O( d 2 ) parameters. This is achieved by combining the output of the density branch and the log determinant branch. Additionally, a restricted approximability bound in terms of the W 2 distance is stated and proven. The text discusses the Gozlan condition being satisfied for a random variable, showing that the mapping is Lipschitz and sub-Gaussian. Theorem D.1 is applied to show the relationship between different parameters. The text discusses upper bounding the Lipschitzness of log p \u03b8 (x) for all \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398 by considering the Wasserstein distances and the Lipschitz property of the inverse network. The text discusses upper bounding the Lipschitzness of log p \u03b8 (x) for all \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398 by considering the Wasserstein distances and the Lipschitz property of the inverse network. In term II, h is C-Lipschitz in x, leading to a bound under p \u03b81 or p \u03b82. Applying Theorem D.2(c) yields a result. The W 1 bound is also considered, with a tail bound derived for X 2 \u2264 D. By choosing D = K \u221a d, a tail bound is obtained. The bound for | log p \u03b8 (x)| is also discussed under p \u03b81 or p \u03b82. The text discusses reparametrizing the log-density neural network F \u03b8 (x) = log p \u03b8 (x) to represent weights and biases of the inverse network. The reparametrized \u03b8 belongs to a certain set, and the Rademacher complexity of F is bounded. An additional re-parametrization is done, and the constant C(\u03b8) is defined. The constant C(\u03b8) is defined as the sum of the normalizing constant for Gaussian density and the sum of log det(W i ). A parameter K is created for this term. The metric DISPLAYFORM13 is defined for any reparametrized \u03b8. The one-step discretization bound is discussed, and two lemmas deal with the terms separately. The constant C(\u03b8) is defined as the sum of the normalizing constant for Gaussian density and the sum of log det(W i ). A parameter K is created for this term. The metric DISPLAYFORM13 is defined for any reparametrized \u03b8. Lemmas D.7 and D.8 are used to bound the generalization error for a finite set of parameters. The bound is derived for \u03b5 \u2264 min {R W , R b } and \u03bb \u2264 \u03bb 0 \u03b4 2 n, with the dominating term being n log n/\u03b4 4. The empirical average over n samples is denoted as Y \u03b8, with |\u03b5 i | \u2264 1. It is shown that for any inverse network G \u22121, the k-th hidden layer is denoted as h k (x). The Lipschitzness of hidden layers is claimed for all k, with bounds shown for eq. FORMULA1 and eq. (27) through induction on k. The Lipschitz property of hidden layers is proven for all layers by induction. Bounds are established for the log \u03c3 \u22121 term and the quadratic term, showing Lipschitzness and tail decay. The random variable is shown to be sub-exponential and sub-Gaussian with mean O(Cd). The curr_chunk discusses the sub-Gaussianity and subexponential properties of certain terms in the context of proving the Lipschitz property of hidden layers. The mean and sub-Gaussianity parameter are O(Cd), and the term h, A \u03b3 h, is shown to be subexponential with a mean bounded by Cd/\u03b4^2. The text discusses the sub-Gaussianity and subexponential properties in proving the Lipschitz property of hidden layers. The mean and sub-Gaussianity parameter are O(Cd), and the term h, A \u03b3 h, is shown to be subexponential with a mean bounded by Cd/\u03b4^2. The covering number of \u0398 is bounded by the product of independent covering numbers, further bounded by the volume argument. Jensen's inequality is used to show that for any \u03bb \u2264 \u03bb 0 \u03b4 2, certain bounds hold. Using Jensen's inequality and bound appendix D.6.2, for any \u03bb \u2264 \u03bb 0 \u03b4 2 n, certain bounds hold. To state the theorem quantitatively, we specify relevant quantities of the generator class. We redefine p \u03b2 \u03b8 as a truncated version of the convolution of p and a Gaussian distribution. The distribution p \u03b2 \u03b8 (x) is obtained by adding Gaussian noise with variance \u03b2 2 to a sample from G \u03b8, and truncating the distribution. The distribution p \u03b2 \u03b8 adds Gaussian noise with variance \u03b2 2 to a sample from G \u03b8 and truncates it to a high-probability region. Regularity conditions are introduced for the family of generators G, including bounds on the partial derivatives of f. The distribution p \u03b2 \u03b8 adds Gaussian noise with variance \u03b2 2 to a sample from G \u03b8 and truncates it to a high-probability region. Regularity conditions are introduced for the family of generators G, including bounds on the partial derivatives of f. Similarly, denoting t(z) := k 3 max |I|=3 (z) and T = max z:z\u2208Dz |t(z)|, with R as an upper bound. The inverse activation function is assumed Lipschitz. The main theorem states that for certain F,d, F approximates the Wasserstein distance. Theorem E.2 states that there exists a family of neural networks F that can approximate the log density of p \u03b2 for every distribution p \u2208 G. The family F has size poly(1/\u03b2, d) and satisfies certain conditions for approximation. Theorem E.2 introduces a family of neural networks F that can approximate the log density of p \u03b2 for any distribution p \u2208 G. The family F, with size poly(1/\u03b2, d), meets specific approximation conditions. The approach to approximating p \u03b2 (x) involves a variant of Laplace's method of integration, with a focus on typical and atypical cases for input x. Theorem E.2 introduces a family of neural networks F that can approximate the log density of p \u03b2 for any distribution p \u2208 G. The family F, with size poly(1/\u03b2, d), meets specific approximation conditions. The approach to approximating p \u03b2 (x) involves a variant of Laplace's method of integration, with a focus on typical and atypical cases for input x. The proof of Theorem E.1 involves neural networks N 1 , N 2 \u2208 F approximating log p \u03b2 and log q \u03b2 respectively, leading to equations that are combined to derive a final result using the Bobkov-G\u00f6tze theorem. The Bobkov-G\u00f6tze theorem is used to prove lower and upper bounds. The optimal coupling C of p, q is considered, along with the induced coupling C z on the latent variable z. The generalization claim follows analogously to Lemma D.5. The proof of Theorem E.2 follows analogously to Lemma D.5, using Lipschitzness bound of generators. The section also includes helper lemmas and proofs by reverse induction. The proof by induction shows that for i = 0, DISPLAYFORM5 holds. By utilizing the Lipschitzness of \u03c3 \u22121, it is shown that DISPLAYFORM6 implies DISPLAYFORM7, leading to DISPLAYFORM8. This further implies DISPLAYFORM9, completing the claim. The neural network's size/Lipschitz constant is analyzed, showing that the smallest eigenvalue is bounded by DISPLAYFORM12. The algorithm presented approximates the integral and can be implemented by a small, Lipschitz network. Parameters are defined, and a discriminator family with restricted approximability for a degenerate manifold is discussed. The smallest eigenvalue is bounded by DISPLAYFORM12. The algorithm approximates the integral using a small, Lipschitz network. Parameters are defined, and a discriminator family with restricted approximability for a degenerate manifold is discussed. The algorithm calculates gradients and matrices to approximate eigenvalues. The algorithm approximates the integral using a small, Lipschitz network and discusses the discriminator family with restricted approximability for a degenerate manifold. Matrices are chosen to approximate eigenvalues, with the existence of matrices that are \u2126(\u03b2)-separated and have bounded norms. The algorithm approximates integrals using a small, Lipschitz network and discusses discriminators with restricted approximability for a degenerate manifold. In synthetic WGAN experiments, invertible neural net generators are used with discriminators designed for restricted approximability. The goal is to demonstrate the computation of KL divergence. The empirical IPM W F (p, q) is well correlated with the KL-divergence between p and q on synthetic data generated from a ground-truth invertible neural net generator. The weight matrices of the layers are well-conditioned with singular values between 0.5 to 2. The discriminator architecture is chosen based on restricted approximability guarantee. The activation function is modeled as a trainable one-hidden-layer neural network. Training involves generating stochastic batches from the ground-truth generator and trained networks with batch size 64. The study involves training a generator using stochastic batches and solving the min-max problem in the Wasserstein GAN formulation. The discriminator is updated 10 times between each generator step with various regularization methods. Evaluation metrics include computing the KL divergence between the true and learned generator's densities. The study evaluates the distributional closeness between the true and learned generator using KL divergence as a criterion. It also considers the training loss (IPM W F train) and the neural net IPM (W F eval) in the Wasserstein GAN formulation. In optimizing the WGAN loss, the generator is fixed while the discriminator is trained from scratch without regularization. The goal is to find the best contrast-maximizing function f \u2208 F through stochastic optimization. The theory suggests that WGAN can learn the true generator in KL divergence, with F-IPM indicating the divergence. The first experiment involves a two-layer net in 10 dimensions. In the first experiment, a two-layer neural net in 10 dimensions is used as the generator. The discriminator is trained with either Vanilla WGAN or WGAN-GP, with results compared from 6 random initializations. WGAN training with a discriminator of restricted approximability can learn the true distribution in KL divergence. The KL divergence in GANs starts around 10-30 and the best run achieves a KL lower than 1, indicating that mode collapse is not happening. The W F (eval) and KL divergence are highly correlated, with adding gradient penalty improving optimization reflected in both curves. W F can be a good metric for monitoring convergence, better than the training loss curve. The estimated IPM in evaluation correlates well with the KL-divergence, indicating that it can be a good metric for monitoring convergence. The inferior performance of the WGAN-Vanilla algorithm in KL divergence does not stem from the statistical properties of GANs but rather from the training performance in terms of IPM convergence. This phenomenon is likely to occur in training GANs with real-life data as well. In this section, the correlation between perturbations of p and its effects is directly tested by comparing KL divergence and neural net IPM on pairs of perturbed generators. The unstable training process for computing neural net IPM is denoised by optimizing the discriminator from 5 random initializations. A clear positive correlation between KL divergence and neural net IPM is shown in FIG6. In FIG6, a positive correlation is observed between symmetric KL divergence and neural net IPM. The majority of points align with the line W F = 100D kl, indicating a linear scaling in KL divergence. Outliers with large KL values are attributed to perturbations causing poor conditioning of weight matrices. Experiments with vanilla fully-connected discriminator nets are redone using a three-layer net with hidden dimensions 50-10. Results from experiments using a three-layer neural net with hidden dimensions 50-10 show that the generators converge well in KL divergence. However, the correlation is slightly weaker compared to the setting with restricted approximability. This suggests that vanilla discriminator structures may be sufficient for obtaining a good generator, although specific designs could enhance the quality of the distance W F. The estimated IPM in evaluation correlates well with the KL-divergence. Correlation between KL and neural net IPM is computed with vanilla fully-connected discriminators and plotted in FIG8. The correlation (0.7489) is roughly the same as for discriminators with restricted approximability (0.7315)."}
{"title": "Hy7fDog0b", "content": "Generative models are useful for modeling complex distributions but current training techniques require fully-observed samples. In scenarios where obtaining full samples is expensive or impossible, learning implicit generative models from partial, noisy observations is more practical. A new method is proposed to train generative models using lossy measurements of samples, showing that the true underlying distribution can be recovered even with per-sample information loss. AmbientGAN is a new method for training Generative Adversarial Networks using measurement models. It shows substantial improvements in qualitative and quantitative results on benchmark datasets. Models trained with AmbientGAN achieve 2-4 times higher inception scores than baselines by passing generator output through a simulated random measurement function for discrimination. This work addresses the challenge of training a generative model with limited data by directly training from noisy or incomplete samples. The framework allows for learning a generative model from various types of measurements, assuming the measurement process is known and meets specific conditions. Our approach, AmbientGAN, trains GANs by distinguishing real measurements from simulated ones of generated images. It effectively constructs generative models from noisy data and low-dimensional projections with significant information loss. Our approach, AmbientGAN, trains GANs by distinguishing real measurements from simulated ones of generated images, leading to drastic per-sample information loss. Theoretical results show that the distribution of measured images uniquely determines the distribution of original images. The distribution of original images in GAN games must match the true distribution for a pure Nash equilibrium. Results are shown for dropout and random projection measurement models. Empirical work explores models without guarantees, presenting results on the celebA dataset with occlusions. Incorporating the measurement process into GAN training improves sample quality when learning from noisy, blurred images. Cleaning up data by inpainting before training a GAN leads to significant artifacts. Our models produce cleaner samples compared to denoising with Wiener deconvolution. Incorporating the measurement process into GAN training improves sample quality. Learning a generative model on 2D images from pairs of 1D projections in the MNIST dataset shows that AmbientGAN recovers underlying structure, but cannot identify distribution up to rotation or reflection. The adversarial framework is powerful for modeling complex data distributions like images, video, and 3D models. Generative models have various applications, including solving inverse problems and making synthetic data more realistic using GANs. The use of GANs in creating realistic synthetic data and translating images between domains has been explored in various studies. Different approaches, such as training generators against discriminators on low-dimensional projections, have shown improvements in stability. Additionally, there are connections to creating 3D object shapes from 2D projections within the AmbientGAN framework. The curr_chunk discusses the use of 2D projections in the AmbientGAN framework for creating synthetic data. It explains the measurement process using weighted sums of voxel occupancies and defines notation for real and generated distributions. The chunk also introduces the concept of lossy measurements performed on samples from a real underlying distribution, parameterized by a stochastic measurement function. The curr_chunk introduces the concept of stochastic measurement functions with parameters having a distribution, allowing for easy sampling and computation of measurements. The goal is to create an implicit generative model of a real distribution using IID realizations from a known distribution. The goal is to create an implicit generative model of a real distribution using stochastic measurement functions and adversarial training. The approach combines the measurement process with the standard GAN framework to learn a generator that approximates the desired distribution without direct access to the objects. The main idea is to simulate random measurements on generated objects and use a discriminator to distinguish real from fake measurements. The discriminator predicts if a measurement is from the real or generated distribution, with a quality function defining the objective. The AmbientGAN objective involves differentiable feedforward neural networks for G and D, allowing for end-to-end differentiability in training similar to standard GAN procedures. Stochastic gradients are computed by sampling Z, \u0398, and Y r in each iteration for parameter updates in G and D through backpropagation. Our approach involves updates to parameters of G and D by backpropagation, compatible with improvements to GAN objective and network architectures. We can incorporate additional information like per sample labels in our framework. Experimental setups include DCGAN, Wasserstein GAN, and Auxiliary Classifier Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty. The measurement models used in our framework are tailored for 2D images. These models include Block-Pixels, where each pixel is independently set to zero with a certain probability, and Convolve+Noise, where measurements are obtained by convolving with a kernel and adding noise. The AmbientGAN framework is versatile and can be applied to various data formats and measurement models. The measurements in the framework involve different operations like setting patches to zero, extracting patches, rotating images, and summing pixels along the vertical axis to obtain measurement vectors. The information about the location of the patch is lost in the process. In the image, measurement vectors are obtained by summing pixels along the vertical axis for each channel. Different measurement functions like PadRotate-Project-\u03b8 and Gaussian-Projection are used, showing the ability to recover the true underlying distribution from observed measurements. The mapping of distributions of samples to measurements is invertible, providing a consistency guarantee with the AmbientGAN training procedure. This lemma discusses the unique probability distribution that induces a given measurement distribution in the vanilla GAN model. The previous lemma discusses the unique probability distribution that induces a given measurement distribution in the vanilla GAN model. The following theorems demonstrate that this assumption holds true under various measurement models, such as Gaussian-Projection, Convolve+Noise, and Block-Pixels, allowing for the recovery of the true underlying distribution with the AmbientGAN framework. The required conditions for these theorems are easily met in common scenarios like Gaussian blurring with additive noise. Theorem 5.4 assumes a finite set of pixel values in images, allowing for consistency and sample complexity results in learning distributions within the AmbientGAN framework. The Block-Pixels measurement model (Section 4) considers the probability of blocking a pixel. If p < 1, a unique distribution can induce the measurement distribution. With optimal discriminator D, any optimal generator G must satisfy a certain condition. Three datasets used in experiments are MNIST, CelebA, and CIFAR-10. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 32 \u00d7 32 RGB images from 10 classes. Different generative models were used for experiments with MNIST, CelebA, and CIFAR-10 datasets. The CIFAR-10 dataset uses an Auxiliary Classifier Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (ACWGANGP) and various discriminator architectures. Different baseline approaches were implemented to evaluate the AmbientGAN framework's performance. The AmbientGAN framework's performance was evaluated using different baseline approaches. One baseline involved creating a generative model directly on measurements to approximate the true distribution, while a stronger baseline considered invertible measurement functions. In the AmbientGAN setting, the measurement functions may not be invertible, and we may not observe \u03b8 i for each measurement y i in the dataset. To address this, an approximate inverse function can be used to \"unmeasure\" the data and obtain an estimate of x i for training a generative model. In the AmbientGAN setting, measurement functions may not be invertible. To address this, approximate inverse functions are used to estimate x i for training a generative model. Different methods are used for obtaining approximate inverse functions for various measurement models. In the AmbientGAN setting, measurement functions may not be invertible. To address this, approximate inverse functions are used to estimate x i for training a generative model. Different methods are used for obtaining approximate inverse functions for various measurement models. For Block-Patch measurements, the Navier Stokes based inpainting method BID2 is used to fill in zero pixels. Inverting Extract-Patch measurements is challenging as the position of the patch is lost. Pad-Rotate-Project-\u03b8 measurements require sampling many angles and using techniques for inverting the Radon transform BID7. In the AmbientGAN setting, measurement functions may not be invertible. Approximate inverse functions are used to estimate x i for training a generative model. Inverting Pad-Rotate-Project measurements is challenging due to the lack of information about \u03b8. Results with AmbientGAN models are reported on a subset of experiments, showing samples generated by baselines and our models. Samples are shown for selected parameter settings, with more results available in the appendix. Results on MNIST are deferred to the appendix. Results on celebA with DCGAN and CIFAR-10 with ACW-GANGP are shown in figures. Baselines struggle to invert the measurement process, producing degraded samples, while our models generate images with good visual quality using Convolve+Noise with Gaussian kernel and IID Gaussian noise. The results for Block-Patch and Keep-Patch measurements on celebA with DCGAN show that our models can create coherent faces by observing only parts of one image at a time. Pad-Rotate-Project and Pad-Rotate-Project-\u03b8 measurement models result in signal degradation, losing most of the information in a sample. Our experiments use two measurements at a time, with the results on MNIST showing that the first model can learn up to rotation and reflection. The model prefers consistent orientation per class for easier learning. The rotation angle in the second measurement model produces upright digits. Despite lesser visual quality, the method can generate digit images from 1D projections. In a failure case on celebA dataset, the model learned a crude outline of a face. The model learned a crude outline of a face with a DCGAN, highlighting the difficulty in learning complex distributions. Inception scores were used to quantify the quality of generative models in the AmbientGAN framework for CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets. The final test set accuracy of the model with two conv+pool layers and two fully connected layers was 99.2%. Different models were trained with varying probabilities of blocking pixels for Block-Pixels measurements on MNIST. Inception scores were computed for each model, showing that AmbientGAN models outperformed baseline models as the probability of blocking pixels increased. For Convolve+Noise measurements on MNIST, models perform well with low noise levels. However, as noise increases, Wiener deconvolution and \"ignore\" baseline deteriorate while AmbientGAN models maintain high scores. Inception scores for 1D projection measurements are reported for AmbientGAN models. The Pad-Rotate-Project model achieves an inception score of 4.18, while the model with Pad-Rotate-Project-\u03b8 measurements scores 8.12. The vanilla GAN model reaches a score of 8.99. The second model trained on 1D projections performs closely to the fully-observed case. In the study, a plot of inception score vs the probability of blocking pixels in the BlockPixels model on CIFAR-10 is shown. The total variation inpainting method was slow and performed similarly to the unmeasure-blur baseline on MNIST. Due to this, inpainting baselines were not run on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The results indicate the superiority of their approach over baselines, as seen in the inception score plotted against training iteration. Generating models typically require a large, high-quality dataset, but the study suggests a way to relax this requirement. The study suggests a way to relax the requirement of a high-quality dataset for generating models by learning from incomplete, noisy measurements. This approach aims to construct new generative models for distributions without high-quality datasets. The vanilla GAN model BID11 shows that if the Discriminator D is optimal, the probability distributions p_gy and p_ry are equal. The underlying distribution p_rx must match all 1D marginals to converge to the true distribution according to the Cramer-Wold theorem BID6. The Convolve+Noise measurement model states that if the support of the Fourier transform of the convolution kernel and noise distribution is empty, then there exists a unique distribution that can induce the measurement distribution. The Convolve+Noise measurement model implies a unique distribution for inducing the measurement distribution, denoted by probability density functions. A bijective map exists between X and Z, with continuous transformations. The pdfs of X and Z are related through a Jacobian function. The pdf of Y, a sum of two random variables, is a convolution of individual pdfs. The reverse map uniquely determines the true underlying distribution from the measurement distribution, concluding the proof. A slightly different version of Theorem 1 is stated for the discrete setting, using indicator functions. Lemma 10.1 discusses the empirical version of the vanilla GAN objective using measurement samples. The optimal discriminator for this objective is defined, and the relationship between the optimal generator and the empirical distribution is explained. The proof involves Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) and replacing the real data distribution with the empirical version. The proof of Theorem 5.4 involves comparing real data distribution with an empirical version using a Block-Pixels measurement model. If the probability of blocking a pixel is less than 1, a unique distribution is guaranteed. A transition matrix is used for random measurement functions on samples from a discrete distribution. The transition matrix A is used for random measurement functions on samples from a discrete distribution. If A is invertible, the distribution p x can be recovered from p y. The sample complexity is determined by the minimum eigenvalue magnitude of A, denoted as \u03bb. The transition matrix A is crucial for random measurement functions on discrete distribution samples. It is used to recover the distribution p x from p y if A is invertible. The sample complexity depends on the minimum eigenvalue magnitude of A, denoted as \u03bb. In the specific case of Block-Pixels measurement, images are divided into classes based on the number of zero pixels. The transition matrix A ensures that images with i pixels must have at least j \u2265 i zero pixels after measurement. The transition matrix for random measurement functions on discrete distribution samples is lower triangular. Each pixel is independently blocked with probability p, resulting in a minimum chance of (1 \u2212 p) n for an image to remain unaffected. Unaffected images have strictly positive diagonal entries in the transition matrix, with a minimum value of (1 \u2212 p) n. The DCGAN model on MNIST uses a noise input with 100 dimensions sampled uniformly on [-1, 1]. The generator has two linear layers and two deconvolutional layers, while the discriminator has two convolutional layers and two linear layers. Labels are concatenated with the inputs at each layer. The WGANGP model on MNIST uses two convolutional layers and two linear layers with batch-norm. The generator takes a 128-dimensional latent vector sampled uniformly on [-1, 1] and applies one linear and three deconvolutional layers. The discriminator has three convolutional layers and one linear layer without batch-norm. The unconditional DCGAN model on celebA uses a 100-dimensional latent vector sampled uniformly on [-1, 1] with one linear layer for the generator. The ACWGANGP model on CIFAR-10 utilizes a 128-dimensional latent vector with coordinates sampled from a standard Gaussian distribution. The generator consists of a linear layer followed by three residual blocks, each containing conditional batch normalization, nonlinearity, and upconvolution layers. In the presented results for various measurement models, the analysis now considers cases where the parameter distribution is only approximately known for the stochastic measurement process. The AmbientGAN approach is shown to be robust to systematic mismatches in parameter distribution for the measurement function, demonstrated through experiments using the Block-Pixels measurement model on the MNIST dataset. After training AmbientGAN models with the dataset, the inception score peaks at p = 0.5 and drops gradually on both sides, indicating robustness to parameter distribution mismatch. The generator learned through AmbientGAN captures the data distribution well and shows potential for compressed sensing applications. Using an AmbientGAN trained with Block-Pixels on MNIST with p = 0.5, we compared reconstruction error vs number of measurements with Lasso. Results show a reduction in measurements using AmbientGAN with corrupted samples over a regular GAN with fully observed samples."}

{"title": "RS21424", "content": "In enacting the CAA of 1970, Congress differentiated between existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. Existing sources were deemed difficult to retrofit with new technology, while new sources were required to install state-of-the-art controls to prevent new pollution problems. States had discretion for existing sources of major air pollutants under the CAA of 1970. The 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act gave EPA the authority to set strict technology-based standards for new sources of air pollutants that may endanger public health or welfare, while states were given discretion for existing sources. This included setting emission ceilings for individual sources and implementing standards in areas cleaner or dirtier than national ambient standards. The Clean Air Act requires new sources of air pollutants to undergo New Source Review (NSR) before construction, with emission limits based on technology standards. The issue of RMRR arises because modifications of existing sources are also subject to NSR and standards. The Clean Air Act mandates New Source Review (NSR) for new stationary sources of air pollutants, with emission limits based on technology standards. The issue of what constitutes a \"modification\" triggering NSR is crucial, as it applies to both new and existing sources. The Clean Air Act mandates New Source Review (NSR) for new stationary sources of air pollutants, with emission limits based on technology standards. The definition of \"modification\" under the CAA determines which changes in a source trigger NSR, focusing on increases in emissions. This definition leaves many questions unanswered regarding what constitutes a physical change or change in the method of operation. The EPA's definition of \"reconstruction\" in the context of the Clean Air Act triggers New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and New Source Review (NSR) when the fixed capital cost of new components exceeds 50% of the cost to build a new facility, and it is feasible to meet NSPS requirements. Litigation has focused on the interpretation of phrases like \"physical change\" and \"change in the method of operation\" in this context. The EPA's definition of \"modification\" under the Clean Air Act includes exceptions for certain changes in a stationary source that are not considered modifications, such as maintenance, repair, and replacement (RMRR). This definition aims to prevent every minor change from triggering heightened pollution-control requirements. The EPA's definition of \"modification\" under the Clean Air Act includes exceptions for RMRR, which are routine maintenance, repair, and replacement activities. EPA regulations previously did not specify the activities included as RMRR, relying on a case-by-case analysis approach. This approach was approved in the WEPCO case, where the company proposed extensive renovation for its generating units. The EPA determined that WEPCO's proposed \"life extension\" program for its generating units required a permit due to triggering NSPS and PSD-area NSR regulations. The Seventh Circuit ruled that the proposal went beyond routine maintenance, repair, and replacement activities, as the extent of the work was substantial and unprecedented. The court found that the work on the plant was substantial and unprecedented, indicating non-routineness due to the project's purpose of \"life extension\" and its high cost. The RMRR exemption has been a focal point recently, with CAA enforcement actions filed against electric utilities for exceeding \"routine maintenance\" without installing NSR controls. President Bush's National Energy Policy Development Group also issued recommendations in May 2001. President Bush's National Energy Policy Development Group recommended a national energy policy in May 2001, leading to EPA's review of NSR impact on investment in new utility and refinery generation capacity. EPA's June 2002 report to the President emphasized the need to specify routine maintenance activities. In December 2002, EPA published final regulations for NSR purposes, including changes in emission increase calculations and other NSR rules amendments. EPA also proposed a rule on the same day. The EPA proposed a rule to clarify the RMRR exception in its NSR rules, specifying activity categories without other considerations. The Eleventh Circuit made a decision in EPA v. Whitman, where the EPA found TVA violated the CAA with rehabilitation projects beyond RMRR. The Eleventh Circuit found that the CAA was unconstitutional in allowing severe penalties for noncompliance with EPA's ACOs without proof in district court, giving TVA freedom to violate ACOs without penalty. This decision did not address the enforcement of the RMRR exception. The October 2003 final rule reshaped the contours of the RMRR exception by declaring certain equipment replacement activities as per se RMRR, providing greater regulatory certainty without sacrificing environmental protection. The new rule specifies that replacing components of a process unit with identical or functional equivalents constitutes RMRR if the cost is less than 20%. EPA is not taking action on the proposed annual maintenance, repair, and replacement allowance at this time. The new rule allows for the replacement of components in a process unit if the cost is less than 20% of the unit's value, without changing its design or emission compliance. This approach expands the circumstances for replacement compared to the previous case-by-case method, which was a source of controversy. The former approach can still be used as an alternative, but the new per se approach with higher thresholds is expected to be more commonly used. The new rule with higher thresholds under the per se approach is expected to reduce the use of the previous case-by-case method for replacement of components in process units. It imposes no recordkeeping requirements, relying on existing business records and EPA's inspection authority for enforcement. The rule only applies to conduct after its effective date and does not serve as a defense in pending CAA enforcement actions. Several states and environmental groups challenge the EPA's equipment-replacement rule, arguing it exceeds the agency's authority under the CAA. The court granted a stay on the rule, citing irreparable harm and likelihood of success for the petitioners. This decision suggests a tough defense for the EPA in the upcoming review. The EPA's equipment-replacement rule has been suspended, with the old case-by-case approach still in effect. The court declined to consolidate the cases but designated the same panel for related cases."}

{"title": "105_s2355", "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Truancy Prevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction Act of 1998\". Congress finds that truancy is a significant indicator of a young person's struggles, leading to school dropouts and increased likelihood of welfare dependence, unemployment, and criminal behavior. High rates of truancy are associated with high daytime burglary and vandalism rates. Up to 44 percent of violent juvenile crimes occur during school hours, and 75 percent of children aged 13-16 who are arrested for crimes are truants. Some cities report 70 percent of daily student absences are unexcused, with up to 4,000 absences per day in a single city. The social and economic costs of truancy are significant, with only 34 percent of inmates completing high school and 17 percent of youth under 18 entering the criminal justice system. Truancy among youth is linked to high rates of daytime crime, with a significant portion of juvenile crimes occurring during school hours. The social and economic costs of truancy are substantial, with a large percentage of inmates and youth in the criminal justice system having not completed high school. Effective truancy prevention and intervention programs can improve school attendance and reduce crime rates. Effective truancy prevention programs can reduce daytime crime rates by addressing the lack of targeted funding in current law. SEC. 3. GRANTS. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like \"eligible partnership,\" \"local educational agency,\" and \"qualified unit of local government.\" The term \"unit of local government\" refers to various political subdivisions of a State or Indian tribe. The Attorney General, in consultation with the government, has the authority to grant under specific conditions. The Attorney General, with the Secretary of Education, grants competitive funds to partnerships to reduce truancy and juvenile crime. Grants are capped at $100,000 per year, with at least 25% allocated to local educational agencies. The partnership can renew a grant for up to 2 additional fiscal years. Grant funds can be used to address truancy through parental involvement in prevention activities and sanctions like community service and license suspension for students. Parental accountability, fines, teacher-aid duty, community service, in-school truancy prevention programs, involvement of local law enforcement, social services, judicial, business, and religious communities, nonprofit organizations, technology like automated telephone notice to parents and computerized attendance system. Model programs prioritized by the Attorney General for funding include the Truancy Intervention Project in Fulton County, Georgia, and the TABS program in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Attorney General prioritized funding for various truancy intervention programs across different states, including programs in Roswell, New Mexico; Rohnert Park, California; New Haven, Connecticut; Atlantic County, New Jersey; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Norfolk, Virginia. The Attorney General prioritized funding for truancy intervention programs in various states, including Oklahoma, Norfolk, Virginia, Marion, Ohio, Bakersfield, California, Farmington, New Mexico, and other model programs. $25,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2001."}
{"title": "SyerXXt8IS", "content": "Auto-generate enhanced input features for ML models with limited training data. Biological neural nets (BNNs) excel at fast learning, with the insect olfactory network rapidly learning new odors through competitive inhibition, sparse connectivity, and Hebbian updates. MothNet, a computational model of the moth olfactory network, generates new features for ML classifiers, resulting in improved performance. The \"insect cyborgs\" combining BNN and ML methods outperform baseline ML methods on MNIST and Omniglot data sets, reducing test set errors by 20% to 55%. MothNet feature generator surpasses PCA, PLS, and NNs, showcasing the potential of BNN-inspired feature generators in ML. Limited data is a common constraint for ML targets, hindering deployment and problem-solving capabilities. The curr_chunk discusses improving machine learning methods' ability to learn from limited data by automatically generating new class-separating features. It mentions the effectiveness of biological neural nets, specifically the insect olfactory network, in rapid learning. The Antennal Lobe (AL) and Mushroom Body (MB) are highlighted as key components in this process. The insect olfactory network, including the Antennal Lobe (AL) and Mushroom Body (MB), can rapidly learn new odors with just a few exposures. This network features competitive inhibition, high-dimensional sparse layers, and a Hebbian update mechanism. The MothNet model, based on the M. sexta moth AL-MB, showed superior performance in learning vectorized MNIST digits with limited training samples. The model includes competitive inhibition in the Antennal Lobe (AL), sparsity in the Mushroom Body (MB), and weight updates affecting only MB\u2192Readout connections. Hebbian updates occur in the weight adjustments. The MothNet architecture involves weight updates affecting only MB\u2192Readout connections, with Hebbian updates occurring based on neural firing rates. It was tested as a front-end feature generator for an ML classifier, combining MothNet with a downstream ML module to feed Readouts into the ML module as additional features. The MothNet architecture served as an automatic feature generator for a non-spatial dataset, enhancing the accuracies of ML methods like NN, SVM, and Nearest Neighbors. The AL-MB network encoded class-relevant information from the original input features, enabling ML methods to access it effectively. The MothNet architecture encoded class-relevant information from input features, outperforming other methods like PCA, PLS, NNs, and transfer learning. vMNIST, downsampling and vectorizing MNIST data, showed improved ML accuracy compared to baseline methods. The MothNet model (AL-MB) outperformed baseline ML methods like Nearest Neighbors, SVM, and Neural Net at low N by controlling trained accuracy through restricted training data. Full network architecture details and Matlab code for the cyborg experiments, including MothNet simulations, can be found in references [11] and [12]. Experiments compared Cyborg vs baseline ML methods on vMNIST, with training samples drawn randomly per class. MothNet, a model trained on vMNIST samples using stochastic differential equation simulations and Hebbian updates, outperformed baseline ML methods. The ML methods were then retrained with MothNet outputs as additional features, creating \"insect cyborgs\". Trained accuracies of baselines and cyborgs were compared to assess gains. In vMNIST experiments, feature generators like PCA, PLS, and NN were used as alternatives to MothNet. PCA and PLS generated new features by projecting onto top 10 modes, while NN pre-trained on vMNIST samples used output units as features. CNNs were not used due to vMNIST lacking spatial content. In vMNIST experiments, alternative feature generators like PCA, PLS, and NN were used. CNNs were not utilized due to vMNIST's lack of spatial content. A NN with weights initialized by training on an 85-feature vectorized Omniglot dataset was then trained on vMNIST data using transfer learning. The baseline NN method included one hidden layer, as adding a second layer did not enhance performance. MothNet readouts as features notably improved ML accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of the MothNet architecture in capturing new class-relevant information. The MothNet architecture effectively captured new class-relevant features in ML tasks, outperforming comparison feature generators like PCA, PLS, and NN. MothNet features significantly improved accuracy on the vMNIST baseline test set by 10% to 88%. MothNet features improved ML accuracy significantly, with a relative reduction in test error of 20% to 55%. NN models benefited the most, showing a 40% to 55% reduction in error. Even when ML baseline accuracy exceeded MothNet's 75% ceiling, MothNet front-end still enhanced accuracy by leveraging clustering information. Gains were observed in almost all cases with N > 3. The cyborg framework using MothNet features significantly improved ML accuracy, outperforming other methods such as PCA, PLS, and NN. Results showed a relative increase in mean accuracy due to the various feature generators, with MothNet features being the most effective. The MothNet architecture, with a competitive inhibition layer (AL) and a high-dimensional sparse layer (MB), was tested using a pass-through AL in vMNIST experiments. Cyborgs with pass-through ALs still showed significant accuracy improvements over baseline ML methods, with gains ranging from 60% to 100% of those with normal ALs. This suggests that the high-dimensional trainable layer (MB) was the most important, but the competitive inhibition of the AL layer added value. The AL layer's competitive inhibition added value by generating strong features, benefiting NNs the most. An automated feature generator based on a simple BNN with competitive inhibition, sparse projection, and Hebbian weight updates significantly improved learning abilities on vMNIST and vOmniglot datasets. This bio-mimetic feature generator extracted class-relevant information not captured by standard ML methods alone. The MothNet's pre-processing made additional information in raw feature distributions accessible, outperforming standard methods like PCA, PLS, NNs, and pre-training. The competitive inhibition layer enhances classification by creating attractor basins for inputs, pushing similar samples towards their respective class attractors. The sparse connectivity from AL to MB functions additively. The sparse connectivity from AL to MB has computational and anti-noise benefits. The insect MB is similar to sparse autoencoders but with differences such as not seeking to match the identity function, having a greater number of active neurons than the input dimension, no pre-training step, and requiring few samples for structure improvement. MB neurons do not have recurrent connections like Reservoir Networks. The Hebbian update mechanism is distinct. The insect MB, similar to sparse autoencoders, has no recurrent connections. The Hebbian update mechanism is distinct from backprop, with weight updates occurring on a \"use it or lose it\" basis. The dissimilarity of optimizers (MothNet vs ML) may increase total encoded information."}

{"title": "R42582", "content": "Foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean reflects the diversity of countries in the region, with some still receiving aid for political, socioeconomic, and security challenges, while others have largely outgrown U.S. assistance but receive support for new security challenges like citizen security and combating organized crime. Foreign aid continues to play a crucial role in advancing U.S. policy in Latin America and the Caribbean, despite the evolving nature of U.S. relations with the region. Congress oversees and allocates foreign assistance to address various challenges, including citizen security and organized crime. Efforts to reduce budget deficits have led to a closer examination of competing budget priorities. The report provides an overview of U.S. assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on historical and recent trends in aid. It also details the Obama Administration's FY2013 request for State Department and USAID-related assistance to the region. The United States has been a major contributor of foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean since the 1960s, with a spike in aid following President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress initiative. The report examines U.S. assistance to the region, including funding provisions in the FY2013 foreign aid appropriations bills and potential issues for congressional consideration. The United States increased assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean to counter Soviet and Cuban influence after Fidel Castro's rise to power in Cuba in 1959. Aid continued in the 1980s to support the Contras against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua and other Central American governments fighting leftist insurgencies. Assistance declined in the mid-1990s with the end of Soviet Union, civil conflicts, and the spread of democracy in the region, but began to increase again later on. U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean increased in the late 1990s, with higher levels of humanitarian and development aid. Aid was provided after Hurricane Mitch in 1998, and new sources of assistance were established with PEPFAR in 2003 and MCC in 2004. The Obama Administration continued to prioritize assistance to the region. The Obama Administration has focused on promoting economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean, increasing aid levels for development efforts. While significant assistance was provided to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, most of the aid through 2010 was directed towards counternarcotics and security programs in the region. The US has provided substantial foreign aid to Colombia and its Andean neighbors to combat drug trafficking and support development. President Bush and the Mexican counterpart announced the M\u00e9rida Initiative in FY2008 for counterdrug and anticrime assistance in Mexico and Central America. In FY2010, the Obama Administration split the Central America portion into CARSI and created a similar program for the Caribbean countries called the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative. The US has provided foreign aid to Latin America and the Caribbean through initiatives like the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI). However, US assistance to the region has been declining since FY2010, with a 10% decrease in aid from FY2008 to FY2012. US foreign aid to various regions saw changes in funding levels. Aid to East Asia, the Pacific, and Europe decreased, while South and Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa received increased aid. This shift reflects evolving global priorities and US foreign policy adjustments towards development efforts in Africa and strategic regions like Afghanistan and Pakistan. U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean decreased from 10% in FY2008 to under 8% in FY2012 due to shifting global priorities towards regions like Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Obama Administration focused more on development and humanitarian aid programs in the region. The U.S. foreign assistance, including funding from the Global Health Programs (GHP) accounts, aims to promote economic progress and social stability in developing nations through long-term projects in areas such as economic reform, democracy promotion, basic education, human health, and environmental protection. Humanitarian assistance focuses on immediate relief for emergencies, including food aid through the Food for Peace account and support for refugees and internally displaced persons through the Migration and Refugee Assistance account. USAID manages most programs, while the State Department oversees the MRA account. The State Department administers the MRA account and manages a portion of the global health account addressing HIV/AIDS. U.S. assistance to the region is also provided through the Economic Support Fund (ESF) account, which promotes U.S. economic, political, or security interests. ESF-funded programs aim to promote political and economic stability, managed by USAID in conjunction with the State Department. The United States funds security assistance programs in the region through various accounts such as INCLE for counternarcotics and law enforcement efforts, NADR for global threats like terrorism, and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The United States provides support to Latin American and Caribbean militaries through various accounts such as INCLE, NADR, FMF, and IMET. Aid levels to the region have decreased in recent years, leading to a shift towards development and humanitarian assistance over security assistance. In FY2012, U.S. aid to Latin America and the Caribbean focused on development and humanitarian assistance, with over $730 million provided through aid accounts. Another $466 million was allocated through the ESF account to support strategic interests. Additionally, nearly $700 million was provided through aid accounts for military support. In FY2012, the United States provided nearly $700 million in aid to Latin American and Caribbean countries for security efforts, representing 37% of total U.S. bilateral assistance to the region. Haiti, Colombia, and Mexico were the top recipients of U.S. foreign aid. Haiti received significant aid due to development challenges and humanitarian relief after the 2010 earthquake. Since FY2000, U.S. aid to Colombia has focused on long-term development in energy, infrastructure, basic services, and governance through \"Plan Colombia.\" Aid has decreased as Colombia's security situation improved, with the country taking on more responsibility. U.S. assistance for Mexico primarily supports the country's fight against. In FY2012, the United States provided $357 million for Haiti, $379 million for Colombia, and $330 million for Mexico, with a focus on supporting the fight against transnational criminal organizations. The Obama Administration's FY2013 foreign aid budget request would continue the downward trend in assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, with approximately $1.7 billion requested for the region. The Obama Administration has requested approximately $1.7 billion for Latin America and the Caribbean, which is about 10-11% less than previous years. The proposed cuts in funding are widespread, affecting every account except Development Assistance. Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, and Guyana would see significant cuts, while Colombia and Mexico would also be impacted. The Obama Administration's request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes significant cuts in funding for most countries, with El Salvador being the only one to receive an increase. The emphasis of U.S. aid in the region is shifting towards development and humanitarian assistance, with over $698 million allocated for these purposes in FY2013. The Obama Administration's request for Latin America and the Caribbean in FY2013 includes a 4% decrease in total funding for development and humanitarian assistance compared to FY2012. The request also includes $434 million through the Economic Support Fund (ESF) account, representing a 7% decline from FY2012. If fully funded by Congress, $567 million, or 33% of U.S. aid, would go to accounts providing security assistance. The Obama Administration's request for Latin America and the Caribbean in FY2013 includes a 4% decrease in total funding for development and humanitarian assistance compared to FY2012. U.S. security assistance for the region would decrease by about 19% compared to FY2012 and 10% compared to FY2011. The distribution of assistance within the Western Hemisphere shows a focus on Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and the Andean nations of South America. The United States provided Mexico and Central America with foreign assistance worth $27.5 billion between FY1980 and FY2010, with over 91% in economic assistance. Brazil and the Southern Cone countries of South America would receive just 1% of U.S. assistance, while 7% is dedicated to regional programs spanning multiple sub-regions. In FY2010, the United States provided over 91% of aid in economic assistance to Central America. El Salvador received the highest percentage of assistance at 33%, followed by Honduras (17%), Guatemala (13%), Mexico (11%), Costa Rica (10%), Nicaragua (9%), Panama (5%), and Belize (1%). U.S. aid to the region has decreased each decade since the 1980s, when it was a priority to counter Soviet influence and support anti-leftist governments. The total assistance to Mexico and Central America from 1980 to 2010 was $12.8 billion in constant 2010 U.S. dollars. During the 1990s, U.S. assistance to Central America and Mexico declined significantly, totaling $7.6 billion in 2010 U.S. dollars, a 41% decrease from the previous decade. Aid further decreased between FY2000 and FY2009 to about $5.9 billion in 2010 U.S. dollars. Despite the decline, new aid initiatives benefited several countries in the region. In the aftermath of declining U.S. assistance to Central America and Mexico, new aid initiatives emerged benefiting countries in the sub-region. El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua received MCC compacts, while Mexico saw increased aid through the M\u00e9rida Initiative. In FY2010, Mexico and Central America received $1.3 billion in U.S. assistance, with 57% going to Mexico. More recently, in FY2013, Mexico and Central America received $532.4 million in foreign aid through the State Department and USAID appropriations. In FY2011 and FY2012, Mexico and Central America received $532.4 million and $696.2 million in U.S. assistance, respectively. The FY2013 request for the sub-region is $619.8 million, with Mexico receiving $269.5 million, a decrease from the previous year. Mexico would still receive over 45% of aid due to U.S. support in combating organized crime.

HIV/AIDS assistance to the region, especially to Haiti and Guyana, increased significantly. Aid to the region rose to almost $1.7 billion in FY2010, largely due to assistance for hurricane recovery and reconstruction in countries like Grenada, Haiti, and Jamaica. U.S. assistance to the Caribbean increased significantly in recent years, reaching $572 million in FY2011 and an estimated $522 million in FY2012. This increase was largely due to the aftermath of Haiti's devastating earthquake in January 2010. Additionally, a new Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) was launched in FY2010 to support efforts in reducing illicit trafficking, advancing citizen security, and promoting social justice in the region. The U.S. provided significant assistance to the Caribbean, with funding reaching $572 million in FY2011 and an estimated $522 million in FY2012. For FY2013, the Administration's request is almost $492 million, with Haiti receiving the majority of assistance.

The U.S. is providing assistance to Haiti to stimulate economic growth and create opportunities outside of Port-au-Prince. Additionally, U.S. foreign aid includes programs for various Caribbean countries to combat HIV/AIDS and support security forces. In the Eastern Caribbean, a $35.2 million program based out of Bridgetown, Barbados, would support assistance activities for Barbados and the six countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS): Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, with almost two-thirds of the aid supporting HIV/AIDS programs. The USAID Mission in Barbados manages HIV/AIDS programs in Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. In the Dominican Republic, global health activities focus on HIV/AIDS and maternal and child health. DA funds projects to strengthen government institutions, improve education, small business competitiveness, and protect natural resources. For Cuba, the Administration is... The Administration is requesting $15 million for Cuba to provide humanitarian assistance to political prisoners and their families, strengthen civil society, and promote uncensored information flow.

In Jamaica, the FY2013 bilateral request is for $5.4 million with assistance for basic education, climate change adaptation, and regional HIV/AIDS support. Additionally, the FY2013 request includes $59 million for the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative to reduce illicit trafficking and enhance public safety in the Caribbean. The CBSI was developed by the Obama Administration in 2009 and 2010 to enhance security and promote social justice in the Caribbean. Funding for the program has totaled $203 million since FY2010, with allocations in various areas such as maritime security, law enforcement capacity building, border security, justice sector reform, and crime prevention for at-risk youth. The CBSI program, developed in 2009 and 2010, aims to enhance security and promote social justice in the Caribbean. Assistance provided includes funding for maritime security, law enforcement capacity building, border security, justice sector reform, and crime prevention for at-risk youth. The State Department does not provide a breakdown of CBSI assistance by country, making it difficult to determine the overall aid levels received by Caribbean nations. U.S. assistance under the CBSI likely exceeds regular bilateral aid levels for many Caribbean countries. Since the 1990s, U.S. assistance to the Andean region of South America has totaled about $3.6 billion in 2010 U.S. dollars, with Colombia receiving the most aid at 45%, followed by Peru (26%), Bolivia (21%), Ecuador (8%), and Venezuela (1%).

El Salvador signed a $461 million compact in 2006 to develop its northern border region. El Salvador signed a $461 million compact in 2006 to develop its northern border region, where more than half of the population lives in poverty. The compact included projects to improve physical infrastructure, invest in human capital, support small farmers and businesses, and build transportation arteries. The compact was completed in September 2012, and in December 2011, MCC announced El Salvador's eligibility for a second compact proposal expected to be finalized in 2013. In June 2005, Honduras signed a $215 million economic growth compact with MCC, consisting of a rural development project and a transportation project. After President Manuel Zelaya's ouster in June 2009, MCC terminated $10 million in funding, reducing the total to $205 million. The compact was completed in September 2010, and MCC decided not to renew it in January 2011. In January 2011, MCC decided not to renew Honduras's compact due to corruption issues. However, Honduras remains eligible for a $20 million threshold program to address corruption and economic growth barriers. Nicaragua signed a $175 million compact in July 2005, focusing on the western region for economic growth through transportation and rural development projects. The MCC funded projects in Nicaragua to increase farm productivity, support rural businesses, and register land ownership. Funding was suspended and later terminated after the disputed 2008 elections, reducing the total funding to $113.5 million. The compact ended in May 2011.

Program funding for the region was around $65 million in FY2011 and is estimated to be $61 million in FY2012, with a budget request of $60 million for FY2013. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the Peace Corps will allocate about $60 million for programs. Due to budget cuts, the number of volunteers in the region will decrease to 2,250 by the end of FY2012 and 1,800 by the end of FY2013. Most countries will see reductions in volunteers, except for Colombia. The Peace Corps plans to close programs in Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Suriname due to the Country Portfolio Review. The Peace Corps has suspended operations in some Latin American and Caribbean countries due to security concerns. In 2005, volunteers were withdrawn from Haiti and in 2008 from Bolivia. In January 2012, volunteers were pulled out of Honduras due to high levels of violence. In December 2011, a volunteer was shot in San Pedro Sula during a robbery attempt on a public bus. The Honduras program was suspended in September 2012 due to security concerns. Volunteer training classes for El Salvador and Guatemala were cancelled in December 2011, but programs continue in both countries. The Peace Corps plans to send new volunteers to El Salvador and Guatemala in 2013. The U.S. Administration's foreign aid budget request for Latin America and the Caribbean focuses on promoting economic opportunity, citizen security, democratic governance, and clean energy. Citizen security programs in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean make up 45% of the total budget. The Administration emphasizes the importance of improving citizen security to achieve other U.S. objectives in the region. The U.S. Administration's foreign aid budget for Latin America and the Caribbean prioritizes citizen security programs to strengthen institutions, address crime, and ensure public security. Assistance for Haiti, focusing on earthquake recovery and development efforts, is also a key priority. The FY2013 request emphasizes an integrated partnership approach and allocates 20% of aid to Haiti. The FY2013 request for aid to Latin America and the Caribbean focuses on different program areas. \"Peace and Security\" assistance makes up 30% of aid, \"Governing Justly and Democratically\" accounts for 24%, \"Investing in People\" for 23%, and \"Economic Growth\" for the rest. The program area of \"Economic Growth\" in the FY2013 aid request for Latin America and the Caribbean includes assistance for projects on environment, agriculture, private sector competitiveness, infrastructure, and trade and investment, accounting for about 20% of aid to the region. The request is about 10% less than the amount provided in FY2012 and takes advantage of favorable development trends in the region. USAID plans to close its mission in Panama, manage programs for Guyana from Barbados, reduce aid to Colombia and Peru, and withdraw from sectors where progress has been made. Concerns have been raised about the proposed 10% decrease in funding for Latin America and the Caribbean. There is broad agreement between Congress and the Administration on maintaining assistance for citizen security and counter-narcotics efforts in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean. Some Members have concerns about declines in assistance for these programs, while others oppose portions of the Administration's proposed FY2013 funding for the region. Assistance for Haiti's recovery is also a point of consensus, with calls for adequate monitoring for transparency and accountability. Some Members on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs oppose parts of the Administration's proposed FY2013 funding for Latin American and Caribbean countries, including the Global Climate Change Initiative. They also oppose increases in funding for Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua, citing concerns about these governments undermining U.S. interests and disregarding the rule of law. Additionally, some committee members are against cuts in democracy funding for Cuba and Venezuela. Some committee members opposed cuts in democracy funding for Cuba and Venezuela, arguing it is crucial to support democracy advocates. House and Senate Appropriations Committees have marked up their versions of the FY2013 State Department appropriations, potentially reducing worldwide foreign aid funding. The House version could lead to a significant cut from the Administration's request for assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean. The House version of the FY2013 State Department appropriations could result in a significant reduction from the Administration's request for assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean. More details on House and Senate priorities will be revealed as the legislation progresses. Members of Congress should consider if the request aligns with U.S. interests and objectives in the region, and if aid programs have been effective. The potential impact of the Administration's proposed FY2013 aid cuts for Latin America on U.S. policy and bilateral relations is a key concern. Congress may need to identify areas for reduction in foreign aid with the least harm to U.S. interests. Coordination among U.S. government agencies and international donors is crucial to maximize the impact of scarce foreign assistance funds. The U.S. foreign assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean is managed by various government agencies, including the State Department, USAID, and DOD. However, there is a lack of coordination among these agencies, leading to potential overlap in aid efforts. The Government Accountability Office has highlighted the need for a formal framework to improve information sharing and avoid duplication. There is a lack of coordination among U.S. agencies providing assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean, leading to potential overlap in aid efforts. The OECD reported that the region received $10.7 billion in official development assistance in 2010, with the United States contributing $2.7 billion (25%). Improved coordination among agencies and international donors could enhance the impact of aid programs. In 2010, major international donors provided a total of $10.7 billion in official development assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean. The United States contributed $2.7 billion (25%), while other bilateral donors provided $5.1 billion (48%) and multilateral organizations provided $2.8 billion (26%). Studies have shown a lack of coordination among donors, leading to duplicated efforts and conflicting goals. Closer coordination could ensure complementary efforts, focus on specific countries or sectors, and use foreign assistance funds more efficiently. The United States has signed trilateral cooperation agreements with Brazil, Chile, and Colombia to provide assistance to third countries, aiming for more efficient aid programs. Coordination among donors in Latin America and the Caribbean is lacking, leading to duplicated efforts and conflicting goals. The United States has signed trilateral cooperation agreements with Brazil, Chile, and Colombia to provide access to new solutions and expertise, aiming to multiply the impact of development programs by combining best practices with larger financial resources. Assistance requested for Brazil in FY2013 would strengthen the Brazilian government's development agency and implement jointly funded agriculture, food security, and school feeding programs in third countries. The House FY2013 foreign aid appropriations bill recommends $18.6 million to support Colombian government efforts in counternarcotics and law enforcement. Critics raise oversight concerns about providing assistance through foreign governments. The House FY2013 foreign aid appropriations bill recommends $18.6 million to support Colombian government efforts in counternarcotics and law enforcement. Questions for Members of Congress include agencies' comparative advantages in providing assistance, clarifying roles of U.S. agencies in foreign assistance, encouraging inter-agency coordination, identifying types of assistance programs the U.S. excels in, and exploring support from other donors for less strategically important countries or sectors. When considering foreign assistance levels for Latin American and Caribbean nations, Congress might examine the issues of political will and program sustainability. The United States should assess and monitor host nations' political will to make the reforms necessary for effective use of U.S. assistance. Controls should be in place to ensure U.S. funds provided through partner nations are used in accordance with U.S. law. The effectiveness of U.S. assistance in Latin America and the Caribbean depends on partner nations' willingness to implement reforms and sustain programs. Colombia, a major recipient of U.S. aid, has shown success in reforming and generating revenue, allowing for a managed transition of assistance programs. The United States is gradually reducing aid to Colombia as the country takes over financial and technical responsibility. USAID is also closing its mission in Panama and ending family planning programs in other Latin American countries due to their increased capacity to manage and fund the programs. However, political will in the region has been lacking in terms of generating sufficient government revenue to sustain efforts initiated with U.S. support. A 2003 study of U.S. democracy programs in Latin America found issues with sustainability after U.S. support ended. Similarly, a 2010 study on counternarcotics programs revealed countries unable to maintain U.S.-provided boats due to lack of funding. Even MCC-funded projects faced sustainability challenges, as seen in a 2011 study on a compact in Honduras. The lifespan of roads built in Honduras under the MCC compact to improve small farmers' access to markets may be limited due to municipalities lacking equipment, expertise, and funding for maintenance. Questions for Congress to consider regarding foreign aid appropriations for Latin American and Caribbean countries include the host country's capacity for equipment maintenance and financial responsibility for assistance programs. The House Committee on Appropriations marked up its FY2013 appropriations bill for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs in May 2012, totaling $48.3 billion, including $40.1 billion for foreign assistance. Questions arise about the host country's capacity for equipment maintenance and financial responsibility for assistance programs. The House Committee on Appropriations reported a $48.3 billion FY2013 appropriations bill for the State Department and Foreign Operations, with $40.1 billion for the core budget and $8.2 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. The Senate Committee marked up a $52.3 billion bill, with $50 billion for the core budget and $2.3 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations, representing a 2.3% decrease from FY2012 levels. The Obama Administration criticized the House bill for proposing funding levels 2.3% lower than FY2012 and 4.7% lower than their request, calling it \"unworkable\" and damaging to national security. The impact on foreign assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean was uncertain under the proposed bills. The House report expressed concerns over conditions in Latin America and the Caribbean and intended to provide assistance levels above the Administration's request for some countries in the region to address security needs, particularly in counternarcotics and law enforcement. The Senate report (S.Rept. 112-172) emphasizes the importance of supporting counternarcotics and law enforcement efforts in Mexico, Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean to combat drug trafficking and violent crime before it reaches the United States. The Committee acknowledges the challenges faced by countries in Central and South America due to struggling economies and weak governmental institutions, calling for additional U.S. aid. The Committee directs additional resources to strengthen democratic institutions and address poverty in the region, with specific funding levels recommended for Colombia and Mexico above the requested levels. The House report recommended increased funding levels for Colombia and Mexico, with specific allocations for training, technical assistance, and anti-crime efforts. The Senate report recommended funding for anti-crime and counternarcotics efforts along the U.S.-Mexican border in INCLE and additional economic development activities in ESF. The House report suggested funding for democracy programs in Venezuela and recommended that democracy programs be administered by the National Endowment for Democracy for CARSI. The House and Senate reports recommended funding levels for regional security programs like CARSI and CBSI, with differences in amounts allocated for democracy programs in Cuba and conservation programs in the Brazilian Amazon. The House report suggested using the National Endowment for Democracy for CARSI, while the Senate report supported the requested levels for both regional security programs. Congress did not take action on H.R. 5857 or S. 3241, delaying consideration of FY2013 appropriations bills until after the new fiscal year and enacting a six-month continuing resolution (P.L. 112-175). In March 2013, new legislation (P.L. 113-6) was approved to fund federal programs. Congress approved new legislation (P.L. 113-6) funding federal programs through the end of FY2013, maintaining State Department and Foreign Operations funding at FY2012 levels with some exceptions. Sequestration cuts reduced funding by about 5%, applied at the account level, leading to country-level allocation uncertainties for FY2013."}
{"title": "R44943", "content": "Some Members of Congress have long been interested in the rules governing patentable subject matter. The term refers to the requirement that an invention must consist of a \"process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter\" to be patented. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011 restricted patents on human organisms and tax avoidance strategies. The courts and USPTO have historically interpreted Section 101 broadly for patentable subject matter. The courts have long recognized exceptions to patentable subject matter, including laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. Recent Supreme Court decisions have tightened the interpretation of Section 101, leading to increased scrutiny of patents. Since 2010, opinions addressing patentable subject matter have led to increased scrutiny of patents under Section 101. The recent prominence of Section 101 in the U.S. patent system has sparked debate on its impact, with some declaring a \"state of crisis\" due to confusing legal standards. The U.S. patent system is facing a \"state of crisis\" due to confusing legal standards set by the Supreme Court, causing chaos and a departure from sensible patent policy. This has led to debates on the impact of Section 101 on patents, with some believing it may result in patents of appropriate scope, reduce abusive litigation, and promote higher quality patents. The report discusses the law governing patentable subject matter, Supreme Court decisions on Section 101 of the Patent Act, implications in information technology and life sciences industries, and legislative reform options. Applicants must submit applications to the USPTO for patent protection. The Patent Act of 1952 requires a detailed specification and at least one claim in a patent application. The examiner assesses novelty and other patentability criteria during the prosecution process. The Patent Act of 1952 mandates a detailed specification and at least one claim in a patent application. Novelty and nonobviousness are crucial patentability criteria. Novelty requires the invention to not be fully anticipated by prior art, while nonobviousness demands that the invention is not readily achievable by an ordinary artisan based on prior art teachings. Additionally, the invention must be useful, operable, and provide a tangible benefit to be patentable. Section 101 of the Patent Act outlines the requirements for patentability, stating that an invention must be new, useful, and fall within a category of patentable subject matter. Process patents claim a series of steps to achieve a specific result. Process patents relate to methods of manufacture or use, claiming a method of making a product or using a chemical compound. The Supreme Court defines \"machine\" as any mechanical device to produce a certain result, and \"manufacture\" as the production of articles from raw materials. The term \"composition of matter\" encompasses all compositions of two or more substances, including composite articles. Courts and the USPTO have set limits on patentable processes, excluding laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas. The Supreme Court views certain inventions as essential tools for scientific and technological progress, meant to be accessible to all and not monopolized. If a patent application meets the requirements, the USPTO grants a patent, giving the owner the right to exclude others from using the invention. The patent proprietor has the right to exclude others from using the claimed invention for twenty years. This exclusivity allows inventors to practice their inventions or license them to others, enabling them to recoup their investment. Patent holders must monitor competitors to ensure they are not infringing on their invention. Patent owners must monitor competitors for infringement. Litigation in federal courts is often necessary to enforce intellectual property rights. The Federal Circuit handles most patent appeals, with the Supreme Court having discretionary review authority. Recent Supreme Court decisions have addressed patentable subject matter for the first time in nearly four decades. In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled in Diamond v. Chakrabarty that genetically engineered microorganisms could be patented. In 1981, the Court also held in Diamond v. Diehr that a process involving a computer and mathematical formula for curing artificial rubber was patentable. These decisions broadened the range of patentable subject matter for information technologies and life sciences. Since then, lower courts and USPTO have rarely used Section 101 to invalidate patents. The Supreme Court's decisions from 2010 to 2014 narrowed patent eligibility, impacting the patent system significantly. In the 2010 Bilski v. Kappos case, the Court considered the patentability of a method for managing consumption risk costs in commodities trading. The patent application discussed involves a method for managing consumption risk costs in commodities trading by initiating transactions between commodity providers and consumers at fixed rates based on historical averages, and balancing the risk with market participants through additional transactions at a second fixed rate. The USPTO rejected the patent application for managing consumption risk costs in commodities trading under Section 101. The Federal Circuit questioned whether the process claimed was tied to a machine or transformed an article, ultimately ruling against Bilski. The Federal Circuit rejected Bilski's patent application for not claiming patentable subject matter, as it did not specify a machine or achieve a physical transformation. The USPTO denied Bilski's patent application because his invention could not be patented as it did not meet the criteria of being a physical object or substance. The Supreme Court issued three opinions, with a plurality opinion rejecting the machine or transformation test as the sole standard for identifying patentable processes. The Supreme Court rejected the machine or transformation test as the sole standard for identifying patentable processes. Instead, they ruled that abstract ideas were not patentable subject matter, with Justice Kennedy stating that allowing patenting of risk hedging would grant a monopoly over an abstract idea. Justice Breyer, in a concurring opinion, highlighted four key points agreed upon by all nine justices regarding patentable subject matter. The machine-or-transformation test was deemed useful but not the exclusive standard, with a focus on limiting patents for methods of doing business. In Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Supreme Court shifted focus to life sciences, specifically regarding patents for methods of determining optimal dosages of drugs for autoimmune diseases. The Court emphasized that the machine-or-transformation test is not the only standard for assessing patentability, and not all results that are \"useful, concrete, and tangible\" qualify for patents. The patents claim methods of administering thiopurine drugs to patients and determining drug levels in red blood cells. If metabolite levels are outside the known range, drug dosage should be adjusted to enhance treatment efficacy and reduce toxicity. The patents claim a method of optimizing therapeutic efficacy for immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorders by administering 6-thioguanine and adjusting drug dosage based on the level of 6-thioguanine in red blood cells. The Supreme Court ruled that claims directed towards natural laws are unpatentable, as monopolizing basic tools through patents could hinder innovation. The Supreme Court ruled that processes applying natural laws in a useful way could be patented under Section 101 of the Patent Act. The Court recognized that the claims involved laws of nature but also included steps like administering a drug and determining metabolite levels. Justice Breyer questioned whether the claims went beyond just stating a natural law. The Supreme Court considered whether the claims in question added enough to natural laws to be patent-eligible processes. Justice Breyer explained that simply limiting the use of a natural law to a specific audience or environment was not enough to make it patentable. The Supreme Court ruled that simply applying a law of nature to a specific technological environment or advising individuals to use the law does not make it patentable. Justice Breyer emphasized that adding conventional or routine steps to a natural law does not make it eligible for a patent. The Supreme Court's ruling in Mayo v. Prometheus stated that adding conventional steps to a natural law does not make it patentable. The Court rejected the argument that the Prometheus patents satisfied the machine-or-transformation test, as they did not transform unpatentable natural correlations into patentable applications. Justice Breyer argued that measuring metabolite levels did not require transforming human blood, and the transformation of the human body was not relevant to patentability. The Court also addressed the argument that any step beyond stating a law of nature should meet patent standards, emphasizing the importance of novelty and nonobviousness under the Patent Act. The Court responded to concerns about rejecting the Prometheus patents, noting that granting patents on the body's natural responses could limit physician access to scientific data. Justice Breyer emphasized the importance of novelty and nonobviousness in patentability under the Patent Act. In a June 2013 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that genomic DNA was ineligible for patenting under the \"product of nature\" doctrine. Products of nature may not be patented, but significant artificial changes can make them patentable. The USPTO issued over 50,000 patents related to DNA, but experts believed that patenting human genes was a misconception of the \"product of nature\" principle. The Supreme Court decision in Myriad reflected this view, ruling that genomic DNA was not eligible for patenting. The Association for Molecular Pathology and other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against USPTO, Myriad Genetics, and University of Utah Research Foundation challenging Myriad's patents on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes associated with breast and ovarian cancers. Myriad held intellectual property rights for genetic testing related to these genes. The plaintiffs challenged Myriad's gene patent claims on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes associated with cancer, arguing that human genes are naturally occurring and not patentable. The U.S. District Court invalidated Myriad's gene patent claims, but the Federal Circuit later reversed this decision, stating that \"isolated\" DNA is manipulated and patentable. The Appeals reasoned that \"isolated\" DNA is chemically manipulated and different from natural DNA, making human genes patentable. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment in the Myriad case and remanded it back to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration. The Federal Circuit upheld Myriad's claims again, leading to the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the case. The Supreme Court ruled that Myriad did not create anything by isolating the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, stating that separating the gene from its surrounding genetic material is not an act of invention. Myriad's claims of patenting isolated DNA were deemed unimpressive by the Court. The Supreme Court ruled that Myriad's claims on isolated DNA were not patentable as they did not involve chemical composition or changes. However, the Court found that claims on complementary DNA (cDNA) were patentable as cDNA is distinct from naturally occurring DNA and can be considered a product of human invention. The Supreme Court ruled that cDNA could be patented as it is not a \"product of nature.\" Justice Thomas clarified that the Myriad opinion did not address innovative gene manipulation methods or altered DNA sequences. The Court held that genes isolated from surrounding genetic material are not patent eligible under \u00a7101. Justice Thomas, joined by seven colleagues, ruled that isolated genomic DNA is not patent eligible. Justice Scalia concurred but disagreed on molecular biology details, stating cDNA can be patented as a synthetic creation. The Supreme Court's recent decision considered the patentability of genomic DNA. In a recent Section 101 decision, the Supreme Court examined the patentability of a computer-implemented financial exchange system in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International. The inventions aimed to reduce settlement risk in financial transactions through method claims, computer system claims, and computer-readable media claims. The district court's conclusion was significant. The Supreme Court upheld the Federal Circuit's ruling that computer-implemented inventions related to financial transactions were unpatentable as they represented a basic business concept. The Federal Circuit determined that patents were directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. Justice Thomas explained the two-part test for identifying such patents, focusing on whether the claim recites additional elements that transform it into a patent-eligible application. Justice Thomas described the second test as determining if a claim includes an \"inventive concept\" beyond just applying laws to a technological environment. The Court found the method claims to be abstract ideas related to intermediated settlement, a common economic practice. The inquiry then focused on whether the claim includes an \"inventive concept\" to transform the abstract idea into something patent-eligible. The Court found that the patented claims were merely implementing an abstract idea on a computer, with Justice Thomas stating that the inclusion of generic computer hardware does not make an abstract idea patent-eligible. The claims were rejected for relying on generic computer hardware without an inventive concept. The Supreme Court found that the patented claims were unpatentable as they only involved generic computer hardware without an inventive concept, failing to link the invention to a specific technological environment. The current law on patent eligibility, as established in Bilski, Mayo v. Prometheus, Myriad, and Alice, requires a two-part test to determine if an invention is eligible for patenting. The Court analyzes patent claims to determine if they preempt a field of activity, and if a claim covers every practical application of a fundamental concept, it cannot be patented under Section 101. Recitation of routine hardware like a general-purpose computer does not make a claim eligible under Section 101. The machine-or-transformation test is a useful guidepost for patent eligibility of processes, with Section 101 determinations often resolved early in litigation without formal claim construction. Statistical analyses show a good probability of invalidating challenged claims when Section 101 challenges are raised. Statistical analyses show a high probability of invalidating challenged claims under Section 101, with courts invalidating 66.5% of challenged patents and the Federal Circuit invalidating 91.9% of patents. The USPTO has rejected over 36,000 patent applications under Alice, indicating a significant number of patents may not comply with Section 101. Recent statistics suggest that around two-thirds of issued patents may not comply with Section 101, indicating a good chance of success in invalidating patent claims that do not adhere to patentable subject matter laws. This trend has implications for various technologies and has been influenced by recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter. The recent Supreme Court interest in patentable subject matter has led to the invalidation of numerous patents on computer-related inventions. Patent claims that do not describe specific solutions or improvements in technology are most vulnerable to challenges under Section 101. Several patent claims were invalidated, including inventions related to generating menus, analyzing electric power grid information, extracting data from hard copy documents, and administering life insurance policies. The patent invalidated in another representative decision, Affinity Labs of Tex. v. DIRECTV, LLC, claimed a broadcast system in which a cellular telephone located outside the territory of a regional broadcaster requests and receives content via a streaming signal, downloads an application for performing those functions, and contains a display for selecting particular content. The Federal Circuit applied the Supreme Court's two-part test for patentable subject matter. The Federal Circuit applied the Supreme Court's two-part test for patentable subject matter and deemed the concept of providing out-of-region access to a local broadcast as an abstract idea. Judge Bryson noted that the patent did not describe how to implement out-of-region broadcasting on a cellular telephone, but rather focused on the idea itself. The Federal Circuit rejected the patent claim as it focused on the idea of out-of-region access on cellular telephones without describing how it was implemented, concluding it did not satisfy Section 101. The Supreme Court decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics have had consequences for the life sciences industry, particularly in the patentability of predictive diagnostic methods and isolated bodily biomarkers. The Supreme Court decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics have impacted the patentability of isolated bodily substances. The 2015 ruling in Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc. has sparked discussion in the patent community regarding non-invasive prenatal diagnostic methods. Sequenom held the exclusive license for a non-invasive prenatal diagnostic method to determine fetal gender, blood type, and genetic disorders using cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma or serum. The method involved amplifying and detecting paternally inherited nucleic acid in the sample. The inventors discovered cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma or serum and developed a method to detect paternally inherited ccfDNA to determine fetal characteristics. The Federal Circuit ruled that the invention failed the patentable subject matter test as it focused on a naturally occurring phenomenon and instructed physicians to use conventional techniques. Judge Linn concurred with the decision but expressed dissatisfaction with the outcome. Judge Linn concurred with the Federal Circuit's ruling that the invention failed the patentable subject matter test, but expressed dissatisfaction with the outcome. He highlighted the breakthrough nature of the patented invention in prenatal diagnosis, which previously involved invasive techniques. Congress has options to address the law of patentable subject matter, including taking no action or altering the law through legislation. No bill has been introduced before Congress on this issue as of the report's publication. No bill has been introduced before Congress addressing the law of patentable subject since the enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act in 2011. However, industry associations like the American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA) and the Intellectual Property Owners Association (IPO) have proposed modifications to Section 101. The AIPLA proposal suggests replacing the existing Section 101 with new language. The language of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 outlines the eligibility criteria for patents, stating that inventions must be useful processes, machines, manufactures, compositions of matter, or improvements thereof. It also specifies exceptions for inventions that exist in nature independent of human activity or can be performed solely in the human mind. The IPO and ABA proposals aim to amend Section 101 of the patent law to determine patent eligibility without considering certain requirements or conditions. The ABA proposal suggests changing the language to focus on eligible subject matter for patents. The ABA proposal suggests amending Section 101 of the patent law to focus on eligible subject matter for patents, without considering certain requirements or conditions. Patent eligibility may be denied if the exclusive rights under a claim preempt the use of all practical applications of a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea. The AIPLA argues that Section 101 of the patent law should not negate patent eligibility based on patentability considerations defined in Sections 102, 103, and 112. It should focus on enabling provisions rather than determining if a technical advance deserves patent protection. The ABA Section on Intellectual Property and the IPO criticize recent Supreme Court decisions for injecting ambiguity into patent eligibility determination by requiring criteria like 'well known,' 'routine,' 'conventional or obvious,' which they argue should be left to other statutory provisions. The analysis of proposed patent eligibility reforms is criticized as contrary to congressional intent, too restrictive, and unsound from a policy standpoint. Some argue that more restrictive rules have not impacted innovation or investment significantly. The proposed amendments could eliminate limits on software patenting and subject matter eligibility. The AIPLA proposal would also change the current statutory phrase regarding patent conditions. The proposed patent eligibility reforms are criticized for being too restrictive and contrary to congressional intent. The AIPLA proposal suggests changing the statutory phrase regarding patent conditions from \"may obtain a patent subject to the conditions and requirements of this title\" to \"shall be entitled to a patent only subject to the conditions and requirements set forth in this title.\" This change could impact common law patentability standards and has sparked debate, especially in the fields of software and life sciences. Observers believe that Section 101 helps maintain a balance between inventors' contributions and their patent rights. Some experts worry that limited patent rights could hinder innovation and investment in the US, sparking debates on what inventions should be patentable."}
{"title": "R44832", "content": "Prescription drug affordability has become a major concern due to the rapid increase in retail drug spending. This rise is attributed to manufacturers introducing new drugs and raising prices for existing brand-name products. Additionally, fewer brand-name drugs losing patent protection has resulted in lower savings from generic substitutes. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services predict a 6.3% annual growth in retail drug spending from 2017 to 2026. Retail drug spending is expected to grow by 6.3% annually from 2017 to 2026, outpacing other medical spending areas. The report addresses government and private-sector policies affecting drug prices and availability, covering topics such as research funding, advertising regulation, reimportation restrictions, and federal price negotiation. The appendix includes references for further reading. The appendix provides references to relevant congressional hearings on prescription drug spending data from the National Health Expenditures (NHE) accounts compiled by CMS. NHE data track annual spending on prescription drugs in retail settings, excluding drugs dispensed in institutions and over-the-counter products. According to recent NHE data, the US spent $328.6 billion on prescription drugs in 2016 and is forecasted to spend $338.1 billion in 2017, accounting for 10% of national health care spending. Prescription drug spending is expected to increase to 11% by 2027. Retail drug spending has been between 5% to 10% of total health care expenditures since 1960. Analysts say data on retail drug sales do not provide a complete picture of U.S. drug spending. Various sources, including the Department of Health and Human Services, offer different estimates that consider factors like rebates and coupons, as well as retail and institutional use. The pace of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has varied through the decades, with growth slowing from 2003 through 2013 due to various factors. Retail prescription drug spending in the U.S. has seen fluctuations over the years, with a significant increase of 12.4% in 2014, followed by slower growth in subsequent years. The forecast predicts a 2.9% increase in 2017, with an average annual growth rate of 6.3% through 2027, driven by faster drug price growth, especially for specialty drugs. Retail prescription drug spending in the U.S. is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 6.3% through 2027, driven by faster price growth for specialty drugs. Congressional hearings have been held to address the sharp increases in drug prices and overall spending acceleration. Retail prescription drug spending in the U.S. is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 6.3% through 2027, driven by faster price growth for specialty drugs. The increase in drug spending in 2014 and 2015 was due to new high-cost drugs, price hikes for existing drugs, and the impact of the Affordable Care Act. Retail prescription drug spending in the U.S. is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 6.3% through 2027, driven by faster price growth for specialty drugs. The increase in drug spending in 2014 and 2015 was due to new high-cost drugs, price hikes for existing drugs, and the impact of the Affordable Care Act. In 2016, drug spending slowed despite overall utilization rising, attributed to factors like fewer new drug approvals, decreased use of high-cost hepatitis C drugs, and reduced spending on diabetes treatments. Drug mix, comparing costs of new versus older drugs, plays a role in expenditure fluctuations. The FDA approved many new expensive specialty drugs for hepatitis C, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease, leading to significant growth in U.S. prescription drug spending. New hepatitis C drugs were a major factor in increased spending in 2014 and 2015, but their impact is now decreasing as fewer new patients are treated with them. The impact of expensive new drugs on U.S. prescription drug spending is diminishing as fewer new patients are treated with them and net prices drop. Generic substitution played a smaller role in reducing total drug spending since 2009, with patents expiring for best-selling brand-name drugs leading to the production of new generic versions. Spending for brand-name drugs subject to generic competition fell significantly in 2012, but annual savings have been lower since then. Changes in drug mix will continue to affect spending. Prescription drug prices have risen faster than overall U.S. inflation since 2014, with biologics playing a key role. The FDA has approved biosimilar substitutes for some biologics, but they are not significantly lower-priced. The gap between prescription drug and overall inflation has narrowed. The gap between prescription drug and overall inflation narrowed significantly in 2017, with U.S. retail drug inflation at 6.4% in 2014, 6.2% in 2016, and 2.8% in 2017. Drug inflation is driven by price increases for brand-name and generic drugs, as well as adoption of expensive new innovator drugs. The 2016 HHS study found that generic price increases were not a major contributor to inflation. Express Scripts analysis showed brand-name drug prices rose 10.7% from 2015 to 2016, while generic drug prices declined by 8.7%. Biologics and specialty drugs drove much of the price inflation. ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage boosted demand starting in 2014. The ACA provided tax credits for health plans and required coverage of prescription drugs. ACA exchanges saw a 15% annual increase in drug spending from 2014 to 2015. Medicaid expansion under the ACA led to an 8% jump in Medicaid prescription drug claims in 2014. The aging baby boomer population also impacted drug spending. The aging baby boomer population has contributed to increased demand in Medicaid prescription drug spending. Patients aged 50 and older accounted for 70% of dispensed prescriptions in 2016. Consumer out-of-pocket spending for filled prescriptions has decreased over the years, with commercial payers and taxpayer-financed health programs covering a growing share of the nation's retail drug bill. Consumer out-of-pocket spending for prescriptions has decreased over the years, with commercial payers and taxpayer-financed health programs covering a growing share of the nation's retail drug bill. Out-of-pocket spending is forecast to decline further in 2026, but consumers may still face high expenses depending on factors like insurance coverage and drug discounts. During the past few years, health plans have increased cost sharing for prescription drugs to control spending. The share of commercial health plans with a prescription drug deductible rose from 23% to 46% from 2012 to 2015. Drug deductibles are common in health plans on ACA state exchanges, with tiered pricing and coinsurance for expensive drugs becoming more prevalent. In tiered pricing, consumers face varying costs for different drugs based on price tiers. The widening differential between tiers has increased financial burden on those using higher-priced drugs. For example, in 2017, enrollees in employer-sponsored health plans paid an average co-payment of $110 for high-priced tier-four drugs compared to $11 for tier-one generic drugs. Cost-sharing increases have been partially offset by other factors, such as the ACA's cap on annual out-of-pocket spending. The ACA has helped reduce out-of-pocket spending for insured consumers by capping total annual costs and eliminating cost sharing for contraceptives. Pharmaceutical manufacturers offer patient assistance through discount coupons and assistance programs based on health condition and income. Generic drug use rates have increased, leading to a decline in average out-of-pocket spending for retail drugs in recent years. However, some consumers still face high out-of-pocket costs. The number of consumers facing high out-of-pocket costs has increased, with some having costs exceeding $1,000 in 2014. The share of people with high drug costs has tripled since 2004, particularly for outpatient specialty drugs. Out-of-pocket spending for outpatient specialty drugs increased by 46% from $24 to $35 per month from 2003 to 2014, while spending for nonspecialty drugs decreased by 57% from $14 to $6 per month. Per person out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs declined from $146 in 2010 to $140 in 2016, with a forecast to decrease to $137 in 2017 and gradually rise to $207 by 2026. Despite overall U.S. retail drug spending increasing, out-of-pocket spending is expected to decline as a share of retail drug expenditures in the next decade. Government share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has increased from 25% in 2005 to 44.1% in 2017, and is projected to reach 47% by 2026 due to expanded subsidized drug coverage through programs like Medicare Part D and Medicaid under the ACA. Unlike other countries, the U.S. does not have a centralized system for drug administration. The United States does not have a centralized system for administering government-sponsored drug benefits or setting drug prices. Various federal departments and agencies oversee different drug discount and contracting systems, including market-based negotiations in Medicare Part D, direct procurement in the Veterans Health Administration, and a combination of rebates and negotiations in Medicaid. FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs but does not have the authority to set drug prices. The US lacks a centralized system for drug benefits or pricing. Federal agencies can secure discounts for prescription drugs, but the discounts vary widely. Medicaid rebates were 47% of Medicaid spending in 2012, while only 15% of Part D spending. Some Medicaid rebates were over 10 times larger than Part D rebates for the same drugs. Legislation has been proposed to give the HHS Secretary more power to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. Medicare Part D is a market-oriented program where commercial health payers compete for enrollees based on drug coverage. Part D plan sponsors negotiate drug prices. The table outlines prescription purchasing systems for federal health care programs like Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, Medicaid, and the Veterans Health Administration. The Medicare Part D program involves commercial health payers competing for enrollees based on drug coverage. Part D plan sponsors negotiate drug prices with manufacturers and pharmacies. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 prohibits the HHS Secretary from intervening in these negotiations. Congress has debated the effectiveness of this market-based model. In the years since Part D was enacted, Congress has debated the effectiveness of the market-based model in controlling drug prices and enrollee costs. Program spending has been below initial budget projections, with total Part D drug rebates increasing from 9.6% in 2007 to a forecasted 24% in 2018. A 2014 CBO study found that Part D premiums were lower in areas with robust plan competition, but Part D plans have higher average drug prices than Medicaid. Some studies found that Part D plans have higher drug prices than Medicaid, which secures lower prices. Lawmakers propose giving the Secretary authority to negotiate drug prices to leverage Medicare beneficiaries' purchasing power for larger discounts. The Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007, H.R. 4, aimed to allow the Secretary to negotiate Part D drug prices without creating a formulary. However, the bill was not approved by the Senate due to concerns about potential savings and control over drug coverage. Various bills have been introduced in Congress to modify Medicare drug pricing. Lawmakers have introduced bills to modify the noninterference provision for Medicare drug pricing. The Obama Administration recommended giving the Secretary authority to negotiate prices for high-cost drugs, while the Trump Administration suggested requiring Part D plans to pass on more drug rebates to enrollees. Additionally, there are proposals to move some Part B-covered drugs to Part D for lower prices. Lawmakers have introduced legislation to apply Medicaid's mandatory rebates to Part D drugs for low-income enrollees, potentially lowering costs initially but leading to price increases over time. This could also reduce incentives for drug manufacturers to invest in research and development. State governments regulate prescription drug use and pricing, playing a key role in health insurance and Medicaid administration. Some states have patient assistance programs for low-income residents, with laws in California, Delaware, and Vermont capping drug costs and requiring price transparency. Vermont passed a law in 2016 mandating manufacturer disclosure for drugs with significant price increases. Vermont passed a law in 2016 mandating manufacturer disclosure for drugs that underwent large percentage price increases. State regulators compile a list of 15 drugs with the largest annual price increases, and manufacturers must justify the price hikes to the state attorney general. Other states are also considering legislation to force drug companies to justify prices and prohibit gag clauses in pharmacy contracts that prevent pharmacists from informing consumers about cheaper prescription options. The United States spends more on prescription drugs than other industrialized nations, with a projected increase in global drug spending share. Maine allowed drug imports from certain countries, but a court ruled it unconstitutional. The United States is projected to account for 12%-13% of global drug spending by 2021. A study by the OECD found that U.S. per capita spending for retail prescription drugs was significantly higher than the OECD average. Price differences for specific drugs between the U.S. and other countries have been observed, with U.S. prices often double that of the European Union. The U.S. price for drugs is often double that of the European Union due to reasons like faster adoption of new drugs, patent protections, and government-run health care systems in OECD countries setting price limits. Value-based pricing is defined by the European Commission as using the price of a medicine in one country to set or negotiate the price in another. In Canada, the Common Drug Review assesses new and existing drugs for reimbursement. In the U.S., there are experiments with alternative pricing methods, such as Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. In the U.S., Harvard Pilgrim Health Care has a deal with drugmakers Novartis and Eli Lilly for discounts based on health improvement goals. CMS encourages value-based purchasing in Medicaid programs. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review evaluates new drugs for effectiveness, cost, and budget impact. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) evaluates the budget impact of newly approved drugs by the FDA, raising concerns in the pharmaceutical industry about limiting reimbursement and patient access to treatments. ICER has refined its methodology for valuing prescription drugs and engages with various healthcare industry segments. The federal government focuses on basic research, while the pharmaceutical industry prioritizes clinical trials over discovery activities. The pharmaceutical industry prioritizes clinical trials over discovery activities, with only a small percentage of new drugs originating from publicly funded research. A 2010 study found that 24.1% of new molecular entities (NMEs) and new biologics approved by the FDA between 1998 and 2007 originated from publicly funded work. The 2011 study by Ashley J. Stevens et al. found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from work in publicly funded labs. Of the total drug applications, 19% from publicly funded research received priority review. According to a study by Ashley J. Stevens et al., publicly funded research institutions received priority reviews for 19% of drug applications, compared to 20% for private-sector research. This suggests that publicly funded research tends to discover drugs with significant clinical impact. The Stevens study found that publicly funded research institutions played a significant role in drug discovery, with priority reviews for 19% of drug applications. The study excluded the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies that led to new drug classes. The study excluded platform technologies developed with public funds, such as recombinant DNA technology, bacterial production methods, antibody production methods, glycosylated protein production methods, and gene silencing methods, which were not used to develop specific drug candidates. A 2018 study found that public funding from the NIH was associated with every new drug approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2016. The study revealed that up to 20% of the NIH budget allocation, around $100 billion, contributed to the development of these new drugs. The NIH budget allocation from 2000 to 2016, around $100 billion, was linked to research contributing to new drug approvals from 2010-2016. This suggests a greater NIH contribution to drug research than previously thought. Pharmaceutical companies disclose overall research spending, but specific drug development costs are not widely available. Academic studies have tried to estimate average drug development expenses, with the Tufts Center being a prominent source. The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development estimates the average cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug to be $2.6 billion in 2014, including clinical spending and time costs. This figure is based on data provided by 10 large drug manufacturers. The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development estimated the average cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug to be $2.6 billion in 2014, including clinical spending and time costs. However, academic and government research has challenged the study's assumptions, questioning the effective rate of return for drug companies, the mix of drugs sampled, and the capture of federal tax breaks for research and development spending. The cost of new drug development is estimated to range from $1.2 billion to $2.6 billion, with factors like development time, cost of capital, and inclusion of orphan drugs affecting the estimates. Transparency legislation is being considered to compel drugmakers to disclose research, marketing, and other costs for high-priced drugs or those with significant price increases. Price transparency legislation assumes that research and development costs are not the main factor in drug pricing. A Senate investigation found that Gilead's pricing strategy for hepatitis C drugs focused on maximizing revenue rather than research costs. The pricing strategy of Gilead for hepatitis C drugs focused on maximizing revenue, rather than research costs. Pfizer's pricing strategy for the breast cancer drug Ibrance considered factors such as existing drug prices, reimbursement, and prescriber feedback. The United States allows direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs, regulated by the FDA to ensure accuracy and balance of benefits and risks. Pharmaceutical companies can deduct advertising expenses for drugs, including direct-to-consumer advertising. This form of advertising is part of the industry's promotional efforts, alongside marketing to healthcare providers. Pharmaceutical advertising has evolved since 1962 under FDA regulations. Pharmaceutical advertising has evolved since 1962 under FDA regulations, expanding to consumers in the 1980s and including guidance on broadcast and internet ads. DTC prescription drug advertising has steadily increased over the decades. DTC prescription drug advertising has steadily increased over the decades, reaching over $5 billion in 2006. Advertising dipped during the 2007 recession but rebounded by 2014. Recent data shows a rapid increase in DTC advertising, with pharmaceutical advertising rising 56% to over $6 billion from 2012 to 2015. Television and newspaper ads make up the majority of spending on pharmaceutical DTC advertising. Newspaper advertisements are the main spending area for pharmaceutical DTC advertising, but internet-based drug ads are growing rapidly. Drug companies must submit ads to the FDA for approval. Internet prescription drug promotions are increasing, while television promotions remain steady. Supporters of pharmaceutical advertising argue that it leads to more informed consumers who are proactive in their healthcare. Critics, however, believe that the industry's presentation of drug benefits and risks may result in inappropriate prescribing and increased drug spending. Recent studies suggest a link between drug advertising and increased use of prescription drugs, with a 10% rise in drug advertising views leading to a 5.4% increase in filled prescriptions for the advertised drugs. The office report found that DTC drug advertising may have direct benefits but could also lead to the use of advertised drugs over more appropriate alternatives. A government survey showed that many people feel the ads lack sufficient information on benefits and risks. Congress has debated restricting DTC advertising to protect public health and finances. The American Medical Association recommended a ban on DTC drug ads in November 2015. The American Medical Association and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists recommended a ban on DTC drug ads in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed a moratorium on advertising for new drugs. Concerns about promoting new drugs without long-term evidence of safety and effectiveness have been raised. In 2006, the Institute of Medicine recommended FDA restrict DTC advertising of new drugs for two years. Congress has debated but not approved a moratorium on advertising for new drugs. Legislation was introduced to disallow federal tax deductions for pharmaceutical DTC advertising to reduce drug spending. FDA regulates the sale of pharmaceuticals in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In the United States, a manufacturer cannot sell a drug without an approved marketing application, which includes clinical data on safety and effectiveness, manufacturing procedures, reporting processes, and labeling. Imported drugs may not meet all approval requirements, such as FDA-approved labeling for U.S. sales. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 clarified that only the manufacturer of an FDA-approved prescription drug can legally bring it back into the United States. The Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act of 2000 allowed pharmacists and wholesalers to import FDA-approved prescription drugs, but in practice, it has not been effective. The MEDS Act, part of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, aimed to allow importation of prescription drugs, but has not been implemented due to the HHS Secretary not certifying its safety and cost benefits to Congress. The importation provision in the MEDS Act has never been implemented as no HHS Secretary has certified its safety and cost benefits to Congress. If implemented, a company could produce and package a drug outside the US according to FDA approval and bring it into the US for sale. Lawmakers have attempted this multiple times. Lawmakers have tried to use the agriculture appropriations bill to bypass restrictions on prescription drug importation into the US. FDA has been lenient in enforcing personal importation rules, allowing individuals to bring in a 90-day supply of drugs. The FDA allows individuals to bring a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs into the US for personal use, requiring written affirmation and physician information. This policy was not intended for importing lower-priced prescription drugs. The goal is to save FDA resources and permit medical treatments not otherwise available. The FDA allows individuals to bring a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs into the US for personal use, requiring written affirmation and physician information. This policy was not intended for importing lower-priced prescription drugs. Some states have tried to pass laws allowing drug importation for cost savings. The Senate committees have held hearings on drug importation and the repercussions of sudden price spikes in decades-old prescription drugs. The Senate committees have conducted hearings on sudden price spikes in decades-old prescription drugs, focusing on the monopoly business model and perspectives from the front lines. They have also examined the proposed Medicare Part B drug demonstration. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions has conducted hearings on the cost of prescription drugs, including an examination of The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Report \"Making Medicines Affordable: A National Imperative\". They have also discussed how the drug delivery system affects what patients pay. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions has conducted hearings on the cost of prescription drugs and how the drug delivery system impacts patient costs. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions has conducted hearings on pharmaceutical competition barriers and patient access to generic drugs. The hearings also included a progress report on biosimilar implementation and advancing research and development for patients. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions has conducted hearings on advancing research and development for patients, drug supply chain examination, 340B drug pricing program utilization, and patient access to investigational drugs. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions has conducted hearings on patient access to investigational drugs, FDA regulation of over-the-counter drugs, FDA's Prescription Drug User Fee Program, and FDA's Generic Drug and Biosimilar User Fee Program. The FDA's Generic Drug and Biosimilar User Fee Program was discussed in a hearing by the House Judiciary Committee, along with antitrust concerns related to the FDA approval process. The State of Competition in the Pharmacy Benefit Manager and Pharmacy Marketplaces was also addressed in a separate hearing. The House Judiciary Committee discussed the FDA's Generic Drug and Biosimilar User Fee Program, along with antitrust concerns related to the FDA approval process. Additionally, the State of Competition in the Pharmacy Benefit Manager and Pharmacy Marketplaces was addressed in a separate hearing. The House Judiciary Committee addressed issues related to the FDA's Generic Drug and Biosimilar User Fee Program, antitrust concerns in the FDA approval process, and the State of Competition in the Pharmacy Benefit Manager and Pharmacy Marketplaces. Additionally, hearings were held on the impact of voluntary restricted distribution systems in the pharmaceutical supply chain, the rising price of EpiPens, and developments in the prescription drug market oversight."}
{"title": "96-228", "content": "A helper in the construction industry is typically an unskilled worker who assists more skilled workers. They may have a range of skills but lack formal training. Helpers could also be craftsmen or journeymen forced by economic circumstances to take on lower-level work. They are usually not union members and are paid less than skilled workers. A helper in the construction industry is an unskilled worker who may perform equally well as a skilled craftsman for certain tasks. They are cheaper to employ and more flexible, making them a valuable addition to a work crew. Craft fragmentation allows managers to assign helpers to specific aspects of complex tasks. Helpers may work under the guidance of a more highly paid journeyman at the worksite. The debate over whether it is economical to have helpers working under a journeyman in the construction industry continues. Apprentices receive comprehensive training, while helpers only receive minimal training for the task at hand and are often seen as temporary workers. The Davis-Bacon Act plays a role in this discussion. The Davis-Bacon Act recognizes apprentices and trainees in formal programs for wage rate purposes but generally does not recognize helpers to protect prevailing wage structures. The Act requires construction contracts over $2,000 to state minimum wages. The Davis-Bacon Act requires construction contracts over $2,000 to state minimum wages based on prevailing rates determined by the Secretary of Labor. Congress delegated the responsibility to the Secretary to define concepts like \"wages\" and \"prevailing\" for projects similar to the contract work. The Davis-Bacon Act delegates the responsibility to the Secretary of Labor to define concepts like \"wages\" and \"prevailing\" for construction projects, which has been a focus of contention and litigation for over 60 years. Congress legislated in broad strokes, referring to \"classes of laborers and mechanics\" employed on public projects. The Davis-Bacon Act delegates the responsibility to the Secretary of Labor to define concepts like \"wages\" and \"prevailing\" for construction projects, focusing on \"classes of laborers and mechanics\" employed on public projects. The act does not mention \"helpers,\" \"trainees,\" or other skill groups, leaving further definition to the Secretary of Labor. The evolving regulations have focused on apprentices and trainees. The Davis-Bacon Act delegates the responsibility to the Secretary of Labor to define concepts like \"wages\" and \"prevailing\" for construction projects, focusing on \"classes of laborers and mechanics\" employed on public projects. The evolving regulations have focused on apprentices and trainees, with the term \"helper\" appearing casually without a precise definition or application in wage rate determinations. Business economist Armand Thieblot noted in 1975 that the regulations were filled with words that needed to be defined. The Davis-Bacon Act delegates the responsibility to the Secretary of Labor to define concepts like \"wages\" and \"prevailing\" for construction projects, focusing on \"classes of laborers and mechanics\" employed on public projects. Business economist Armand Thieblot noted in 1975 that regulations were filled with undefined terms, such as \"helper,\" which could impact prevailing wage determinations for open-shop firms bidding on covered construction projects in union areas. Thieblot highlighted the need for formal DOL-approved apprenticeship programs for workers to avoid reclassification as journeymen or laborers. The Davis-Bacon Act requires workers to be enrolled in a formal DOL-approved apprenticeship program to be considered journeymen for pay purposes. Helpers are only recognized in areas where open shop firms predominate, as unions rarely acknowledge this category. DOL's restrictions on apprentices, trainees, and helpers at sub-craft rates align with congressional intent. The Davis-Bacon Act requires workers to be enrolled in a formal DOL-approved apprenticeship program to be considered journeymen for pay purposes. Contractors may try to undercut prevailing wage rates by designating workers as apprentices or trainees. The Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD), AFL-CIO, views apprentices and trainees recognized by DOL as causing few problems. The Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD), AFL-CIO, criticizes the informal titles of \"helper\" and \"trainee\" for causing conflict. They argue that most trainees and helpers are temporary employees, released after project completion. BCTD believes that DOL's restriction on helpers impacts wage-cutting practices of non-union contractors, allowing them to underbid union contractors on federally funded projects. The use of helpers at sub-craft wages goes against the intent of the Davis-Bacon Act to address abuses in the industry. The Davis-Bacon Act aimed to address abuses in the industry, including the use of helpers at sub-craft wages. In the late 1970s, there was a push for reform or repeal of the Act through direct legislation or regulatory changes. The Carter Administration proposed a rule in 1979 to revise the administration of Davis-Bacon, which included adding new language. The proposed rule in 1979 aimed to establish two tests for the designation of a special classification of laborers and mechanics based on differences in work performed, not skill or supervisory functions. Prevailing wages for apprentices and trainees are not included in wage determinations, but their use is allowed. The proposed rule in 1979 aimed to establish two tests for the designation of a special wage rate for helpers: that helpers are utilized in the proposed work area and are distinguishable from other laborer and mechanic classifications. The final rule published in mid-January 1981 did not provide a definition for helpers, despite defining other terms like \"laborer\" and \"mechanic.\" The Department acknowledged concerns that only allowing apprentices and trainees under BAT approved programs for employment was limiting job opportunities for youths, minorities, and women. However, they emphasized that recognized apprenticeship and training programs were available for these groups to ensure genuine training and prevent exploitation. Payment of reduced wages to apprentices and trainees was noted as an exception to the Davis-Bacon Act, with strict conditions required. The Department acknowledged concerns about limiting job opportunities for youths, minorities, and women by only allowing apprentices and trainees under approved programs. Payment of reduced wages to apprentices and trainees was noted as an exception to the Davis-Bacon Act, with strict conditions required to prevent circumvention of the act's requirements. The final rule defined apprentice and trainee terms but not helper. Differences in wage determinations were based on work performed, not skill levels, to avoid confusion in procurement. The Department faced difficulties recognizing the use of helpers and determining prevailing wage rates. The Reagan Administration delayed and then withdrew Davis-Bacon regulations for further review. Consideration of the helper issue during this era spanned from a proposed rule in August 1981 to litigation through the remainder of the Reagan Administration. The Reagan Administration issued a new proposed rule for the Davis-Bacon Act in August 1981, allowing a helper classification on wage determinations to reflect actual industry practices. The Department recognized the need for this change due to the restrictive nature of previous regulations. The Reagan Administration proposed a new regulation for the Davis-Bacon Act in 1981, allowing helper wage determinations to be issued based on industry practices. The regulation defined helpers broadly and allowed one helper for every five journeymen, but prohibited the use of journeymen as helpers to prevent abuse. This marked a shift from the Carter Administration's regulations, emphasizing increased use of helpers when needed in the area. The concept of a \"helper\" was redefined as a semi-skilled worker who assists a journeyman by performing various tasks under their supervision, such as preparing materials, cleaning work areas, and carrying tools. This change in definition was part of the Reagan Administration's 1981 proposal to allow helper wage determinations based on industry practices. The Department of Labor redefined the concept of a \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker who assists a journeyman in performing tasks under supervision. The final Davis-Bacon rule was issued on May 28, 1995, after receiving approximately 2,200 comments, with over 1,000 specifically addressing the helper issue. The Department of Labor issued a final Davis-Bacon rule on May 28, 1995, redefining the concept of a \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker. The new standard increased the ratio of helpers to journeymen to two helpers for every three journeymen, allowing up to 40% of the on-site workforce to be helpers. This decision was made to better reflect the diversity in construction practices and localities, and it was supported by industry views while rejecting trade union concerns. The final Davis-Bacon rule redefined a \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker, increasing the ratio of helpers to journeymen to 2:3. This decision was met with sharp division, with critics like John Dunlop calling it \"categorically wrong\" and concerns raised about unlimited use of helpers within a craft. The final Davis-Bacon rule redefined a \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker, increasing the ratio of helpers to journeymen to 2:3. Industry favored this change, with the Associated General Contractors calling it the \"most far-reaching change\" and the American Farm Bureau Federation commending the Reagan administration for the revision. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also supported the new regulations. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce praised the new Davis-Bacon rules, allowing contractors to use semi-skilled workers at lower wages. The AFL-CIO expressed concern over the redefinition of the helper classification. The AFL-CIO filed a lawsuit to stop the changes in the helper requirement on federally-funded construction projects, arguing that it will harm minority workers and lead to wage-cutting practices. Judge Harold H. Greene of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia was set to rule on the matter before the final rule's implementation on July 27, 1982. In 1982, Judge Harold H. Greene issued a preliminary injunction against the Secretary of Labor regarding the helper provision under the Davis-Bacon Act. Congress was aware of employers classifying workers as \"helpers\" to avoid paying skilled laborers' wages, leading to breakdowns in wage standards. The report recommended construction contracts include provisions for minimum wages based on prevailing rates for different classes of laborers and mechanics, a concept central to the statutory scheme. The new regulations may allow the practice Congress sought to prevent in 1935. The statutory scheme emphasizes the importance of different classes of laborers and mechanics. The new regulations redefine helpers as \"general helpers\" who can perform any task in the construction field, potentially allowing them to take on various roles at the contractor's discretion. The contractors can assign helpers to perform tasks of different classes of laborers and mechanics at lower pay, potentially undermining the requirement for wages based on corresponding classes. This flexibility could lead to classification issues in the construction industry. The Davis-Bacon Act may be undermined by contractors who have the freedom to classify traditional craft work as they wish, potentially leading to the erosion of established wage standards in the construction industry. The new regulations allow for the use of helpers as long as they are \"identifiable,\" deviating from the requirement for prevailing wages for specific classes of laborers and mechanics. The new regulations under the Davis-Bacon Act allow for the use of helpers in construction work, deviating from the requirement for prevailing wages for specific classes of laborers and mechanics. This change may lead to helpers being employed in substitution of traditional craft workers throughout an area, which goes against the central purpose of the Act. Judge Greene expressed doubt that this regulation will be allowed to stand due to its departure from prior practice. Judge Green, in response to the Davis-Bacon regulations allowing for the use of helpers in construction work, issued a permanent injunction against the implementation of the helper rule. This decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1983. The U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, partially upheld and partially overturned Judge Greene's decision on the helper issue in the spring of 1983. They ruled that the provision allowing for helper classifications to be 'identifiable' in an area should be struck down as it undermines the act's purpose of mirroring local wages on federal construction projects. The Appeals Court also highlighted the potential for downgrading work classifications, leading to reduced wages. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld part of Judge Greene's decision on the helper issue in 1983, ruling against the provision allowing for identifiable helper classifications, which could lead to underclassification and reduced wages on federal construction projects. The Appeals Court supported the Secretary of Labor's efforts to align wage rates with local practices. The Appeals Court upheld part of Judge Greene's decision on the helper issue in 1983, supporting the Secretary of Labor's efforts to align wage rates with local practices. The court split on the helper issue, accepting the new definition of \"helper\" but blocking implementation of the helper rule as it could lead to underclassification and reduced wages on federal construction projects. The unions appealed the decision, but in January 1984, the regulation remained in effect. In January 1984, the Supreme Court declined to hear the unions' appeal on the helper rule. The Secretary of Labor had to restructure the regulation to gain judicial approval. By January 31, 1985, DOL implemented approved portions of the general rule, while the helper regulation remained under review. In August 1987, a new proposed rule on helpers was issued, conforming to Judge Greene's standard on \"prevailing\" but still facing challenges in defining the term. In August 1987, a new proposed rule on helpers was issued, conforming to Judge Greene's standard on \"prevailing.\" Defining \"prevailing\" remained a problem, with the Department setting forth several options for determination and calling for public comment. A revised final rule was published on January 27, 1989, but had to be cleared through the District Court due to a 1982 injunction. Judge Greene vacated the injunction on September 24, 1990, allowing DOL to implement the helper regulation. In 1990, Judge Greene vacated the injunction, allowing DOL to implement the helper regulation. Building trades unions appealed immediately. The Department notified that the helper rule would start on February 4, 1991, and contractors were asked to report helper, apprentice, and trainee details. Congress intervened with a bill in April 1991, preventing funds for the helper regulations. In 1990, Judge Greene vacated the injunction, allowing DOL to implement the helper regulation. Building trades unions appealed immediately. The Department notified that the helper rule would start on February 4, 1991, and contractors were asked to report helper, apprentice, and trainee details. Congress intervened with a bill in April 1991, preventing funds for the helper regulations. The Secretary of Labor was barred from further activity with respect to the helper regulation until the end of the fiscal year. Requests for funding to implement the regulation in the FY1992 budget were denied, leading to a dispute over whether the restriction was temporary or permanent. The Appeals Court ruled that the ratio of helpers to journeymen in the Department's regulations was \"arbitrary and capricious,\" declaring this provision invalid. The court criticized the fixed ratio as lacking rational decision-making and being arbitrary in a regulatory scheme designed to implement prevailing practices. The Appeals Court found the Department's regulation on the ratio of helpers to journeymen to be arbitrary and capricious. The court criticized the fixed ratio as lacking rational decision-making and being arbitrary in implementing prevailing practices. The Department later issued a new rule removing the fixed ratio, allowing for an open-ended interpretation. The Department's decision to implement the helper regulation in 1992 was seen as a blow to building trades unions and a victory for industry critics. Debate continued on the regulation's impact on manpower utilization, labor costs, and project costs. The Davis-Bacon Act faced challenges in terms of costs, with calls for reform through legislation or rulemaking. Senator Nickles introduced legislation in 1982 to amend the act by including \"laborers, mechanics, helpers, or any combination thereof.\" Senator Nickles introduced legislation in 1982 to amend the Davis-Bacon Act by adding the classification of \"helper\" to workers. Despite unsuccessful attempts to codify the regulations, the helper issue resurfaced in Congress in 1993 during consideration of H.R. 2518. Senator Nickles introduced legislation in 1982 to add the classification of \"helper\" to workers under the Davis-Bacon Act. He argued that allowing helpers on federal projects would save the government $600 million annually and create over 250,000 jobs. Senator Harkin opposed the proposal, citing the age of the regulations and the potential waste of taxpayer money. Senator Nickles introduced legislation in 1982 to add the classification of \"helper\" to workers under the Davis-Bacon Act, arguing it would save $600 million annually and create over 250,000 jobs. Senator Harkin disputed the impact on minority workers and apprentice training programs, questioning the claimed savings from the helper regulation. The committee's amendment to suspend implementation of DOL's helper regulations for one year was passed by a vote of 60 yeas to 39 nays, resulting in $600 million in savings. The House Appropriations Committee later defeated a proposal to remove the helper funding restraint from a pending DOL appropriations measure. Representative DeLay urged the deletion of the restrictive language during floor debate on the issue. DeLay urged the removal of the restrictive language in the helper regulations to lower costs, increase job opportunities, and support small contractors. Representative Ford argued that the Davis-Bacon requirement ensures fair wages, quality construction, and long-term savings by preventing the shift of work from skilled journeymen to lower-paid helpers. Representative Ford argued against the DeLay amendment, stating that it would undermine apprenticeship training programs by shifting work from skilled journeymen to lower-paid helpers. He also mentioned the Department's plan to issue revised helpers regulations and urged the defeat of the amendment. The DeLay amendment was ultimately defeated. The DeLay amendment, which aimed to prevent the implementation of helper regulations, was defeated by a voice vote. Congress has attempted to modify the Davis-Bacon Act through various means, including repealing the statute. Senator Kassebaum introduced a bill calling for the repeal of Davis-Bacon and the related Copeland Act. The bill calling for the repeal of the Davis-Bacon and Copeland Acts was referred to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, chaired by the Senator. The Committee voted along party lines to report the measure after a hearing. In parallel, a similar bill was introduced in the House and referred to the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, receiving a mixed reception before being reported to the full Committee on Economic and Educational. During the summer and fall of 1995, additional measures were introduced as the repeal legislation moved towards floor consideration. S. 1183 (Hatfield) and H.R. 2472 (Weldon) were seen as compromises to reform rather than repeal the Davis-Bacon Act. Representative Weldon argued that repealing Davis-Bacon would harm skilled construction workers and their families. The Hatfield and Weldon bills proposed comprehensive revisions to the Davis-Bacon Act, including language on helpers. The Hatfield/Weldon bills proposed revisions to the Davis-Bacon Act, including language on helpers. The bills did not fully resolve the technical issues surrounding the classification of helpers. The Hatfield/Weldon bills proposed revisions to the Davis-Bacon Act, including language on helpers, but did not fully resolve the technical issues involved in helper classification. The term \"prevails\" remained undefined, and no ratio of helpers to journeymen was established. No action was taken on the legislation by the 104th Congress. In November 1993, the Department suspended the helper regulation under mandate from Congress. The spending prohibition continued until mid-fiscal 1996, with no prohibition in the latter half of fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1997. In June 1996, the Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) sued the Department to enforce the revised helper regulations, stating that the exclusion of helpers had cost taxpayers. ABC President Gary Hess stated that the exclusion of helpers has cost taxpayers over $500 million annually. He emphasized the need to align public construction practices with industry standards. Assistant Secretary of Labor Bernard Anderson later deemed the current helper regulation unenforceable due to unclear distinctions between helpers and other workers. The Department has no plans to implement the regulation in its current form. The Department of Labor (DOL) stated that they had no intention of implementing the current helper regulation. The DOL mentioned that additional information had become available over the years, warranting a review of the suspended rule. The original purpose of the regulation was to create a construction workforce. The Department of Labor explained that they believed the helper regulation would align federal construction projects with the private sector and save costs. However, new data showed that the use of helpers may not be as widespread as initially thought, raising concerns about potential abuse of the regulation. The Department of Labor expressed concerns about the potential for abuse of the helper classification to justify lower wages and its impact on apprenticeship programs. Due to Congressional controversy and lack of public comment, DOL recommended reexamining the semi-skilled helper regulation. The Department of Labor decided to continue the suspension of the court-approved rule on helper regulations, citing potential disruption and uncertainty. They are engaging in substantive rulemaking and requested public comments, receiving 47 submissions from industry and trade. The Department of Labor received 47 submissions on the suspension of the helper rule, with most comments focusing on substantive issues rather than the immediate suspension. The Building and Construction Trades Department supported the suspension, while the Associated General Contractors disagreed, suggesting a quicker implementation. The Department of Labor disputed the Associated General Contractors' suggestion that the reevaluation process could be done in 60 days with little disruption. The Department stated that based on past experience, it would take longer than 60 days to fully implement the helper regulations. If the suspended rule were to be implemented immediately, it would have a 60-day effective date for affected parties to comply. The Department of Labor stated that implementing the helper regulations would take longer than 60 days based on past experience. Bid solicitations must be advertised for 30 to 60 days before a contract is awarded under the new regulations. Conforming changes in government procurement regulations and standard contract forms would also be necessary. The Department of Labor stated that implementing helper regulations would take longer than 60 days due to the need for wage determination and prevailing practice surveys. The Department aims to complete substantive rulemaking within a year. The Department of Labor aims to complete substantive rulemaking within a year and concluded that implementing helper regulations during this period would cause disruption and uncertainty. Comments received did not change the Department's decision to continue the suspension of the helper regulation. The Department of Labor has not decided to repeal helper regulations but will reexamine the basis and effect of semi-skilled helper regulations. New data suggests that the use of helpers may not be as widespread as initially thought. The Department will decide if any changes are needed and publish a proposed rule for public comment. The Department of Labor expressed concerns about the administration and potential abuse of the helper classification regulation, as well as its impact on formal apprenticeship programs. They are willing to explore private sector helper utilization further but noted the potential for abuse as a significant issue. The Department of Labor is concerned about the subjective nature of the helper classification, which may make enforcement more difficult. Critics of the regulation have expressed concerns about its impact. Critics of the regulation (then suspended) are worried about its potential impact on apprenticeship and training. They argue that paying apprentices less than journeymen serves as a crucial incentive for contractors to engage in formal training programs. The availability of lower-paid helpers could lead to contractors pulling out of these programs, jeopardizing private funding for apprenticeship and training. This could result in industry labor shortages and leave workers stuck in low-skilled, dead-end jobs. The Department of Labor noted concerns about the impact of the regulation on apprenticeship and training programs. Industry views helpers as entry-level workers, providing opportunities for skill development and advancement. The helper classification is seen as a way for unskilled workers to gain experience and potentially enter apprenticeship programs. The Department of Labor suspended the helper regulation to further understand the helper/apprentice relationship. The Associated Builders and Contractors filed a lawsuit to implement the regulations. In July 1997, the U.S. District Court ruled that the Department of Labor had acted properly in suspending the helper regulations due to a congressional prohibition on expenditure. Judge Stanley Sporkin noted that while there was good cause for the suspension in 1993, the validity of the suspension after the congressional prohibition expired was questioned. Judge Sporkin ruled that the Department of Labor was not obligated to implement the regulations once the spending ban expired in April 1996. He stated that the Department had the freedom to review and update the regulations during the two-and-a-half year period before the ban expired. Judge Sporkin noted that the Department of Labor collected new data on helper employment, undermining key assumptions behind revised regulations. This raised doubts about cost-savings on federal construction projects. The Department was not required to ignore new information discovered in the two-and-a-half years since the regulations were last implemented. Judge Sporkin pointed out that the Department of Labor's new data on helper employment undermines key assumptions behind revised regulations, casting doubt on cost-savings for federal construction projects. He noted that the Department should have sought an indefinite postponement of the effective date based on this new information. Despite criticism for a three-month delay in publishing the notice of intent to suspend implementation, Judge Sporkin deemed the claim attacking the delay moot. Judge Sporkin found that the plaintiffs focused on the substance of helper regulations rather than procedural issues. They provided little evidence that the delays by the Department of Labor were arbitrary and capricious. The court deemed the Department's rationale for the delays reasonable. The Department of Labor's rationale for delaying the implementation of helper regulations was deemed reasonable by Judge Sporkin. Despite claims that the regulations would reduce government construction costs by $600 million, more recent data and assumptions called this into question. The court ruled in favor of the DOL, leading to the indefinite suspension of the helper regulation. The DOL published a new proposed rule in the Federal Register on the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects, reaffirming its longstanding policy and reflecting current practice. The Department of Labor published a new proposed rule in the Federal Register regarding the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects, reaffirming its policy and reflecting current practices. The rule would allow the use of helpers on covered projects under specific conditions, distinguishing their duties from journeyman or laborers and ensuring that helpers are not synonymous with trainees in informal training programs. The notice also discussed the Department's initiatives, court rulings, and Congressional restraints on implementing a new helper rule. The Department of Labor's new proposed rule on the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects aimed to align with industry practices and provide job opportunities for unskilled workers, especially women and minorities. However, after years of analysis, it was found that the rule may not be effectively enforced and the use of helpers in the private sector is not as widespread as initially expected. The Department of Labor's suspended rule on the use of helpers in the private sector may have a negative impact on apprenticeship and training. The agency found that the rule posed significant administrative difficulties and could not be effectively enforced. This contrasts with the Clinton Administration's findings, indicating a shift back to pre-1980s practices. The Department of Labor suspended a rule on the use of helpers in the private sector due to significant administrative difficulties and enforcement challenges. The definition of \"helper\" was criticized for being internally inconsistent and not distinguishable from a general laborer. Wage and Hour struggled with identifying job classifications based on tasks performed and determining the line between semi-skilled and skilled journeyworkers. The Department of Labor suspended a rule on the use of helpers in the private sector due to administrative difficulties. They questioned how to distinguish between semi-skilled and skilled workers, if a semi-skilled helper could become skilled, and if a skilled worker could work as a helper without violating regulations. The Department of Labor argued that the definition of a semi-skilled helper in the suspended rule does not provide clear guidance on distinguishing them from other workers on the worksite, leading to overlap in duties between helpers and laborers. The Department of Labor highlighted the significant overlap between the duties of helpers and laborers, making it difficult to distinguish helpers as a separate classification. The term 'helper' has multiple meanings in the construction industry, leading to subjective definitions. The Department questioned the effectiveness of any regulatory definition for helpers in reflecting the industry's practices. The Department of Labor found it challenging to determine wages for helpers in the construction industry due to varying definitions of the term. Survey data revealed that the use of helpers was lower than initially assumed, leading to difficulties in defining their role. The Department of Labor has found challenges in defining wages for construction helpers. Survey data suggests formal training programs are more effective than informal on-the-job training. The Department aims to encourage training for unskilled and semi-skilled workers. The Department of Labor aims to encourage training for unskilled and semi-skilled workers, including women and minorities, by allowing lower rates of pay in structured training programs. The proposed new helper rule aims to prevent contractors from using helpers instead of apprentices and trainees in formal programs. The comment period for the new rule ends on June 8, 1999. The Department of Labor is working on a new helper rule to encourage training for unskilled and semi-skilled workers. Representative Norwood introduced legislation to establish helpers as a separate classification under the Davis-Bacon Act. The proposal (H.R. 1012) redefined \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker assisting a journeyman with various tasks. Introduced on March 4, 1999, the bill was referred to the Committee on Education. The bill H.R. 1012, introduced in March 1999, redefined \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker assisting a journeyman. The Department of Labor (DOL) reviewed the legislation but found it imprecise and burdensome. In November 2000, DOL issued a final rule on the use of helpers on Davis-Bacon projects. The Department amended regulations to recognize helpers as a separate category of workers, effective January 19, 2001. DOL explained why previous proposed regulations were not satisfactory. The Department amended regulations to recognize helpers as a separate category of workers, effective January 19, 2001. DOL concluded that the suspended rule defining helpers would be difficult to administer and enforce, opting for a duties-based approach. The BCTD of the AFL-CIO seemed to agree, while industry spokespersons disagreed, suggesting helper classes could be identified through area practice surveys. The Department emphasized that laborers or mechanics should be paid prevailing rates based on duties performed. The Department amended regulations to recognize helpers as a separate category of workers, effective January 19, 2001. DOL concluded that the suspended rule defining helpers would be difficult to administer and enforce. The rule would allow helpers to perform the duties of other classifications without limitations, making it hard to identify their work for enforcement and wage determination purposes. This could lead to helpers performing work of other classifications at lower wages. The Department of Labor (DOL) found that the suspended rule defining helpers would undermine the prevailing wage structure. DOL stated that it was difficult to draw the line between semi-skilled and skilled work, as skilled craft workers may perform a range of duties. The vague criteria in the rule would not effectively differentiate between different levels of work. The Department of Labor (DOL) expressed concerns about the suspended rule defining helpers, stating that supervision on a construction worksite is often ambiguous and not easily evaluated. DOL emphasized the definitional ambiguities of the rule and the challenges it posed for conducting meaningful wage determinations. The Mercatus Center at George Mason University raised concerns about the impact of the suspended rule defining helpers, noting potential differences in interpretation by contractors. They highlighted the productivity and cost-saving benefits of the rule, while the Department of Labor emphasized the challenges in enforcement and administration. The Department stated that cost-saving features cannot outweigh the need for effective regulation consistent with its goals. The Department of Labor stated that a regulation must align with the goals of the statute to protect prevailing wages. They emphasized that the Davis-Bacon Act aims to set a wage floor, not to secure cheap labor, and highlighted that helpers are used less widely than previously thought. The Department of Labor found that the use of helpers in construction was much lower than previously projected, with only 3.9% of classifications employing helpers. Estimates ranged from 1.2% to slightly higher percentages, indicating a significant discrepancy from initial projections. The Department of Labor found that the use of helpers in construction was lower than projected, with estimates ranging from 1.2% to slightly higher percentages. The Department expressed concerns about the impact of suspended helper regulations on formal apprenticeship and training programs in the construction industry. The Department of Labor expressed concerns that suspended helper regulations in the construction industry could undermine effective training programs by allowing contractors to use low-wage helpers instead of apprentices. Building trades unions argued that this practice would disadvantage contractors supporting formal apprenticeship programs and weaken the overall apprentice training system. The Department of Labor expressed concerns that suspended helper regulations in the construction industry could undermine apprentice training programs. Unions feared a shortage of skilled workers, but employers disagreed, suggesting helpers as a viable alternative. The Department emphasized the importance of formal structured training programs over informal on-the-job training. The Department of Labor and unions are concerned that suspended helper regulations in the construction industry could undermine formal apprenticeship and training programs. They fear that the use of helpers could replace apprentices and trainees, leading to a shortage of skilled workers. The Department emphasizes the importance of structured training programs over informal on-the-job training. The final rule restores the definition of helper on DBRA-covered projects, ensuring distinct classification only where duties are clearly defined, prevailing practice, and not employed as a trainee. The final rule restores the definition of helper on DBRA-covered projects, ensuring distinct classification only where duties are clearly defined, prevailing practice, and not employed as a trainee. In the 107th Congress on May 23, 2001, Representative Norwood introduced legislation dealing with the helper issue. In the 108th Congress, Representative Marsha Blackburn introduced the \"Helpers Job Opportunity Act\" (H.R. 2283) along with Representatives Norwood and Steve King. The proposal aimed to classify helpers separately for Davis-Bacon purposes and ensure they are paid the prevailing wage of helpers and laborers or mechanics on similar projects in the locality. In the 108th Congress, Representative Marsha Blackburn introduced the \"Helpers Job Opportunity Act\" (H.R. 2283) to classify helpers separately for Davis-Bacon purposes and ensure they are paid the prevailing wage of helpers and laborers or mechanics on similar projects in the locality. The proposal defined a \"helper\" as a semi-skilled worker who assists a journeyman under supervision, but no action was taken on the bill in subsequent committees. In the 109th Congress, Representative Blackburn reintroduced the \"Helpers Job Opportunities Act\" (H.R. 3907) with Representative Norwood. The measure was referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce, then to the Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, but no action was taken. The issue of helpers did not resurface in the 110th Congress, while the Davis-Bacon Act continued to be a focus of public policy debate. The oversight of the Davis-Bacon Act led to the inclusion of fringe benefits in prevailing wage calculations in 1964. Further reviews and rulemaking took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with regulations proposed by the Carter Administration and later withdrawn under Reagan. Litigation ensued over the issue of helpers in the proposed regulations. The helper provision of the Davis-Bacon Act faced delays in implementation, finally winning approval in 1992 after a decade of proposals. However, Congress intervened and blocked enforcement until 1996. The Department of Labor later deemed the regulation \"non-administrable\" and suspended it for further review, leading to a lack of enforcement. Associated Builders and Contractors sought court order for enforcement of the regulation in summer 1996. The Department reopened the rulemaking process and suspended implementation of the regulation in December 1996. DOL reverted to the status quo of the late 1970s. The Department indicated new evidence had been developed, leading to a reassessment of the regulation. In July 1997, the United States District Court ruled in favor of the Department. In 1997, the US District Court ruled in favor of the Department regarding the withdrawal of the helper regulation. In April 1999, a new proposed rule was published reinstating the Department's practice on helpers. The final helper rule was published in November 2000, taking effect in January 2001 after a 2-decade process. The wage treatment of helpers employed on Davis-Bacon projects underwent a lengthy process spanning over 2 decades. The Department of Labor struggled to fully implement the regulation, defending various versions of proposed reforms between 1981 and 1993. However, after reassessing its position post-1993, the Department reverted to its 1970s practice for helpers with the release of a new rule in April 1999. The final rule in November 2000 largely rejected the helper policy of the 1980s and 1990s. In November 2000, the Department of Labor repudiated its helper policy from the 1980s and 1990s. Congress debated and endorsed a new helper classification, but legislation introducing a separate \"helper\" classification on Davis-Bacon projects did not pass in the 109th Congress. The issue has not resurfaced in the 110th Congress."}

Subsequent developments such as the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 and Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-19 provided more specific protections for IC whistleblowers. In 2018, Congress passed P.L. 115-118 to address gaps in protections for Intelligence Community (IC) contractors. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA) assists IC whistleblowers excluded from the Whistleblower Protection Act. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA) was passed to assist whistleblowers in the Intelligence Community (IC) who are excluded from the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. It allows IC government employees or contractors to report complaints or information to the Inspector General of their agency, addressing gaps in protections for IC contractors. The ICWPA defines formal processes for submitting complaints to protect classified information. The IG must report credible complaints to the CIA Director or agency head, who then reports to congressional intelligence committees. If the IG fails to report accurately, employees or contractors can directly submit complaints to Congress after notifying the IG. The ICWPA provides a process for IC whistleblowers to report complaints to Congress via the relevant IC agency IG. However, it lacks specific provisions for protecting whistleblowers from reprisal or punishment. The IAA for FY2010 included the first general provisions for whistleblower protection as part of legislation establishing the OIGIC. The Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (OIGIC), led by the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (IGIC), was established under the IAA for FY2010. Section 103H of the National Security Act of 1947 allowed lawful disclosures to the IGIC for investigating violations of laws, rules, or regulations within the Director of National Intelligence's authorities. The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community investigates complaints of violations of laws, rules, or regulations within the Director of National Intelligence's authorities. The identity of the employee making the complaint is kept confidential unless unavoidable during the investigation or disclosed to the Department of Justice. No reprisals or threats are allowed against the employee. The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community investigates complaints of violations of laws, rules, or regulations within the Director of National Intelligence's authorities. No reprisals or threats are allowed against the employee who makes a complaint or discloses information to the Inspector General. Section 405 covers contractors as well as federal employees of IC elements, granting access to any employee or contractor needed for the Inspector General's duties. Employees within the intelligence community can report complaints or information to the Inspector General without fear of reprisal. Protections against reprisals for lawful disclosures were clarified by the IAA for FY2010 and PPD-19. Protecting Whistleblowers with Access to Classified Information, signed by President Obama on October 10, 2012, provided executive branch protections for IC whistleblowers. PPD-19 specifically protects employees in the IC with access to classified information from reprisals for making lawful disclosures. PPD-19 protects employees in the Intelligence Community with access to classified information from reprisals for making lawful disclosures of violations of laws or regulations, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or dangers to public health or safety. It prohibits reprisals that could impact a whistleblower's access to classified information or involve personnel actions against the employee. PPD-19 protects Intelligence Community employees who make lawful disclosures from reprisals. The process includes certification to the DNI, review of personnel actions, and determination by the IC element Inspector General. Corrective actions are recommended if a violation is found, and the agency head must consider the IG's findings and recommendations. The agency head does not have to accept an IG's recommendation for corrective action. IC agencies must certify to the DNI that there is a review process allowing employees to appeal actions related to access to classified information. PPD-19 allows whistleblowers to request an external review by an IG panel chaired by the IGIC if the agency review process is exhausted. If the panel decides in the employee's favor, the agency must consider the recommendation but is not required to accept it. The IGIC must report annually to congressional intelligence committees on determinations and recommendations, including IC element head responses. PDD-19 mandates training for employees with classified information access on whistleblower protections. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA provides statutory protections for IC whistleblowers against reprisal actions. IC whistleblowers are protected from reprisal actions for lawful disclosures to specified individuals or entities, as outlined in Section 601 of Title VI. This includes disclosures to the Director of National Intelligence, Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, employing agency heads, appropriate inspector generals, congressional intelligence committees, or their members. No specific protections are mentioned in Section 601 of Title VI. Section 601 of Title VI protects IC whistleblowers from reprisal for lawful disclosures to specified individuals or entities. It defines lawful disclosure as a violation of federal law, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health and safety. Section 602 provides protections against retaliatory revocation of security clearance for covered government employee whistleblowers. It also mandates the development of appeal policies for decisions affecting a whistleblower's security clearance. ICD-120, Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection, provides guidance for protecting whistleblowers in the Intelligence Community. It includes provisions for protecting whistleblowers from reprisal involving personnel actions and allows them to retain their current employment status during the appeal process. The provision does not allow for judicial review or a private right of action. Protections under ICD-120 include safeguards against reprisal for whistleblowers in the Intelligence Community, covering personnel actions and access to classified information. It also mandates a review process for security clearance decisions related to lawful disclosures, allowing whistleblowers to maintain employment status during appeals. The ICD-120 provides protections for whistleblowers in the Intelligence Community, including safeguards against reprisal and access to classified information. It also allows whistleblowers to request an External Review Panel chaired by the IGIC after exhausting internal agency review processes. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code offers protections against retaliation for protected communications by members of the Armed Forces in the IC elements. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code allows members of the Armed Forces in the Intelligence Community to make protected communications to various entities without fear of retaliation. It does not address protecting classified information in the process. The curr_chunk discusses the protection of Armed Forces members who make protected communications, outlining prohibited personnel actions and measures to mitigate hardship. It also mandates updates during investigations and sets standards for investigations and training for Inspectors General. The curr_chunk discusses inconsistencies in whistleblower protection for contractors in existing legislation, with efforts in Congress to address the gap. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 2002 in 2017 to provide protections for Intelligence Community (IC) employees, including contractors, from retaliation for making protected disclosures. The bill included provisions for a complaint process. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 794 in 2015 to extend protections for contractor employees on contracts with IC elements who make whistleblower complaints. Congress later passed P.L. 115-118 in 2018, amending the National Security Act to provide protections for IC contractor employees. Section 1104 of the National Security Act of 1947 was amended to provide protections for IC contractor whistleblowers, allowing them to make lawful disclosures to specified entities. These protections are similar to those for IC employees under Title VI of the IAA for FY2014. Section 110 ensures unambiguous protections for IC contractors. Section 110 of the National Security Act of 1947 provides clear protections for IC contractors who make lawful complaints against retaliatory personnel actions. These protections cover a wide range of issues, including violations of federal laws or regulations, gross mismanagement, waste of funds, and abuse of authority. Section 110 of the National Security Act of 1947 offers protections for IC contractors who report misconduct, including unauthorized actions, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. These protections also apply to contractors of the FBI's Intelligence Branch, safeguarding them from retaliatory actions for lawful whistleblower disclosures. The DOD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (H.R. 4870) redirected $2 million to fund the IC Whistleblower and Source Protection Directorate within the OIGIC. The funds supported hiring investigators and support staff to enhance the IGIC's ability to investigate fraud, waste, and abuse, addressing an underfunded capability for responsive follow-up on whistleblower complaints."}
{"title": "108_s2981", "content": "The Act titled \"Conventional Arms Threat Reduction Act of 2004\" is cited as the short title. The findings and sense of Congress are outlined in the following sections. The global proliferation of MANPADS, small arms, light weapons, and tactical missile systems poses a direct threat to US national security. Their use by terrorists hampers peace efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the spread of missile systems threatens international peace and security. The Government Accountability Office estimates there are 500,000 to 750,000 MANPADS worldwide. Many countries have these weapons but lack the means to eliminate or secure them. The US lacks a program to help other countries reduce conventional arms threats and eliminate tactical missiles.

{"title": "R43456", "content": "Airline passenger screening in the United States has evolved significantly since the 9/11 attacks, with new technologies and policy changes overseen by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) created under the Aviation Transportation and Security Act (ATSA). The Aviation Transportation and Security Act (ATSA; P.L. 107-71) mandated TSA to provide comprehensive security screening for all airline passengers and property. Congress later directed TSA to implement trusted traveler programs and utilize technologies to expedite screening, allowing focus on passengers needing more extensive checks. Additionally, TSA was tasked with checking all airline passengers against terrorist watchlists. The TSA has primarily relied on a uniform risk assumption for airport checkpoint screening, despite challenges in implementing risk-based strategies. This contrasts with their approach to other aspects of aviation security, such as air cargo and charter operators. Efforts to improve screening have focused on technology like whole-body imagers and advanced X-ray equipment. The TSA has focused on technology such as whole-body imagers and advanced X-ray equipment to improve airport screening. However, constraints like budgetary limitations and space constraints at airports have hindered a solely technology-driven approach. TSA personnel face challenges in screening passengers efficiently without causing long wait times. The TSA has implemented technology to enhance airport screening, but budget and space constraints limit its effectiveness. Passengers still endure cumbersome security procedures, leading to unpredictable wait times and criticism from experts like former TSA Administrator Kip Hawley. Public perception of TSA's performance remains mixed. The TSA has shifted to a risk-based screening approach in response to criticisms of a brittle security system. Controversy surrounds the focus on passengers with elevated security risks, with differing views on how to assess and mitigate risk. The focus on security efforts should be informed by the advice to prioritize the main point and not try to defend everything at once. Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff emphasized that in a free society, perfect security is unattainable. Despite its imperfections, security can still be configured in an informed manner. In aviation security, risk is understood as a complex interaction of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Strategies are developed to mitigate these risks by understanding their nature and characteristics. Probability values are assigned to threats and vulnerabilities to manage security effectively. In aviation security, risk is managed by assigning probability values to threats and vulnerabilities. Risk-based practices use categorical techniques and scoring methods to quantify security risk. Passenger screening focuses on detecting and managing threats through identifying individuals and using detection technologies. Vulnerabilities are also addressed in a comprehensive risk-based aviation security strategy. In aviation security, vulnerabilities are identified through assessment techniques and addressed with multiple security layers. Consequences are assessed for severity to determine risk valuation and assess security strategies. Emergency management and response activities primarily mitigate consequences and are the responsibility of airports and airlines. In aviation security, risk assessment and strategy implementation are key challenges. TSA utilizes risk scoring for air cargo security but not for commercial passenger aviation due to complexity and controversy. Airlines, airports, and emergency management agencies are responsible for recovery activities. Risk assessment of airline passengers is primarily done through categorical processes, such as assigning passengers to different threat categories based on biographical data and behavioral indicators. The validity of behavioral-based risk scores has been questioned, and there is a lack of agreement on the specific risks a risk-based security strategy should address. Following TSA's March 2013 proposal to allow passengers to carry small knives and certain sports equipment onboard aircraft, the agency claimed that the threat had diminished. They argued that armed air marshals, armed pilots, and reinforced cockpit doors were sufficient to mitigate the risk of a hijacking or terrorist attack posed by these items. Critics, including flight attendants and pilots' organizations, disagreed. Critics, including flight attendants, pilots, and airlines, opposed TSA's proposal to allow small knives and sports equipment onboard planes, citing risks from unruly passengers. Legislation was introduced to prevent TSA from lifting the ban on small knives, leading TSA to abandon the proposal. This shift in approach towards risk-based passenger screening contrasts with TSA's previous focus on prohibiting certain items. Former TSA administrator Hawley expressed concerns about this change. Former TSA administrator Hawley and Israeli expert Ron raise concerns about TSA's focus on prohibited items lists and detection technology, which may hinder the security system's ability to adapt to evolving threats. Ron highlights that the box cutters used in the 9/11 attacks were not prohibited at the time, emphasizing the need for a more dynamic approach to security. Ron and Hawley criticize TSA's reliance on detection technology and prohibited items lists, arguing that terrorists can easily bypass these measures. They suggest a more dynamic approach to security that integrates detection technologies with other threat assessment measures to minimize vulnerabilities. This approach would move away from TSA's traditional rigid screening methods. Advocates suggest a proactive, flexible, and unpredictable approach to security, citing Israel's use of demographic profiling and extensive security interviews to identify high-risk passengers. Israel's methods have successfully prevented major terrorist attacks. Israel has successfully prevented major terrorist attacks against its airlines and airports for over 40 years. The effectiveness of its methods in deterring or preventing such attacks is uncertain. Implementing an Israeli-style approach in the United States is seen as problematic due to legal and practical concerns. Research suggests that a risk-based approach tailored to the US aviation security framework would be more effective, politically feasible, socially acceptable, and legally defensible than extensive interviewing and targeted screening. Table 1 outlines key attributes of a risk-based aviation security framework, which is considered more effective and legally defensible than the Israeli airport security model. Risk-based screening is part of a multi-layered approach to aviation security, allowing TSA to focus resources on unknown and elevated risk passengers and adapt security measures based on perceived threats. Risk-based programs influence decisions on security postures, including the deployment of air marshals and behavioral detection officers. These approaches have been in use since the early 1970s, allowing for targeted screening of high-risk passengers. Details on how these security components interact have not been publicly disclosed. In the late 1970s, risk-based passenger profiling techniques were largely abandoned with the deployment of metal detectors and X-ray scanners at airports. However, the FAA continued to use profiling tools to examine passenger name records for potential threats. In the late 1980s, FAA required airlines to ask all passengers basic security questions to address concerns over aircraft bombings. The FAA required airlines to ask passengers basic security questions before flights to address concerns over aircraft bombings. The questions aimed to target elevated-risk checked baggage and raise passenger awareness of security threats. Despite criticism for their obvious intent, the questions reflected the real threat posed by bombers trying to deceive individuals into carrying devices aboard aircraft. Following the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing in 1988, the Computer-Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening (CAPPS) system was developed by FAA and airlines to identify potential security threats using flight reservation data patterns. TSA eliminated the use of security questions in 2006, which were previously used by some countries and airlines for security screening. The CAPPS system, now overseen by TSA, uses security-sensitive algorithms to identify potential threats, such as purchasing one-way tickets or paying with cash. After 9/11, TSA was directed to establish trusted traveler programs and expedite screening for participating passengers. The CAPPS system overseen by TSA uses security algorithms to identify potential threats and expedite screening for participating passengers. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act directed TSA to ensure all passengers are evaluated before boarding, with an emphasis on risk-based screening. The Security Rapid Response Team, formed after 9/11, recommended a nationwide program for vetting passengers to expedite processing and focus security resources effectively. TSA started work on CAPPS II, which aimed to include identity authentication, watch list checks, and expanded risk assessments for passengers. CAPPS II was initially designed to integrate checks of passenger name records against the \"no fly\" and \"selectee\" lists, categorize passengers based on threat assessments, and use additional databases. Privacy concerns led to the project being scrapped in 2004, with TSA focusing on screening all passengers against terrorist watchlists instead. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving the \"no fly\" and \"automatic selectee\" lists in 2004, urging TSA to screen passengers against a larger set of federal watchlists. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required TSA to take over passenger watchlist screening from air carriers. TSA took over passenger watchlist screening from air carriers, utilizing the Terrorist Screening Database. The program, called \"Secure Flight,\" began in 2009 for domestic flights and 2010 for international flights, fully operational since 2011. TSA is prohibited from using algorithms or commercial data for passenger risk assessment. Since 2011, Secure Flight has been screening passenger biographic information against terrorist watchlists, including the TSDB. The TSDB contains fewer than 400,000 names, with about 50,000 identities on the \"no fly\" or \"selectee\" lists. The TIDE repository, a source of foreign identities in the TSDB, has grown to include about 875,000 names as of May 2013. The TIDE repository, a key source of foreign terrorist identities in the TSDB, has expanded to include around 875,000 names. The TSDB itself has also grown, now containing over 500,000 identities as of September 2012. Improving watchlist practices, particularly in processing nominations and removals for accuracy and timeliness, has been a major focus for the intelligence community. Secure Flight, a focus of intelligence community efforts since the attempted bombing, compares airline passenger data against watchlists to determine access denial or additional screening. It also checks passenger names against CDC lists for boarding restrictions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determines who should be denied boarding for public health reasons. TSA destroys records within seven days if no watchlist match is found, but potential matches are kept for 7 years. Confirmed matches can be retained for up to 99 years. Lists of known travelers and individuals disqualified from expedited screening are kept until updated. Secure Flight was developed based on experience with the Advance Passenger Information System. Passenger Information System (APIS) managed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) collects manifest data from airlines for international flights to the United States. CBP cross-checks data against law enforcement databases and terrorist watchlists using Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) for risk assessments on travelers. ATS-P helps CBP assess individuals before their arrival. The Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) helps CBP assess individuals before their arrival by comparing passenger data against terrorist and law enforcement databases to identify potential matches to terrorist identities and wanted criminals. The system does not use a risk scoring methodology but focuses on red flags such as suspected use of lost or stolen passports. Data in the ATS may be retained for up to 15 years. Passenger data in the Automated Targeting System may be retained for up to 15 years, with passenger name record data depersonalized within six months. Travelers from Visa Waiver Program countries must submit biographical information through ESTA before boarding a U.S.-bound flight, which is checked against law enforcement databases. Secure Flight and Screening Passengers by Observational Techniques (SPOT) are programs used by TSA to identify potential threats among passengers. Secure Flight checks passenger information against various databases to determine if there is a potential threat, while SPOT observes passenger behavior at airports. SPOT was initiated in 2003 and by FY2012, almost 3,000 Behavior Detection Officers were deployed at 176 airports at an annual cost of about $200 million. The TSA's Screening Passengers by Observational Techniques (SPOT) program has deployed nearly 3,000 Behavior Detection Officers at 176 airports, costing around $200 million annually. Despite claims of scientific validity, questions persist about the program's effectiveness and cost. TSA utilizes behavior detection techniques rooted in law enforcement methods and criminal profiling for identifying potential threats. The SPOT program by TSA utilizes behavior detection techniques different from traditional law enforcement methods, focusing on large groups of individuals rather than specific crimes. TSA's approach involves interpretation of behaviors for threat detection. The TSA SPOT program utilizes behavioral detection techniques, focusing on non-verbal cues to rate suspicion, unlike traditional law enforcement methods. Law enforcement agencies use these techniques in combination with other practices during lengthy interviews and repeated encounters. The TSA SPOT program uses behavioral detection techniques to observe passengers quickly. Despite TSA's claims of effectiveness, the Government Accountability Office found that known terrorists passed through checkpoints where Behavior Detection Officers were stationed without being identified. The GAO could not confirm if the SPOT program led to the arrest of terrorists. TSA conducted validation studies with DHS and AIR, showing behavior detection was more effective than random selection. The study has not been publicly released for independent review. The TSA has not released the study publicly for independent analysis. They have taken steps to address GAO recommendations and partnered with international counterparts to improve the SPOT program. Despite positive validation results, doubts remain about behavior detection in the program. The GAO concluded in 2013 that evidence did not support the validity of behavior detection techniques used by TSA in the SPOT program. Concerns were raised about the metrics used to evaluate the program, as they did not directly relate to TSA's mission of deterring terrorism and criminal acts targeting aviation assets. Developing suitable metrics to assess the program's impact was highlighted as a challenge due to the low occurrence of terrorist acts. Developing suitable metrics to evaluate the impact of the SPOT program on mission objectives has proven difficult due to low occurrence of terrorist acts. GAO and DHS audits found discrepancies in BDOs' referrals to law enforcement and questioned the effectiveness of behavioral indicators. Metrics used to support SPOT's effectiveness were not directly related to aviation security objectives, with lapses in records-keeping suggesting incomplete and inaccurate data presented to TSA. The Inspector General found that TSA had incomplete and inaccurate data about the SPOT program, with a lack of consistent refresher training for behavior detection officers. Questions were raised about the quality and efficacy of the program, despite TSA championing it as a key part of their risk-based approach to passenger screening. Members of Congress have raised concerns about the program's effectiveness. Questions remain over the efficacy of the TSA's SPOT program, with some Members of Congress seeking to eliminate funding for it. Despite concerns raised by the GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General, Congress has not taken specific action to revamp the program. In contrast, TSA's Pre-Check program, aimed at expediting processing for low-risk passengers, has received more positive feedback since its launch in 2011. The TSA's Pre-Check program, launched in 2011, has received favorable responses. It is available at no cost to select frequent flyers and trusted traveler program members. Eligible travelers can also apply for a fee at a TSA enrollment center. The program is similar to the former Registered Traveler program. The Registered Traveler program, implemented in 2007 under a public-private partnership model, involved multiple vendors collecting biographical and biometric data for expedited screening at airports. Initially, extensive background checks were conducted, but these were later eliminated as the program expanded in 2008. In 2008, TSA eliminated background checks and program fees for the Registered Traveler program, stating they were not essential for threat determination. The program was dismantled soon after. Under Pre-Check, TSA now conducts extensive biographic-based background checks, contrary to their previous stance. Approved individuals receive a known traveler number for flight reservations, without a biometric credential. The known traveler number is used for Pre-Check members to access expedited screening lanes, but random thorough screenings may still occur. TSA's ability to authenticate boarding passes and traveler documents is limited, raising concerns. TSA has deployed Credential Authentication Technology/Boarding Pass Scanning Systems for inspection and authentication. The deployment of Credential Authentication Technology/Boarding Pass Scanning Systems by TSA has been delayed due to technical and managerial challenges. This system is crucial for authenticating boarding pass information to ensure access to Pre-Check screening lanes is limited to cleared individuals. Applicants for the Pre-Check program are required to submit biographic and biometric data for identity verification. Applicants for the Pre-Check program must submit biographic and biometric data to TSA for security threat assessments. TSA uses law enforcement, immigration, and intelligence databases, including FBI criminal history records checks. Pre-Check applications are accepted from U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, and legal permanent residents. Ineligibility criteria include recent criminal convictions or court determinations. Applicants for the Pre-Check program must provide biographic and biometric data to TSA for security assessments. TSA may reject applicants with criminal convictions, even if not disqualifying, and based on information from terrorist watchlists. A non-refundable $85 processing fee is required. Upon approval, travelers receive a Known Traveler Number valid for five years. Applicants with an assigned Pre-Check Known Traveler Number must notify TSA within 30 days if they are not qualified and wish to appeal. They can provide supporting records to correct any inaccurate information. The $85 processing fee is non-refundable, so individuals with concerns about disqualification based on criminal records or other eligibility factors may choose not to apply. TSA opened the first Pre-Check in December 2013. TSA opened the first Pre-Check enrollment center for the general public in December 2013 at the Indianapolis, IN, airport. There will eventually be 300 enrollment centers nationwide with an online application process. Applicants can pre-enroll online but must visit a physical site for identification and fingerprinting. Early feedback shows that frequent travelers are satisfied with Pre-Check, with a 2012 survey indicating high satisfaction rates. The Pre-Check program has received positive feedback from frequent travelers, with high satisfaction rates reported. However, the rapid expansion of the program may lead to increased wait times in Pre-Check lanes as more travelers join, potentially benefiting non-participating travelers as well. The Pre-Check program is experiencing increased wait times as more travelers join, leading to the possibility of non-participating travelers also benefiting from expedited screening lanes through managed inclusion and Secure Flight assessments. TSA is exploring real-time threat assessments to identify low-risk individuals for random selection. New passenger screening canine teams and behavioral detection officers are being utilized for enhanced security measures. Passengers are initially screened for potential threats by behavioral detection officers and canine teams for explosives. If no elevated risk is detected, they may be randomly selected for Pre-Check screening. A lighted arrow at the kiosk directs passengers to regular or expedited lanes based on random selection. This process includes Pre-Check members, Secure Flight selections, and managed inclusion. Military servicemembers, including active duty, reservists, and National Guard members, are allowed to use Pre-Check screening lanes for official and personal travel. Family members under 12 can also use Pre-Check lanes when traveling with cleared military personnel. Family members over 12 must either use standard screening lanes or independently obtain Pre-Check eligibility. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard may also be eligible for Pre-Check. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard, along with uniformed airline crewmembers, can participate in expedited screening without enrolling in Pre-Check. Airline crews undergo TSA-managed criminal history record checks for eligibility. The Known Crew Member database verifies airline crew credentials for expedited screening. Background screening for airline crews is equivalent to Pre-Check applicants, with some undergoing even more extensive checks, especially military personnel and civilian employees with defense clearances. TSA considers these individuals for expedited screening. The TSA considers individuals in specific sub-populations, such as military servicemembers, defense personnel, and airline crews, to be lower risk and eligible for expedited screening. Despite this, random selection for standard screening is still used for some members of these groups. The TSA conducts risk-based screening programs, collecting biographic and biometric data, as well as intelligence sources, to identify potential threats. Each program has its own data collection and retention rules, with a policy to delete unnecessary data. The TSA collects biographic and biometric data for risk-based screening programs, with different retention rules based on the individual's match to terrorist or criminal databases. Data from non-matches, like Pre-Check applications, are kept unless updated or corrected. Commercial databases and consumer reporting agencies may also be used for information. The TSA collects biographic and biometric data for risk-based screening programs, utilizing information from commercial databases and consumer reporting agencies. Personal data collected may be shared among DHS agencies for counterterrorism and homeland security purposes, as well as with intelligence, law enforcement, and judicial agencies at various levels for investigations and oversight. The Privacy Act of 1974 and other legislation require federal agencies and contractors to protect data. The TSA and DHS must establish appeals procedures for individuals identified as security threats based on records in the TSDB. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 also imposed requirements on DHS. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53) mandated DHS to establish an Office of Appeals and Redress for individuals wrongly identified as a threat when boarding a commercial aircraft. DHS created the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) to address misidentification issues and maintain accurate passenger records. The DHS TRIP program allows passengers to file complaints online or by mail if they have been wrongly identified as a threat. DHS requests supporting information within 30 days and provides a control number for tracking the inquiry status. If a misidentification is found, steps to resolve the issue are described, such as presenting a DHS response letter during check-in for flights. The TSA allows passengers to appeal decisions made by DHS during the check-in process for airline flights. TSA decisions based on Secure Flight program records are mostly exempt from judicial review. In 2013, TSA sought to expand expedited screening by using third-party prescreening of passengers. The TSA is considering using large commercial databases to assess the risk posed by individuals in the aviation transportation system. Concerns have been raised about privacy and data accuracy in this process. The TSA is considering using commercial databases for passenger risk assessments, raising concerns about privacy and data accuracy. Non-federal government and private databases may already be used for passenger prescreening, including CBP's ATS and other programs like Secure Flight and Pre-Check. The TSA is considering using commercial data for passenger risk assessments in systems like Secure Flight and Pre-Check, where personal information may be used for purposes other than counterterrorism. Congress previously restricted the use of commercial data in airline passenger prescreening. The TSA is exploring the use of commercial data for passenger risk assessments in systems like Secure Flight and Pre-Check, raising concerns about privacy and potential legislative action by Congress. Congressional oversight plays a crucial role in reviewing TSA's risk-based approach to airline passenger screening to ensure effectiveness, efficiency, and data security. Experts in aviation security emphasize that risk-based screening should be part of a comprehensive security strategy, not a standalone technique. Risk-based screening should not be seen as a standalone technique but as part of a comprehensive security strategy. It is important to assess how well these programs fit into a broader risk-based framework and their ability to adapt to evolving threats. The risk-based approach to passenger screening, including the Pre-Check program, is adaptive and evolving. Details on terrorist watchlists and behavioral profiling techniques are not publicly disclosed. The evolution of terrorist watchlist information dissemination has been a key concern since the 2009 Northwest Flight 253 bombing attempt, with specific changes not publicly acknowledged. Information on the adaptation of behavioral detection methods by TSA is also not publicly available. The evolution and adaptation of TSA's behavioral detection methods have not been publicly disclosed. Congressional oversight may be interested in how TSA's risk-based strategy and intelligence practices have adapted to changing threat landscapes, resource shifts, and new procedures and technologies. Identifying suitable metrics to assess the effectiveness of TSA's risk-based strategies has been challenging due to necessary security secrecy. The limited encounters with individuals tied to terrorism make defining suitable metrics for security effectiveness challenging. TSA's choice of metrics for behavioral detection programs has been questioned, with emphasis on efficiency rather than security. Concerns arise over false alarms singling out individuals as potential threats when they pose no actual threat. Efforts to reduce false alarms in threat detection may lead to gaps in capabilities, potentially misdirecting screening resources and causing complications for individuals mistakenly targeted as threats. Initiatives to minimize false alarms in Secure Flight have focused on refining terrorist databases for accurate information. The TSA has implemented measures to reduce false alarms in aviation passenger pre-screening by refining terrorist databases and establishing a redress process for falsely targeted individuals. The effectiveness of these steps in reducing false alarms has not been publicly disclosed, but anticipated efficiency gains from risk-based screening initiatives could lead to significant savings of about $120 million. The TSA has implemented measures to reduce false alarms in aviation passenger pre-screening by refining terrorist databases and establishing a redress process for falsely targeted individuals. Risk-based security efficiencies are expected to save $120 million and reduce staffing by 1,500 positions in FY2015. Congressional oversight may examine security effectiveness and privacy protections within DHS systems. As TSA implements a risk-based approach to passenger screening, concerns remain about the integration of various programs, adaptation to changes in threats and resources, and effectiveness assessment metrics. Despite elaborate security measures post-9/11, the potential for a large-scale aviation attack remains. Debate continues on balancing security measures with public expectations and privacy concerns. Debate continues on balancing privacy with effective security strategies in aviation to combat terrorism, a central issue for policy and possible congressional oversight."}

{"title": "SylCrnCcFX", "content": "Deep networks aim to understand complex mappings through locally linear behavior. The challenge lies in the instability of derivatives, especially in networks with piecewise linear activation functions. This paper introduces a new learning problem to promote stable derivatives over larger regions, focusing on provably stable linear approximations around points. The paper introduces a new learning problem to promote stable derivatives over larger regions by identifying stable linear approximations around points. It proposes a novel relaxation to scale the algorithm to realistic models and illustrates the method with residual and recurrent networks on image and sequence datasets. The derivatives discussed in this paper focus on first-order local approximations and the challenge of unstable derivatives in deep learning models due to over-parametrization. The function values and derivatives in deep learning models can be unstable, leading to unreliable first-order approximations. Gradient stability is different from adversarial examples, where small input perturbations can change the predicted output. Robust estimation techniques are used to protect against adversarial examples. The paper focuses on deep networks with piecewise linear activations to ensure gradient stability by inferring lower bounds on the maximum radius of p-norm balls around a point where derivatives are provably stable. The paper investigates the stability of derivatives in deep networks with piecewise linear activations, focusing on the radius of p-norm balls around a point. The objective is to maximize the lower bound for p = 2, leading to a regularization problem. The learning problem is relaxed similar to support vector machines, requiring evaluation of neuron gradients with respect to inputs. A novel perturbation algorithm is proposed for piecewise linear networks to compute exact gradients efficiently. The paper introduces a novel perturbation algorithm for D-dimensional data to efficiently compute exact gradients in neural networks with piecewise linear activations. The algorithm collects exact gradients by forward propagating carefully crafted samples in parallel without back-propagation. If GPU memory constraints arise, an unbiased approximation to the objective is developed using a random subset of samples. The inference and learning algorithms are empirically tested on various network architectures like fully-connected, residual, and recurrent networks using image and time-series datasets. Key contributions include inference algorithms for identifying input regions of neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions. The paper introduces novel algorithms for identifying stable regions in neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions. It focuses on networks like ReLU BID15 and its variants, emphasizing the importance of activation functions in deep models. The algorithms aim to expand regions of provably stable derivatives and scale computation to high-dimensional data. Empirical evaluations are conducted on various network types to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The proposed approach is based on a mixed integer linear representation of piecewise linear networks, encoding the active linear piece of the activation function for each neuron. Once an activation pattern is fixed, the network degenerates to a linear model. The feasible set corresponding to an activation pattern in the input space is a natural region where derivatives are provably stable. Neighboring regions may have the same end-to-end linear coefficients, leading to a linear region. A complete linear region is a maximal connected subset of the input space with the same derivatives of the network. Activation patterns have been studied in various contexts, such as visualizing neurons and reachability of specific output values. In contrast to quantifying the number of linear regions as a measure of complexity, the focus is on local linear regions and expanding them via learning. The notion of stability is considered in different contexts such as visualizing neurons and reachability of specific output values. The focus is on local linear regions and expanding them via learning. The notion of stability considered differs from adversarial examples. Methods for finding exact adversarial examples are NP-complete and do not scale. Layer-wise relaxations of ReLU activations are more scalable but yield bounds instead of exact solutions. Defense methods are still intractable on ImageNet scale images. The proposed learning algorithm focuses on maximizing the 2 margin around each data point in high-dimensional settings. It uses a sub-sampling procedure for unbiased estimation and scales to ResNet on 299 \u00d7 299 \u00d7 3 dimensional images. The approach differs from SVM training by maximizing the 2 margin of linear regions around data points. Our approach maximizes the 2 margin of linear regions around each data point in an unsupervised manner, similar to transductive/semi-supervised SVM. We develop a smooth relaxation of the margin and perturbation algorithms for gradient stability in realistic networks, with implications for interpretability and transparency. The gradient stability issue addressed in this work has implications for the interpretability of complex models. Various explanation methods for deep models rely on gradients, including gradient saliency maps and their variants, which attribute predictions to inputs using nonlinear post-processings for visualization. The focus is on establishing robust derivatives, with approaches developed under the notation of FC. The text discusses approaches for developing robust derivatives in neural networks with ReLU activations, focusing on gradient stability for interpretability of complex models. The notation of FC networks is used, with details on hidden layers, neurons, and activation functions provided. The text discusses the linear transformation of hidden layers in neural networks with ReLU activations, focusing on the piecewise linear property and generic loss functions for classification problems. The text discusses activation patterns in neural networks, represented by f \u03b8 (x) and using a generic loss function L(f \u03b8 (x), y) for nonlinear mechanisms. It defines an activation pattern as a set of indicators for neurons that specify functional constraints. Points on the boundary of linear regions can fit multiple activation patterns. The text discusses activation patterns in neural networks, defined as sets of indicators for neurons specifying functional constraints. Each linear region of f \u03b8 is characterized as a convex polyhedron with linear constraints. The activation pattern is defined by \u2207 x z i j through back-propagation, and the feasible set is a convex polyhedron. The p margin of x subject to its activation pattern is denoted as \u02c6 x,p. The text discusses the feasibility of directional perturbations in neural networks based on activation patterns. It explores the linear regions of f \u03b8 as convex polyhedrons with constraints, denoted by \u2207 x z i j. The feasibility of a perturbation x +\u00af \u2206x \u2208 S(x) is determined by checking if x +\u00af \u2206x satisfies the constraints of the activation pattern. The feasibility of directional perturbations in neural networks can be determined by checking if the perturbation x +\u00af \u2206x satisfies the activation pattern constraints. Proposition 5 discusses the feasibility of 1-ball and \u221e-ball, with the latter being intractable in high dimensions due to the exponential number of extreme points. The number of extreme points in a 1-ball is linear to the dimension, allowing for binary searches to find margin certificates. The feasibility of directional perturbations in neural networks can be verified by binary searches to find margin certificates for 1-balls and 2-balls. The certification process is efficient due to the convexity of the activation pattern constraints. The minimum 2 distance between a point x and the union of hyperplanes can be computed analytically by evaluating a specific formula. The certification process for directional perturbations in neural networks involves efficiently computing the number of complete linear regions among data points, which can be visualized on 2 margins. Counting the linear regions in the input space is complex due to activation patterns, but certifying the number of complete linear regions (#CLR) captures the structure of the data manifold. In this section, the focus is on maximizing the 2 margin\u02c6 x,2 through a regularization problem in the objective to maximize the number of complete linear regions of f \u03b8 among the data points D x. The number of complete linear regions is upperbounded by the number of different activation patterns and lower-bounded by the number of different Jacobians. In this section, a regularization problem is formulated to maximize the margin, but the rigid loss surface hinders optimization. A hinge-based relaxation similar to SVM is applied to the distance function. If certain conditions are not met, an upper bound is still valid. A smoother relaxation is derived to solve the problem. The text discusses deriving a relaxation to solve a regularization problem by maximizing the margin. The relaxation involves smoothing out the squared root and reciprocal on the 2 norm, as well as replacing hard constraints with a soft regularization problem using a hinge loss. This approach aims to aggregate TSVM losses among all neurons to maximize the margin in a linear model scenario. The text discusses using distance and relaxed regularization methods to enlarge linear regions in a binary classification dataset trained with a fully connected network. Visualization of piecewise linear regions and prediction heatmaps is shown in FIG3. The text discusses using relaxed regularization to generalize the property to the whole space, creating a smoother prediction boundary with a special central region where gradients are 0. The generalized loss involves a set of neurons with high losses to the given point, denoted as \u00ce(x, \u03b3). The final objective for learning RObust Local Linearity (ROLL) is the set of neurons with top \u03b3 percent relaxed loss on x. When \u03b3 = 100, the nonlinear sorting step disappears, stabilizing training, simplifying computation, and inducing a strong synergy effect. The parallel algorithm developed avoids heavy computation on gradient norms by constructing a linear network g \u03b8 that mimics the behavior of f \u03b8 in S(x) using fixed linear activation functions. This allows for computing derivatives of all neurons to an input axis by forwarding two samples. The proposed approach involves computing derivatives of neurons to an input axis by forwarding two samples, which can be amortized and parallelized. The complexity analysis assumes no overhead for parallel computation, with the perturbation algorithm requiring 2M operations for a batch of inputs. Despite the parallelizable computation, computing the loss remains challenging. Despite the parallelizable computation of \u2207 x z i j, computing the loss for large networks in a high dimension setting is still challenging. An unbiased estimator of the ROLL loss in Eq. FORMULA17 is proposed when \u00ce(x, \u03b3) = I. The sum of gradient norms can be efficiently computed using a decoupling method, allowing for practical implementation by uniformly sampling input axes. The proposed algorithms provide an unbiased approximation for computing partial derivatives with respect to input axes in deep learning models with affine transformations and piecewise linear activation functions. They can be applied by enumerating neurons with ReLU-like activation functions, but do not immediately generalize to nonlinearity of maxout/max-pooling. In the Appendix E, the linear function is discussed, suggesting the use of average-pooling or convolution with large strides instead of maxpooling for better performance. The section compares the 'ROLL' approach with a baseline model ('vanilla') in various scenarios, evaluating accuracy, number of complete linear regions, and margins of linear regions on a testing set. Experiments were conducted on a single GPU with 12G memory. Parameter analysis was conducted on the MNIST dataset using a 4-layer FC model with ReLU activations. The testing data was evaluated at different percentiles, and models with the largest median were reported based on validation data. The results are shown in TAB1. The tuned models in the study have specific parameters and achieve higher margins compared to the baseline model. The ROLL loss shows significantly larger margins than the vanilla loss, even with a small decrease in accuracy. The Spearman's rank correlation between certain variables is consistently high. The lower #CLR in the approach indicates the presence of larger linear regions across different testing points. The ROLL model exhibits larger linear regions with consistent labels for points within the same region. Parameter analysis in Figure 2 shows accuracy decreases with increased C and \u03bb values, while higher \u03b3 values indicate less sensitivity to hyper-parameters. Running time efficiency of the proposed method is validated. The efficiency of the proposed method is measured by comparing running times for different loss computations. Results show that the approximate ROLL loss is about 9 times faster than the full loss, with comparable accuracy and margins. The approach is only twice slower than the vanilla loss. The perturbation algorithm achieves about 12 times empirical speed-up compared to back-propagation. The computational overhead of the method is minimal, achieved by the perturbation algorithm and the approximate loss. Training RNNs for speaker identification on a Japanese Vowel dataset from the UCI machine learning repository. The dataset for speaker identification has variable sequence length with 12 channels and 9 classes. The network implemented uses the scaled Cayley orthogonal RNN with LeakyReLU activation. Results show larger margins on testing data compared to vanilla loss. The Spearman's rank correlation between\u02c6 x,1 and\u02c6 x,2 among all cases is 0.98. Sensitivity analysis on derivatives identifies stability bounds for each timestamp and channel. ROLL regularization shows larger stability bounds compared to the vanilla model. Experiments on Caltech-256 BID18 dataset with 256 classes are conducted. On Caltech-256 BID18 dataset with 256 classes, images are downsized and a 18-layer ResNet is trained using pre-trained parameters. ROLL loss is used with 120 random samples per channel. Evaluation measures are challenging due to high input dimensionality, so a sample-based approach is used for stability evaluation. The stability of gradients f \u03b8 (x) y for the ground-truth label is evaluated using a sample-based approach on a cluster of GPUs. The gradient distortion is measured in terms of expected 1 distortion and maximum 1 distortion within an intersection B ,\u221e (x). The adversarial gradient \u2206(x, x , y) is maximized over an \u221e -norm ball with radius 8/256 using a genetic algorithm BID33 due to the ill-defined Hessian \u2207 2 x f \u03b8 (x ) y. The genetic algorithm BID33 is used for black-box optimization due to computational limits. Results show ROLL loss has more stable gradients and slightly better precisions compared to vanilla loss. Only 40 and 42 out of 1024 images change prediction labels in ROLL and vanilla models, respectively. The paper introduces a new learning problem to create locally transparent neural networks with stable gradients. It focuses on piecewise linear networks to achieve this goal. The paper introduces a new learning problem to create locally transparent neural networks with stable gradients, focusing on piecewise linear networks. The proposed ROLL loss expands regions with stable derivatives and generalizes the stable gradient property across linear regions. The feasible set of activation patterns is equivalent to satisfying linear constraints in each layer. The proof of directional feasibility states that if a point x, a feasible set S(x), and a unit vector \u2206x exist such that x + \u00af\u2206x is in S(x), then f \u03b8 is linear in a certain range. The 1-ball feasibility proposition shows that any point x in a 1-ball B ,1 (x) with extreme points is a convex combination of x 1 , . . . , x 2D and thus belongs to the feasible set S(x). The 2-ball certificate proposition is also discussed. The 2-ball certificate proposition states that the minimum 2 distance between a point x and a union of hyperplanes is the maximizing distance that satisfies certain conditions. This is proven by showing that a neural network feasible model has the same loss as the optimal model. The network g \u03b8 is constructed with the same weights and biases as f \u03b8 but with a linear activation function. Each layer in g \u03b8 is represented as a function of x, with a fixed activation function \u00f4. The new activation function applies linearity to the neurons, allowing for easy computation of derivatives with respect to input axes. This approach simplifies the process by using two forward passes to compute all gradients of the neurons. The proposed approach simplifies gradient computation by using two forward passes, taking a total of 2M operations. This is more efficient than back-propagation, which cannot be parallelized among neurons. The proposed approach simplifies gradient computation by using two forward passes, taking a total of 2M operations. Back-propagation cannot be parallelized among neurons, requiring sequential computation of gradients for each neuron. Dynamic programming can be used with the chain-rule of Jacobian to compute all gradients efficiently. The proposed approach simplifies gradient computation using dynamic programming with the chain-rule of Jacobian. It involves two forward passes and is efficient for fully connected networks but not for convolutional layers. The focus is on deriving methods for maxout/max-pooling nonlinearity. The proposed approach simplifies gradient computation using dynamic programming with the chain-rule of Jacobian. It involves two forward passes and is efficient for fully connected networks but not for convolutional layers. The goal is to derive inference and learning methods for a piecewise linear network with max-pooling nonlinearity, suggesting the use of convolution with large strides or average-pooling instead of max-pooling neurons to avoid new linear constraints. The proposed approach simplifies gradient computation using dynamic programming with the chain-rule of Jacobian. It involves two forward passes and is efficient for fully connected networks but not for convolutional layers. The network degenerates to a linear model when the nonlinearity in max-pooling disappears, creating a feasible set in the input space with stable derivatives. The feasible activation pattern induces a convex polyhedron as a feasible set, allowing for the application of linear constraints in inference and learning algorithms. The FC model consists of 4 hidden layers with 100 neurons each. Input dimension is 2, output dimension is 1. Sigmoid cross entropy loss function is used. Model trained for 5000 epochs with Adam optimizer. Regularization parameters tuned until classifier performance is not perfect. The FC model has 4 hidden layers with 300 neurons each, using ReLU activation. Cross-entropy loss with soft-max is applied during training, with tuned regularization parameters for imperfect classifier performance. Data normalization is done with specific \u00b5 and \u03c3 values. The model uses ReLU activation and cross-entropy loss with soft-max. It runs for 20 epochs with stochastic gradient descent and Nesterov momentum. Parameters like learning rate, momentum, and batch size are specified. Grid search is done on \u03bb, C, \u03b3 values. Data normalization is not performed, and the ROLL loss is computed during training. The representation is learned with a single layer scoRNN, using LeakyReLU activation functions. The hidden neurons dimension is set to 512, with AMSGrad optimizer BID21. Tuning involves grid search on \u03bb, C, \u03b3 values. Learning rate is 0.001, batch size is 32 sequences. Cross-entropy loss with soft-max is used for the loss function. We perform a grid search on \u03bb and C values, with \u03b3 set to 100. Models with slightly lower testing accuracy compared to the baseline are reported. A bijective mapping is established between normalized and original distances using a trick from Appendix G. The pre-trained ResNet-18 model is downloaded and modified by replacing max-pooling with average-pooling after the first convolutional layer. The ResNet-18 model is modified by replacing max-pooling with average-pooling after the first convolutional layer and enlarging the receptive field of the last pooling layer to output 512 dimensions. The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent with Nesterov momentum for 20 epochs, starting with an initial learning rate of 0.005 and adjusting to 0.0005 after the first 10 epochs. The model is trained for 20 epochs with an initial learning rate of 0.005, adjusted to 0.0005 after 10 epochs. The momentum is 0.5, batch size is 32. The best validation loss model is selected. Tuning involves fixing C = 8, using 18 samples for learning, tuning \u03bb until inferior validation accuracy is reached, then fixing \u03bb = 0.001 and trying to increase C, but C = 8 is already the highest plausible value. Finally, a model is trained with 360 random samples for approximate learning. The model is trained with 360 random samples using a genetic algorithm (GA) BID33 with 4800 populations P and 30 epochs. Samples are evaluated based on their gradient distance from the target x, sorted, and updated through crossover and projection steps. The genetic algorithm (GA) used in training the model with 360 random samples does not implement mutation due to computational reasons. The crossover operator in GA is compared to a gradient step, where direction is determined by other samples and step size is random. Visualization includes original image, original gradient, adversarial gradient, and image of adversarial gradient. The integrated gradient attribution method is used to visualize gradients in the literature by aggregating derivatives in each channel, taking the absolute value, and normalizing them. The genetic algorithm used in training the model does not implement mutation, and the crossover operator is compared to a gradient step. The integrated gradient attribution method visualizes gradients by aggregating derivatives in each channel, normalizing them, and clipping values above 1. The derivatives are then visualized as gray-scaled images, highlighting differences in settings. Examples from the Caltech-256 dataset show gradient distortions at different percentiles. The ROLL model visualizes the maximum 1 gradient distortions among testing data, with examples from the Caltech-256 dataset showing P 25 and P 50 percentiles. The values differ slightly from Table 4 due to interpolation, and the figures are selected from images closest to the percentiles. The ROLL model visualizes maximum 1 gradient distortions in testing data from the Caltech-256 dataset. The vanilla model shows distortions for 'Projector', 'Bear', and 'Rainbow', while the ROLL model shows distortions for the same categories."}

{"title": "R40832", "content": "The report summarizes the USDA's efforts to establish a national animal traceability system for rapid disease outbreak response. Despite economic benefits, federal proposals face controversy within the U.S. cattle industry. It provides background on animal ID and traceability, reviews arguments for and against a national system, and describes current U.S. practices. The curr_chunk discusses the claims and counter-claims surrounding a national animal ID system, highlighting unresolved issues in program development. It also includes a brief chronology of the U.S. National Animal Identification System and international organizations involved in animal health standards. Tom Vilsack announced USDA's new approach to animal disease traceability, replacing the abandoned National Animal Identification System. The new framework allows states and tribal nations to choose their own level of animal ID and traceability. USDA will require all animals in interstate commerce to have a form of ID. USDA's new framework for animal disease traceability requires all animals in interstate commerce to have a form of ID traceable back to their originating state. A Traceability Regulation Working Group was established to collaborate with state, tribal, and APHIS officials in building on the framework. The USDA's new framework for animal disease traceability involves a Traceability Regulation Working Group collaborating with state, tribal, and APHIS officials to gather feedback and make recommendations for a proposed rule. Public meetings were held to present the framework and receive input from animal health officials and producers. In August 2010, USDA released publications outlining the Animal Disease Traceability Framework. The USDA's traceability framework for animal disease involves collaboration with state, tribal, and APHIS officials to gather feedback and make recommendations for a proposed rule. Public industry forums were held to discuss and provide feedback on the framework. One key principle is that managing a traceability program is the responsibility of states and tribal nations, allowing flexibility in implementing mandatory animal ID and traceability capabilities. The USDA's traceability framework for animal disease involves collaboration with state, tribal, and APHIS officials to implement within-state programs for livestock traceability. The federal rules will apply only to livestock moving in interstate commerce, requiring official identification and an Interstate Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (ICVI). Data collection and storage will be done by state authorities, not the federal government. The USDA's traceability framework for animal disease involves collaboration with state, tribal, and APHIS officials to implement within-state programs for livestock traceability. Exemptions for identification and ICVI requirements will be defined in the rules, with acceptable official identification types outlined in federal regulations. The animal disease traceability capacity of each state and tribal nation will be evaluated according to performance standards set by the Traceability Regulation Working Group. Performance standards will describe desired outcomes, leaving the method for achieving them up to states and tribal nations. The method for achieving animal disease traceability outcomes will be determined by states and tribal nations through detailed cooperative agreements with APHIS. Federal funding, if available, will be provided through annual agreements, but the FY2011 agriculture appropriations bill does not designate funding for animal traceability. However, the Senate Committee on Appropriations report suggests that funding could be considered after needs are identified under USDA's new initiative. Animal disease traceability for interstate animal movements will be regulated through federal rules, with USDA defining the process in Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations. A proposed rule is expected in April 2011, with a final rule likely 12 to 15 months later. This is crucial for preventing major outbreaks of diseases like avian influenza, foot and mouth disease, and mad cow disease. The economic impact of animal disease outbreaks like foot and mouth disease (FMD) and mad cow disease has led to the slaughter of millions of animals and significant economic losses. The United States has been fortunate in avoiding catastrophic outbreaks similar to those in Taiwan in 1997 and the United Kingdom in 2001. The economic consequences of major animal disease outbreaks in the 1990s and early 2000s led to the development of animal identification and traceability systems in many countries, with potential costs of $30 billion to $100 billion for the U.S. cattle industry alone in the event of a similar outbreak. The development of animal identification and traceability systems varies across countries, from voluntary programs in the United States to mandatory programs in the EU, Japan, and South Korea. Major importers like Japan and South Korea are considering requiring traceability on imported meat products, adding a market access dimension to these programs. The United States plays a significant role in the global livestock industry as a major producer and exporter of beef, poultry, and pork. It leads in beef and poultry production, ranks third in pork production, and is the top exporter of pork, second in poultry, and third in beef. Additionally, the US is the leading importer of beef worldwide. The United States is a major producer and exporter of beef, poultry, and pork, ranking first in beef production and as the top importer of beef. U.S. exports of animal products account for a significant portion of domestic production, with animal identification used to track animals from birth through the marketing chain. The ideal system for animal traceability involves a national database of animal ID combined with traceability, accessible via a high-speed computer network. This system allows for quick response to disease outbreaks or tainted food, minimizing threats to human and animal health and commercial damage. Various versions of animal ID systems exist in different countries. Animal traceability systems exist in different countries, varying in the amount and type of information collected. Minimum data includes animal's birthplace, owner's details, movement history, and slaughter information. More advanced systems include sex, breed, parentage, feed, pharmaceuticals, and product movement details. The purpose is to identify and track animals effectively. In the United States, animal ID focuses on animal health, tracing movements from birth to slaughter. In contrast, countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea have more comprehensive traceability systems that include both animal health and food safety. In the United States, animal ID focuses on tracing movements from birth to slaughter. However, countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea have more comprehensive traceability systems that include animal health and food safety. International buyers are demanding better information on the history of animal products, leading to the evolution of a national animal ID and traceability system in the United States. Proponents of a national animal ID and traceability system argue that it enhances animal health surveillance and disease eradication by facilitating early detection of outbreaks and identifying the source of diseases. The USDA supports a national animal ID and traceability program to reduce disease testing costs and minimize economic impact of outbreaks by regionalization or compartmentalization. This tool helps contain disease outbreaks to specific zones, limiting spread and trade restrictions. Compartmentalization reduces economic damage by limiting disease spread and trade restrictions. Farmers can capitalize on domestic marketing opportunities by tracking individual animals for premium pricing in certain retail markets. Universal bar codes on processed food, including meats, are used by processors and retailers for inventory management and adding value. ID and traceability help verify production methods for organic, humane treatment, or environmental standards in animal products. Government programs like USDA's AMS process verification program assure consistent quality for livestock and meat producers. The USDA's AMS process verification program offers meat producers the opportunity to assure customers of consistent quality products through independent audits. Suppliers can make marketing claims such as breeds and feeding practices under this voluntary program. Other traceability programs include the national organic certification and mandatory country-of-origin labeling. It provides a valuable management tool for producers. An animal ID and traceability program would provide valuable post-mortem information on cattle, track performance history of racing or show animals, increase transparency in the supply chain, reduce liability claims against livestock producers, and help maintain records on animal movements and health. A traceability program helps producers maintain records on animal movements, health, breed registries, and marketing activities. It addresses food safety and national security concerns by collaborating with federal and state agencies to protect the food supply from threats like tuberculosis and foodborne illnesses. Local health officials can trace illnesses back to processors and slaughter facilities, but determining specific animals, herds, or flocks can be challenging. Some believe that a more rigorous traceback and animal ID system would facilitate food recalls, contain the spread of foodborne illnesses, and help authorities prevent future incidents. However, others, especially in the food industry, argue that such a system would not be scientifically sound, technically feasible, and would be costly. The USDA's AMS developed an export verification program for U.S. plants to meet beef import specifications of countries like Japan after the appearance of BSE in North America in 2003. This program aims to reassure buyers about the health of U.S. animals and certify production processes for niche markets. The USDA's AMS established standards for U.S. beef suppliers to ship to foreign markets like Japan and Korea. The EV program is voluntary but necessary for access to these markets. Establishing traceability enhances U.S. export competitiveness. The lack of a national animal identification system hindered the U.S. from receiving the best status for BSE from the World. Receiving negligible risk status for BSE from the OIE would enhance the US's international competitiveness and support domestic price structures. An animal ID system could aid in rescuing at-risk animal populations during natural disasters. Opponents argue against implementing an animal ID and traceability system. Opponents of a national animal ID and traceability system argue that it invades privacy and increases costs and technical complexity. They are concerned about the collection of personal information and potential disclosure of proprietary data, as well as the likelihood of increased producer-level costs without any market guarantees. The concern over increased producer-level costs of implementing an animal ID system without market benefits is supported by a USDA-funded analysis. Over 90% of the costs would fall on the cattle sector, and the technology requirements could complicate operations. Additionally, the system may favor vertical integration over family farms in the cattle industry. The cattle industry is expected to bear the costs of implementing a national ID program, disadvantaging family farms with a lack of market power in price structure. Small operators may struggle to absorb the added costs, eroding profit margins. Disadvantages family farms with a lack of market power in price structure. Large retailers and meat packers may shift compliance costs to farms, making it harder for smaller, independent farms to survive. Some religious groups object to individual animal marking as a sign of the world's end. Some producers push back due to concerns about increased transparency at the farm level. Some producers are concerned that increased transparency at the farm level may lead to higher tax liabilities. A national animal ID and traceability program has evolved from state and national disease eradication efforts, overseen by USDA's APHIS. The USDA's APHIS oversees programs for animal disease eradication and control, including animal identification components. Brucellosis ID tags were used successfully in a program to eradicate the disease from U.S. commercial herds. Animal ID requirements have become less common as the program ended. Certain classes of livestock have official identification requirements before entering interstate commerce. After the successful eradication of brucellosis in U.S. commercial herds, animal ID requirements have become less common. Official disease programs for pseudorabies in swine and scrapie in sheep mandate official identification before interstate commerce. Various state laws and breed association rules also require animal identification for participation in shows or races. However, these programs are not national in scope and differ in animal identification methods. U.S. animal ID limitations were highlighted after the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a Canadian-born dairy cow in 2003. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) program was established in response to the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a Canadian-born dairy cow in the United States in December 2003. Trading partners were hesitant to reopen borders due to difficulties in tracing other cattle that had entered the country with the infected cow. The program, administered by USDA's APHIS, aimed to improve disease traceability through a state-federal-industry partnership. The USDA replaced the voluntary NAIS program with a state-based program mandating traceability for livestock moving in interstate commerce, in response to criticism from the U.S. cattle sector. The NAIS system aimed to cover all major commercial livestock and poultry species in the US, excluding household pets. It was a new development as there had never been a nationwide animal ID system for all animals of any given species. The NAIS system aimed to cover all major commercial livestock and poultry species in the US, excluding household pets. Animals entering commerce or commingling at other premises were to be identified, with a focus on popularizing the program and ensuring adequate information for participants. USDA's involvement was to prioritize implementation by species/sectors and address general issues. The USDA prioritized implementing the NAIS system by species/sectors and addressed general issues such as harmonizing animal ID programs, standardizing data elements, integrating technology, partnering with states/industry, and advancing ID technologies. Reports were published to provide guidance, technical standards, and implementation strategies to stakeholders. The USDA prioritized implementing the NAIS system by species/sectors and addressed general issues such as harmonizing animal ID programs, standardizing data elements, integrating technology, partnering with states/industry, and advancing ID technologies. Reports were published to provide guidance, technical standards, and implementation strategies. Three reports detailed information about the status of NAIS, how to participate in the program, necessary technical details, and future program implementation. A Business Plan to Advance Animal Disease Traceability recommended strategies to enhance animal disease traceability. The NAIS User Guide provided guidance to producers and owners of animals. The NAIS User Guide, published in November 2006, offered guidance to animal producers on participating in NAIS and its benefits. The Program Standards and Technical Reference document established data standards for NAIS, including formats for premises, animal, and group/lot identification numbers, and technology standards. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) utilized technology standards published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to ensure system effectiveness. The primary goal of NAIS was to protect U.S. agriculture from the potential harm of an animal disease outbreak, not as a food safety program. USDA identified specific goals for NAIS, including increasing disease control in the United States. USDA identified specific goals for NAIS to increase disease response capabilities, limit disease spread, minimize economic impact, protect animal producers' livelihoods, and maintain market access. The long-term goal was to identify and trace animals within 48 hours of a disease problem, requiring rapid access to reliable data on animal ID and movement history during outbreaks. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) was designed to quickly trace animals in a disease outbreak to limit commercial damage. It consisted of three components: premises registration, animal identification, and animal tracking. NAIS aimed to collect data on infected animals and those exposed to the disease for efficient traceback during outbreaks. The first phase of NAIS involved premises registration, collecting specific information for USDA data standards. This included a premises identification number (PIN), entity name, contact details, operation type, and dates of activation and retirement. The PIN, a unique seven-digit number, was permanently assigned to each location. The PIN, a unique seven-digit number permanently assigned to a location, would not change following a change of ownership. Producers or owners could have multiple PINs based on the nature of operations. Premises registration was free and maintained by state or tribal animal health authorities. USDA stored premises information in a National Premises Information Repository, ensuring privacy and confidentiality. The USDA implemented premises information to protect private and business data, notify producers of disease outbreaks, and aid in locating at-risk animals during emergencies. By 2009, only 37% of premises were registered under the NAIS out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations. The USDA implemented premises information to protect private and business data, notify producers of disease outbreaks, and aid in locating at-risk animals during emergencies. Only 37% of premises were registered under the NAIS out of an estimated 1.4 million U.S. animal and poultry operations. USDA stated that higher levels of participation would be needed to successfully implement NAIS, involving assigning unique numbers to individual animals or specific groups. An animal identification number (AIN) is a unique 15-digit number, with the first three digits as the country code and the following 12 digits as the animal's unique identifying number. Animal ID under NAIS was achieved through obtaining USDA-recognized numbering tags or devices from authorized manufacturers. AIN devices include visual ear-tags, RFID tags, and injectable transponders for electronic reading. The USDA does not specify specific identification technologies beyond minimum requirements for official identification. RFID devices and injectable transponders are increasingly used for faster access to ID information, reducing stress on animals. Some animals are exempt from NAIS identification. USDA encourages all animal owners to register their premises for disease control, regardless of the number of animals. Some animals are exempt from NAIS identification if their movement poses a low disease risk. The USDA recommends registering premises for disease control, regardless of the number of animals. Animals should have an ID attached before moving to another location. Producers can choose when to attach ID devices, with some opting to do so shortly after birth. If animals cannot be tagged on their current premises, they can be tagged at an auction market before being commingled with other animals. When animals are unloaded, they should be tagged before being mixed with animals from other premises. Producers bringing animals into their operation should maintain the official identification already on the animal, without needing additional identification. Group/lot identification numbers can be used for animals moving through the production chain as a group, common in the poultry and pork industries. Group/lot identification numbers (GIN) are commonly used in the poultry and pork industries. The GIN is a 15-character number that includes a seven-character PIN, a six-digit date, and a two-digit number to reflect the count of groups assembled at the same premises on the same day. The GIN is self-generated by the producer and remains with the animal for its lifetime, linking each producer's livestock or poultry flock. The uniform numbering system in the NAIS links each producer's livestock or poultry flock to the animal's birthplace. The identification protocol is tailored to different species groups and their unique characteristics. The third phase of NAIS focuses on timely access to accurate animal movement records to quickly locate at-risk animals during disease outbreaks. Producers choose from NAIS-compliant animal tracking databases maintained by states and private industry for this purpose. The NAIS requires producers to report animal movements to databases maintained by states and private industry. Only minimum tracing information is needed, including national premises ID, animal ID, date of event, and event type. Additional animal-specific data is standardized but not required for participation. The voluntary animal tracing component of NAIS is a public/private partnership where industry and states maintain ATDs containing animal location and movement records. The federal government does not maintain the ATDs; states and private entities do. The federal government does not maintain the Animal Tracking Databases (ATDs) in the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). States and private entities are responsible for maintaining the ATDs to ensure confidentiality for participants. The USDA operates the Animal Trace Processing System (ATPS) to facilitate information requests during animal disease events. The ATDs provide timely and accurate reports on animal movements during outbreaks. The USDA defines optimal retrieval of traceback data within a 48-hour window for disease containment. State and federal officials use the system for suspect or confirmed positive tests for foreign animal diseases, emergencies, or origin of infection determinations. About 40% of potential premises in the US were included as of September 2008. As of September 2008, 40% of potential premises in the United States had been registered for animal disease response. Poultry and sheep registration was at 95%, swine at 80%, goat at 60%, horse at 50%, and cattle at 18%. 531,284 animal premises (excluding horses) had been registered in available databases, representing 36.9% of estimated livestock and poultry farms in the US. To achieve an effective response to an animal disease outbreak, USDA stated that 70% participation is necessary for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) to reach its goal of 48-hour traceback. Dr. John Clifford emphasized the need for 70% of animals in a specific species to be identified and traceable to their premises of origin for an effective measure. Dr. Clifford suggested a 90% participation rate for effective traceability in the animal ID program. Some supporters criticize USDA for slow progress and lack of a clear path towards universal ID. GAO report identified problems hindering implementation, such as prioritization among species and integration with existing requirements. The USDA's National Animal Identification System (NAIS) faced criticism for not integrating with existing animal ID requirements, lacking key data, and low participation rates. The 2008 NAIS Business Plan aimed to address some issues, but slow progress was attributed to unresolved differences among stakeholders. USDA officials expressed concern over low participation rates hindering NAIS's effectiveness in achieving a 48-hour traceback window. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) and other groups called for Congress to address low participation rates in the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) by making the program mandatory. USDA officials expressed concern over the effectiveness of NAIS due to low participation rates. USDA mandates animal ID for U.S. breeding cattle. Industry groups and lawmakers support mandatory system to prevent disease outbreaks. Opposition exists to mandatory NAIS. Groups opposed to mandatory NAIS, such as the Rancher's-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund (R-CALF) and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA), fear high costs and industry concentration. They question USDA's ability to keep information confidential. Members of Congress from cattle-heavy districts share these concerns. In August 2006, then-Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns announced that USDA would continue to implement NAIS as a voluntary program, despite concerns from the cattle industry. Proponents of a mandatory NAIS program argue that Secretary Vilsack should have the authority to reverse this decision. The USDA announced that participation in NAIS would be mandatory for the U.S. livestock industry, imposing costs for tags, data systems, and traceability. Cost estimates vary, raising the question of who should pay - industry, government, or both. USDA suggests sharing expenses. The USDA's ideas for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) involve sharing expenses between the government and producers. There are concerns that larger retailers and meat packers may pass compliance costs to farms, making it harder for smaller operations to survive. However, smaller plants with slower fabrication speeds may be better equipped to implement traceability. Smaller plants with slower fabrication speeds may have niche market opportunities and be better equipped to implement traceability to the retail level. On April 29, 2009, APHIS released the KSU Benefit-Cost Study (2009) on the economic benefits and costs of adopting USDA's NAIS, conducted by economists at Kansas State University in collaboration with researchers from other universities. The report estimated the outcomes of NAIS adoption across multiple species and participation rates, with key assumptions on individual versus group ID tagging for cattle. The KSU Benefit-Cost Study (2009) estimated that implementing NAIS for livestock industries would cost approximately $228 million for full pre-harvest traceability with 100% participation. This cost increases to $304.2 million when including horses. Cost estimates vary for lower participation levels. The cost estimates for implementing NAIS for livestock industries vary based on levels of participation and traceability features. Over 90% of the costs would be associated with the cattle sector, with an estimated cost of $5.97 per animal marketed. Identification tags and tagging cattle accounted for 75% of the annual adoption costs in the cattle sector, ranging from $3.30 to $5.22 per animal. The average cost per animal for livestock sectors varies, with figures such as $0.059 per swine, $1.39 per sheep, $0.0007 per broiler, $0.002 per turkey, and $0.0195 per layer. The economic benefits of NAIS with full participation outweigh the costs, including savings in government administration and quicker market recovery after disease outbreaks. The study found that implementing NAIS could prevent significant losses due to lost export market access and increase consumer confidence in food products. Cost-effectiveness of NAIS improves with higher participation levels, but may not be viable at lower levels. Some producers are concerned about liability for contamination issues. Producers are concerned about liability for contamination issues and the protection of their records from public scrutiny under the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Producers are worried about liability and protecting their records from public scrutiny under FOIA. FOIA exempts certain business information like trade secrets, commercial or financial data that could harm the provider. In the 110th Congress, a provision in the farm bill addressing protection of trade secrets was deleted. South Korea plans to enforce traceability measures. South Korea plans to impose traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010, following the EU's standards. Japan currently does not require traceability for imported beef but has age limitations. The opposition party in Japan aims to pass laws for traceability on imported beef. The DPJ in Japan won 308 seats in the Diet and aims to form a coalition to pass legislation. However, addressing traceability requirements for imported meat is not a top priority. India is the only major beef exporter without a traceability system. According to CattleFax analyst Brett Stuart, beef traceability may become necessary for global market access due to WTO regulations. Traceability measures for imports must be scientifically justified and equivalent. Since early 2004, USDA has invested nearly $142 million in the development of the National Animal Identification System (NAIS), with low participation rates of about 40% among livestock producers by 2009. The U.S. cattle sector has criticized the program, leading to a slow growth in participation rates and prompting a reassessment of producer concerns. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack conducted public listening sessions from April 15 to June 30, 2009, to gather feedback on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) from livestock producers and stakeholders. The information collected from these sessions and written comments prompted Secretary Vilsack to announce changes in the future direction of animal ID and traceability in the United States. Secretary Vilsack announced the abandonment of NAIS in favor of a state-based system in response to public feedback. Congress expressed frustration with the slow implementation of NAIS despite significant funding. In 2009, the Administration proposed increasing funding for the NAIS to $14.6 million in FY2010, but the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee voted to eliminate funding for USDA's NAIS from the FY2010 appropriations bill. Subcommittee chairwoman Rosa DeLauro and Collin Peterson expressed frustration with the slow national sign-up for NAIS. The House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee voted to eliminate funding for USDA's NAIS due to slow national sign-up. The full committee's report criticized APHIS for not implementing an effective system despite receiving $142 million since FY2004. Continued investments in NAIS are deemed unwarranted until USDA provides details on an effective ID system. The Senate passed an amendment reducing FY2010 funding for NAIS to $7.3 million, with restrictions on fund use. The final funding level was set at $5.3 million in the Agriculture appropriations bill signed into law as P.L. 111-80 by President Obama on October 21, 2009. The USDA claims authority to implement an animal ID program under the Animal Health Protection Act. In the 110th Congress, bills were proposed to clarify USDA's authority and establish a national ID system. H.R. 3485 and S. 1292 aimed to establish a comprehensive farm-to-consumer animal ID and meat traceability program, including systems for USDA-regulated meat and poultry as well as other FDA-regulated foods. The bills required FSIS to create a traceability system to track animals and meat products from slaughter to the consumer. The bills aim to establish a farm-to-consumer animal ID and meat traceability program for USDA-regulated meat and poultry, as well as other FDA-regulated foods. Traceability provisions have been included in food safety legislation approved by the House and Senate. The 111th Congress held hearings on the national animal ID system. The Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry reviewed animal identification systems in a public hearing. The House Committee on Agriculture's Subcommittee held a joint hearing with the Committee on Homeland Security to discuss the National Animal Identification System. Previous Congresses have also addressed animal ID issues, including animal health, disease, bio-security, and agro-terrorism. The use of animal ID in the United States dates back to the 1800s. In the 1940s, the USDA implemented a successful animal ID program for cattle to identify those vaccinated for brucellosis. However, as brucellosis neared eradication, the tagging and ID system was phased out. In the 1950s-1980s, early detection of sick animals in disease outbreaks became crucial for the animal industries. In the 1980s, the USDA started planning a national animal identification system after the discovery of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the UK. BSE, or \"mad cow disease,\" was found to be widespread in the UK's cattle population, leading to the slaughter of millions of cattle. In 1997, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Taiwan resulted in $6.9 billion in losses. In 1997, foot and mouth disease outbreak in Taiwan cost $6.9 billion and led to the slaughter of 3.8 million pigs, impacting the pork export market. A Classical Swine Fever outbreak in the Netherlands resulted in the destruction of 12 million hogs and $2.3 billion in losses. In 2001, foot and mouth disease in the UK led to the slaughter of over 10 million sheep and cattle, costing $7.9 billion. In 2002, APHIS officials collaborated with various organizations to address animal health issues. In 2003, Animal Agriculture and other organizations collaborated to draft the U.S. Animal Identification Plan (USAIP), which called for recording animal movements in a central database. APHIS designed an ID numbering system and allocated numbers to premises and animals. The USAIP called for all states to have an animal premises ID system by July 2004, with farm animals identified by July 2006. The first case of mad cow disease in the US in December 2003 led to accelerated implementation of a national animal ID system by USDA. In April 2004, Secretary Ann Veneman transferred $18.8 million from CCC funds to APHIS to implement the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The program's framework has been periodically revised since then, with a Draft Strategic Plan issued in May 2005 and Draft Program Standards announced in August 2005. In April 2006, USDA revealed new \"Implementation Strategies\" for the program. In April 2006, USDA unveiled a new plan for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) with a timeline for full implementation by 2009. The program was initially designed as voluntary but could become mandatory if participation levels were insufficient. However, in August 2006, Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns announced that NAIS would remain entirely voluntary at the federal level. In November 2006, USDA distributed a draft \"user guide\" outlining the three-step approach to implementing the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). The guide emphasized that the program would remain voluntary and ensure the protection of individuals' private information. In December 2007, USDA's APHIS released the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) User Guide and Additional Information Resource, followed by a Business Plan in April 2008 to advance animal disease traceability. The Business Plan aimed to clarify implementation strategies and set benchmarks for the NAIS, prioritizing species for 48-hour traceback in case of disease outbreak. The USDA's APHIS released the National Animal Identification System (NAIS) User Guide and Business Plan to advance animal disease traceability. The plan prioritized species for quick traceback in case of disease outbreak. Tier 1 includes primary commercial food animals and horses needing health certificates, while Tier 2 includes all other livestock and poultry. A proposed rule for an Official Animal Identification Numbering System was published in January 2009 for public comment until March 2009. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack held public listening sessions from April to June 2009 with various stakeholders. In April to June 2009, Agriculture Secretary Vilsack held public listening sessions with stakeholders to gather feedback on the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). In 2009, USDA released a comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of NAIS, and in 2010, Secretary Vilsack announced a new approach for animal disease traceability, allowing states and tribal nations to choose their own system. The USDA announced a new approach for animal disease traceability in 2010, allowing states and tribal nations to choose their own system. All animals moving in interstate commerce will require a form of ID for traceability back to their originating state. Public meetings were held from March to August 2010 to gather feedback on the Animal Disease Traceability framework. The USDA introduced a new approach for animal disease traceability in 2010, allowing states and tribal nations to implement their own systems. Animals moving across state lines will need identification for traceability. The United States participates in international organizations like CODEX alimentarius, OIE, and WTO for animal health and trade. The United States participates in international organizations like CODEX alimentarius, OIE, and WTO for animal health and trade. U.S. livestock and animal products are subject to export certification standards imposed by importing countries. The WTO sets international trade rules for harmonizing participation in commerce and resolving disputes. The CODEX alimentarius and OIE recommend standards for food safety and animal health, serving as guidelines for countries developing their own standards. The WTO's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures restricts traceability measures on imports to scientifically justified requirements equivalent to domestic standards. The Codex Alimentarius Commission, created by the FAO and the World, sets international food safety standards. The FAO and WHO collaborate to develop food standards and guidelines for consumer health and fair trade practices. The OIE, founded in 1924, is responsible for animal health standards. The OIE, an intergovernmental organization, is a leading international standard-setting body for animal identification and traceability. It helps member countries implement systems to improve disease prevention, control, food safety, and export certification. In 2006, the OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Standards Commission established guidelines on identification and traceability adopted by OIE Members. The OIE, as a standard-setting body, established guidelines on animal identification and traceability in 2006. These guidelines were adopted by OIE Members in May 2007 as official standards in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. The Director General of the OIE called for the worldwide implementation of animal identification and product traceability systems from \"farm to fork\" under these standards. Robust animal identification and tracing systems based on OIE standards allow compartmentalization and regionalization of disease outbreaks, enabling trade to continue for animal products. The OIE's Terrestrial Code includes sections on zoning and compartmentalization. Export certification is managed by USDA's FSIS for trade compliance. Certification for beef imports involves compliance with veterinary, animal health, and sanitary standards, including plant inspection by the importing country. The OIE contributes to international certification standards through its programs and promotion of transparency. Chapter 5 of the OIE's Terrestrial Code outlines general obligations and procedures for certification. The Code outlines general obligations and procedures for certification related to foreign animal ID and traceability programs, including Canada's national individual identification system for cattle and bison managed by the CCIA. The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) oversees the animal identification system for the Canadian cattle and bison industry. It was initially voluntary in 2001 but became mandatory in 2002. The CCIA works closely with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Agriculture Canada to meet funding requirements for development initiatives. Since 2003, the Canadian cattle industry has transitioned to RFID tags for all cattle leaving their farm of origin. These tags consist of a transponder with an encoded chip and antenna, providing benefits such as exceptional tag retention, increased data integrity, and the ability to read at a distance without line of sight. CCIA executive director Kerry St. Cyr estimated a nationwide compliance rate of 99-100% for Canadian cattle ID by March 2009. The Canadian cattle industry has a compliance rate of 99-100% for ID. Personal information linked to ear tag numbers is securely stored in the national database. The Canadian Livestock Traceability System (CLTS) manages ID and traceback systems for various industry groups. Sheep and hog ID programs in Canada became mandatory in 2004 and 2008. Australia has the National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) for traceability. The National Livestock Identification System (NLIS) in Australia is a permanent system for electronic identification and traceability of livestock from birth to slaughter. It has been mandatory for cattle since 2005 and for sheep and goats since 2009. Australia started its animal identification system in the 1960s to eradicate diseases like bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis. In 1967, a mandatory cattle identification system using Property Identification Codes (PICs) was established to trace cattle back to their last property of residence. In the mid-1990s, the system transitioned to electronic RFID technology for whole-of-life individual cattle identification to ensure biosecurity, food safety, and market access. In 1998, individual identification became compulsory for producers supplying the EU market with meat from Hormone Growth Promotant-free cattle. The NLIS was introduced in 1999, and by 2004, all animals identified using NLIS were traced to their property of origin within 24 hours. NLIS expanded in 2005 to mandatory animal identification for all cattle leaving their property of birth. Australia's NLIS requires individual animal ID numbers assigned at slaughter, linked to bar codes for tracking. However, unless agreements are made, animals are grouped into lots by harvest date, and individual carcass data is not available. The Australian Government collaborates with industry on animal identification programs, with the Federal government providing funding and policy coordination while state governments oversee livestock movement and health. Joint management committees develop legislation, and state governments offer education programs and a registry of PICs. The state governments in Australia oversee livestock movement and health, including the establishment of a registry of PICs and monitoring compliance with legislative requirements. Meat and Livestock Australia administers the database for NLIS, ensuring data protection from Australian Freedom of Information. The European Union also has specific regulations for animal identification. The European Union has mandatory programs for animal identification as part of its food safety initiatives. The objectives include localizing and tracing animals for veterinary purposes to control infectious diseases. Species-specific ID systems have evolved in response to disease outbreaks like classical swine fever in 1997 and foot-and-mouth disease in 2001. In response to the BSE crisis, the EU implemented a mandatory system for permanent identification of individual bovine animals, requiring double ear tags for identification, cattle passports for recording movements, and a national database for tracking information. The EU implemented a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system, including labeling meat products with a reference number linking them to the animal of origin, the member state of harvest, and facility approval numbers. Mandatory food traceability has been part of EU law since 2005. Since 2000, all equidae in the EU must have a passport for movement. Porcine animals have had mandatory identification since 2008, while ovine and caprine animals have had an ID system since 2005. Japan also has a mandatory bovine ID and traceability system since 2004, tracking animals from birth to consumer purchase. Imported beef does not have the same traceability requirements as domestically produced beef. In Japan, domestically produced beef is subject to traceability requirements due to food safety crises in the early 2000s. However, imported beef currently does not have the same traceability regulations. In Japan, traceability laws were enacted to track domestically produced beef from farms to slaughterhouses by December 1, 2003. The Food Safety Basic Law and Beef Traceability Law further extended traceability requirements to processors, distributors, and retailers by December 1, 2004. This led to retailers and restaurants displaying animal identification numbers for consumers to access information about the beef they purchase. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) in Japan introduced the Japan Agricultural Standard (JAS) program for certifying the traceability of imported beef. Exporters need to provide detailed information including date of birth, breed, owner's details, feeding practices, and pharmaceuticals used. South Korea has a mandatory Beef Traceability System (BTS) for domestically produced beef, requiring individual identification. The Beef Traceability System (BTS) in South Korea requires individual identification and registration in a central database for domestically produced beef. It tracks each animal from birth to consumer, providing detailed information such as sex, breed, quality grade, location of birth, owner's details, feed, medications, slaughter date, inspection date, and processing location. The South Korean government plans to implement traceability requirements on imported beef by December 2010. New Zealand lacks a national animal ID system but established the NAIT project in 2006 to improve traceability. As of early 2009, NAIT in New Zealand is still a project under development for traceability in cattle and deer populations. The current systems allow traceability at herd levels but not for individual animals, with gaps at the national level. Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) focuses on cattle and deer, with plans to add other species once the system is fully operational. New Zealand's animal ID systems, including MINDA and NBTIP, are in place for cattle and deer. MINDA is a voluntary herd management system with high dairy herd participation, while NBTIP is mandatory for cattle and deer traceability. A new mandatory animal identification system for cattle and possibly deer is proposed to be in place by June 2011 in Brazil. The Brazilian Bovine and Buffalo Identification and Certification System (SISBOV) was created in 2001 as a farm-level identification system for cattle, later extended to include the entire beef chain. SISBOV, initially planned as mandatory for individual animal identification by 2008, remains voluntary due to lack of demand in Brazil's domestic market. It focuses on premises supplying slaughterhouses for foreign markets like the EU, which requires strict traceability criteria for imported animal products. The EU imposed a near-total ban on beef imports from Brazil in 2008 due to severe shortcomings in animal identification and traceability. Despite efforts to improve, a 2009 report by the EU/FVO suggested the situation in Brazil was worsening. The EU/FVO raised concerns about Brazil's worsening situation in 2009, citing a lack of robust information and the fear of foot-and-mouth disease entering the EU. Argentina implemented a limited mandatory animal identification system in 2003, aimed at products for the EU, including farm-of-origin information and permits for cattle movements. Argentina implemented a limited mandatory animal identification system in 2003 for cattle destined for export markets, with official ID tagging required for calves born after September 2007. The program aims to track cattle from birth to slaughter, but the entire beef herd is not expected to be tagged until 2017. Argentina's beef exports to the United States are restricted to thermo-processed beef due to disease control issues, such as foot and mouth disease outbreaks. Argentina implemented a limited mandatory animal identification system in 2003 for cattle destined for export markets. Official ID tagging is required for calves born after September 2007, with the goal of tracking cattle from birth to slaughter. The entire beef herd is expected to be tagged by 2017. This system provides incentive for Argentina to improve its animal identification and traceability. Uruguay, on the other hand, is highly dependent on external markets for selling a large portion of its beef production. About 68% of Uruguay's annual beef production was sold in foreign markets during the 2004-2008 period. Uruguay has a strong incentive to provide animal identification and traceability information as demanded by foreign buyers, leading to the implementation of a comprehensive national program in late 2006 by the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries. Uruguay's Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries (MAGyP) introduced the National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in 2006, making it mandatory for all cattle to be identified with two tags before six months of age or before being transported. The government aims to have all herds registered and cattle tagged by 2010, with traceability extended beyond slaughter. The government of Uruguay introduced the National Livestock Information System (SNIG) in 2006, requiring all cattle to be identified with two tags before six months of age. By 2010, traceability will be extended to all cuts of beef back to specific animals at their farm of origin. SNIG includes premises and animal identification, movements, and termination data, with termination records recorded by MAGyP. Further traceability to consumers is under consideration. The Uruguayan government plans to shift the cost of ID tags for cattle to producers in the future. Some countries like Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Russia do not have animal ID programs due to large agrarian populations and lack of technological advancement. Many poorer countries lack national distribution chains for animal products, relying on local production and marketing. Lower-income consumers are often unable to pay a premium for traceable food."}

{"title": "r1l73iRqKm", "content": "In open-domain dialogue, intelligent agents struggle to incorporate knowledge into conversations. Existing models often rely on generic responses rather than recalled knowledge. To address this, a new dataset grounded in Wikipedia knowledge is collected to improve dialogue systems. Our dialogue models are designed to retrieve and use knowledge from Wikipedia, enabling them to engage in knowledgeable discussions on various topics. The ultimate goal is for machines to be able to converse with humans, requiring skills such as language comprehension and memory retention. Dialogue models aim to master skills like language comprehension, memory retention, reasoning, and generating captivating responses. Current state-of-the-art approaches, such as sequence to sequence models, struggle to incorporate memory and knowledge effectively in conversations. In the context of dialogue models, incorporating memory and knowledge effectively is crucial for open-domain conversations where speakers exchange information and viewpoints on various topics. This task presents a challenge that requires more direct knowledge memory mechanisms to be employed. In the context of dialogue models, incorporating memory and knowledge effectively is crucial for open-domain conversations. A new architecture called Transformer Memory Networks combines Memory Network and Transformer architectures to generate state-of-the-art text representations for human-human conversations. A supervised dataset was created using crowd-sourced workers to facilitate this research. The study involved crowd-sourcing diverse discussion topics and conversations with 201,999 utterances. Topics were linked to Wikipedia, and a human wizard connected knowledge to existing sentences. Transformer Memory Network architectures were tested for training conversation agents and evaluating their ability to use knowledge effectively. The study tested Transformer Memory Network architectures for training conversation agents to engage in knowledgeable conversations with humans. A new benchmark in ParlAI aims to encourage further improvements in this research direction by explicitly studying the use of knowledge in dialogue tasks. Popular chit-chat datasets focus on sequence-to-sequence models that attend to recent dialogue history but do not emphasize knowledge recall. Our work investigates unstructured knowledge across a diverse set of topics potentially spanning all of Wikipedia, unlike models that focus on recent dialogue history or access databases through API calls. In question answering, the goal is to provide a factual answer based on a question, rather than producing a dialogue response based on conversation history. In question answering, retrieving and conditioning knowledge is crucial. Neural models in SQuAD and Open-SQuAD answer questions by attending to Wikipedia paragraphs. QuAC dataset explores dialogue-based question answering. This work focuses on natural human dialogues, not just questions and answers. The work discussed in the curr_chunk focuses on dialogue incorporating knowledge, similar to previous works using Memory Networks and structured knowledge bases. BID14 and BID8 also use unstructured text for discussions, with BID8 utilizing an extended Encoder-Decoder model. In contrast to previous works using Memory Networks and structured knowledge bases, our task involves grounding dialogues with Wikipedia articles and sentences. Our model combines Memory Networks, Transformers, and RNNs for encoding and decoding. Our paper also compares our approach with a dataset based on movie chats. Our work BID13 introduced a dataset for movie chats in a closed domain. The paper showcases models handling full multi-turn dialogue in an open-domain setting, a novel approach. The dialogue setting involves two participants engaging in chitchat, with one as a knowledgeable expert (wizard) and the other as a curious learner (apprentice). The apprentice freely interacts with the wizard, playing the role of a curious learner. In the conversation stage, the apprentice engages with the wizard as a curious learner, aiming to delve deeply into a chosen topic of interest. The wizard's role is to share information with their partner, emphasizing the use of knowledge in the discussion. The wizard in a conversation game has access to Wikipedia paragraphs to guide their replies, aiming to share knowledge in an engaging way. The flow of conversation involves choosing a topic, with the wizard or apprentice speaking first. The conversation game involves a wizard and an apprentice choosing a topic to discuss. The wizard uses relevant knowledge from Wikipedia to respond to the apprentice's messages. The goal is to replace the human wizard with a learned agent. The conversation game involves a wizard and an apprentice discussing various topics using knowledge from Wikipedia. The goal is to replace the human wizard with a learned agent. Topics include commuting, Gouda cheese, music festivals, podcasts, bowling, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The wizard has access to relevant knowledge passages during the dialogue. The conversation game involves a wizard and an apprentice discussing topics using knowledge from Wikipedia. A retriever is used to present articles as knowledge context to the wizard, comparing articles and queries using TF-IDF weighted bag-of-word and n-gram vectors. Top articles are retrieved for dialogue turns and original topic. During data collection, the wizard can select relevant article titles and sentences to generate responses for the apprentice. Only one article and sentence can be chosen per turn. The wizard then enters their response. In this work, dialogue models are developed to replace the wizard in learning tasks. These models have access to a knowledge source like Wikipedia to ground conversations. Extensions of Memory Network BID19 and Transformer BID21 models are created to retrieve relevant information from a large memory, read and attend to it, and generate the next dialogue utterance. This model is used consecutively on each turn to form a complete dialogue with a user. The dialogue models developed in this work have access to a knowledge source like Wikipedia to ground conversations. Two classes of models are created: retrieval models that produce responses from a set of candidate responses, and generative models that generate word-by-word. The input to both models is the current dialogue context, and the goal is to output the next utterance. Knowledge retrieval is based on a large knowledge base. The next stage involves knowledge retrieval from a large hierarchical knowledge base using standard information retrieval techniques to return a smaller set of candidates for fine-grained selection. The retriever operates on the dialogue topic and the last two turns, calling the IR system three times. The retrieval process involves calling the IR system three times with different queries to retrieve top articles. The results are flattened into separate sentences with article titles prepended for independent attention by the neural model in the next stage. The retrieval process involves calling the IR system three times with different queries to retrieve top articles, which are then flattened into separate sentences for independent attention by the neural model in the next stage. Knowledge attention is used to select relevant knowledge sentences for the next dialogue turn, followed by utterance prediction to generate the output utterance. Different variants of knowledge attention and utterance prediction are considered. The model encodes knowledge sentences and dialogue context using a Transformer. Dot-product attention is used to calculate the final input encoding, which is then combined with candidate responses encoded separately. The model is trained to select the best response based on the input encoding. The model is trained to minimize cross-entropy loss by selecting the best response from negative candidates. Two versions, Two-stage and End-to-end, find the most relevant knowledge and encode it with dialogue context for response formulation. Beam search of 5 is used for response selection. Generative models employ BPE encoding for copying rare words from Wikipedia sentences. The End-to-end version of the model uses a shared Transformer encoder to encode candidates and dialogue history, producing an attention prediction over the memory. The selected knowledge is concatenated with the dialogue encoding and passed into a Transformer decoder for response generation. Training aims to minimize negative loss. The End-to-end model uses a shared Transformer encoder for encoding candidates and dialogue history, with training focused on minimizing negative loss. In the Two-stage version, separate models are used for knowledge selection and utterance prediction, with emphasis on maximizing the performance of knowledge selection. Additional supervision can be added by ensuring correct knowledge selection through crossentropy loss modulation. In the context of dialogue systems, maximizing the performance of components is crucial. Employing knowledge dropout (K.D.) can enhance decoder performance by preventing the model from attending to knowledge during training. This technique helps the generator handle errors in knowledge selection and speeds up training. Experimental setups and results are described, focusing on knowledge selection and dialogue tasks. The proposed K.D. technique is similar to other dropout methods and proves beneficial in improving model resilience and training efficiency. In the context of dialogue systems, maximizing component performance is crucial. Knowledge dropout (K.D.) enhances decoder performance by preventing model attention to knowledge during training. Experimental setups and results focus on knowledge selection and dialogue tasks. The proposed K.D. technique improves model resilience and training efficiency. Transformers pretrained on a large dataset (Reddit) work best for predicting knowledge selected by human wizards in dialogue tasks. The best performing Transformer model pretrained on a large dataset (Reddit) is used for a two-stage generative Memory Network in dialogue generation tasks. Evaluation is done on dialogue generation with knowledge in two settings: using gold knowledge chosen by a human or predicting which knowledge to use. Experiments are conducted for retrieval and generative models, with Transformer Memory applied as a baseline. The addition of knowledge improves all models in the experiments, with Bow MemNet improving from 56 to 71 Recall@1 and Transformer MemNet from 79 to 87 Recall@1. Performance significantly increases when models are given gold knowledge. Generative End-to-end and Two-stage Transformer Memory Network models are compared in the experiments. The generative End-to-end and Two-stage Transformer Memory Network models outperform baselines in dialogue response prediction by utilizing knowledge, as shown in the evaluation results. The Two-stage model shows stronger performance with predicted knowledge, while the End-to-end model also demonstrates improvements when provided with gold knowledge. The End-to-end model outperforms the Two-stage model in gold knowledge experiments, suggesting better knowledge utilization. Additional knowledge selection supervision in the End-to-end model improves performance on every metric. Knowledge dropout also proves beneficial. The conversation revolves around a preference for physical books over e-books due to the tactile experience and ownership of a real book. The individuals find reading on a screen disorienting and prefer the feel of turning pages. The mention of owning physical copies and a preference for print and newsreels is also made. The study evaluates Two-stage models against retrieval models in terms of F1 scores. Human evaluation involves chatting with models on specific topics and rating engagingness. Wiki F1 score measures model utterance overlap with Wikipedia. The study compares Two-stage models to retrieval models based on F1 scores and human engagingness ratings from conversations. Retrieval models outperform generative models in engagingness evaluation. The study found that retriever models with knowledge trend towards higher engagingness and Wiki F1 scores compared to those without knowledge. Generative models also showed improved engagingness ratings and higher Wiki F1 scores when using knowledge conditioning. The study found that retrieval models with knowledge have higher engagingness and Wiki F1 scores compared to those without knowledge. On unseen data, the gap between retrieval and generative models is larger due to retrieval models being limited to the training set. Human ratings still show a considerable gap compared to all models. Example conversations with retrieval and generative models are shown in FIG2. Our study focuses on developing Transformer Memory Network models that utilize encyclopedic knowledge for engaging open-domain conversations. We introduce the Wizard of Wikipedia dataset for training and evaluating these models, aiming to encourage further exploration in this research direction. The study focuses on developing Transformer Memory Network models using encyclopedic knowledge for engaging open-domain conversations. The Wizard of Wikipedia dataset is introduced for training and evaluating these models, with future work including bridging the gap between retrieval responses and generative models, learning to retrieve and reason simultaneously, and investigating the relationship between knowledge-grounded dialogue and existing QA tasks. The goal is to create an engaging and knowledgeable conversational agent. The Wizard of Wikipedia dataset contains conversations between a wizard and an apprentice, where the wizard has access to an information retrieval system over Wikipedia. The dataset shows that apprentices ask questions in 13.9% of training set utterances and answer questions 39.5% of the time. Knowledge retrieval is performed based on dialogue history, with \u223c61 knowledge candidates per turn. The Wizard of Wikipedia dataset shows that the wizard and apprentice engage in various dialogue acts, with the wizard answering questions 39.5% of the time and making new statements 49.3% of the time. The dataset is based on the Persona-Chat dataset, where personas were created by crowdworkers to serve as topics of interest for conversations. The Wizard of Wikipedia dataset involves mapping sentences to relevant Wikipedia pages to obtain 1,431 topics for dialogue. The dataset is based on the Persona-Chat dataset, where personas serve as conversation starters. Additional experiments include testing the performance of models on knowledge selection tasks. The retrieval system's performance on the knowledge selection task was tested, showing room for improvement. Auxiliary loss was found to benefit generative models. Dialogues from human evaluation experiments were analyzed, with 20 conversations sampled from each experimental setting. Common errors and behaviors were noted in a single-blind setup analysis. In a single-blind setup analysis of human-human and bot conversations, differences were observed. Humans engage in more small talk, while bots tend to produce factual sentences like in the Wizard dataset. Some humans treat bots as question-answer machines. The study found that humans treat bots as question-answer machines, with retrievers without knowledge prone to non sequiturs. Retrievers with knowledge stick to the topic but struggle when the subject changes. In a two-stage retrieval system, the best-performing model for knowledge selection outperformed the best retrieval method in F1 score but not in Recall@1. Comparing this to a system where the dialogue retrieval module is optimized for the gold chosen knowledge sentence, suggests that improving performance on the knowledge selection subtask could enhance the retrieval system. The wizard and apprentice's Wiki F1 scores were calculated for comparison to human evaluations. The wizard had direct access to Wikipedia passages, resulting in higher Wiki F1 values. The model sometimes provides factually inaccurate answers, such as listing locations in Greece when asked about parts of Ireland. Despite this, it offers inviting responses. The generator without knowledge exhibits typical seq2seq system behaviors like repetition and inconsistencies in personality. In contrast, the generator with knowledge shows fewer issues with repetition by copying large fragments. The generator with knowledge, while sometimes producing inaccurate statements, is able to generalize to unseen topics using information from Wikipedia. It may act as a conversationalist and often provides formulaic responses."}

{"title": "115_hr3804", "content": "The Act is titled the \"Safe Communities Act of 2017\" and includes findings. The Congress acknowledges the lack of financial resources for incorporating disaster threats into land use planning, leading to costly relief programs and disruptive security measures. This highlights the need for improved planning to mitigate the impact of natural and human-caused disasters, including terrorism. The Federal Government and State governments should support incorporating disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness into land use planning to enhance community safety. Disaster response and relief efforts in the United States are costly, with a focus on post-disaster recovery rather than mitigation. Planning should prioritize prevention of property damage and human casualties by proactively integrating mitigation strategies. Mitigation strategies from various professional fields such as urban planning, architecture, and landscape architecture are essential for reducing risks posed by natural disasters and terrorist acts. Comprehensive planning, supported by the Federal Government and States, should prioritize prevention through proactive integration of mitigation practices. Many States are updating land use statutes to support comprehensive planning for safe communities, incorporating long-term hazard mitigation and emergency preparedness. State and regional investments need coordination with local plans, requiring additional State-level planning for at-risk public infrastructure. Comprehensive urban planning considers the relationship between land use, transportation systems, and water. Local governments should integrate safety considerations into comprehensive planning efforts to promote safe and economically viable communities. Safe housing is essential for community development, and modern planning techniques should ensure a broad range of safe housing options for all community members. Prevailing land use patterns often impact community safety. Prevailing land use patterns in rural communities and small towns on the metropolitan fringe pose risks due to haphazard development. The Federal and State governments should support Tribal and Native Hawaiian efforts in land use planning for safer housing and community development. The Federal and State governments should support Tribal and Native Hawaiian efforts in land use planning for safer housing and community development. The Safe Communities Planning Grants are outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Homeland Security will establish a grant program to assist States and local governments in developing or updating land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning documents to address natural and human-caused hazards, including acts of terror. The grant program aims to support States and local governments in enhancing land use planning statutes and comprehensive planning to address various hazards, including acts of terror. Eligibility for the grant requires submission of proposals by State or local planning directors. State or local planning directors must submit an application to the Secretary demonstrating consistency with guidelines on citizen engagement and multi-jurisdictional cooperation in land use planning legislation. To effectively assess risks from natural hazards and terrorist acts, planning legislation and regulations are created through multi-agency cooperation between Federal, State, and local government agencies. Land use plans include implementation elements with timetables for action. Comprehensive planning involves defining roles and responsibilities, aligning with budget objectives, and guiding decisions on future infrastructure development. Land use plans should incorporate risk considerations. The text chunk discusses the importance of incorporating risk assessment and mitigation into State or locally adopted comprehensive plans, urban design guidelines, building codes, and transportation plans. It also emphasizes the need for updating these plans over time and ensuring they reflect appropriate standards. Grant funds received under subsection (a) must be used for developing comprehensive land use plans, integrating natural hazard mitigation and security plan elements, and assessing critical public infrastructure for land use and community development policies. The grant funds must be used for developing geographical information systems, scenario planning technology, updating building codes and zoning regulations, implementing CPTED initiatives, and assessing risk and vulnerability related to land use. The grant funds can be used for assessing risk and vulnerability related to land use, incorporating mitigation and security elements in transportation plans, encouraging interagency cooperation, and identifying natural hazard areas. The maximum grant amount is $1,125,000. The grant amount under subsection (a) is capped at $1,125,000.

{"title": "B1i7ezW0-", "content": "A new semi-supervised learning framework is developed using an inversion scheme for deep neural networks, applicable to various systems and problems. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on MNIST and shows promising performance on SVHN and CIFAR10. It introduces the use of residual networks in semi-supervised tasks for the first time and demonstrates its effectiveness on one-dimensional signals. This method is simple, efficient, and does not require changes to the deep network architecture. Deep neural networks have advanced in various machine perception tasks but still rely on costly fully supervised training with labeled data. Semi-supervised learning leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to train deep neural networks, reducing the need for costly fully supervised training. Current methods for semi-supervised learning in DNNs have limitations such as training instability. In this paper, a new semi-supervised learning approach is introduced for deep neural networks. It includes an inverse function for input reconstruction and a loss function that incorporates information from unlabeled data into the learning process. The key insight is the ease of deriving and computing the general inverse function. The defined and general inverse function can be easily derived and computed for unlabeled data points to minimize error between input signal and estimate without extra cost. This approach promises to advance semi-supervised and unsupervised learning significantly. The semi-supervised approach with ladder network employs per-layer denoising reconstruction loss, turning a deep unsupervised model into a semi-supervised model by describing the class distribution of the input. The main drawback is the difficulty in generalizing it to other network topologies. The probabilistic formulation of deep convolutional nets in BID14 supports semi-supervised learning, but requires ReLU activation functions and a deep convolutional network topology. Temporal Ensembling for Semi-Supervised Learning in BID8 aims to constrain representations of the same input stimuli to be identical in the latent space despite dropout noise, seeking stability in representation. Temporal Ensembling for Semi-Supervised Learning in BID8 utilizes dropout noise to seek stability in representation by constraining representations of the same input stimuli to be identical in the latent space. This technique provides explicit loss for unsupervised examples and a more efficient method known as temporal ensembling. Distributional Smoothing with Virtual Adversarial Training BID12 introduces a regularization term to maintain the regularity of the DNN mapping for a given sample, leading to a semi-supervised setting where unlabeled samples must maintain a stable DNN. This paper proposes a simple way to invert any piecewise differentiable mapping, including DNNs, without changing their structure. It introduces a new optimization framework for semisupervised learning and emphasizes the importance of reconstruction ability closely related to DNN stability. The paper introduces a new optimization framework for semisupervised learning that leverages penalty terms based on input reconstruction. It reviews the work of BID1, which interprets DNNs as linear splines, providing a mathematical justification for deep learning reconstruction. This theory allows for the approximation of DNNs by multivariate linear splines, improving on current state-of-the-art methods for various DNN topologies. The paper presents a new optimization framework for semisupervised learning using penalty terms based on input reconstruction. It discusses interpreting DNNs as linear splines, allowing for the approximation of DNNs by multivariate linear splines for different topologies. The theory enables deriving an explicit input-output mapping formula for DNNs. The output denoted by \u0177(x) in a Resnet DNN is a result of linear mappings applied layer by layer. The bias term accumulates per-layer biases, providing stability and a direct linear connection between input x and inner representations z(x). This reduces information loss sensitivity to nonlinearity. The Resnet DNN output \u0177(x) is a result of linear mappings, reducing information loss sensitivity to nonlinearity. Optimal templates for prediction have been shown to be proportional to the input, minimizing cross-entropy with softmax nonlinearity. In the case of spherical softmax, optimal templates become null for incorrect classes. Theorem 1 states that when all inputs have a norm of 1, reconstruction is implied by the optimal DNN solution. The corollary proposes the inverse of a DNN as a method for reconstruction based on the DNN representation of the input. This leverages the closest input hyperplane found through the forward step. The method provides a reconstruction based on the DNN representation of the input, distinct from exact input reconstruction. Bias correction has insightful meaning compared to known frameworks. With ReLU based nonlinearities, the scheme resembles soft-thresholding denoising. Further details on inverting a network and semi-supervised application are provided in the next section. The inverse strategy is applied to a given task with an arbitrary DNN. In our application, we used automatic differentiation to modify the objective loss function for semi-supervised learning in deep neural networks. The efficiency of our inversion scheme lies in rewriting any deep network as a linear mapping, allowing for the derivation of a network inverse. The efficiency of the inversion scheme in deep neural networks is achieved by deriving a network inverse defined as f \u22121. This allows for the computation of the matrix efficiently on any deep network via differentiation. The reconstruction error represents the reconstruction loss for common frameworks like wavelet thresholding and PCA. Incorporating this loss is essential for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. The reconstruction loss R is defined as the mean squared error or any other differentiable reconstruction loss like cosine similarity. A \"specialization\" loss, the Shannon entropy of class belonging probability prediction, is introduced for semi-supervised learning to force clustering of unlabeled examples towards learned clusters. Experiments show the benefits of this approach. The complete loss function combines cross entropy loss for labeled data, reconstruction loss, and entropy loss with parameters \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1]. These parameters control the ratio between supervised and unsupervised loss, guiding learning towards a better optimum. Experiments demonstrate the benefits of this approach. Results of our approach on a semi-supervised task on the MNIST dataset show reasonable performances with different topologies. MNIST consists of 70000 grayscale images split into a training set of 60000 images and a test set of 10000 images. With N L = 50 labeled samples, the rest of the training set is unlabeled and used for reconstruction and entropy loss minimization. Parameter search was conducted over (\u03b1, \u03b2) values to optimize the learning process. The study conducted parameter search over (\u03b1, \u03b2) values to optimize the learning process with different topologies. The Resnet topologies, especially wide Resnet, achieved the best performance on a semi-supervised task on the MNIST dataset. The proposed scheme using Theano and Lasagne libraries led to improved results. The study optimized learning with different topologies on MNIST using Theano and Lasagne libraries. Results show improved performance with deep CNN models on CIFAR10 and SVHN datasets with varying labeled data. The study optimized learning with different topologies on MNIST using Theano and Lasagne libraries, showing improved performance with deep CNN models on CIFAR10 and SVHN datasets. Results on a supervised task on the Bird10 dataset for classifying 10 bird species from their songs in a tropical forest are presented. In this study, networks based on raw audio were trained using CNNs. Varying (\u03b1, \u03b2) over 10 runs showed that non-regularized supervised models are not optimal. Regularized networks learn more slowly but generalize better. The study showed that regularized networks learn more slowly but generalize better than non-regularized models. An inversion scheme for deep neural networks was presented, achieving state-of-the-art results on MNIST. This opens up new questions in the area of DNN inversion and input reconstruction. The study demonstrated that regularized networks learn slowly but generalize well compared to non-regularized models. An inversion scheme for deep neural networks was introduced, showing impressive results on MNIST, leading to new inquiries in DNN inversion and input reconstruction. The reconstruction loss can be developed into a per-layer loss, allowing for weighted penalties on each layer to enhance meaningful reconstruction. This approach prioritizes high reconstruction accuracy for inner layers close to the final latent representation, reducing the cost for layers closer to the input, especially in noisy datasets with background interference. Additionally, updating the weighting during learning can further improve the reconstruction process. One approach to improve learning is to update loss weighting coefficients \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 after each batch or epoch using backpropagation. This can be done through an iterative update based on a given policy, such as gradient descent. One approach to improve learning is to update loss weighting coefficients \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 after each batch or epoch using backpropagation. This can be done through an iterative update based on a given policy, such as gradient descent. An alternative method involves using adversarial training to update hyper-parameters, where both updates cooperate to accelerate learning. GANs like EBGAN and BID18 use a discriminant network D to measure the energy of input X, with high energy for generated data and low energy for real data. Authors suggest using an auto-encoder to compute this energy function, but a proposed method aims to replace the autoencoder for reconstructing X and computing energy, resulting in D(X) = R(X). Our proposed method reconstructs X and computes energy, requiring only half the parameters for D. It allows for unsupervised tasks like clustering by setting \u03b1 = 0. The framework differs from a deep autoencoder as it does not have greedy layer-wise reconstruction loss and focuses on the final output. In our proposed method, the reconstruction loss only considers the final output. There is parameter and activation sharing, with backward activation states induced by backward projection. Different nets are compared for reconstructing a test sample. The network successfully reconstructs the test sample using mean-pooling, max-pooling, and inhibitor connections."}

{"title": "rkhlb8lCZ", "content": "Wavelet Pooling is introduced as an alternative to traditional neighborhood pooling in Convolutional Neural Networks for image and object classification. This method decomposes features into a second level decomposition, reducing feature dimensions and addressing overfitting encountered by max pooling in a more compact manner. Our proposed Wavelet Pooling method addresses the overfitting issue of max pooling by reducing features in a more compact manner. Experimental results show it outperforms or performs comparably with other pooling methods like max, mean, mixed, and stochastic pooling in classification tasks. CNNs are widely used for image and object classification due to their superior accuracy compared to vector-based deep learning techniques. The strength of the CNN algorithm drives researchers to constantly upgrade its key components, the convolutional and pooling layers, to enhance accuracy and efficiency. Pooling, rooted in predecessors like Neocognitron and Cresceptron, subsamples convolutional results to reduce spatial dimensions and parameters, improving computational efficiency. Pooling operations in CNNs aim to reduce parameters, increase computational efficiency, and prevent overfitting. Max pooling and average pooling are common methods, but they have limitations. Other approaches like mixed pooling and stochastic pooling use probabilistic techniques to address these issues. All pooling operations involve subsampling in a neighborhood approach similar to nearest neighbor interpolation in image processing. Our proposed wavelet pooling algorithm utilizes second-level wavelet decomposition to subsample features, avoiding artifacts like edge halos and blurring. This method aims to minimize data discontinuities for network regularization and improved classification accuracy. Comparison with other pooling methods such as max, mean, mixed, and stochastic pooling is conducted. Our proposed wavelet pooling algorithm utilizes second-level wavelet decomposition to subsample features, avoiding artifacts like edge halos and blurring. We compare it to other pooling methods such as max, mean, mixed, and stochastic pooling on benchmark image classification datasets. The simulations are performed in MATLAB R2016b. The paper is organized into sections discussing background, proposed methods, experimental results, and a summary. Pooling is a method of subsampling in convolutional layers, where regions are condensed into one neuron value. Max pooling selects the maximum value of a region, while average pooling calculates the average value. The max pooling function selects the maximum value in a region, while average pooling calculates the average value. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, with max pooling potentially erasing details from an image and overfitting training data. Researchers have developed probabilistic pooling methods to address the shortcomings of max and average pooling. Mixed pooling combines both methods by randomly selecting one over the other during training, with no set way to perform it. Probabilistic pooling methods like mixed pooling and stochastic pooling have been developed to improve upon max and average pooling. Mixed pooling randomly selects between max and average pooling during training, while stochastic pooling samples from neighborhood regions based on activation probabilities. Stochastic pooling selects activations based on probabilities, avoiding the limitations of max and average pooling. It samples from a multinomial distribution to choose a location within a region, with activations having higher probabilities more likely to be selected. This method offers some advantages of max pooling while being probabilistic. The proposed pooling method uses wavelets to reduce feature map dimensions and minimize artifacts. By discarding first-order subbands, it captures data compression more organically, reducing jagged edges and other artifacts that could affect image classification. The proposed wavelet pooling scheme in image classification performs a 2nd order decomposition using the fast wavelet transform (FWT) to efficiently implement the two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (DWT). This involves approximation and detail coefficients, scaling and wavelet vectors, and resolution levels. The proposed wavelet pooling algorithm performs a 2nd order decomposition using the FWT on images, obtaining detail subbands (LH, HL, HH) and an approximation subband (LL) at each level. The image features are reconstructed using only the 2nd order wavelet subbands, pooling them by a factor of 2 with the IFWT based on the IDWT. The algorithm illustrated in FIG3 shows the forward propagation of wavelet pooling, with backpropagation reversing the process. The proposed wavelet pooling algorithm performs backpropagation by reversing the process of forward propagation. Image features undergo 1st order wavelet decomposition, with detail coefficient subbands upsampled by a factor of 2 to create a new 1st level decomposition. This initial decomposition then becomes the 2nd level decomposition, reconstructing the image feature for further backpropagation using the IDWT. All CNN experiments use MatConvNet, and training employs stochastic gradient descent. The wavelet basis is crucial for the proposed method. The proposed method utilizes the Haar wavelet basis for backpropagation in CNN experiments. Experiments are conducted on a 64-bit operating system with specific hardware configurations. Different regularization techniques are tested on CIFAR-10 and SHVN datasets to observe their impact on pooling results. The proposed method uses the Haar wavelet basis for backpropagation in CNN experiments, testing different pooling methods on various datasets. Results show the proposed method outperforms all others, using the MNIST database for training and testing. Our proposed method outperforms all others in testing different pooling methods on various datasets. Max pooling starts to overfit the data with a small number of epochs, while mixed and stochastic pooling show a rocky trajectory without overfitting. Average and wavelet pooling exhibit a smoother descent in learning and error reduction. Two sets of experiments were run, one without extra regularization and the other with dropout and batch normalization, to observe the effects of these changes over 30 more epochs. Our network structure for CIFAR-10 experiments includes full training and test data sets. Our proposed method ranks second in accuracy, with wavelet pooling resisting overfitting. Changes in learning rate prevent overfitting, showing slower learning progression. Mixed and stochastic pooling maintain consistent learning progression. In the SHVN experiments, two sets of experiments were conducted with pooling methods, one without dropout layers and the other with dropout. The network structure for the experiments is shown in FIG0. The training and test data come from the SHVN dataset, with different image sets used for cases with and without dropout. In the SHVN experiments, a set of 531,131 images and a testing set of 26,032 images were used. The proposed method showed the second lowest accuracy, with max and wavelet pooling slightly overfitting the data. The method followed the path of max pooling, performing slightly better in maintaining stability. Mixed, stochastic, and average pooling showed a slow progression of learning. Experiments with dropout included a network structure for the KDEF experiments. The KDEF dataset contains 4,900 images of 35 people displaying seven basic emotions using facial expressions at five poses. The dataset had errors which were fixed by mirroring missing or corrupted images in MATLAB and adding them back. Images were manually cropped to match. The KDEF dataset contains 4,900 images of 35 people displaying seven basic emotions using facial expressions at five poses. Images were manually cropped to match dimensions. The dataset does not have designated training or test sets. Data was shuffled, with 3,900 images for training and 1,000 for testing. Images were resized to 128x128 due to constraints. Dropout layers help regulate the network and maintain stability. The proposed method showed the second highest accuracy. Max pooling tends to overfit, while wavelet pooling resists overfitting. Average and mixed pooling are unstable for most learning. Stochastic pooling maintains consistency. The construction and implementation of wavelet pooling is not efficient, presented as a proof-of-concept with potential for improvement in computational efficiency. The code implementation is not at its peak form due to time, space, and resource constraints. The method presented is not optimized due to constraints. Efficiency is measured in terms of mathematical operations for different pooling methods such as max, average, mixed, and stochastic pooling. The results are seen as a starting point for future improvements by both the researchers and others in the field. The mean value of average and max pooling is calculated for stochastic pooling using mathematical operations and random selection based on probability. Wavelet pooling involves operations for each subband at each level. Average pooling has the least computations, followed by mixed pooling, with max pooling close behind. Stochastic pooling is the least computationally efficient method among neighborhood-based methods. Wavelet pooling is the least computationally efficient method, using 54 to 213x more mathematical operations than average pooling. However, with improvements in coding practices, GPUs, and an enhanced FTW algorithm, this method can still be a viable option. The FTW algorithm has been improved with multidimensional wavelets, lifting, parallelization, and other methods to enhance speed and memory efficiency. Wavelet pooling shows potential to outperform traditional methods in CNNs, with superior performance in the MNIST dataset and competitive results in CIFAR-10 and KDEF datasets. Dropout and batch normalization are added for network regularization, resulting in improved performance compared to non-dropout cases. The study explores different pooling methods in CNNs, showing that no single method is superior. Results indicate that varying pooling methods can maximize effectiveness, with potential for improvement by exploring different wavelet bases. In exploring different pooling methods in CNNs, altering upsampling and downsampling factors in decomposition and reconstruction can improve image feature reductions. Retaining discarded subbands for backpropagation may enhance accuracies. Improving the FTW method could boost computational efficiency. Analyzing SSIM of wavelet pooling versus other methods could validate the effectiveness of this approach."}
{"title": "R44870", "content": "Many governments recognize the international risks of environmental degradation and climate change, leading to negotiations for international agreements to protect the environment and promote sustainable growth. Efforts by wealthier countries alone are deemed insufficient without similar measures in lower-income countries prioritizing poverty reduction. International financial assistance is crucial for lower-income countries to address global environmental problems. The UNFCCC, ratified by the United States in 1992, recognizes human-driven climate change and outlines obligations for higher-income Parties. The UNFCCC, ratified by the United States in 1992, outlines obligations for higher-income Parties to provide new and additional financial resources to developing countries for meeting their compliance costs. The United States has delivered on these commitments over the past few decades. The United States has provided financial and technical assistance for climate change activities in developing countries through various bilateral and multilateral programs. This assistance has been delivered through agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development and contributions to environmental funds at international financial institutions. The United States has provided financial and technical assistance for climate change activities in developing countries through various international financial institutions and organizations. This includes the Global Environment Facility, the Green Climate Fund, the U.N. Development Program, the U.N. Environment Program, the World Bank's Climate Investment Funds, and the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility. The UNFCCC establishes a financial mechanism to provide funds to developing country Parties. The GEF, established in 1991, operates as a financial mechanism for international environmental agreements, including the UNFCCC. The relationship between the UNFCCC and the GEF is outlined in a memorandum of understanding. The US has committed to six GEF resource replenishments, providing significant funding over the years. In 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014, the US committed a total of $2.732 billion to the GEF, representing 13% of the institution's total funding. US disbursements since 1994 amount to approximately $2.2 billion. The COP adopted elements of the Copenhagen Accord in the Cancun Agreements, including Fast start financing by developed countries. The agreement commits developed countries to provide $30 billion for climate finance in 2010-2012 and aims to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020. Funding sources can be public, private, bilateral, or multilateral. The Paris Agreement (PA) adopted in 2015 brings all nations together to combat climate change and support developing countries. Developed countries, including the United States, are obligated to provide financial support for climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. The agreement aims to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 from various funding sources. The Paris Agreement (PA) encourages all Parties to provide financial support voluntarily, regardless of economic standing. Developed countries are urged to lead in mobilizing climate finance from various sources, aiming for a progression beyond previous efforts. The COP Decision reaffirms the $100 billion annual pledge by developed countries until 2025. The Parties agree to set a new collective quantified goal for mobilizing financial resources of at least $100 billion annually to assist developing country Parties by 2025. President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the PA in 2017, with the process to be completed by November 4, 2020. The GCF was designated as an operating entity of the UNFCCC's financial mechanism following the 2009 Copenhagen Accord. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was designed during the 2011 COP in Durban, South Africa to assist developing countries combat climate change through grants and concessional financing. It operates independently from the UNFCCC with its own board, trustee, and secretariat. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) provides grants and concessional financing to assist developing countries combat climate change. It was capitalized by financial inputs from developed country Parties to the Convention and other public and private sources. The GCF became operational in 2014 with approximately $10.3 billion pledged for its initial capitalization. The U.S. Department of State made contributions of $500 million in March 2016 and January 2017 from the agency's Economic Support Fund. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 allows the President to use the Economic Support Fund to provide assistance for economic or political stability. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request aims to eliminate U.S. funding for the Green Climate Fund in alignment with President Trump's promise to cease payments. The Trump Administration aims to eliminate U.S. funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in FY2018, aligning with President Trump's promise to cease payments to UN climate change programs. Despite the U.S. disbursing $1 billion to the GCF under the Obama Administration, the future of U.S. board membership in the GCF remains uncertain under the Trump Administration. The future of U.S. board membership in the Green Climate Fund (GCF) remains uncertain under the Trump Administration, which aims to eliminate U.S. funding for the GCF in FY2018. The State Department has not confirmed if it will retain its board membership, stating that future U.S. engagement with the GCF will be decided as part of a wider internal process to develop climate change policy. The GCF's relationship to the UNFCCC 2020 pledges for mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020 is not directly tied to public funding. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is just one of many public and multilateral sources that could contribute to the $100 billion goal for climate financing. Development bank instruments, carbon markets, and private capital are also seen as crucial for reaching the pledged assistance levels. Bilateral aid would not be affected by the GCF's involvement. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) would not interfere with bilateral climate change assistance to developing countries. It would complement other multilateral mechanisms for climate change assistance, such as the GEF and the World Bank's Climate Investment Funds. The GCF board is tasked with determining its complementarity with other U.N. multilateral mechanisms, potentially altering future multilateral aid choices provided by the UNFCCC. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) would not interfere with bilateral climate change assistance to developing countries. U.S. allocations among multilateral assistance channels would remain based on congressional guidance. Table 1 lists donor Parties to the GCF, their pledges, and disbursements. Withdrawal from the PA may have both positive and negative implications for the United States. The United States' climate change programs may have positive and negative implications, including fiscal savings. The U.S. government provided $1 billion annually for climate finance under the Obama Administration, accounting for 3% of the foreign operations budget. Critics question the effectiveness of international financial assistance in promoting economic development in lower-income countries. Reductions in international financial assistance could redirect funds to other priorities, including U.S. exports, and help sustain markets for GHG-intensive fuels and technologies. Some stakeholders argue that U.S. withdrawal from climate change commitments under the PA redefines U.S. international relations, emphasizing issues of sovereignty and national interest. The withdrawal from climate change commitments under the PA redefines U.S. international relations, emphasizing sovereignty, national interest, and control of domestic economics, legal systems, and political values. Potential repercussions include investment efficiencies and higher costs of responding to climate-related catastrophes in the future. Developing countries may find economic efficiencies more readily due to lower costs of adopting new technologies. Reductions in international financial assistance could increase economic inefficiencies and worsen poverty, social tensions, and environmental degradation in developing countries, impacting both the country and U.S. interests. Climate finance in developing countries may benefit U.S. businesses supporting low-emissions technologies, while reductions in international financial assistance could restrict global economic activity for these goods and services, including U.S. exports. Financial commitments under the PA allow the U.S. to increase its global environmental leadership and influence international economic and environmental policies. The United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement may impact its global environmental leadership and influence on economic and environmental policies. Despite being released from specific obligations, the US would still be committed to providing financial resources to developing countries and mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020. The Administration has not clarified its intentions regarding these commitments. The Trump Administration's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and cessation of U.S. payments to climate change programs could have minimal impacts if other investments compensate. However, it may erode international efforts to help developing countries confront climate change. The U.S. Congress determines contributions to developing countries for climate change activities, authorizing programs, appropriations, and providing guidance. Congressional committees overseeing international climate change assistance include the U.S. House of Representatives Committees on Foreign Affairs, Financial Services, and Appropriations. The U.S. Congress oversees international climate change assistance through committees in the House of Representatives and the Senate."}

{"title": "R40080", "content": "Total nonfarm employment declined steadily between December 2007 and October 2009, dropping from 137,951,000 to 129,633,000, with the majority of job losses occurring after November 2008. Despite a slight increase in employment from October to November 2009, the number of jobs on employer payrolls decreased the following month. Both private and public employers have since seen an increase in aggregate employment, with the number of jobs in July 2010 rising to 130,470,000. The goods-producing sector, including mining, construction, and manufacturing, has been the most affected during the economic downturn, with construction workers experiencing job losses early on. The construction industry saw job losses before the recession began in December 2007. Employment in the service-providing sector peaked in December 2007, with some industries like education and health services adding workers. However, job losses in other service-providing industries outweighed these gains. The financial activities industry also began losing jobs before the economy-wide downturn, reflecting the trend in construction employment due to the impact of the housing market collapse. The financial activities industry, like construction, suffered from the housing market collapse. Despite the belief that the recession ended in 2009, job growth may not immediately rebound. Job numbers fluctuated for months after previous recessions, with sustained growth taking three to five months. In response to recessions, Congress has often created jobs by increasing federal spending to boost demand for goods and services. This has typically been directed towards infrastructure projects. Other methods, such as public service employment and employment tax credits, have been used less frequently for countercyclical job creation. Public works historically focused on heavy and civil construction activities like road and bridge building, but now includes green economic activities. Green jobs are related to industries using renewable resources or producing energy-efficient goods. The discussion focuses on the job-generating impact of infrastructure spending, with a focus on job creation estimates and models used to calculate the number of jobs nationwide and by state in the construction industry and other industries. The section discusses the challenges in estimating the number of jobs created by green economic activities and the caution needed when using these estimates. Interest in job creation arises during economic downturns and when policymakers compare stimulus options or shift expenditures between budget categories. The section discusses challenges in estimating job creation from green economic activities, using an input-output model to analyze interrelationships between industries and distribution of sales. The input-output model analyzes the dollar value of products from different industries and converts output requirements to employment estimates based on productivity. Total employment requirements are determined by the industry producing the final product. The employment requirements table, like an I-O table, shows the number of jobs supported by expenditures in different industries. It is an approximation of direct and indirect employment dependent on economic activity, expressed as jobs per billion dollars spent. The employment requirements table estimates the impact of one billion dollars spent in the construction industry on direct and indirect employment in various sectors. Input-output models freeze technology and productivity, affecting the job-generating potential of economic activities over time. The job-generating potential of economic activities can vary over time due to technological advancements and productivity improvements. Estimates of job creation are often based on expenditures, but the purchasing power of a billion dollars can change with fluctuating price levels. Differences between estimated and actual job creation can occur because input-output models assume unlimited resources. The job-generating potential of economic activities can vary over time due to technological advancements and productivity improvements. Estimates of job creation based on expenditures may fall short due to capital and labor constraints, especially during economic downturns. Input-output tables may overstate domestic employment impact if inputs are imported and do not differentiate between full-time and part-time jobs. Estimates of job creation based on economic activities may vary depending on the industries involved. A comprehensive estimate includes direct, indirect, and induced jobs. Induced jobs are dependent on the purchases of workers in direct and indirect jobs. The multiplier effect of job creation depends on how much additional money workers spend versus save, with estimates varying widely due to economic conditions. The Federal Highway Administration's estimate of the employment impact of federal spending on roads is widely used, with the latest update indicating that $1.25 billion expenditure supported a significant number of jobs. The FHWA's latest update shows that $1.25 billion in highway construction expenditure, with $1 billion from the federal government and $250 million from state government, could support 34,779 jobs. Without a state match, $1 billion in federal funds supports 27,800 jobs. The number of jobs has decreased over time due to increases in input prices like asphalt and diesel fuel. The estimate breaks down to 9,536 construction-oriented jobs per billion dollars of federal spending on highways. The FHWA's latest update shows that $1.25 billion in highway construction expenditure could support 34,779 jobs, with $1 billion from the federal government and $250 million from state government. This includes 16,493 direct jobs, 4,324 jobs in supporting industries, and 13,962 induced jobs. Induced jobs account for half of the total estimate. The FHWA mentions that job estimates for construction projects utilize national average mix of materials and labor inputs, but local factors can alter the number of jobs supported. Employment figures have been used to justify highway spending in economic stimulus packages, although highway funds typically spend out slowly. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides employment requirements tables for assessing the impact of policies on employment. These tables are based on official I-O tables developed by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis every five years. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics uses the latest national I-O table from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, updated to reflect 2006 technologies and labor productivity, to create an employment requirements table for the construction industry. The construction industry is divided into three major subdivisions: construction of buildings, heavy and civil engineering construction, and specialty trade contractors. Around 11,768 jobs are dependent on $1 billion of construction spending. The construction industry creates 11,768 jobs for every $1 billion spent on construction. The discrepancy in job figures between different sources may be due to various factors like industry definitions and data sources. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) used to conduct surveys on employment in construction activities like building new schools, hospitals, roads, and maintenance. The BEA provides estimates of employment, earnings, and output based on additional spending in various industries through its Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II). The number of jobs directly and indirectly supported by a $1 billion expenditure in the construction industry varies widely by state due to differences in industry mix and earnings. This disparity is influenced by each state's capacity to supply intermediate goods for construction projects. Estimating jobs dependent on green infrastructure activities is challenging due to the lack of separate identification in the NAICS system for green industries. The system currently disaggregates the electric utility industry into different sources of energy production. The NAICS system lacks separate identification for green industries, making it challenging to estimate jobs dependent on green infrastructure activities. Renewable sources like wind, solar, and biomass are grouped under the \"other\" category, posing difficulties in estimating job numbers for these green activities. Retrofitting in the construction industry also lacks a unique category, further complicating job estimations for activities like installing energy-efficient systems. Retrofitting for energy efficiency in buildings requires a different mix of inputs compared to new construction, posing challenges for estimating job creation in green industries. The difficulty is often overlooked in analyses of green job creation, but one study commissioned by the Center for American Progress addresses this issue by explaining the limitations of current input-output tables in recognizing renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and biomass. The limitations of current input-output tables in recognizing renewable energy sources like wind, solar, biomass, building retrofitting, and new mass transit as industries are addressed by creating synthetic industries by combining parts of industries for which data are available. Studies often develop employment projections based on differing sets of data. Employment projections are often based on different assumptions and time horizons, such as the shift from coal to wind and geothermal power generation. Some reports include induced employment, but this is not always clear. Results from analyses specific to a state may not be applicable to other areas due to different industry mixes and input availability for green outputs. Many green economy studies lack clear methodologies for job creation estimates, making it challenging to review the results. Some reports were not originally intended to quickly increase jobs during a recession. Job creation estimates from organizations proposing green economy strategies to stimulate the labor market are briefly described. The September 2008 report, Green Recovery: A Program to Create Jobs and Start Building a Low-Carbon Economy, commissioned by the Center for American Progress, outlines strategies to stimulate the labor market. The report, an acceleration of a 10-year program from a 2007 report, estimates that almost 2 million jobs could be created through green economy initiatives. A two-year $100 billion \"green economic recovery program\" could create or preserve over 1.5 million jobs. Federal spending of $46 billion would go towards public building retrofits, mass transit expansion, and smart electrical grid development, with the rest in the form of tax credits for building retrofits. Some green activities can deliver results within a year, while others may take longer. The Apollo Economic Recovery Act proposed by the Apollo Alliance in December 2008 aims to create 5 million green-collar jobs over 10 years through a $500 billion program. The initiative calls for $50 billion in federal spending to create or maintain over 650,000 direct jobs and 1.3 million indirect jobs. Job creation figures are based on estimated spending-to-jobs relationships. The proposed allocation of federal funds includes $10 billion for improving the electric transmission grid (131,000 jobs), $8 billion for repairing roads and bridges (278,000 jobs), and $8 billion for replacing aging buses and trains with clean-energy vehicles (37,600 direct jobs in manufacturing and 167,000 indirect jobs). Congress was concerned about tracking the number of jobs created or maintained during the crafting of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The 111th Congress addressed timely tracking of job creation in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Recipients of ARRA funds were required to report estimates of direct jobs created and retained by infrastructure projects in their quarterly reports to federal agencies. Recipients of ARRA funds had to submit required information in October 2009. Federal agencies must post reports on websites 30 days after each quarter. OMB provided guidance for report preparation, including job estimates. CBO and GAO were tasked with reviewing job estimates within 45 days. 633,342 jobs were saved based on recipient self-reporting. OMB revised its guidance on jobs saved so that recipients no longer have to make a subjective judgment on whether a given job would have existed were it not for the Recovery Act. The updated guidance defines jobs created or retained as those funded by the Recovery Act. Recipients reported 608,311 jobs funded in Q4 2009 and 682,370 jobs created or saved in Q1 2010. The Council of Economic Advisers submits quarterly reports on the impact of ARRA provisions on employment and economic indicators. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) issues quarterly reports on the impact of ARRA provisions on employment and economic indicators. The first report in September 2009 estimated that ARRA may have added around one million jobs to employer payrolls in August 2009. The CBO was tasked with commenting on the number of jobs created or saved due to direct government purchases, grants, and loans. The CBO estimated that ARRA's tax cuts and outlay increases through September 2009 increased employment by 600,000 to 1.6 million. The CEA estimated that the stimulus law might have raised year-end employment by about 1.7\u20131.9 million jobs above what it otherwise would have been, while CBO estimated an increase of 1.0\u20132.1 million people employed due to ARRA's policies. The CEA's quarterly reports estimated that the ARRA law increased employment by 2.2\u20132.8 million jobs in the first quarter of 2010. The CBO also reported an increase of 1.2\u20132.8 million employed individuals. The fourth quarterly report suggested that ARRA may have raised employment by 2.5\u20133.6 million in the second quarter of 2010. The CEA estimated that public investment outlays under ARRA could have increased total employment by over 627,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2010 and by over 800,000 jobs in the second quarter of the year."}

{"title": "HkGv2NMTjQ", "content": "State of the art sound event classification uses neural networks to learn associations between class labels and audio recordings in a dataset. Ontologies define a structure that relates sound classes with more abstract super classes, serving as a source of domain knowledge representation. However, ontology information is rarely considered in modeling neural network architectures. We propose two ontology-based neural network architectures for sound event classification, demonstrating improved performance by incorporating ontological information. Humans can identify various sounds in their environment, which can be categorized into more abstract classes represented by ontologies. Ontologies, such as BID0, are used for sound event classification but are not fully utilized. Neural networks are the state of the art for SEC but often do not consider ontologies. Ontologies provide structure to training data and network architecture through categories and relationships. Abstraction hierarchies are common in ontologies, where a super category represents subcategories. Hierarchies in sound event classifiers are defined by linguistics, with super categories representing subcategories. Taxonomies can be based on nouns or verbs, such as animal containing dog and cat. Examples of datasets include ESC-50, UrbanSounds, DCASE, and AudioSet. Hierarchical relations offer multiple benefits in sound event classification. Hierarchical relations in sound event classifiers offer benefits such as allowing back-off to general categories, disambiguating acoustically similar classes, penalizing classification differently, and serving as domain knowledge for neural networks. Ontology-based network architectures have shown performance improvement in sound event classification. Authors in BID16 proposed an ontology-based deep restricted Boltzmann machine for textual topic classification, replicating a tree-like structure with intermediate layers. They demonstrated improved performance and reduced overfitting in training data. Another approach in BID17 used a perceptron for each node in the hierarchy, showing enhanced performance through class disambiguation. Our proposed ontology-based networks aim to handle ontological information using deep learning architectures. We introduce a Feed-forward model with constraints to maintain consistency with the ontological structure, including an ontological layer. The framework extends the learning model to compute ontology-based embeddings using Siamese Neural Networks, considering ontologies with two levels. Training data consists of audio representations associated with labels from the ontology. The framework can be generalized to more levels. The ontology in the framework assigns labels to classes at different levels, with each class in a higher level mapped to one in the next level. For example, C1 includes {cat, dog, breathing, eating, sneezing, violin, drums, piano, beep, boing, train, siren} and C2 includes {nature, human, music, effects, urban}. Each element in C1 is related to one in C2, such as cat to nature or drums to music. The framework assigns labels to classes at different levels, with each class in a higher level mapped to one in the next level. If we know the label in C1, we can infer its label in C2 using a probabilistic formulation. This allows us to estimate p(y2 |x) by computing p(y1 |x) and summing the values corresponding to the children of y2. The text discusses using knowledge to improve model performance by relating different classes at training time. It introduces an ontological layer in the architecture design for ontology-based neural network frameworks. The Feed-forward Network (FFN) with Ontological Layer utilizes a base network to generate two outputs for different ontology levels. The base network learns weights for audio features and produces a vector z, which is used to predict probabilities for classes C1 and C2. The FFN can predict any class in C1 and C2 once trained. The FFN with Ontological Layer can predict classes in C1 and C2 using the ontological layer M, which defines weights for a standard layer connection. The weights are not trainable but are part of the training data. The FFN with Ontological Layer predicts classes in C1 and C2 using weights from the ontological layer M. The weights are not trainable but are part of the training data. To train the model, a gradient-based method minimizes the loss function L, a convex combination of two categorical cross-entropy functions. The hyperparameter \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] tunes the combination, with \u03bb = 1 reducing the problem to training a standard classifier using only first-level ontology information. The goal is to create embeddings that preserve the ontological structure. The Siamese neural network (SNN) architecture with the Feed-forward Network with Ontological Layer aims to create embeddings that preserve the ontological structure by enforcing samples of the same class to be closer while separating samples of different classes. The twin networks have the same base architecture with shared embeddings. The Siamese neural network architecture aims to create embeddings that preserve the ontological structure by enforcing samples of the same class to be closer while separating samples of different classes. The twin networks have the same base architecture with shared weights, learned simultaneously. The ontological embeddings are used to compute a Similarity metric, where the distance between embeddings indicates the difference between samples with respect to the ontology. The output probabilities for both levels are also calculated. The text discusses training a Feed-forward Model with Ontological layer using Ontology-based embeddings for sound event classification. It evaluates the performance of ontological-based neural network architectures on datasets with different levels of hierarchy. The dataset, MSoS, is designed for classifying sounds. Challenge 2 - MSoS dataset designed for classifying sounds with two levels of ontology. Development dataset has 1500 audio files divided into 5 categories, evaluation dataset has 500 files. All files are single-channel 44.1 kHz, 16-bit .wav files. The dataset for the Urban Sounds -US8K challenge consists of 500 files divided into 5 classes. The files are 5 seconds long, with periods of silence, and are in single-channel 44.1 kHz, 16-bit .wav format. The taxonomy was adjusted to avoid redundant levels, resulting in a two-level ontology. The dataset for the Urban Sounds -US8K challenge consists of 500 files divided into 5 classes, with files in single-channel 44.1 kHz, 16-bit .wav format. The resulting ontology has two levels, with 10 classes at level 1 and 4 classes at level 2. The dataset contains 8,732 audio files divided into 10 subsets, with 9 folds used for training and tuning parameters and one fold for testing. State-of-the-art Walnet features BID1 were used to represent audio recordings, with a 128-dimensional logmel-spectrogram vector computed for each audio and transformed via a CNN trained on a balanced set of AudioSet. The architecture of the base network (Net) used in the experiment is a feed-forward multi-layer perceptron network with 4 layers: input layer (1024 dimensions), 2 dense layers (512 and 256 dimensions), and output layer (128 dimensions). The dense layers employ Batch Normalization, a dropout rate of 0.5, and ReLU activation function. Parameters in the Net box and those transforming vector z into p(y 1 |x) were tuned. The baseline models for different data sets did not include ontological information, consisting of the Base Network Architecture with an added output layer for level 1 or level 2. For level 1, this is similar to training the Feed-forward model with Ontological Layer using \u03bb = 1, while for level 2, the baseline model differs from the Feed-forward model with \u03bb = 0 as it lacks a layer for predicting y 1. The baseline model lacks a layer for predicting y 1 in level 1. Table 1 displays baseline model results for MSoS and US8K data sets in level 1 and level 2. The baseline performance for MSoS level 2 was 0.81. Training models with different values of \u03bb showed improved performance. The ontological layer affected classification in both data sets. Using the ontological layer improved classification performance in both MSoS and US8K datasets. For MSoS, the best accuracy was achieved with \u03bb = 0.8, resulting in a 5.4% and 6% improvement in levels 1 and 2 respectively. In comparison, for US8K, the best accuracy was with \u03bb = 0.7, leading to a smaller improvement of 2.5% and 0.2% in levels 1 and 2. The ontology-based embeddings improved classification performance in sound event classification. Tighter and better defined clusters were observed in t-SNE plots at different levels. The architecture described in Section 2.3 was tested to evaluate the performance of the embeddings. The embeddings produced by training the Siamese neural network were passed to the base network architecture (Net) for further processing. The SNN was trained for 50 epochs using the Adam algorithm and hyper-parameters were tuned for optimal performance. Testing different numbers of input pairs showed that 100,000 pairs yielded the best results. The Siamese neural network was trained with 100,000 pairs yielding the best performance. The loss function used values from previous experiments, with lambdas of 0.8 for level 2 classifiers, 0.2 for level 1 classifiers, and 0.2 for the similarity metric. Results showed accuracy performance for MSoS and US8K, with conclusions that the architecture outperformed the baseline but slightly underperformed without embeddings. The ontology-based embeddings showed better grouping in t-SNE plots for level 2 classes compared to FF + Ontology vectors. However, performance on the US8K dataset was limited due to similar numbers of sub classes and super classes. In the Making Sense of Sounds Challenge, a Feed-forward Network with Ontological Layer achieved 0.88 accuracy, while using ontological embeddings achieved 0.89, both outperforming the baseline of 0.80 accuracy for level 2. This paper proposes a framework for designing neural networks for sound event classification using hierarchical ontologies. This paper presents methods for incorporating hierarchical ontologies into deep learning models for sound event classification. Two approaches were introduced: a Feed-forward Network with an ontological layer to connect predictions across hierarchy levels, and a Siamese neural Network for ontology-based embeddings. Results from datasets and challenges showed improvements over baselines, indicating potential for further exploration of ontologies in sound event classification. The paper introduces methods for integrating hierarchical ontologies into deep learning models for sound event classification, showing improvements over baselines. Further exploration of ontologies is crucial due to the wide acoustic diversity and limited lexical terms for describing sounds."}

{"title": "rJxlc0EtDr", "content": "Recent research on neural network architectures with external memory has focused on the bAbI question and answering dataset, which presents challenging tasks requiring reasoning. A classic associative inference task from human neuroscience literature was used to assess the reasoning capacity of memory-augmented architectures. Current architectures struggle with reasoning over long distance associations, indicating limitations in their ability to appreciate distant relationships among elements distributed across multiple facts or memories. MEMO, a novel architecture, was developed to reason over longer distances by introducing a separation between memories and items in external memory, and using an adaptive retrieval mechanism. It can solve novel reasoning tasks and all 20 tasks in bAbI. The MEMO architecture can solve novel reasoning tasks and all 20 tasks in bAbI by connecting facts acquired across experiences at different points in time to infer unobserved relationships. Inferential reasoning, supported by the hippocampus, involves storing memories independently through pattern separation to minimize interference and recall specific events as episodic memories. This conflicts with the hippocampus's role in generalization. The hippocampus plays a role in generalization by integrating separated memories through a recurrent mechanism at the point of retrieval. This allows for multiple pattern separated codes to interact and support inference, which can be applied to enhance inferential reasoning in neural networks. Neural networks with external memory, such as DNC and EMN, have shown impressive abilities in computational tasks. Recent advancements in attention mechanisms and context utilization have enabled traditional neural networks to tackle similar tasks. However, some tasks like bAbI present challenges with repetitive patterns that neural networks can exploit for degenerate solutions. To address this, a new task called Paired was introduced. To overcome limitations in neural networks exploiting repetitive patterns for degenerate solutions, a new task called Paired Associative Inference (PAI) was introduced. Derived from neuroscientific literature, PAI aims to capture inferential reasoning by forcing neural networks to learn abstractions to solve unseen associations. This task is followed by finding the shortest path and bAbi tasks to investigate effective memory representations. MEMO is a new approach that retains all facts in memory and utilizes a linear projection with a recurrent attention mechanism for flexible memory usage. This contrasts with other models that use fixed memory representations based on word embeddings and positional encoding. MEMO is a new approach that allows for flexible weighting of individual elements in memory, supporting inferential reasoning. It addresses the issue of prohibitive computation time in neural networks by adjusting input values for efficient computation. The REMERGE model is inspired by human associative memory and adjusts compute time based on task complexity, unlike hand-tuned input values in neural networks. It recirculates retrieved content as new queries to determine network convergence. The REMERGE model adjusts compute time based on task complexity by implementing a halting policy inspired by adaptive computation time techniques. The network outputs an action indicating whether to continue computing or terminate, learning the termination criteria through reinforcement training. Our approach adjusts compute time based on task complexity using reinforcement learning to minimize the expected number of computation steps. By adding an extra term to the REINFORCE loss, we encourage the network to prefer representations and computation that minimize the overall computation steps. Our contributions include a new task emphasizing reasoning, an investigation into memory representations for inferential reasoning, extensions to memory architectures for improved results, and a REINFORCE loss component for learning optimal task-solving iterations. Empirical results on three tasks show the effectiveness of these contributions. The paper focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of contributions through tasks like paired associative inference, shortest path finding, and bAbI. It introduces End-to-End Memory Networks as a contrast to their work, emphasizing the prediction of answers given knowledge inputs and a query. The paper introduces End-to-End Memory Networks for tasks like paired associative inference, shortest path finding, and bAbI. It involves embedding words and summing vectors using key, value, and query matrices. Positional encoding and vocabulary size are also considered in the process. End-to-End Memory Networks (EMN) involve element-wise multiplication and weight calculations over memory elements to produce outputs. The matrices K and V are formed by memory elements, with weights w_t and linear mappings W_qv and W_a. EMN is trained using cross entropy loss on the final answer. On the other hand, MEMO embeds input matrices differently by deriving a common embedding c_i for each input matrix x_i. MEMO embeds input matrices differently by deriving a common embedding c_i for each input matrix x_i, adapting them to be keys or values without using hand-coded positional embeddings. Multiple heads are used to attend to the memory, allowing c_i to flexibly capture any part of the input sentence. MEMO uses multiple heads to attend to memory, allowing for flexible weighting of input items. This contrasts with hand-coded positional embeddings used in previous models. The attention mechanism in MEMO, as described by Vaswani et al. (2017), utilizes multi-head attention, DropOut, and LayerNorm for improved generalization and learning dynamics. Matrices K(h), V(h), and Qt are used in the attention mechanism, with transformation matrices Wh and Wq for logits and queries. The attention mechanism in MEMO utilizes matrices for transforming logits and queries, with an output MLP producing the answer. It differs from Vaswani et al. (2017) by preserving queries separate from keys and values, leading to linear computational complexity. MEMO utilizes an attention mechanism with linear computational complexity, unlike methods using self-attention which have quadratic complexity. The number of computational steps required to answer a query is learned by collecting information at each step and processing it with gated recurrent units and an MLP to define a binary policy and approximate its value function. The input to this network is the Bhattacharyya distance. The network in MEMO uses Bhattacharyya distance to determine when to stop querying memory, preventing settling into a fixed point. Trained using REINFORCE, it adjusts parameters \u03b8 with n-step look ahead values. The network in MEMO adjusts parameters using n-step look ahead values and a discount factor. The objective is to minimize a term that allows minimizing the expected number of hops in the network. The network in MEMO adjusts parameters using n-step look ahead values and a discount factor to minimize the expected number of hops. When training discrete random variables, using REINFORCE may lead to high variance, but for a binary halting random variable, the variance is bounded by 1/4. The reward structure is defined by the target answer and the prediction from the network. The final layer of M LP R was initialized with bias init to increase the chances of producing a probability of 1. A maximum number of hops, N, was set for the network, with no gradient sharing between the hop network and the main MEMO network. Model hyperparameters are reported in appendix D. The Differential Neural Computer (DNC) is an influential model that operates sequentially on inputs, learning to read and write to a memory store. It has shown capability in solving algorithmic problems but struggles to scale to higher-dimensional domains. An extension incorporating sparsity has improved performance on larger-scale tasks like the bAbI task suite. Several memory-augmented architectures have been developed since the publication of the bAbI task suite models. These include the Dynamic Memory Network, Recurrent Entity Network, Working Memory Network, and RelationNet, each with unique features such as sequential inputs, parallel architecture, working memory buffer, and simultaneous updates across memory locations. The RelationNet enables relational reasoning over memory contents and has shown good performance on tasks like the bAbI task suite. Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) adjusts computational budget based on task complexity by learning a halting probability to modulate processing time. The \"ponder time\" in Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) dynamically adjusts computational steps based on task complexity. Other methods like Adaptive Early Exit Networks and REINFORCE are also used for conditional computation in neural networks. The REINFORCE algorithm has been used to optimize the number of steps in a sequence, reducing the total processed inputs. This technique has also been applied to recurrent neural networks and neural networks with external memory. Our method introduces the idea of using the distance between attention weights at different time steps as a proxy to determine if more information can be retrieved from memory. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) involve iterative message passing to propagate embeddings in a graph for various learning tasks. The process is similar to attention mechanisms and aims to determine if more information can be retrieved from memory. Our work introduces a model that differs from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by performing adaptive computation to modulate the number of message passing steps, without requiring message passing between memories. One contribution of this paper is to introduce a task, derived from neuroscience, to probe the reasoning capacity of neural networks by formalizing a prototypical task called paired associative inference (PAI). This task aims to capture the essence of reasoning by appreciating distant relationships among elements distributed across multiple facts or memories. The PAI task is used to study the role of the hippocampus in generalization. It involves associating two images together and testing the ability to generalize by presenting a new pair of images. The PAI task involves associating two images together and testing generalization ability through direct and indirect queries. Direct queries test episodic memory, while indirect queries require inference across multiple episodes. The network is presented with a cue, image A, and two choices: the match, originally paired with B, or the lure, forming a different triplet A-B-C. The right answer requires linking A and C because they were both paired with B. The study compared MEMO with other memory-augmented architectures like End to End Memory Networks (EMN), DNC, and Universal Transformer (UT). Results are summarized in Table 1, with details in the appendix. The study found that A and C are linked because they were both paired with B, similar to how two people walking the same little girl are likely associated. For more details on the batch creation process, refer to appendix A.1. Table 1 summarizes the results of the MEMO model compared to other baselines on the hardest inference query for each PAI task. MEMO and DNC achieved the highest accuracy on the smaller set (A-B-C), while MEMO was the only architecture successful on longer sequences (length 4 and 5). Further analysis on the length 3 PAI task showed that DNC required 10 pondering steps to solve it. MEMO and DNC achieved the highest accuracy on the length 3 PAI task. DNC required 10 pondering steps to solve it, while MEMO converged to 3 hops. Analysis of MEMO's approach included attention weights on an inference query to associate a CUE with the MATCH and avoid interference from the LURE. In the first hop, MEMO retrieved memories from slot 10 and 25. Slot 10 contained the CUE, ID 611, and item ID 191 forming an A-B association. In the following hop, slot 16 with the B-C association (ID 191 and ID 840) became active. Slot 13 associated with the LURE, ID 943, also received some mass. MEMO assigned probability masses to support correct inference decisions. The activation sequence in MEMO for making decisions was confirmed in the last hop, showing a pattern dependent on the number of hops taken. This suggests a link to knowledge distillation in neural networks. The study on neural networks involved using multiple hops to solve tasks efficiently, with automatic reduction of computation. Ablation experiments on MEMO confirmed the importance of specific memory representations and recurrent attention for successful inference. This conclusion applied to inference queries but not direct queries. The study focused on using multiple hops in neural networks for efficient task-solving, with a comparison of adaptive computation mechanisms. The importance of memory representations and recurrent attention for successful inference was confirmed through ablation experiments on MEMO. Direct queries are not suitable for testing episodic memory. The study compared different neural network models for efficient task-solving using multiple hops. Results showed perfect accuracy in predicting intermediate shortest path nodes on a small graph with 10 nodes. MEMO outperformed EMN and DNC in predicting nodes on more complicated graphs with high connectivity, showing great scalability. Universal Transformer had different performance in predicting the first node. The Universal Transformer showed varied performance in predicting nodes on different parts of the shortest path. MEMO outperformed other models on complex graphs with high connectivity. Test results for MEMO's best hyper-parameters are reported, along with results for EMN, UT, and DNC. Additionally, the study includes training details on the bAbI question answering dataset. In the 10k training regime, MEMO achieved high accuracy on all tasks, outperforming other models with lower error rates. Ablation experiments were conducted to analyze the impact of different architectural components on performance. In an in-depth investigation, the combination of memory representations and recurrent attention, along with the use of layernorm in the mechanism, was crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance on the bAbI task. Test results for the best run on the task are compared with results from DNC and Universal Transformer models. In an in-depth investigation, MEMO, an extension to existing memory architectures, showed state-of-the-art results in inferential reasoning tasks. It successfully solved paired associative inference and graph traversal tasks, as well as matched the performance of current state-of-the-art results on the bAbI dataset. Our analysis supported the hypothesis that flexible weighting of individual elements in memory, combined with a recurrent attention mechanism, achieved state-of-the-art results. The task involved using the ImageNet dataset to create three distinct datasets with embedded images. We created 3 datasets with sequences of varying lengths and a large number of images for training, evaluation, and testing. Each sequence in the dataset was randomly generated without repetition. Batches were built with memory, query, and target entries by selecting N sequences from the pool. The memory content included all possible pairwise associations between items in the sequence. For S = 3, a memory with 32 rows was created by generating all possible queries with 3 images: cue, match, and lure. Cue and match are from the same sequence, while lure is from a different sequence. Two types of queries are 'direct' and 'indirect', where 'direct' queries require no inference. The network is tested with 'direct' and 'indirect' queries, with 'direct' queries testing episodic memory by retrieving an experienced episode, while 'indirect' queries require inference across multiple episodes. The queries are presented as a concatenation of three image embedding vectors, with the cue always in the first position. The positions of the match and lure are randomized to avoid degenerate solutions. The network is tested with 'direct' and 'indirect' queries, with 'direct' queries testing episodic memory by retrieving an experienced episode. The position of the match and lure are randomized to avoid degenerate solutions. The lure image always has the same position in the sequence but is randomly drawn from a different sequence in memory. The task can only be solved by appreciating the correct connection between the images and avoiding interference from other items in memory. Each entry in the batch generates all possible queries that the current memory store could support, with one selected at random. The batch is balanced with half direct queries and half indirect queries. The network is tested with 'direct' and 'indirect' queries to predict the class of matches. Longer sequences provide more 'direct' queries and multiple 'indirect' queries requiring different levels of inference. For example, a sequence like A-B-C-D-E produces trials with varying distances, requiring different levels of inference steps. The network is tested with 'direct' and 'indirect' queries to predict the class of matches, with longer sequences providing more queries. Different models use memory, query, and encoder in specific ways to generate predictions on evaluation sets. The evaluation set at the end of training contains 600 items. Graph generation involves creating graphs by sampling two-dimensional points from a unit square. Each point represents a node, with the K nearest neighbors used as outbound connections. The task is represented by a graph description, a query, and a target in the form of tuples of integers representing connections. The graph description includes tuples of integers representing connections between nodes. Queries and target paths are also represented as tuples of integers, with the target being the sequence of node IDs between the source and destination. During training, a mini-batch of 64 graphs, queries, and target paths are sampled. Queries are in a matrix of size 64 \u00d7 2, targets are of size 64 \u00d7 (L \u2212 1), and graph descriptions are of size 64 \u00d7 M \u00d7 2, where L is the length of the shortest path. In experiments, the graph description size is 64 \u00d7 M \u00d7 2, where M is the maximum number of nodes multiplied by the out-degree. Networks were trained for 2e4 epochs with 100 batch updates. For EMN and MEMO, the graph description is the memory contents, and the query is used as input. The model predicts the sequence of nodes for each answer independently. The model predicts answers for nodes sequentially, with differences in query handling between MEMO and EMN. MEMO uses predicted answers as queries, while EMN uses ground truth. Weights for each answer are not shared. Universal Transformer embeds query and graph description similar to EMN. The Universal Transformer and DNC models embed query and graph description similarly to EMN and MEMO. The weights for each answer are not shared. DNC presents graph description tuples first, followed by the query tuple. The Universal Transformer and DNC models present graph description tuples first, followed by the query tuple. Pondering steps are used to output the proposed shortest path sequence. Models are trained using Adam with cross-entropy loss. Evaluation includes sampling a batch of 600 graph descriptions, queries, and targets to calculate mean accuracy over all nodes of the target path. Average values and standard deviation are reported over the best 5 hyperparameters used. The Universal Transformer and DNC models have a 'global view' on the problem, allowing them to reason and work backwards from the end node to achieve better performance. In contrast, MEMO has a 'local view' where the answer to the second node depends on the answer to the first node, making it unable to perform better than chance if the first node's answer is incorrect. In an experiment comparing MEMO and EMN models, MEMO's performance improves when given the ground truth for node 1 as the query for node 2, compared to using the prediction for node 1. This highlights the difference in performance between the two models. When using the same training regime for EMN as MEMO, EMN performs almost at chance level. Results are confirmed in a simpler scenario with 20 nodes and 3 outbound edges using the English Question Answer dataset. Pre-processing includes converting text to lowercase and ignoring punctuation. Comma-separated answers are not ignored. The text explains that in the dataset, each answer has its own label, and every input corresponds to a single answer. Questions are separated from the text and used as queries during training. A mini-batch of 128 queries and corresponding stories are sampled, resulting in matrices of specific sizes. In the dataset, each answer has a label, and inputs correspond to answers. Questions are separated from the text and used as queries during training. A mini-batch of 128 queries and stories are sampled, with specific sizes for matrices. The batch size is 128, max stories is 320, and max sentence size is 11. Padding with zeros is done for queries and stories that don't reach max size. Different models like EMN, MEMO, DNC, and UT handle stories and queries in various ways for final predictions. For training, a mini-batch of 128 queries and stories is sampled with specific matrix sizes. The models use Adam optimization with hyperparameters detailed in the appendix. A time encoding column vector is added to the memory store to account for temporal context. Networks are trained for 2e4 epochs with 100 batch updates each. Evaluation involves sampling a batch of 10,000 elements and computing the forward pass. During training, a mini-batch of 128 queries and stories is used with specific matrix sizes.

The models are trained with polynomial learning rate decay and cross entropy loss for different tasks. MEMO utilizes a halting policy network updated with RMSProp. Its temporal complexity is O(n s \u00b7 A \u00b7 N \u00b7 H \u00b7 I \u00b7 S \u00b7 d), where parameters like the number of samples, answers, hops, heads, stories, and words are considered. This complexity arises from the hopping procedure for each answer in every sample. MEMO utilizes a halting policy network updated with RMSProp.

The hopping procedure queries memory by interacting with all slots for all sizes. The spatial complexity of MEMO is O(I \u00b7 S \u00b7 d), which is the size of the memory. In all experiments, the size of memory is fixed. ACT is implemented based on Graves (2016). The halting unit h is defined using a binary policy \u03c0 t in MEMO. This differs slightly from the original ACT, with trainable weights and biases W h and b h, and previous state s t. The change aims to enhance fairness in comparison.

The halting probability is defined based on a fixed threshold, with the answer provided by MEMO+ACT determined by previous answers. The architecture follows Graves et al.

The FY2011 DOD appropriations bill included reductions to the President's request, with cuts made to major weapons programs, including $1.7 billion from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, $473 million from a new ground combat vehicle for the Army, and $325 million from a new mid-air refueling tanker for the Air Force. H.R. 1473 partially offset these cuts by adding funds to the request, including $495.0 million for Navy strike fighters, $1.38 billion for National Guard and reserve equipment, and $661.7 million for medical research. The FY2011 DOD appropriations bill included reductions to the President's request, with cuts made to major weapons programs. The bill added funds for Navy strike fighters, National Guard and reserve equipment, medical research, Israeli missile defense systems, and the Military Career Advancement Account program. The bill did not allocate funds for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported a bill authorizing $725.7 billion for defense-related activities, $240.7 million less than the Administration's request. The bill was not acted upon due to opposition to repealing the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. On December 9, 2010, the Senate rejected a motion to invoke cloture on the bill, with a vote of 57-40 in favor. A compromise version of the authorization bill (H.R. 6523) was negotiated by House and Senate Armed Services Committees, removing the \"don't ask, don't tell\" provision. The bill was signed by the President on January 7, 2011 (P.L. 111-383), supporting President Obama's budget request. The enacted H.R. 6523 supported President Obama's position by not adding funds to continue production of the C-17 cargo plane. It authorized a 1.9% increase in military personnel pay and $485 million for an alternate jet engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, contrary to the President's requests. The FY2011 bill, H.R. 6523, authorized a 1.4% basic pay raise and $485 million for the alternate engine for the F-35. The President's FY2011 budget request included $738.7 billion for national defense, with $733.3 billion in discretionary spending. The FY2011 budget for national defense included $733.3 billion in discretionary spending, with $5.3 billion in mandatory spending for military retirees. Additionally, $159.3 billion was allocated for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Administration requested $33 billion in supplemental DOD appropriations for FY2010 war costs to cover the deployment of additional troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total DOD request for FY2011 to $708.3 billion. This would increase the total number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan to 98,000 in FY2011. The Administration requested $159.3 billion for FY2011 war costs, lower than FY2010. The budget shifted focus from Iraq to Afghanistan. An additional $655 million was allocated for humanitarian relief in Haiti after the earthquake. The DOD relief effort after the Haiti earthquake in 2010 included deploying Navy ships, cargo flights, and military personnel. The budget request for FY2011 included a 3.4% increase for the DOD base budget and real growth in spending for other security agencies like the Department of State. The Administration requested $719.2 billion for discretionary programs of security agencies, a 5.2% increase from FY2010. For non-security agencies, the request was $386.4 billion, a 1.5% decrease from FY2010. The $548.9 billion requested for the FY2011 DOD base budget is $18.2 billion higher than the previous year. The $548.9 billion requested for the FY2011 DOD base budget is $18.2 billion higher than the previous year, representing a 3.4% increase. Adjusted for inflation, this would be DOD's third largest budget since the end of the Korean War. In FY2011, the DOD base budget saw a 3.4% increase to $548.9 billion, the third largest budget since the Korean War. However, annual increases projected for FY2012-FY2015 fall short of the 2% real growth rate needed for planned investments, prompting Secretary Gates to propose reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually. Secretary Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to sustain current forces amidst budget constraints. He acknowledged the need for 2-3% real growth in the defense budget, but deemed it unlikely. Gates suggested reallocating funds to support combat forces while cutting spending in other areas to offset costs. Secretary Gates proposed increasing spending on combat forces by reducing costs in administrative and support activities, aiming to convert \"tail\" to \"tooth\" for real growth within the budget. Secretary Gates proposed shifting about $10 billion from support functions to combat units to achieve a 3% real increase in the \"tooth\"-related part of the FY2012 DOD budget request. This would require sustained root-and-branch changes to reduce the cost of DOD's headquarters and support bureaucracies. Secretary Gates proposed initiatives to reduce the cost of DOD's headquarters and support bureaucracies, including a 10% reduction in funding for service support contractors, reducing the number of generals and admirals by 50, and eliminating certain departments. Additionally, on September 14, 2010, he announced 23 more initiatives to increase efficiency in contracting for goods and services. Secretary Gates proposed initiatives to reduce the cost of DOD's contracts for goods and services, which make up a significant portion of the department's annual spending. These initiatives include requiring affordability targets for weapons programs, rewarding contractors for efficiency, and changing contracting rules to lower service contract costs. Members of Congress have raised concerns about these changes. Some Members of Congress are concerned about the Administration's projected budget increases for the Department of Defense, stating that the planned budgets may force DOD to scale back acquisition programs. Representative Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon highlighted that a one percent real growth in the defense budget over the next five years would result in a net cut for investment and procurement accounts. Some Members object to exempting DOD from the budget freeze on discretionary spending, calling for reductions in unnecessary weapons programs and overseas military deployments. President Obama's exemption of the military budget from deficit reduction efforts may lead to cuts in other federal programs. The FY2011 DOD base budget request amounts to 3.6% of the GDP, marking a leveling off of the DOD share of GDP since 9/11. The FY2011 budget sustains initiatives from the previous budget with fewer changes to major weapons programs. The FY2011 budget request reflects the strategy and force planning assumptions from DOD's Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). The QDRs since 1997 show a shift in DOD strategic thinking towards focusing on the need for... The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for U.S. forces to be prepared for various missions, with a focus on ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. The DOD's top priority is supporting forces engaged in current operations, including counterinsurgency and counter-terrorism efforts. The 2010 QDR recommends increased funding for acquiring helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft. It also suggests converting one heavy Army brigade combat team into a Stryker brigade, with potential for more conversions in the future. The 2010 QDR emphasizes that potential adversaries will likely challenge U.S. forces asymmetrically, using unconventional tactics and technologies. This challenges the idea of a conflict spectrum from unsophisticated insurgents to sophisticated foes. The 2010 QDR highlights the evolving nature of conflict, with low-end terrorist groups using advanced technologies and near-peer competitors employing indirect means like cyber-warfare. It emphasizes the military's need to operate effectively in cyberspace and strengthen its capabilities to defend cyber-networks. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for the military to strengthen its capabilities in cyberspace, including developing a comprehensive approach, increasing cyber expertise, centralizing command, and collaborating with other agencies for enhanced cyber security. It also maintains the policy of being able to win two major regional wars simultaneously while prioritizing flexibility and effectiveness in response to various conflicts. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of preparing U.S. forces to handle multiple missions of different types around the globe, including stabilizing another country, deterring aggressors, counter-insurgency missions, and supporting civil authorities after disasters or attacks. China and other potential adversaries are developing an \"anti-access, area-denial\" capability that could target U.S. forward bases and naval forces, threatening the U.S. ability to project power in regions far from home. This power projection is crucial for U.S. alliances and stability efforts in Europe, Asia, and other regions, but it comes at a high cost. The cost of power projection capabilities is a reason for the high U.S. defense spending, making U.S. forces vulnerable to various attacks such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and other advanced technologies. The QDR recommends countering anti-access strategies with long-range strike weapons, submarines, and offensive electronic attack capabilities. Missile defense is also highlighted as a major and expensive focus. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components, reflecting a 4.7% increase over FY2000 end-strength levels. This increase follows a reduction in active-duty manpower that began in FY1987 and accelerated during the 1990s. During the 1990s, active-duty end-strength was reduced by about one-third across all services after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Army and Marine Corps end-strength rebounded to 562,400 and 202,100, respectively, due to combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Congress authorized a temporary increase in the Army's active duty strength to 569,400 in 2010. The FY2011 budget included a $1 billion increase for military personnel's basic pay and a 4.2% increase in Basic Allowance for Housing. Congress has typically approved raises in military basic pay higher than the average private-sector increase. The FY2011 budget included a $1 billion increase for military personnel's basic pay, with a 4.2% increase in Basic Allowance for Housing. DOD officials argue that service members are already better paid than 70% of private sector workers, proposing a 0.5% higher raise than the ECI increase. Military advocacy groups push for the higher increase to close the pay gap between military personnel and civilians. The FY2011 DOD funding bills provided a platform for legislative initiatives regarding President Obama's decision to revise a 1993 law and DOD regulations on openly homosexual individuals in the military. Some Members of Congress argue that openly homosexual personnel in combat units could undermine cohesion and combat effectiveness. Critics oppose changing the current policy. Some legislators call for repealing the 1993 law on openly homosexual individuals in the military, with bills introduced in Congress for nondiscrimination based on sexual orientation. President Obama also supports repealing the law and adopting a policy of nondiscrimination. The DOD launched a study on implementing a policy of nondiscrimination against individuals with a same-sex orientation. Secretary Gates opposed repealing the 1993 law until the study is completed. Changes were made to enforcement procedures, requiring only high-ranking officers to initiate investigations and separating individuals based on homosexual conduct. Senators Levin and Lieberman wrote a letter to President Obama regarding the issue. In a letter to President Obama, Senators proposed an amendment to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service, pending completion of the DOD review and certification from key officials. The Administration supports the draft amendment to repeal the ban on openly homosexual persons from military service, despite the ongoing DOD review. The DOD review should be completed before any legislation to repeal the 'don't ask, don't tell' law. Federal Judge Virginia A. Phillips ruled the law unconstitutional on September 9, 2010. The Ninth Circuit temporarily stayed the injunction on October 19, 2010. Under Secretary of Defense Clifford Stanley issued a memorandum on October 21, 2010. The Secretary of Defense for Personnel, Clifford Stanley, issued a memorandum limiting the authority to discharge service members for homosexual behavior to only five senior DOD officials. The FY2011 budget request included $50.7 billion for the DOD health care system, which has seen its costs more than double in the past 10 years. The system serves 9.5 million eligible beneficiaries through various medical facilities and clinics, with costs projected to increase annually at a rate of 5-7% through FY2015. The DOD health care costs are projected to increase annually at a rate of 5-7% through FY2015, reaching 10% of the planned DOD budget. Factors contributing to the rise include more retirees using TRICARE, increased frequency of beneficiaries using DOD medical services, legislatively mandated benefit increases, and stagnant fees since 1995. The Bush and Obama Administrations proposed fee increases for TRICARE beneficiaries, but Congress passed legislation to prohibit them. Secretary Gates expressed a desire to work with Congress to control TRICARE costs. The Congress aims to control TRICARE costs by finding a balance between cost increases and program expenses. The FY2011 request included an increase in funding for weapons and equipment procurement, with a slight shift in budget allocation towards procurement and away from research and development. The FY2011 budget saw a decrease in the proportion of funds allocated to R&D from 44% to 40%, mainly due to the transition of major programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter into production. The total budget for the program remained at $11.2 billion, with $2.3 billion for R&D and $9.0 billion for procurement. The Administration proposed minimal cuts to major weapons programs, reiterating two proposed cuts from the previous year that were rejected by Congress. The FY2011 budget request included no funds for additional C-17 cargo jets or an alternate F-35 jet engine, despite Congress adding funding for these programs in 2009. Some Members of Congress have questioned the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, which the Administration requested $3.2 billion for in FY2011. The FY2011 budget request included $3.2 billion for the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, which replaced the Future Combat System (FCS) program. One controversial element is the proposed new Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV). In 2009, efforts to develop 14 manned and unmanned systems tied by a communications network were underway, but the manned ground vehicle component was recommended for cancellation by Secretary of Defense Gates. The Army's Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program replaced the Future Combat System (FCS) program due to concerns about the MGV component not reflecting lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan. The GCV program aims to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017 based on mature technologies and future network capabilities. The Army cancelled the existing competition for the GCV development contract and revised performance specifications. The GCV competition was restarted on November 30, 2010. The Army's Future Combat Systems (FCS) program components are being integrated into the Army's Modernization program for deployment to all 73 Army BCTs by 2025. The effectiveness of these components has not been demonstrated in field exercises. The Navy's FY2011 budget includes funding for nine new battle force ships. The Navy's FY2011 budget includes funding for nine new battle force ships, including two attack submarines, two destroyers, two LCSs, one amphibious assault ship, one MLP ship, and one JHSV. The Navy's shipbuilding plan for FY2011-FY2015 includes 50 new battle force ships, with half being LCSs or JHSVs. The FY2011 30-year shipbuilding plan includes 276 ships, but it does not fully support the 313-ship plan in the long run. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan projects a fleet growth from 284 ships in FY2011 to 315 ships in FY2020, peaking at 320 ships in FY2024, dropping below 313 ships in FY2027, declining to 288 ships in FY2032-FY2033, and then increasing to 301 ships in FY2039-FY2040. The plan estimates that the attack submarine and cruiser-destroyer forces will fall below required levels in later years, requiring an average of $15.9 billion per year in constant FY2010 dollars. A Congressional Budget Office report suggests an average of $19.0 billion per year would be needed for the plan. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan projects fleet growth to 315 ships by FY2020, peaking at 320 ships in FY2024. The plan estimates an average of $15.9 billion per year in constant FY2010 dollars, but a Congressional Budget Office report suggests $19.0 billion per year may be needed. The Navy is working on a class of 12 next-generation ballistic missile submarines, SSBN(X)s, as replacements. The Navy is working on a class of 12 next-generation ballistic missile submarines, SSBN(X)s, to replace the current Ohio-class submarines. The program received significant funding in the Navy's FY2010 and FY2011 budgets, with plans to procure the first SSBN(X) in FY2019. The estimated procurement cost for each SSBN(X) is $6 billion to $7 billion in FY2010 dollars. The Navy's SSBN(X) program, with a procurement cost of $6-7 billion per submarine, could strain the affordability of the Navy's long-term shipbuilding program. Concerns arise that procuring 12 SSBN(X)s from FY2019-FY2033 may lead to reduced procurement rates for other ship classes. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan indicates limitations in procuring other ship types while SSBN(X) is being acquired. Options for reducing the cost and impact of the SSBN(X) program include procuring fewer submarines, reducing the number of missiles carried, designing for smaller missiles, stretching out the procurement schedule, and using split funding. The Navy's budget proposal includes ending procurement of Zumwalt class destroyers, resuming procurement of Arleigh Burke class Aegis destroyers, and terminating the planned CG(X) cruiser program as unaffordable. They plan to procure two DDG-51s in FY2011 and six more in FY2012-FY2015. The Navy's budget proposal includes ending procurement of Zumwalt class destroyers, resuming procurement of Arleigh Burke class Aegis destroyers, and terminating the planned CG(X) cruiser program as unaffordable. Instead of procuring CG(X)s, the Navy plans to build an improved version of the DDG-51, called the Flight III version, starting in FY2016. Flight III DDG-51s will carry a smaller version of the new Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) originally planned for the CG(X). The Navy's proposed FY2011 budget includes $228.4 million for AMDR research and development. The Aegis ballistic missile defense program, carried out by the Missile Defense Agency and the Navy, aims to increase the number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships from 20 to 38 by the end of FY2015. Concerns have been raised about the growing demand for BMD-capable Aegis ships outpacing the planned increase in numbers, especially with the intention to use these ships to defend Europe against potential ballistic missile attacks. The Aegis BMD program aims to increase the number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships. Concerns have been raised about the growing demand for these ships outpacing the planned increase in numbers, which could strain the Navy's ability to provide Aegis ships for non-BMD missions. The program is funded through MDA's budget, with additional funding from the Navy for BMD-related efforts. The proposed FY2011 budget requested $2,161.6 million for the Aegis BMD program and $457.0 million for BMD-related efforts. The Congress had to decide on approving, rejecting, or modifying the Navy's proposal for the Flight III DDG-51 design and funding for the Aegis BMD program in FY2011. The budget also included funding for two Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) designed for shallow water operations with interchangeable weapons modules. The Navy planned to buy two different versions of LCS designed by Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics before selecting one design for the fleet. The Navy accelerated its timetable to choose a single design for all LCSs procured in FY2010 and beyond. The winning contractor would build 10 LCSs over five years at a rate of two ships per year. The Navy planned to buy two different versions of LCS designed by Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics before selecting one design for the fleet. The winning contractor would build 10 LCSs over five years at a rate of two ships per year. Navy officials announced a different acquisition strategy, seeking approval from Congress to buy 10 ships from each competing industry team. The Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps collectively have about 3,500 fighters, but there are concerns about a shortfall in the number of planes due to budget constraints. Air Force officials project a shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024, while Navy officials anticipate a shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. The Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps have around 3,500 fighters, but budget constraints may lead to a shortfall in aircraft numbers. Concerns about the affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft force have been raised in Congress. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is crucial to DOD's modernization plans, with predictions of a budget \"train wreck\" as acquisition plans clash with funding limitations. The F-35 program is key to DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans, with a total of 2,443 JSFs to be acquired at an estimated cost of over $300 billion. The program is the largest weapon procurement effort for DOD, with additional F-35s to be purchased by U.S. allies. The Administration's FY2011 budget requested $11.3 billion for the F-35 program. The F-35 program is a significant part of DOD's aircraft modernization plans, with a total of 2,443 JSFs to be acquired at a cost of over $300 billion. Concerns arise about the affordability of F-35s in the face of constrained DOD resources, as annual production increases, requiring over $10 billion in acquisition funding per year. The F-35 program is crucial for DOD's aircraft modernization plans, with 2,443 JSFs to be acquired at a cost exceeding $300 billion. Concerns about affordability arise due to constrained DOD resources, with annual production requiring over $10 billion in acquisition funding per year. The British government announced a reduction in planned F-35 purchases from 138 to as few as 40, with none of the vertical-takeoff \"B\" model to be bought. The Administration has proposed to terminate the program to develop the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Congress has rejected this proposal for four years, providing approximately $2.5 billion for the alternate engine program. An additional $2.9 billion is estimated to be needed through 2017 to complete the development of the F136 engine. In a letter to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, the GAO stated that the DOD estimate for terminating the F136 alternate engine program should be seen as one point in a range of possible costs. Critics argue that budget pressures, not long-term considerations, drove the termination. They believe engine competition saved money and improved reliability. Supporters of termination point out that single-source engine contracts are common. The termination of the F136 engine program raises concerns about operational risks, impact on the defense industrial base, and efficiency in DOD's acquisition system. Single-source engine contracts are common, but critics argue that competition saves money and improves reliability. The F136 engine program termination raises concerns about efficiency in DOD's acquisition system and cost control in a single-supplier environment. Continuing F136 development could impact the F-35 acquisition program by potentially reducing the number of F-35s acquired. The Administration's proposed FY2011 defense budget includes funding for a new fleet of mid-air refueling tankers. In 2003, the Department of Defense planned to replace its aging fleet of KC-135 tankers with new KC-X mid-air refueling tankers. A competition between Boeing and a team of Northrop Grumman and EADS ensued, with a contract valued at $35 billion. The bidding closed in July 2010 with three offerors submitting bids. The bidding for the KC-X mid-air refueling tankers replacement contract closed in July 2010 with three offerors submitting bids. Boeing was awarded the contract in February 2011. EADS did not challenge the decision. The KC-X acquisition program, involving the tanker contract awarded to Boeing, has been of great interest due to its value, job creation potential, and importance to U.S. military operations. EADS decided not to challenge the decision, and the history of previous attempts to acquire a new tanker is crucial in defining the required capabilities for the KC-X competition. The Obama Administration replaced the Bush Administration's plan for a land-based BMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic with the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA), deploying BMD-capable Aegis ships to defend Europe and the United States against potential ballistic missile attacks from Iran. Similar BMD capabilities could be pursued in other regions like the Middle East and Northeast Asia. The Obama Administration's Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for missile defense includes a $2.27 billion budget request for FY2011, with $712 million for unique development efforts and $1.56 billion for the Aegis ship-borne BMD system. The FY2011 base budget for military construction and family housing is reduced by nearly 20% compared to FY2010. The FY2011 budget includes $2.7 billion for new facilities due to BRAC Commission moves, with military family housing budget decreasing to $1.8 billion. Basic Allowance for Housing has increased over the past decade. The increase in service members not living in government housing is due to more paying rent to private landlords and policy changes in housing allowances. The FY2011 DOD bills addressed opposition to the Navy's plan to move a nuclear aircraft carrier to Mayport, FL. The DOD's final report on the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review supports the Navy's desire to establish Mayport as a second homeport. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) endorses the Navy's plan to establish Mayport, Florida as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port. This move would require the construction of new nuclear support facilities and shift economic activity from Norfolk to Mayport. Certain Members of Congress from Florida and Virginia have differing views on the proposal to homeport an aircraft carrier at Mayport. The Navy estimates the costs to be $589.7 million, including $46.3 million for dredging. Certain Members of Congress from Virginia are skeptical or opposed to the proposal to homeport an aircraft carrier at Mayport, citing questionable benefits for the Navy's Atlantic Fleet CVNs and suggesting that the funding could be better spent on other Navy priorities. The Administration's budget includes $139 million for facilities on Guam for 8,000 Marines relocating from Okinawa, following negotiations between the US, Japan, and DOD. Guam is a mountainous island with a population of about 178,000. The planned influx of military personnel, their families, DOD personnel, and supporting contractors could increase the population by as much as 56,000. Additionally, an estimated 25,000 temporary workers may be needed to build the planned facilities, amounting to 14% of the population. The Administration's budget supported the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) as a component of the U.S. Strategic Command to centralize command of DOD networks and coordinate their protection and operation. The reorganization of cyber forces began in October 2008 under Secretary Gates. The U.S. Cyber Command was established under the U.S. Strategic Command to centralize command of DOD networks and coordinate offensive and defensive cyber operations. This marked a departure from the historical segregation of these capabilities. The U.S. Cyber Command, established under the U.S. Strategic Command, combines offensive and defensive cyber operations. The director of the NSA leads the new command while retaining the NSA directorship. Some argue this militarizes cyberspace and threatens civilian privacy, while others believe it will improve DOD cyber practices and focus on defending DOD networks. The Administration's FY2011 budget request includes funding for Air Force cyber operations. The FY2011 budget request for Air Force Operations and Maintenance includes $139 million for U.S. Cyber Command, an increase of $105 million from the previous year. This funding will support the establishment of Cyber Command at Ft. Meade, MD. The FY2011 DOD budget reflects efforts to \"rebalance\" roles between DOD and the State Department in providing foreign assistance. The FY2011 NDAA legislation does not include two previously funded DOD programs. The FY2011 DOD budget request includes funding for U.S. Cyber Command at Ft. Meade, MD. The budget reflects efforts to \"rebalance\" roles between DOD and the State Department in providing foreign assistance. The State Department will take responsibility for Iraq police training in FY2012. The DOD budget request for FY2011 does not include funding for the Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISSF) used for Iraqi police training. Additionally, two programs previously funded by DOD are now included in the Department of State budget. The FY2011 DOD budget request includes funding for U.S. Cyber Command at Ft. Meade, MD, and reflects efforts to \"rebalance\" roles between DOD and the State Department in providing foreign assistance. The State Department will take responsibility for Iraq police training in FY2012, with funding for the Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISSF) not included in the DOD budget request. Pentagon officials have shown interest in maintaining or expanding DOD's role in security assistance despite the planned transfer of responsibilities to the State Department. The Administration is reviewing security assistance authorities, with the Senate Armed Services Committee welcoming the process. Secretary of Defense Gates highlighted advising foreign security forces as a key military mission. Secretary Gates emphasized the importance of advising and training partner nations' security forces, aligning with recommendations from the Quadrennial Defense Review Report. Admiral Mullen also stressed the need to consider military power as a viable option alongside diplomacy. The Quadrennial Defense Review Report and Secretary Gates highlighted the need to enhance civilian capabilities in assisting foreign governments in conflict prevention and recovery, emphasizing a new relationship between defense and diplomacy. The FY2011 DOD budget request retains control over controversial security assistance programs. The DOD's FY2011 budget includes funding for various security assistance programs, such as the Section 1206 program, Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program, Defense Institution Reform Initiative, and legal instruction for foreign military and government officials. Additionally, a new program is set to launch. The FY2011 budget includes funding for security assistance programs, with a new Stability Operations Fellowship Program proposed. Secretary Gates highlighted the need to update the national security system to align with current threats. Some Members are considering legislation for a pooled fund for security assistance. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act passed by the House authorizes $725.9 billion for defense activities, $2.7 million less than requested by the Administration. The Senate's version reduces this to $725.7 billion and includes a provision to repeal a 1993 law. The Senate rejected a provision to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy in the FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act. The compromise version of the bill dropped this provision and was cleared for the President on December 22, 2010 animal. The \"don't ask; don't tell\" policy was cleared for the President on December 22, 2010, and signed on January 7, 2011. H.R. 6523 authorized lump-sum totals for appropriations in the DOD and Energy Department budgets, but did not include specific funding tables. Highlights of H.R. 5136, S. 3454, and the final version of H.R. 6523 are provided. The final version of the authorization bill, H.R. 6523 (P.L. 111-383), authorized a total end-strength of 1.43 million members for the active-duty components of the armed services, an increase of 7,400 from FY2010. The bill included a 1.4% increase in military basic pay, as requested by the Administration. The House-passed bill proposed a 1.9% raise, which was not included in the final version. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the Government Accountability Office to assess DOD's use of cash incentives for recruiting and retaining highly qualified individuals in essential wartime specialties. The Senate committee directed the GAO to review DOD's process for identifying specialties for incentives and assess the accuracy of housing allowance determinations for service members. The FY2011 defense authorization act did not include a provision to repeal the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military. On May 27, 2011, the House passed an amendment to H.R. 5136 by Rep. Patrick Murphy to repeal the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military, contingent on completion of a DOD review and certification by key officials. The House bill included a provision on effectiveness, unit cohesion, and recruiting and retention of the armed forces. The Senate also voted on a similar provision in S. 3454. Senator John McCain argued against Senate action on the bill, stating it was premature. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on a bill related to the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, with a vote of 56-43. The final version of the bill did not include a provision to repeal a law prohibiting military facilities from performing abortions, allowing DOD to return to a previous policy. The Senate committee provision to repeal the law prohibiting military facilities from performing abortions did not pass. The enacted version of the bill also did not include a provision for a pilot program allowing officers to pursue mid-career educational programs outside of their service. The final version of the bill included provisions from a DOD commission report on sexual assault in the military, establishing the position of director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office. The final version of the bill establishes the position of director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office, requiring improved protocols for medical care of military personnel who are sexual assault victims and ensuring access to victim advocates. It does not include provisions for confidentiality of victims' communications with advocates, legal assistance, or a hotline. The bill, H.R. 6523, requires the Secretary of Defense to evaluate the feasibility of providing legal assistance to sexual assault victims. It authorizes the majority of the Administration's $50.7 billion budget request for DOD's health care program, without including increases in TRICARE fees and pharmacy copayments. The House-passed H.R. 5136, the Senate Armed Services Committee's S. 3454, and the final enacted version of the authorization bill (H.R. 6523) all include provisions prohibiting any increase in TRICARE fees and pharmacy copayments. TRICARE beneficiaries can now extend coverage to their dependent children up to age 26, similar to private health insurance programs under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The enacted reform bill in April 2010 (Section 702) did not include a House provision for a unified medical command. H.R. 6523 included a modified provision for training programs in response to an incident at Fort Hood in November 2009. The final version of the authorization bill in April 2010 did not include provisions related to incidents at Fort Hood and a recruiting station in Little Rock in 2009. The House provision not included would have provided special compensation to victims of these incidents. The final bill did not include provisions for special compensation for victims of incidents at Fort Hood and a recruiting station in 2009. It also did not allocate funds for implementing recommendations from a panel analyzing the Fort Hood incident. The bill supported the Administration's ballistic missile defense. The Senate committee supported the Administration's ballistic missile defense activities, including defense plans for U.S. troops and allies in Europe against Iranian missile attacks. Both bills authorized slightly more than the $10.3 billion requested for missile defense, with H.R. 5136 adding $361.6 million and S. 3454 adding $349.1 million. H.R. 6523 specifically authorized $205 million for Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system to intercept short-range rockets and artillery shells. The bill H.R. 6523 does not allocate specific funding amounts for missile defense programs, except for $205 million for Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system. Funding levels for missile defense programs were presented in Table A-2 of H.R. 5136 and S. 3454. The bill also includes a provision affirming the strategic arms reduction treaty with Russia. H.R. 6523 affirms that the New START treaty with Russia does not restrict U.S. missile defense programs. The Administration requested $2.27 billion in FY2011 for the \"Phased Adaptive Approach\" for defending Europe against ballistic missiles. The final version of the authorization bill requires a DOD report on the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) and places restrictions on the deployment of missile defense systems in Europe until certain conditions are met. The final version of the bill includes restrictions on the deployment of missile defense systems in Europe until certain conditions are met, with provisions for the Secretary of Defense to waive them in the interest of national security. It also authorizes the establishment of a shared ballistic missile early warning system with the Czech Republic. The final version of the authorization bill in May 2010 did not include provisions from H.R. 5136 or S. 3454. It endorsed statements regarding missile defense capabilities against Iranian ICBMs, development of ground-based interceptors, and maintaining strategic stability with Russia. The final version of the authorization bill in May 2010 did not include provisions from H.R. 5136 or S. 3454. It omitted provisions from the House bill that would have restricted the reduction of U.S. nuclear weapons below New START Treaty limits and criticized the Administration's Nuclear Posture Review for weakening U.S. security. The final version of the authorization bill approved $15.7 billion for Navy shipbuilding, including funding for two DDG-51 Aegis destroyers, two Virginia-class attack submarines, two Littoral Combat Ships, and other vessels. The authorization bill approved $15.7 billion for Navy shipbuilding, including funding for a research ship, the U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, an LHA-class helicopter carrier, and the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt carrier refueling. Incremental funding is common for expensive ships, but it is unusual in the congressional appropriations process. H.R. 6523 includes provisions for incremental funding of a helicopter carrier over two years and a report on the impact of using cruisers and destroyers for anti-ballistic missile defense. The final version of the authorization bill did not include provisions to prevent a decline in the size of the fleet, such as blocking the retirement of two large helicopter carriers and limiting the Navy's ship retirements until the fleet reaches a certain size. The Senate committee expressed concerns about the Navy's shipbuilding schedule and its impact on commercial shipyards. They directed assessments on how the Navy's plans would affect the Marine Corps's ability to conduct amphibious landings. Navy and Marine Corps leaders agreed on the importance of a fleet of 313 ships. The Senate committee raised concerns about the Navy's shipbuilding schedule and its impact on commercial shipyards. They questioned the feasibility of the Navy's plan to replace its Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines with a new class of submarines. The Navy and Marine Corps leaders agreed on the importance of having a fleet of 313 ships for conducting amphibious landings. The Navy's goal of 33 amphibious landing ships may be difficult to achieve due to cost increases and construction delays. The new SSBN(X) ships are expected to absorb a large share of the Navy's shipbuilding budgets after 2016, potentially affecting the construction of other planned ships. The final version of the authorization bill approved a lump-sum authorization for Navy R&D without specifying the allocation of the $672.3 million requested for SSBN(X) development in FY2011. The House-passed provision would have limited Navy spending on the C-17 cargo jet until a report is submitted. Congress added funds to continue C-17 production despite objections from the Bush and Obama Administrations. The Administration warned of vetoing any bill funding additional C-17s. The Senate and House Armed Services committees criticized cost overruns in the F-35 Joint Strike program. The Senate and House services committees criticized cost overruns and delays in the F-35 program. The final bill included a Senate provision for DOD to create a progress assessment plan. The House provision to limit F-35 procurement until cost and performance milestones were met was not included. Both bills authorized $11 billion for F-35 development and 42 plane purchases. The House and Senate bills authorized $11 billion for F-35 development and 42 plane purchases. The House-passed bill included an additional $485 million for an alternate jet engine for the F-35, while rejecting a request for one extra F-35 plane. The final bill did not include additional funds for the alternate jet engine for the F-35, as the Senate committee's bill had proposed. Secretary Gates reaffirmed his position on the project during a Pentagon press conference in May 2010. In a May 20, 2010, Pentagon press conference, Secretary Gates reiterated his intention to recommend a veto on any defense bill funding the alternate F-35 engine. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees are concerned about a drop in carrier-borne fighters due to delays in the F-35 program. The House and Senate bills address the strike fighter gap by adding funding for additional F/A-18E/F model fighters. The enacted bill does not specify the number of planes authorized but includes a provision for the Navy to report on dealing with the gap by extending the service life of current F/A-18s or reducing the number of planes in certain squadrons. The House and Senate bills address the strike fighter gap by adding funding for additional F/A-18E/F model fighters. The House adopted an amendment requiring DOD to consider unfair competitive advantages in bids for the KC-X tanker. The House adopted an amendment regarding unfair competitive advantages in bids for the KC-X tanker, based on findings of government subsidies for EADS. Boeing's tanker design was selected by DOD, and EADS decided not to challenge the decision. EADS announced on March 4, 2011, that it would not challenge Boeing's selection for the KC-X tanker. Both H.R. 5136 and S. 3454 would deny authorization for part of the Army's $3.19 billion request for its Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, the successor to the terminated Future Combat Systems program. The authorization bill would also deny the $431.8 billion requested for the Non-Line of Sight missile. The House bill and Senate committee both denied funding for the Non-Line of Sight missile program and the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program. The House bill made deeper cuts to the Army's plan compared to the Senate committee. The final authorization did not specify funding for the BCT program. The House Armed Services Committee recommended a less ambitious approach for the new Ground Combat Vehicles program, urging the Army to focus on developing vehicles that meet basic requirements and can be upgraded later. They also suggested upgrading the current fleet of combat vehicles to meet the GCV requirements. Additionally, a provision in the bill allows the Army to spend only half of the FY2011 GCV appropriation until a detailed analysis of their development plans is provided. The House Armed Services Committee recommended a less ambitious approach for the new Ground Combat Vehicles program, urging the Army to focus on developing vehicles that meet basic requirements and can be upgraded later. DOD reduced its FY2011 GCV funding request to $461 million. The enacted version of the authorization bill fully funds the Administration's adjusted request. The bill did not include a provision to bar funds for planning and designing structures at the Naval Station in Mayport, FL for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The House Armed Services Committee directed the GAO to assess the costs of homeporting a carrier in Mayport, FL. H.R. 6523 authorized $176.0 billion for military construction on Guam, with reductions in funding for Marine Corps units redeployment. The final bill approved funds for improving access roads and wharves in Guam but denied funding for construction of a Marine base and facilities for Marine aviation squadrons. It also did not authorize $70.0 million for replacing Guam's military hospital. Additionally, $50.3 million was approved for Air Force projects related to global repositioning of forces and $19.0 million for a new National Guard Readiness Center. The final version of the bill did not include a House provision for transferring funds to Guam for increased municipal services. H.R. 6523 requires reports on military facilities and civil infrastructure improvements needed for force redeployment. The final version of H.R. 6523 includes provisions for assessing civil infrastructure improvements needed for population increase due to re-stationed combat forces and construction workers. It also prohibits transferring Guantanamo Bay detainees to U.S. territory or foreign governments without specific conditions met. The final version of H.R. 6523 waives restrictions on detainee transfers if ordered by a court or tribunal. It also prohibits using funds to build detainee facilities elsewhere and requires a report on transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay. The Administration's DOD appropriations request for FY2011 for the \"Global Train and Equip\" program was $489.5 million, exceeding the $350 million annual limit set by existing law. The House-passed authorization bill aimed to increase the funding ceiling to $500 million, extend program authorization through FY2012, and allocate $75 million to build counterterrorism forces in Yemen. The House-passed authorization bill aimed to increase the funding ceiling for the \"Global Train and Equip\" program to $500 million and allocate $75 million to build counterterrorism forces in Yemen, contingent on the Secretary of State's certification of effective assistance provision. The House Armed Services Committee recognized Yemen as a \"strategic partner\" in combating Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The Senate committee-reported bill aimed to expand the Section 1206 program to support national military forces and create a separate authority for the Secretary of Defense to provide up to $75 million in assistance to Yemen for combating Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The final version of the authorization bill authorizes an additional $75 million in assistance to the Yemen Ministry of the Interior for counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and its affiliates. This funding does not exceed the $350 million ceiling on Section 1206 funding as requested by the Administration. The Senate committee bill authorizes the Secretary of Defense to use up to $150 million of Army funds for the Task Force for Business and Stability Operations in Afghanistan to link military operations with economic elements to reduce violence and restore economic normalcy through strategic business activities. The final version of H.R. 6523 includes provisions related to cybersecurity, directing the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on cyber warfare policy, develop an acquisition process for cyberspace, and implement continuous monitoring of DOD computer systems. The final version of the authorization bill requires the Secretary of Defense to continuously monitor DOD computer networks for security and FISMA compliance, report annually to Congress on cyber attack damages and assess cyberwar capabilities of the U.S. and potential adversaries to improve cybersecurity. The House and Senate did not agree on a FY2011 budget resolution, leading to committees operating under spending caps adopted through other procedures. The House and Senate did not agree on a FY2011 budget resolution, leading to committees operating under spending caps adopted through other procedures. The House adopted a one-year cap on discretionary spending, with the Defense Subcommittee receiving $523.9 billion, $7 billion less than requested by the Administration. The Senate did not adopt an overall ceiling on FY2011 discretionary spending. The Senate did not adopt an overall ceiling on FY2011 discretionary spending. The Senate Appropriations Committee set a ceiling of $522.8 billion for the Defense Subcommittee, $8.1 billion less than the President's request. The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee approved a bill for $671.0 billion, with a base budget of $513.3 billion, $7.0 billion less than the President's request. The Defense Subcommittee's bill would appropriate $513.3 billion, a reduction of $7.0 billion from the President's request. For war costs, the bill would provide $157.7 billion, a reduction of $253 million from the request. The text of the bill and detailed recommendations were not made public, only a summary table and list of Member earmarks were provided. On September 16, 2010, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a FY2011 DOD Appropriations bill (S. 3800) with a total of $669.9 billion, including $512.2 billion for the base budget and $157.7 billion for war costs. This bill represented a reduction of $8.10 billion to the President's base budget request and a reduction of $254 million to the request for war costs. DOD was funded through mid-April 2011 by short-term continuing resolutions as an appropriations bill had not been enacted by the start of the fiscal year on October 1, 2010. The House passed a bill (H.R. 1) in February 2011 to fund federal agencies through the balance of FY2011 with $505.2 billion in discretionary budget authority for base budget programs. The Senate debated H.R. 1 but laid it aside on March 9, 2011, after failing to close debate. The Senate rejected an alternative funding measure by a vote of 42-58, offered by Senator Inouye, which would have provided $503.1 billion for base budget programs. The President signed an omnibus funding bill for the balance of FY2011 (H.R. 1473; P.L. 112-10) on April 15, 2011, incorporating a detailed DOD appropriations bill with a total of $502.4 billion for the base. The Inouye amendment to H.R. 1 resulted in a reduction of $20.1 billion from the total DOD funding requested by the President for FY2011. H.R. 1473 provided $502.4 billion for the base budget and $677.7 billion for all DOD funding, including military construction and war costs. The bill incorporated $4.4 billion in reductions to the President's request for broad categories of spending. The President's request in H.R. 1473 included cuts to DOD funds, civilian pay, and research and development corporations. The bill also added funds to the request in some instances, partially offsetting the cuts. The defense appropriations bill for FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010 included a total of 2,085 earmarks, with the bill adding funds to the budget request for various programs such as Navy strike fighters, equipment for the National Guard, medical research programs, and Israeli missile defense. The defense appropriations bill for FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010 included funds for Navy strike fighters, National Guard equipment, medical research programs, and Israeli missile defense. Additionally, $523.0 million was allocated for innovative research and procurement projects, but no funds were added for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The bill lacked an explanatory statement, leaving only brief descriptions in the funding tables for insight into the changes made. The House Rules Committee posted funding tables for the defense appropriations bill, which included a 1.4% military pay raise and $162 million for the MyCAA tuition assistance program for military spouses. The Senate committee bill proposed adding $447.0 million to the Defense Health Program. The Defense Health Program (DHP) saw a net increase in funding, with additions totaling $661.7 million for research and development programs focused on breast cancer, psychological health, traumatic brain injury, and prostate cancer. The bill cut $425.0 million from the deployment of Theater High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) missiles and added $205 million to accelerate production of the Israeli Iron Dome system. Planned THAAD production has been delayed pending additional tests. President Obama requested Congress to approve $205 million to accelerate production of the Israeli Iron Dome system, which intercepts short-range rockets and artillery shells. The bill also provided funding for Navy shipbuilding, making minor reductions in requested amounts. For more details on missile defense and shipbuilding funding in H.R. 1473, refer to the Appendix. The bill made significant changes to the budget request, including a $1.38 billion reduction for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and a $325.0 million cut for the development of a mid-air refueling tanker. The bill would fund the purchase of 35 out of 43 requested planes and delayed the decision on the tanker project until March 2011. The bill denied funding for the Non-Line of Sight Missile and cut funding for the Ground Combat Vehicle program. The Army cancelled the competition for the new Bradley armored troop carrier design and revised the performance specifications. The GCV competition was restarted on November 30, 2010."}
{"title": "R41010", "content": "The Supreme Court has held in abeyance the question of whether a demonstration of actual innocence after a state trial would render a defendant's execution unconstitutional. Davis's habeas petition raised these questions, and the District Court found the constitutional right exists but denied habeas relief. The Circuit Court agreed that only the Supreme Court could review this decision. Davis was convicted of murder, obstruction of a police officer, aggravated assault, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. The murder victim was a police officer shot while responding to a disturbance outside a fast food restaurant. The Supreme Court declined to review the lower court opinion, leaving the underlying question for another day. Davis was sentenced to death for the murder of a police officer and subsequent denial of post-conviction relief. He petitioned for habeas relief in federal court, citing newly discovered evidence, false testimony by the prosecutor, failure to disclose exculpatory evidence, and ineffective trial counsel. He also claimed innocence as an exception to the procedural default rule. The district court rejected Davis's constitutional claims, which were affirmed by the court of appeals. Despite petitioning for a new trial based on witness recantations and evidence of another man committing the murder, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the denial of his petition. Davis sought approval from the federal court of appeals to file a second federal habeas petition, claiming innocence in the murder he was convicted of. The majority denied his application, stating he failed to meet the requirements for a second petition. The majority denied Davis's application for a second federal habeas petition, stating it was insufficient and did not meet the requirements. The dissenting member argued for granting the petition in cases of viable claims of actual innocence. The Supreme Court transferred Davis's petition for habeas relief to the District Court for the Southern District of Georgia to determine his actual innocence. The district court may not apply certain portions of the AEDPA to his case. The Supreme Court transferred Davis's petition for habeas relief to the District Court for the Southern District of Georgia to determine his actual innocence. Justice Stevens suggested avenues to relief in response to Justice Scalia's dissent, stating that AEDPA cannot preclude a claim of 'actual innocence.' The Supreme Court transferred Davis's petition for habeas relief to the District Court for the Southern District of Georgia to determine his actual innocence. Justice Scalia assumes the District Court may not grant relief due to 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254(d)(1), but the transfer is not futile. The court may find exceptions to the law or consider Davis's 'actual innocence' claim. The court may find exceptions to the law or consider Davis's 'actual innocence' claim, which could potentially lead to relief for a death row inmate. The jurisdictional bar on second or successive habeas petitions under section 2244(b) does not apply to petitions filed originally with the Supreme Court. The Judiciary Act of 1789 granted the Supreme Court and other federal courts the power to issue writs of habeas corpus. Congress expanded the jurisdiction of federal courts in 1867 to issue the writ in all cases. Congress expanded the jurisdiction of federal courts in 1867 to issue the writ of habeas corpus \"in all cases\" where a person may be restrained of their liberty in violation of the constitution, treaty, or US law. The expansion also clarified the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction over habeas decisions of lower federal courts, excluding military prisoners. The first case under this new authority involved William McCardle, a Mississippi newspaper editor. The new appellate authority involved William McCardle, a Mississippi newspaper editor arrested by military authorities for trial by a military commission under reconstruction laws. His petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied by the federal circuit court, and he appealed to the Supreme Court. The government tried to dismiss the appeal, but the Court denied the motion as the military custody exception only applied to the expansion of habeas under the 1867 Act, while McCardle relied on the pre-existing habeas authority of the Judiciary Act. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal in Ex parte McCardle (1868) after Congress repealed the law granting appellate jurisdiction. However, the Court clarified that it still had the ability to review lower court habeas decisions despite losing jurisdiction to hear appeals in habeas cases. The Supreme Court confirmed its ability to review lower court habeas decisions despite losing jurisdiction over appeals in habeas cases before the 1867 Act. The Supreme Court retained jurisdiction to review habeas cases despite losing appellate jurisdiction under the 1868 Act. This authority was reaffirmed in Ex parte Yerger and later restored by Congress in 1885. In 1885, Congress reopened Supreme Court review in habeas cases after cumbersome appellate procedures. The original writ of habeas corpus was rarely successful and urged for abandonment. The scope of Congress's control over Court's appellate jurisdiction resurfaced in Felker v. Turpin in 1996. Felker argued that 28 U.S.C. 2244(b)(3)(E) limits appellate jurisdiction for second or successive habeas petitions. The Court upheld this limitation, stating that AEDPA does not strip the Court of its authority to entertain habeas petitions. Review can still be sought through the original writ of habeas corpus. The Supreme Court upheld the limitation on appellate jurisdiction for second or successive habeas petitions under 28 U.S.C. 2244(b)(3)(E). AEDPA does not strip the Court of its authority to entertain habeas petitions, allowing review through the original writ of habeas corpus. Felker sought review and reversal of \u00a72241 of Title 28, but the Court refused relief under its original writ authority. The Court did not hold that it was required to follow the act's standards in its original writ determinations, but acknowledged that they inform their consideration of original habeas petitions. The Court denied Felker's request for relief under its original writ authority, citing a lack of exceptional circumstances. Legislative barriers alone do not constitute the necessary exception circumstances for issuance of a writ sought originally from the Court. In Boumediene v. Bush, the Court addressed Congress's authority to bar access to the writ of habeas corpus for detainees at Guantanamo Bay. The case involved foreign nationals detained at the U.S. Naval Station in Cuba, raising questions about habeas rights for individuals seized in a combat zone. The Defense Department had established tribunals to determine detainee status as enemy combatants, but the reach of habeas corpus for Guantanamo detainees was uncertain until the Rasul v. Bush case in 2004. The Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether detainees in Guantanamo were beyond the reach of U.S. courts. Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act and the Military Commissions Act to limit habeas petitions for foreign nationals held in Guantanamo. The Supreme Court ruled that foreign nationals detained in Guantanamo are entitled to habeas corpus protection, and the Military Commissions Act did not suspend the writ. The Supreme Court ruled that the Military Commissions Act did not formally suspend the writ of habeas corpus. It considered whether the statute stripping jurisdiction for the writ provided adequate substitute procedures, finding little precedent to guide this assessment. The case of Felker, which involved a suspension clause challenge, did not offer a close parallel to the federal detention without trial of Boumediene. The Supreme Court identified essential features of habeas corpus and any adequate substitute in the context of Boumediene. It noted that the privilege of habeas corpus entitles the prisoner to a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate errors in the application of relevant law. The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of a meaningful opportunity for habeas review in cases where a person is detained by executive order. The court conducting the habeas proceeding must have the authority to correct errors in prior proceedings and assess the sufficiency of the Government's evidence against the detainee. The Court found the Detainee Treatment Act procedures inadequate for habeas review, stating that the Military Commissions Act's attempt to limit habeas jurisdiction for Guantanamo detainees is unconstitutional. The Court emphasized the importance of admitting relevant exculpatory evidence and ensuring a fair review process. The habeas review allows for a state prisoner to challenge a constitutionally defective conviction or sentence, with an exception for actual innocence based on new evidence. The petitioner must demonstrate that a constitutional violation likely led to the conviction of an innocent person. The habeas review standard for proving actual innocence based on new evidence is less demanding than for challenging a constitutionally defective conviction or sentence. The habeas court can issue the writ if there is insufficient evidence of guilt for a state conviction. In Herrera v. Collins, the petitioner claimed innocence based on new evidence after being convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The Court declared that a truly persuasive demonstration of \"actual innocence\" in a capital case could render the execution unconstitutional, but the disruptive effect on finality and burden on states would be significant. The Court emphasized that proving \"actual innocence\" in a capital case to prevent execution would require an extraordinarily high threshold. The petitioner in this case did not meet this threshold, as confirmed by the Court's decision in House v. Bell. This suggests that the standard for proving innocence is higher than usual. The level of persuasion required for a freestanding innocence claim is higher than for an innocence-plus-constitutional-defect claim. Davis's petition may need to survive inquiries regarding the Constitution's prohibition on executing actually innocent individuals, the availability of original habeas relief, any constraints on such petitions, and potential statutory impediments that could be unconstitutional. The Herrera Court debated whether executing an indisputably innocent person would violate due process. The transfer to district court suggests actual innocence could be grounds for habeas relief. The Court in Felker suggested that actual innocence might provide grounds for habeas relief, despite statutory impediments. Prudential rules developed by the Supreme Court, including those regarding second or successive petitions and deference to state courts, are likely to influence a court's consideration of original habeas petitions. Section 2244(b) of title 28 of the United States Code mandates the dismissal of a claim in a second or successive habeas petition, unless it is based on a new constitutional interpretation by the Supreme Court or newly discovered evidence proving innocence. The section discusses the standard of probability for second or successive habeas petitions, emphasizing the need to show a constitutional violation probably resulted in a wrongful conviction. The Davis District Court has indicated it will not reconsider the applicability of the bars set by section 2244(b) of title 28. In re Davis, 2009 WL 2750976, n.3 (S.D.Ga. Aug. 7, 2009) discusses the applicability of section 2254(d) of title 28 of the United States Code in habeas cases. State court rulings are usually given deference, and habeas relief is precluded unless the state court decision goes against Supreme Court precedent or involves an unreasonable application of the law. Justice Stevens noted that the District Court may find that section 2254(d)(1) does not apply. Justice Stevens suggests that the District Court may find that section 2254(d)(1) does not fully apply to an original habeas petition, and even if it does, it could be unconstitutional to deny relief to a death row inmate who has proven their innocence. The Teague doctrine might also be relevant in this case. The Teague doctrine may prevent a state prisoner from using habeas to benefit from a new constitutional interpretation not in place when their conviction became final, unless it prohibits the underlying conduct of conviction or is a \"watershed rule of criminal procedure.\" The Teague doctrine may prevent a state prisoner from benefiting from a new constitutional interpretation not in place when their conviction became final. The \"watershed rule of criminal procedure\" implicates fundamental fairness and accuracy in criminal procedure. The level of persuasion necessary for habeas relief in cases of assumed innocence is described as 'extraordinarily high' in Herrera. The District Court conducted a hearing and extensive examination of the record to determine if the Eighth Amendment precludes execution of a defendant who is actually innocent. Davis must assemble evidence to satisfy the standard established. The Eighth Amendment's cruel and unusual punishment clause condemns punishments that offend evolving standards of decency. State practices and legislative actions, along with Supreme Court precedents, determine the line between permissible and impermissible punishments. Most states have statutes allowing innocent defendants to challenge capital convictions, with two states not having capital punishment as an option. The Eighth Amendment permits execution of a defendant only if responsible for another's death, serving penological purposes. The District Court borrowed the \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard to establish actual innocence. The district court applied the \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard from Sawyer to determine Mr. Davis's actual innocence. Despite some doubt cast by new evidence, the majority of trial evidence remained intact and the new evidence was deemed not credible. As a result, Mr. Davis failed to meet the standard for habeas relief in federal court. The District Court denied Davis habeas relief in federal court, with any appeal going directly to the Supreme Court. Despite doubts raised by new evidence, Davis failed to establish his actual innocence, leading the Supreme Court to dismiss the case without a written opinion on March 28, 2011."}
