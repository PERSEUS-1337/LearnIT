    "content": "The \"Taxpayer Debt Buy-Down Act\" is designated for the reduction of public debt through the addition of a new part in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This part allows taxpayers to designate amounts for the reduction of public debt. Every individual with adjusted income tax liability can designate up to 10 percent of their liability to reduce the public debt. This designation must be made when filing the tax return and can only be done once per taxable year. Adjusted income tax liability refers to the income tax liability for that year. The designation of adjusted income tax liability can be made on the first page of the tax return or the page with the taxpayer's signature. Adjusted income tax liability is the income tax liability reduced by any designated amount for the Presidential Election Campaign Fund. A clerical amendment is made to the table of parts for subchapter A. The amendments in Part IX apply to taxable years after the enactment date. A new section is added for the Public Debt Reduction Trust Fund in the Internal Revenue Code. The Public Debt Reduction Trust Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States for the purpose of paying off federal government obligations. Amounts designated for public debt reduction are appropriated to this fund. The Public Debt Reduction Trust Fund, designated under section 6097, is available for paying off federal government obligations. Amounts in the fund can only be used to pay, redeem, or buy back federal government obligations, which are then canceled and retired. The Public Debt Reduction Trust Fund, established under section 6097, is utilized for settling federal government debts. The fund can only be used to pay off, redeem, or repurchase federal government obligations, which are subsequently canceled and retired. The amendments in this section apply to amounts received after the enactment of this Act. The Taxpayer-Generated Sequestration of Federal Spending to Reduce the Public Debt involves sequestration to reduce the public debt, as outlined in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. Sequestration equivalent to estimated aggregate amount designated under section 6097 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for the last taxable year ending before the beginning of that session of Congress shall occur within 15 days after Congress adjourns. The Department of the Treasury estimates the taxable year ending before the start of the congressional session, adjusted by discretionary spending reductions and deficit changes from legislation. This applies unless specified otherwise. The fiscal year 1996 budget is based on 1995 appropriations minus sequesters, and the deficit change from direct spending legislation. Each account will be reduced by a percentage to make the reductions permanent. The fiscal year 1996 budget will reduce each account by a uniform percentage to make the reductions permanent. No order issued under this part can reduce benefits for the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance program, payments for net interest, or certain specified accounts. The fiscal year 1996 budget will reduce certain accounts by a uniform percentage to make the reductions permanent, excluding benefits for the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance program, payments for net interest, and specific accounts related to federal deposit insurance and credit union share insurance.
