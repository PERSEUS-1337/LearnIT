    "content": "The report discusses the modernization of U.S. military tactical aircraft, including fighter aircraft, strike fighters, and attack planes. Tactical aircraft are crucial for U.S. military capability and defense spending. The Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps had around 3,500 tactical aircraft in early 2009. Modernization efforts focus on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Air Force F-22 fighter program, and the Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter program. Program-specific issues for Congress in FY2010 include the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs. In FY2010, Congress faces decisions on the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs, including whether to terminate the alternate engine for the F-35, end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft, and approve funding for additional F-22s. In FY2010, Congress must decide on ending F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft or funding more F-22s. They also need to consider the Navy's request for F/A-18E/F procurement and a multiyear procurement arrangement for F/A-18E/Fs and EA-18Gs. These program-specific issues are detailed in CRS reports. In FY2010, Congress must decide on ending F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft or funding more F-22s. They also need to consider the Navy's request for F/A-18E/F procurement and a multiyear procurement arrangement for F/A-18E/Fs and EA-18Gs. Program-specific issues are detailed in CRS reports, covering legislative activity on U.S. tactical aircraft affordability. In FY2010, legislative activity focused on the affordability of modernizing U.S. tactical aircraft and the future of the industrial base for designing and manufacturing these aircraft. Tactical aircraft are shorter-ranged combat planes that operate within a single regional theater of operations. Tactical aircraft are shorter-ranged combat planes that operate within a single regional theater of operations. Strategic aircraft, on the other hand, are larger and longer-ranged bombers designed for very long flights, including intercontinental missions. Tactical aircraft, such as fighters and strike fighters, are designed for shorter-ranged missions within a single theater of operations. They are distinct from strategic aircraft like B-2 bombers, which are built for long-range intercontinental flights. Tactical aircraft, including fighters, strike fighters, and attack planes, are designed for air-to-air and air-to-ground combat operations. They are often referred to as tac air and operate primarily within a single theater of operations. Tactical aircraft, such as attack planes with an \"A\" designation like A-10, are designed for air-to-ground operations. Air Force tactical aircraft operate from land bases, Navy tactical aircraft operate from aircraft carriers, and Marine Corps aircraft operate from both Navy ships and land bases. Marine Corps tactical aircraft include VSTOL and STOVL aircraft. Marine Corps tactical aircraft, including VSTOL and STOVL planes, operate from Navy ships and land bases. Fighters focus on air-to-air combat for air superiority, while attack planes support ground forces with close air support and interdiction missions. The Air Force's tactical aircraft, such as attack planes and strike fighters, are used for air-to-ground combat operations, including close air support, battlefield air interdiction, and deep interdiction. They can also perform air-to-air operations and other missions like surveillance and reconnaissance. The Air Force operates new F-22 fighters along with older aircraft like F-15 fighters and F-15E strike fighters. The Air Force operates tactical aircraft for various operations, including surveillance and reconnaissance. They have new F-22 fighters and older aircraft like F-15 and F-16 fighters, as well as A-10 attack aircraft. The Navy has older F/A-18A-D strike fighters and newer F/A-18E/F strike fighters. The Marine Corps operates F/A-18 A-D strike fighters and AV-8B VSTOL attack planes. The Department of Defense (DOD) had approximately 3,500 tactical aircraft in early 2009, with the Air Force having about 2,375 and the Navy and Marine Corps having about 1,125. Modernization efforts focus on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), Air Force F-22 fighter, and Navy F/A-18E/F strike fighter programs. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program is a key focus of modernizing U.S. tactical aircraft, with versions for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. It was designed to be a relatively affordable fifth-generation strike fighter. The F-35 program is the largest weapon procurement program for the US military, with plans to acquire 2,456 JSFs for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy at an estimated cost of $246 billion. The DOD plans to acquire 2,456 JSFs for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy at an estimated total cost of $246 billion in constant FY2009 dollars. The Air Force is getting the F-35A to replace F-16s and A-10s, the Marine Corps is getting the F-35B to replace F/A-18A-Ds and AV-8Bs, and the Navy is also procuring F-35s. The F-35A is a more affordable complement to the Air Force's F-22s. The Marine Corps is getting the F-35B to replace F/A-18A-Ds and AV-8Bs, while the Navy is procuring the F-35C for carrier operations. The proposed FY2010 budget includes funding for 30 F-35s, with variants for each branch. The administration's FY2010 budget includes funding for 30 F-35 strike fighters, with variants for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. The F-22 fighter, also known as the Raptor, is a fifth-generation aircraft with advanced capabilities like stealth and high maneuverability. The procurement of F-22s began in FY1999, with a total of 187 aircraft procured through FY2009. The administration plans to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft. The F-22 fighter, with advanced capabilities like stealth and high maneuverability, began procurement in FY1999 with a total of 187 aircraft procured through FY2009. The administration plans to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft. Supporters want to continue procuring the aircraft towards a goal of 243 to 250 or more. The F/A-18E/F, known as the Super Hornet, is a Navy strike fighter, larger and more capable than earlier models. The Navy has been procuring the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircraft since FY2010 towards a goal of 243 to 250 or more. The Super Hornet is a fourth-generation Navy strike fighter, larger and more capable than earlier F/A-18A-D Hornets. It incorporates some fifth-generation technology in its sensors and forms the core of the Navy's aircraft carrier air wings. The Navy has been procuring F/A-18E/F Super Hornets since FY1997, with a total of 449 purchased through FY2009. The administration's proposed FY2010 budget requested funding for nine more F/A-18E/Fs. Air Force officials projected a fighter shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024, while Navy officials projected a strike fighter shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. The Air Force and Navy are facing projected fighter aircraft shortfalls, with the Air Force potentially lacking up to 800 aircraft by 2024 and the Navy-Marine Corps facing a shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. Some question the accuracy of these projections, suggesting they are influenced by assumptions about military threats and organizational constraints rather than actual warfighting needs. The Air Force and Navy are projected to face fighter aircraft shortfalls, with the Air Force potentially lacking up to 800 aircraft by 2024 and the Navy-Marine Corps facing a shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. The peak size of the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall depends on assumptions about service life extensions for Hornets and procurement rates of F-35Cs and F-35Bs. The Air Force announced a combat air forces restructuring plan to retire older tactical aircraft. The Air Force announced a combat air forces restructuring plan on May 18, 2009, to retire 249 older tactical aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and A-10s, in order to generate savings for other program needs. This plan does not include the retirement of five fighters proposed in the FY2010 budget submission. The Air Force announced a plan to retire 249 older tactical aircraft, including F-15s, F-16s, and A-10s, to fund a smaller and more capable force for higher priority missions. This plan does not include the retirement of five fighters proposed in the FY2010 budget submission. The Combat Air Forces restructuring plan will retire approximately 250 aircraft, including F-15 Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, and A-10 Thunderbolt IIs. This strategic move aims to convert legacy fighters and F-22 Raptors into a smaller, more flexible, and lethal force to bridge to fifth-generation fighters like the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley emphasized the importance of this restructuring for current operations. The Air Force's Combat Air Forces restructuring plan aims to retire 250 aircraft, including F-15 Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, and A-10 Thunderbolt IIs, to convert them into a smaller, more flexible, and lethal force bridging to fifth-generation fighters like the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. This plan will result in cost savings of $355 million in FY10 and $3.5 billion over the next five fiscal years, which will be used to reduce current capability gaps by investing in advanced capability modifications to remaining fighters and bombers, as well as procuring munitions for joint warfighters. The Air Force plans to invest in advanced capability modifications for remaining fighters and bombers, procure munitions for joint warfighters, and sustain critical intelligence capabilities. This decision was made after a careful assessment of the current threat environment and capabilities, according to Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz. The Air Force is restructuring its Combat Air Forces to modernize its fighter force in response to the eroding advantage over potential adversaries. This decision comes after a careful assessment of the current threat environment and capabilities, aiming to invest in advanced capability modifications and fifth-generation aircraft. The CAF restructuring plan aims to move 4,000 manpower authorizations to priority missions like surveillance and nuclear deterrence. This includes expanding aircrews for MQ-1 Predator, MQ-9 Reaper, and MC-12 Liberty, adding a fourth B-52 squadron, and enhancing information processing capabilities. The Air Force is realigning its operations to prioritize surveillance and nuclear deterrence. This includes expanding aircrews for MQ-1 Predator, MQ-9 Reaper, and MC-12 Liberty, adding a fourth B-52 squadron, and enhancing information processing capabilities. Secretary Donley and General Schwartz are committed to revitalizing the nuclear enterprise and deploying 50 unmanned combat air patrols by FY11 to meet current mission requirements. Secretary Donley and General Schwartz are committed to revitalizing the Air Force's nuclear enterprise and deploying 50 unmanned combat air patrols by FY11 to meet current mission requirements. Congress is concerned about the affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft. The affordability of DOD's plans for modernizing tactical aircraft has been a long-standing concern in Congress and elsewhere. Observers fear a budget \"train wreck\" as funding may not be sufficient for acquisition plans. The issue was previously focused on the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs, but as production of the F-22 and F/A-18E/F decreases, the focus may shift to the affordability of the F-35 program. The affordability of DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plans has been a concern, focusing on the F-35, F-22, and F/A-18E/F programs. As production of the F-22 and F/A-18E/F decreases, the affordability issue may shift to the F-35 program, with plans to increase procurement rates. The Department of Defense has reduced the number of new aircraft to be acquired for tactical aircraft modernization plans, including 80 F-35As for the Air Force by 2015 and 50 F-35Bs and Cs for the Marine Corps and Navy by 2014. This reduction was due to post-Cold War cuts in Air Force and Navy air wings and the Navy-Marine Corps Tactical Air Integration Plan. The Department of Defense has reduced the number of new aircraft to be acquired for tactical aircraft modernization plans through initiatives like the Navy-Marine Corps Tactical Air Integration Plan and the F-35 program. These efforts aim to lower costs for developing, procuring, and operating U.S. tactical aircraft. The DOD's tactical aircraft modernization plan aims to reduce costs by acquiring a strike fighter that can be used by all three services. However, affordability remains uncertain given future defense budget constraints. The projected Air Force and Navy-Marine Corps fighter shortfalls highlight ongoing challenges. The projected Air Force and Navy-Marine Corps fighter shortfalls indicate ongoing challenges in the affordability of tactical aircraft modernization. Policymakers may need to prioritize funding for tactical aircraft acquisition programs over non-aircraft systems to address potential funding tradeoffs. Funding tradeoffs may arise between tactical aircraft acquisition programs and non-aircraft systems like surface-to-air missile systems, surface-to-surface missiles, and ship-based guns. Policymakers may also need to consider funding for other aircraft like long-range bombers or helicopters for certain missions performed by tactical aircraft. Funding tradeoffs between tactical aircraft acquisition programs and other aircraft like long-range bombers or helicopters for specific missions. Some argue for less funding on tactical aircraft and more on long-range aircraft due to regional anti-access capabilities. The funding emphasis is on tactical aircraft and long-range aircraft that can operate outside the range of anti-access systems. There is a debate on funding for tactical aircraft acquisition programs versus other aircraft for different missions. Observers question the affordability of DOD's plans for procuring new aircraft of all types, including unmanned aerial vehicles. DOD's focus on tactical aircraft modernization is part of a larger debate on the affordability of procuring new aircraft, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs). The increasing role of UAVs in surveillance and reconnaissance, along with UCAVs in ground-attack operations, is prompting DOD to prioritize these aircraft in the coming years. The DOD is focusing on tactical aircraft modernization, with an emphasis on UAVs and UCAVs for ground-attack operations. There is a debate on funding for land-based Air Force tactical aircraft vs. sea-based Navy and Marine Corps aircraft. The administration's proposal to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft and concentrate on future Air Force tactical aircraft, comparing funding for land-based F-22 and F-35A programs with sea-based F/A-18E/F and F-35 B/C programs. Observers debate capabilities and costs of land- vs. sea-based aircraft for various missions. The administration's proposal to end F-22 procurement at 187 aircraft and focus on future Air Force tactical aircraft, comparing funding for land-based F-22 and F-35A programs with sea-based F/A-18E/F and F-35 B/C programs. Funding tradeoffs between procurement of F-35s, F-22s, and F/A-18E/Fs versus service life extensions or new models of older-design tactical aircraft are being debated. The debate over funding tradeoffs between procurement of F-35s, F-22s, and F/A-18E/Fs versus service life extensions or new models of older-design tactical aircraft poses complex questions of costs, capabilities, and technical feasibility. The potential tradeoffs between procurement of F-35s, F-22s, and F/A-18E/Fs versus service life extensions of older aircraft are being studied and debated in the context of U.S. military goals and objectives, which are currently under review in the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). One key issue in the QDR is the emphasis on preparing for irregular warfare operations vs. conventional interstate conflict. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) is being reviewed in preparation for submission to Congress with the proposed FY2011 budget. One key issue in the QDR is the balance between preparing for irregular warfare operations and conventional interstate conflict, particularly in relation to force elements like tactical aircraft. Observers have questioned the need for large quantities of high-capability tactical aircraft in the post-Cold War era, arguing that they may not be the most cost-effective for counterinsurgency and anti-terrorism operations. Some observers question the need for large quantities of high-capability tactical aircraft, suggesting investments in UAVs, special operations helicopters, and other equipment for counterinsurgency and anti-terrorism operations. Others argue that such aircraft are still necessary due to the availability of Russian aircraft and surface-to-air missiles. Some argue for investing in UAVs, special operations helicopters, and equipment for counterinsurgency, while others believe high-capability tactical aircraft are still needed due to the availability of Russian aircraft and surface-to-air missiles. Concerns also arise from recent acquisitions of advanced fighter aircraft and surface-to-air missiles by China and India. Recent acquisitions of advanced fighter aircraft and surface-to-air missiles by China and India have raised concerns about potential challenges to U.S. airpower in the future. It is argued that having a large number of advanced aircraft will ensure operational success in conflicts with well-armed adversaries. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined DOD's investment planning for recapitalizing in response to a request from Representative Neil Abercrombie. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined DOD's investment planning for recapitalizing its tactical fighter and attack aircraft force portfolio at the request of Representative Neil Abercrombie. The report highlighted that the military services plan to spend $109.3 billion in the next 7 years to acquire 570 new tactical aircraft and modernize existing ones, despite cost increases, schedule delays, and changes in requirements reducing procurement quantities. The military services plan to spend $109.3 billion on acquiring 570 new tactical aircraft and modernizing existing ones. Cost increases, schedule delays, and changes in requirements have reduced procurement quantities of new aircraft. The development period for the F-22A doubled, unit costs more than doubled, and the number of aircraft the Air Force can procure has declined. Similar issues are emerging for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), which is crucial for future modernization efforts. The development costs for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) have increased by $31.6 billion since 2004, with procurement and delivery schedules slipping. Legacy systems must be sustained until new systems are ready to replace them. Funding needs for new and legacy aircraft are interdependent. Since 2004, the development costs for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) have increased by $31.6 billion, with procurement and delivery schedules slipping. Funding needs for new and legacy aircraft are interdependent, and uncertainty about new systems costs and deliveries complicates modernization and retirement planning for legacy systems. The services are investing an average of about $1.7 billion per year on legacy modifications over the next seven years, with pent up demands for unfunded requirements and potential life extension programs. Hard decisions on retiring or extending the life of legacy aircraft must be made soon. DOD lacks a comprehensive plan for modernization efforts and legacy retirement schedules. DOD officials are facing decisions on retiring or extending the life of legacy aircraft soon. There is a lack of a comprehensive investment plan for modernizing fighter and attack aircraft, leading to difficulty in assessing capability gaps and duplication of resources among military services. Each service operates independently to acquire resources for its force structure. The military services operate independently to acquire resources for their specific force structures, leading to underperformance in delivering aircraft within desired costs and quantities. Future plans may be unaffordable within projected funding levels. The military services have underperformed in delivering aircraft within desired costs and quantities. Future plans may be unaffordable within projected funding levels due to unrealistic assumptions about cost, quantity, and delivery schedules for new acquisitions. The military services have struggled to deliver aircraft within desired costs and quantities, leading to unaffordable future plans. Projected decline in federal discretionary spending, operational support for the global war on terror, and competition for funds from other defense projects like a strategic tanker aircraft and long-range strike systems are challenging the recapitalization and sustainability of tactical air forces. Joint requirements examinations have not significantly impacted service plans and investments. The military services have faced challenges in delivering aircraft within desired costs and quantities, impacting future plans. To address this, GAO recommends DOD to shorten cycle times for developing new tactical aircraft and develop an integrated investment strategy. The Congressional Budget Office conducted a study on the capabilities and costs of the fighter force at the direction of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Congressional Budget Office conducted a study on the capabilities and costs of the fighter force for tactical air forces, comparing alternative approaches for modernization. The Congressional Budget Office conducted a study on the fighter force for tactical air forces, finding that planned purchases of new aircraft are insufficient to maintain fighter inventories at required levels. The study compares seven alternative approaches for modernization, including options to satisfy inventory requirements, maintain weapons capacity with fewer aircraft, or replace portions of the fighter force with longer-range aircraft. The report from May 2009 discusses the modernization goals of the fighter force, highlighting the potential increase in capability with state-of-the-art aircraft offering technological advances like increased payload capacity and stealth capabilities. The report from May 2009 discusses the modernization goals of the fighter force, emphasizing the potential increase in capability with state-of-the-art aircraft that offer technological advances such as increased payload capacity and stealth capabilities for enhanced survivability. Despite the emphasis on greater flight endurance, the unrefueled ranges of newer aircraft may not increase significantly. Fighter inventories are projected to fall below stated goals in the coming years under DoD's fiscal year 2009 procurement plans, but aggregate capabilities are expected to remain equal to or improve due to enhanced lethality and survivability. Despite falling below stated goals in the coming years, fighter inventories are expected to maintain or improve aggregate capabilities with new fighters offering enhanced lethality and survivability. Alternative approaches like purchasing additional F/A-18E/F Super Hornets or upgraded versions of legacy aircraft could provide short-term inventory relief. Purchasing upgraded versions of legacy aircraft like the F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-15E Strike Eagle could offer short-term inventory relief and cost savings, although with lesser capability improvements compared to buying JSFs. Forces equipped with a mix of fighters and subsonic attack aircraft would provide improved basing options. Forces with a mix of fighters and subsonic attack aircraft offer improved basing flexibility and persistence during air-to-ground missions. Replacing some fighters with attack aircraft can maintain air-to-ground weapons capacities at similar costs, but with fewer aircraft for air-to-air combat. This poses an issue for Congress regarding tactical aircraft. The aircraft could provide air-to-ground weapons capacities comparable to today's forces at costs similar to DoD's plans, with fewer aircraft for air-to-air combat. Congress is concerned about the implications of tactical aircraft acquisition decisions on the U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry and employment levels. The U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry employs thousands of workers. Decisions on tactical aircraft acquisition programs can impact industry structure. Currently, there are two prime contractors - Lockheed and Boeing. Reduction in F/A-18E/F production could leave Lockheed as the sole prime contractor for tactical aircraft. The U.S. military aircraft manufacturing industry currently has two prime contractors, Lockheed and Boeing, for tactical aircraft production. If F/A-18E/F production decreases, Lockheed may become the sole prime contractor. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact on competition, innovation, pricing, schedule adherence, and production quality. Congress may need to consider how many tactical aircraft prime contractors are necessary. The U.S. military aircraft industry currently has two prime contractors, Lockheed and Boeing, for tactical aircraft production. Questions for Congress include the need for competition, innovation, pricing, and production quality in future aircraft development. The potential role of Boeing in preserving key skills for future competition against Lockheed is also a consideration. The potential for Boeing to preserve key skills for future competition in tactical aircraft production against Lockheed is a consideration for Congress. Legislative activity for FY2010 related to tactical aircraft modernization is presented, with a focus on how decisions on tactical aircraft programs could impact U.S. export earnings and international competitiveness in the aerospace industry.

Additionally, it should provide authorizations necessary for Air Force personnel affected by the retirements, an estimate of cost avoidance if the restructuring plan is implemented, and a description of how funds would be invested to ensure the remaining fighter force is modernized to outpace threats. The text chunk discusses the investment of funds in the future-years defense plan to modernize the remaining fighter force and outpace threats. It also mentions an exception for five fighter aircraft scheduled for retirement in fiscal year 2010. Congress expresses its findings regarding Navy carrier air wing force structure in Section 1051. Congress expresses its findings on Navy carrier air wing force structure, stating the requirement for not less than 10 carrier air wings with 44 strike fighter aircraft each. Despite the benefits of fifth-generation aircraft deployment, the Navy must maintain a certain force structure. The Department of the Navy requires not less than 10 carrier air wings, each with at least 44 strike fighter aircraft. Despite the potential benefits of fifth-generation aircraft deployment, the majority of strike fighters in carrier air wings will not be fifth-generation assets. Congress emphasizes the need for this force structure in addition to other naval combat forces. The House Armed Services Committee report summarizes the requirement for the Navy to have at least 10 carrier air wings, each with a minimum of 44 strike fighter aircraft. Congress emphasizes the importance of this force structure alongside other naval combat forces.

The report to Congress by March 1, 2010, must address the \"fighter gap\" issue with alternative solutions like accelerated procurement of fifth generation fighters such as the F-22 and F-35, interim procurement of \"4.5 generation\" fighters, and fleet management options. It should analyze the impact of any shortfalls on the Air National Guard and the air sovereignty alert mission, including the loss of flying missions and pilot and maintenance capability. (Page 101) The report expresses concern about the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall, with projected deficits of 110 aircraft in fiscal year 2009, 152 in fiscal year 2010, and a potential peak shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. The Department of the Navy faces a strike-fighter inventory shortfall of 110 aircraft in fiscal year 2009, projected to increase to 152 in fiscal year 2010 and potentially peak at 312 by fiscal year 2018. The committee deems these shortages unacceptable, attributing them to various factors such as previous inventory reductions and program delays. The Navy faces a strike-fighter inventory shortfall due to previous inventory reductions, program delays, and aircraft reaching service life sooner than expected. The committee is concerned about the impact on carrier air wings. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to address the naval strike-fighter inventory shortfall and believes that a multi-year procurement contract is more cost-effective than annual contracts. The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft through a multi-year contract to address inventory shortfall and cost-effectiveness. Authorization for the purchase of more aircraft is included in the Act, along with a provision to maintain a minimum of ten carrier air. The Navy is authorized to enter a multi-year procurement contract for more F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft. Congress recommends maintaining at least ten carrier air wings with 44 strike-fighters each. A report is requested to evaluate extending the service-life of F/A-18A through D aircraft to 10,000 flight hours. The Senate Armed Services Committee's report on the F/A-18E/F program expresses concern about the Navy facing a significant strike fighter shortfall. The Senate-reported version of the FY2010 defense authorization bill (S. 1390) highlights the Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall due to the retirement of older F/A-18A-D Hornets before the F-35C variant is available. This issue has been raised in previous committee reports on defense authorization bills. The committee expressed disappointment in the Navy's failure to provide a report comparing single versus multiyear procurement costs as mandated by previous committee reports. The Navy projected a shortfall of 69 tactical aircraft in 2017, which could increase to 125 based on current assumptions. The Navy projected a shortfall in tactical aviation, with a potential gap of 250 aircraft for the Department of the Navy. The committee criticized the Navy for not addressing this issue in their fiscal year 2010 budget. The Chief of Naval Operations projected a gap of 250 aircraft for the Department of the Navy, raising concerns about national security due to the Navy's failure to address this shortfall in their fiscal year 2010 budget. The delay in taking action on this issue is worrisome. The Navy's delay in addressing the projected aircraft shortfall raises concerns about national security. The committee notes that achieving initial operational capability of the F-35C in 2015 is considered optimistic. The Navy's reliance on a costly service life extension program for legacy F/A-18s is worrisome, as well as the lack of realistic long-range procurement plans to address the carrier strike aircraft shortfall. The Navy is considering a costly service life extension program (SLEP) for legacy F/A-18s to bridge the gap until the Joint Strike Fighter is fully operational. Concerns are raised about the lack of realistic long-term procurement plans to address the carrier strike aircraft shortfall. The Navy's proposal to extend the life of select legacy F/A-18s to 10,000 flight hours through a SLEP is estimated to cost $26.0 million per plane. The Navy is considering a costly service life extension program (SLEP) for legacy F/A-18s to bridge the gap until the Joint Strike Fighter is fully operational. Concerns are raised about the cost uncertainties and inefficiency of extending the life of select legacy F/A-18s to 10,000 flight hours through a SLEP estimated at $26.0 million per plane. The committee is concerned about the cost uncertainties and inefficiency of extending the life of legacy F/A-18s to 10,000 flight hours through a costly SLEP. They believe that procuring new F/A-18E/F's may be more beneficial, costing less than $50.0 million each in 2009 constant dollars under a multiyear procurement strategy. A SLEP to achieve an additional 1,400 flight hours would cost approximately $18,571 per flight hour gained, compared to $8,333 per flight hour for a new F/A-18E/F. The committee suggests that the Navy should carefully evaluate the costs and benefits of procuring new F/A-18E/F models compared to investing in a costly SLEP to extend the life of legacy aircraft. New F/A-18E/F models offer improved technological capabilities and may be a more cost-effective option, with a lower cost per flight hour gained. The committee recommends that the Navy evaluate the costs and benefits of purchasing new F/A-18E/F models versus investing in a SLEP for legacy aircraft. The new models offer advanced technological capabilities such as radar, avionics, refueling system, and weapon hard points, increasing the benefits of buying them over upgrading older aircraft. The Navy is considering purchasing new F/A-18E/F models over upgrading older aircraft through a SLEP. The new models offer advanced technological capabilities like radar, avionics, refueling system, and weapon hard points, making them a more beneficial option. The F/A-18E/F is projected to remain in the fleet until at least 2040, with the potential to utilize the full service life of any newly purchased aircraft. The Department of Defense plans to review tactical aircraft forces in the upcoming Quadrennial Defense Review. The committee expects the Department to analyze multiyear procurement for the F/A-18 as directed in the previous year's report. The Department of Defense will review tactical aircraft forces in the upcoming Quadrennial Defense Review. The committee expects analysis of multiyear procurement for the F/A-18, including cost differentials and tradeoffs between SLEP and new procurements. This information will inform tactical aviation procurement strategies. The Department will use analysis from the Quadrennial Defense Review to inform tactical aviation procurement strategies, especially in addressing the strike-fighter shortfall.

The Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall is due to high operational tempo causing aging of F-18 aircraft faster than planned for the introduction of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. The Navy is facing critical shortfalls in its strike fighter inventory due to high operational tempo aging the F-18 aircraft faster than planned for the introduction of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. The shortfall was predicted to peak at 125 aircraft in fiscal year 2017. The Navy is experiencing a shortfall in its strike fighter inventory, which was initially predicted to peak at 125 aircraft in fiscal year 2017. However, the current shortfall is now over 200 aircraft due to challenges with the life extension of older F-18 aircraft and a reduction in the number of F-18s being purchased in fiscal year 2010. The Navy is facing a shortage of F-18 aircraft, with a reduction in purchases for fiscal year 2010. Despite this, the production line for the F/A-18E/F variant is still open and producing cost-effective aircraft. The production line for the F/A-18E/F aircraft is still open and producing cost-effective aircraft. The Navy is not entering into another multi-year procurement for F/A-18E/F aircraft, missing out on significant savings. The Committee believes the Navy is missing out on significant savings by not entering into another multi-year procurement for F/A-18E/F aircraft. The recommendation provides $108,000,000 above the request for long lead equipment and cost reduction initiatives for a five-year, 150 aircraft multi-year procurement. Additionally, $495,000,000 is allocated for the procurement of nine additional aircraft to mitigate the strike fighter shortfall. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends cost reduction initiatives and additional procurement of F/A-18E/F aircraft to address the Navy's strike fighter shortfall caused by aging models and delays in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The Committee is concerned about the Navy's projected strike fighter shortfall due to aging F/A-18 models and delays in the F-35 program. To address this, an increase of $512,280,000 is provided to procure nine additional F/A-18s in fiscal year 2010. The Committee provides an increase of $512,280,000 to procure nine additional F/A-18s in fiscal year 2010, encouraging the Navy to pursue a multi-year procurement contract.
