It protects U.S. shipyards, carriers, and sailors but is debated for increasing costs and limiting ship availability. The Jones Act, part of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, mandates that vessels transporting cargo within the U.S. must be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. It has been a contentious issue in recent Congresses due to its impact on the cost of building merchant vessels in U.S. shipyards compared to abroad, as well as its relevance in discussions about national security goals and domestic transportation of oil and natural gas. The Jones Act of 1920 mandates that vessels transporting cargo within the U.S. must be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. It has been a contentious issue in recent Congresses due to its impact on the cost of building merchant vessels in U.S. shipyards compared to abroad, as well as its relevance in discussions about national security goals and domestic transportation of oil and natural gas. In May 2018, the Office of Management and Budget requested public comment on federal requirements in the maritime sector. The Jones Act of 1920 mandates that vessels transporting cargo within the U.S. must be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. This requirement dates back to laws favoring a U.S.-flag fleet over a foreign fleet enacted in 1789. The Office of Management and Budget sought public input on potentially modifying or repealing federal regulations in the maritime sector to increase efficiency and reduce unnecessary burdens. The Jones Act of 1920 mandates that vessels transporting cargo within the U.S. must be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. This requirement stems from laws enacted in 1789 favoring a U.S.-flag fleet over a foreign fleet. Congress enacted laws in 1817 and 1886 to restrict foreign-owned vessels from transporting domestic cargo between U.S. ports. In 1817, Congress enacted a precursor to the Jones Act by disallowing foreign-owned vessels from transporting domestic cargo between U.S. ports. This prohibition was later extended to vessels carrying passengers domestically in 1886. The United States initially had a shipbuilding advantage due to ample timber supply, but lost it as wooden sailing ships were replaced by iron steamships. Congress debated how to address the decline in U.S. vessels' share of foreign trade. In the mid-1800s, the United States lost its shipbuilding advantage to Scotland and England as wooden sailing ships were replaced by iron steamships. Congress debated how to respond to the decline in U.S. vessels' share of foreign trade, with proposals for foreign-built vessels to sail under the U.S. flag known as the \"free ship\" movement. Opponents argued that the higher cost of U.S. crews would hinder a resurgence of trade carried by U.S. vessels. Since 1912, the domestic build requirement has mainly applied to vessels on domestic voyages, while in the late 1800s, Congress considered but did not pass bills allowing foreign-built ships in domestic trade. Since 1912, the domestic build requirement has mainly applied to vessels on domestic voyages. In the late 1800s, Congress tightened coastwise transport regulations in response to shippers' attempts to use foreign-built ships to avoid high-cost U.S. vessels. In 1891, a shipper loaded 250 kegs of nails at the Port of New York destined for Los Angeles (Redondo) on a foreign-flag ship via Antwerp, Belgium. Despite extra port charges, using foreign-flag ships saved on freight costs compared to U.S.-owned ships. Similarly, shipments from Seattle to Alaska often went through Vancouver to utilize foreign-flag ships. Congress amended the coastwise law in 1893. In 1891, a shipper legally carried nails from New York to Los Angeles on a foreign-flag ship via Antwerp, Belgium. Shipments from Seattle to Alaska also used foreign-flag ships by routing through Vancouver, Canada. Congress amended the coastwise law in 1893 to prevent cargo from being routed through foreign ports to avoid coastwise laws. Despite this, U.S. shippers continued to use foreign-flag vessels in the Alaska trade by moving cargo between the United States and Vancouver, Canada, by rail. Senator Wesley Jones of Washington sought to stop this practice in the Merchant Marine Act of 1920. In the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, Senator Wesley Jones amended the coastwise law to require Alaska-bound cargo to move through the Port of Seattle, replacing shipments between \"U.S. ports\" with shipments between \"U.S. points.\" The debate leading to the Jones Act passage included the relative cost of building ships in the United States versus foreign countries. The Jones Act, part of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, amended the coastwise law to require Alaska-bound cargo to move through the Port of Seattle, replacing shipments between \"U.S. ports\" with shipments between \"U.S. points.\" The debate leading to the Jones Act passage included the relative cost of building ships in the United States versus foreign countries. The minority report expressed concerns about banning foreign-built ships, stating it would result in more costly domestically built ships. The Jones Act, part of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, required Alaska-bound cargo to move through the Port of Seattle. The debate leading to the Jones Act passage included concerns about banning foreign-built ships, stating it would result in more costly domestically built ships. The view expressed was that American merchants should be able to acquire ships at the lowest possible price to compete globally in the transportation of commerce. The Jones Act of 1920 aimed to allow American merchants to buy ships at the lowest price to compete globally in commerce transportation. This would result in American-flagged ships being bought as cheaply as foreign-flagged ships, promoting competition in the industry. The Jones Act of 1920 aimed to promote American shipbuilders by requiring U.S.-built ships for coastwise trade. Over the years, the cost of U.S.-built ships increased significantly compared to foreign-built ships, with prices reaching up to four times higher today. The cost of U.S.-built ships has significantly increased over the years compared to foreign-built ships. In the 1930s, the cost differential was 50%, doubling in the 1950s and tripling by the 1990s. Today, a U.S.-built tanker is estimated to be four times the global price of a similar vessel, while a U.S.-built container ship may cost five times the global price. This cost difference is also a concern for Department of Defense officials overseeing military sealift ships, leading to a decision to purchase more used foreign-built cargo ships instead of building domestically. The Department of Defense officials are facing cost differentials with military sealift ships, opting to buy used foreign-built cargo ships due to unaffordable domestic construction. U.S. shipyards do not compete on price or vessel characteristics with foreign shipyards, leading to higher operating costs for U.S.-flag ships compared to foreign-flag ships. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 focused on the sale of surplus government cargo ships. U.S.-flag ships have higher operating costs compared to foreign-flag ships, with crewing being the primary cost element. The cost differential is estimated to be over $6 million per ship per year, including insurance and maintenance costs. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 focused on the sale of surplus government cargo ships and stated maritime policy goals. U.S.-flag ships have significantly higher operating costs compared to foreign-flag ships, with a cost differential that has increased over time. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920, outlined in Section 27 (46 U.S.C. \u00a750101), emphasizes the need for a strong U.S. merchant marine for national defense and commerce. It aims for a privately owned fleet of vessels operated by U.S. citizens, with the government committed to supporting its development and maintenance. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 emphasizes the importance of a strong U.S. merchant marine for national defense and commerce. It aims for a privately owned fleet of vessels operated by U.S. citizens, with the government committed to supporting its development and maintenance. The act was a response to the shortage of ships during World War I, highlighting the need for the U.S. to have its own merchant marine. The Jones Act, part of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, requires domestic waterborne shipments to be carried out by U.S. owned and crewed vessels. This act was a response to the shortage of ships during World War I, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to have its own merchant marine. The Jones Act mandates that U.S. owned and crewed ships must handle domestic waterborne shipments. The crewing requirement specifies that a majority of the crew and stock must be U.S. citizens. Certain U.S. territories are exempt from the Jones Act, allowing foreign-flag ships to transport cargo between these islands and other U.S. points. The Coast Guard enforces the U.S.-build requirement for vessels traveling between Guam and other U.S. locations. Ships transporting cargo between U.S. points must be U.S.-owned and -crewed. The Coast Guard enforces U.S.-build requirements for vessels traveling between Guam and other U.S. locations. Customs and Border Protection oversees Jones Act operators' licensing. The Jones Act requires operators to use \"U.S.-built\" vessels for coastwise endorsements. Customs and Border Protection determines maritime activity under the act, including defining \"transportation\" and identifying \"U.S. points\" for voyages. The Act has consistent interpretations since the late 1800s and early 1900s. The Jones Act mandates the use of \"U.S.-built\" vessels for coastwise endorsements. Customs and Border Protection defines maritime activity under the act, including \"U.S. points\" for voyages. The Coast Guard determines if a vessel is U.S.-built based on specific criteria. The Coast Guard regulations define a vessel as U.S.-built if the hull and superstructure are fabricated in the United States and the vessel is assembled in the United States. Propulsion machinery and other components do not affect this determination, allowing U.S. shipyards to import engines from foreign manufacturers for oceangoing ships. For oceangoing ships, U.S. shipyards can import engines from foreign manufacturers as they are considered components attached to the hull, not integral parts of the hull's structure. Parts or components that are self-supporting and do not compromise the vessel's integrity can be manufactured abroad, as long as they are attached or joined to the vessel in the U.S. The Coast Guard allows certain parts or components of vessels to be manufactured abroad if they are self-supporting and do not compromise the vessel's integrity. These components must be attached or joined to the vessel in a U.S. shipyard, not overseas. The weight limit for foreign-manufactured hull or superstructure components is up to 1.5% of the steel weight. This includes items like propellers, stern bulbs, bulbous bows, rudders, and watertight closures used in U.S.-built vessels. The Coast Guard allows certain foreign-manufactured components like propellers, stern bulbs, bulbous bows, rudders, and watertight closures to be used in U.S.-built vessels as long as they do not exceed the steel weight limit. Shipyards must confirm with the Coast Guard that incorporating these components will not disqualify the vessel. Shipyards in the U.S. must perform custom shaping, molding, and cutting of steel for vessel design. The Coast Guard issues determination letters detailing permissible foreign components in vessel construction. Shipyard unions refer to vessels built with foreign components as \"kit ships.\" In 2007, unions sued the Coast Guard over its interpretation of the statute. In the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018, Congress directed the publication of determination letters regarding permissible foreign components in vessel construction. Shipyard unions, who call ships built with foreign components \"kit ships,\" sued the Coast Guard in 2007 over its interpretation of the statute. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ruled in favor of the Coast Guard, citing historical interpretations dating back to the late 1800s by the Treasury Department and early 1900s by the U.S. Attorney General. The Coast Guard's interpretation of permissible foreign components in vessel construction is consistent with historical interpretations dating back to the late 1800s by the Treasury Department and early 1900s by the U.S. Attorney General. The shipyard unions' lawsuit was prompted by a partnership between a Philadelphia shipyard and a South Korean shipbuilder to build Jones Act tankers and container ships since 2004. General Dynamics NASSCO of San Diego also partners in building Jones Act oceangoing ships. Since 2006, General Dynamics NASSCO of San Diego has partnered with Daewoo Shipbuilding of South Korea to procure vessel designs and materials for Jones Act commercial ships, potentially undermining the policy objective of domestic shipbuilding independence. Importing engines and major ship components for Jones Act vessels may contradict the policy objective of domestic shipbuilding independence. Shipyards argue that restricting the use of foreign components would increase ship costs, reduce orders, and harm the domestic fleet. The US is the largest cruise ship market, but most Americans board foreign-flag cruise ships due to CBP regulations exempting ships that visit distant foreign ports from Jones Act compliance. The CBP regulations exempt cruise ships visiting distant foreign ports from Jones Act compliance, allowing most Americans to board foreign-flag ships in the largest cruise ship market. The 1910 Attorney General's opinion and a 1985 rule by the U.S. Customs Service allow foreign cruise ships to visit U.S. ports as long as they also include a visit to a nearby foreign port. Passengers must stay on the cruise until it ends at the same dock. Foreign-flag cruise ships are allowed to make round trips from a U.S. port and visit other U.S. ports if they also stop at a nearby foreign port. Passengers must stay on the cruise until it returns to the original dock. This exemption from the Jones Act is based on the primary purpose of the voyage. Another type of passenger vessel excursion involves visits to no other ports, such as whale watching or deep-sea fishing. If passenger vessels stay within 3 miles of U.S. territorial waters on voyages to nowhere, they must comply with the Jones Act. This interpretation is based on Treasury Decision 22275 from 1900. If vessels stay within 3 miles of U.S. territorial waters, they must be Jones Act-compliant. CBP considers these waters as \"U.S. points\" based on Treasury Decision 22275 from 1900. However, if vessels go beyond 3 miles into international waters, they do not need to comply with the Jones Act, per a 1912 Attorney General opinion. Charter fishing boats must still be Jones Act-compliant even in international waters, according to a 1936 ruling by the Bureau of. The policy for charter fishing boats differs from other passenger vessels regarding Jones Act compliance. Charter fishing boats must comply even in international waters, as determined by a 1936 ruling and affirmed in 1960. CBP's interpretation includes defining a passenger as anyone aboard who is not a crew member, regardless of payment. The Jones Act defines a passenger as anyone aboard a vessel who is not a crew member or owner, regardless of payment. This interpretation affects various industries, such as yacht owners entertaining clients and construction companies transporting workers. Compliance with the Jones Act is required for activities like lightering in the offshore oil market. The Jones Act requires construction companies to use Jones Act-compliant vessels when transporting workers to construction sites. CBP's interpretations impact lightering and offshore supply vessels in the offshore oil market. CBP considers a tanker anchored within 3 nautical miles of shore a \"U.S. point,\" allowing foreign-flagged vessels for lightering operations in certain areas. The Jones Act requires Jones Act-compliant vessels for transporting workers to construction sites. Lightering vessels within 3 miles of shore must be Jones Act-compliant, while offshore supply vessels servicing oil rigs must also comply. U.S. waters extend 200 miles offshore for certain purposes under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953. Within U.S. waters extending 200 miles offshore, only oil rigs attached to the seabed are considered \"U.S. points\" for Jones Act compliance. Mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs) not attached to the seabed are not required to comply with the Jones Act. In 2008, Congress required that OSVs servicing MODUs be U.S.-owned and -crewed, but not necessarily U.S.-built, similar to requirements for U.S.-flag vessels on international voyages. OSVs servicing MODUs must be U.S.-owned and -crewed, but not necessarily U.S.-built. Whether an OSV needs to be Jones Act-compliant depends on its activities, such as transporting supplies or workers to an oil rig. Vessels laying cable or pipeline in U.S. waters are exempt from Jones Act requirements. Vessels laying cable or pipeline in U.S. waters are exempt from Jones Act requirements, while OSVs transporting supplies and rig workers must be Jones Act-compliant. Foreign-flagged vessels can be used for installing rig equipment, geophysical surveying, diving inspections, and as \"flotels\" for construction workers. The distinction between Jones Act compliance can be unclear, with CBP proposing in 2017 that most activities performed by OSVs fall under the Jones Act. In 2017, CBP proposed that most activities performed by OSVs fall under the Jones Act, but later withdrew the proposal. There is uncertainty regarding whether the Jones Act applies to offshore wind farms beyond 3 miles from shore. Wind farm developers currently rely on CBP's interpretations of the Jones Act for guidance. The nonavailability of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs) is seen as a hindrance. The Department of Energy has highlighted the lack of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs) as a challenge for offshore wind farm development in the U.S., especially for installations in deeper waters. U.S. wind developers either import equipment from foreign countries or use Jones Act-compliant vessels alongside non-compliant TIVs for installation. The lack of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs) is a challenge for offshore wind farm development in the U.S. Wind developers either import equipment from foreign countries or use Jones Act-compliant vessels alongside non-compliant TIVs for installation. CBP's interpretation of the Jones Act regarding merchandise transformation at foreign ports has also influenced coastal maritime activity. If a product is transformed at a foreign port, vessels transporting it to and from the U.S. do not need to be Jones Act-compliant. This allows for foreign-flag tankers to transport products between U.S. points, such as a Texas oil producer shipping gasoline to a Bahamian facility for blending before being shipped to New York. The transformation of a product at a foreign port allows for foreign-flag tankers to transport it between U.S. points, such as a Texas oil producer shipping gasoline to a Bahamian facility for blending before being shipped to New York. This interpretation has precedent in a 1964 Customs Service ruling involving California rice being processed in the U.S. Virgin Islands before being shipped to Puerto Rico on foreign-flag ships. Since 1920, Congress has enacted provisions tightening Jones Act requirements and exempting certain maritime activities. In 1935, vessels qualified under the Jones Act were prohibited from being sold to foreign owners or requalifying under a foreign flag, ensuring they could not be used in U.S. domestic trade again. In 1935, Congress prohibited Jones Act-qualified vessels from being sold to foreign owners or requalifying under a foreign flag, ensuring they could not be used in U.S. domestic trade again. This provides protection for Jones Act carriers from competition if coastal shipping demand increases, as it takes time to construct new ships. In 1940, the Jones Act was expanded to cover towing vessels and salvage vessels operating in U.S. waters. In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material requires use of a Jones Act-qualified vessel. Congress has enacted exemptions to the Jones Act when no qualified operator is available in a particular market. In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material requires a Jones Act-qualified vessel. Exemptions to the Jones Act have been enacted when no qualified operator is available in a specific market. Some exemptions include passenger travel between Puerto Rico and other U.S. ports, allowing foreign-flag cruise ships to operate. Congress has permitted waivers of the Jones Act in certain situations. The Jones Act has exemptions for foreign-flag cruise ships to operate between the U.S. mainland and Puerto Rico. Congress has also allowed exemptions for foreign-flagged LNG tankers in certain situations, but these have not been utilized. Additionally, exemptions have been enacted to address vessel shortages, such as during the 1940s for iron ore transport on the Great Lakes. In response to vessel shortages, Congress enacted exemptions for iron ore transport on the Great Lakes during the 1940s and for a bumper grain harvest in 1951. In 1996, an exemption was enacted for vessels involved in oil spill cleanup operations when there are not enough Jones Act-qualified vessels available. Additionally, waivers have been granted for innovative vessel designs used in foreign trade with domestic legs. Congress has enacted Jones Act waivers for innovative vessel designs used in foreign trade with domestic legs, including exemptions for a ship designed for river barges (LASH) and the movement of empty containers. In 1971, Congress exempted river barges (LASH) from the Jones Act (P.L. 92-163), but this exemption is no longer relevant. In 1965, Congress exempted the movement of empty containers between U.S. ports from the Jones Act (P.L. 89-194) to allow foreign-flagged container carriers to reposition their empty equipment along U.S. coastlines. Jones Act-compliant ships are needed for transshipment of loaded international containers. The Jones Act requires transshipment of loaded international containers to be done by U.S.-built, -crewed, and -owned ships. Lack of transshipment services in the U.S. increases demand for rail and road connections to ports. The Jones Act mandates that ships involved in transshipment of international containers in the United States must be U.S.-built, -crewed, and -owned. Exemptions to the Jones Act can be authorized by Congress for specific vessels, but details about the waivers are often lacking. Since 1989, Congress has granted Jones Act waivers to at least 133 specific vessels in 16 legislative acts, typically found in maritime-related legislation. These waivers are granted without specifying the reason or details about the vessels. Since 1989, Congress has granted Jones Act waivers to at least 133 specific vessels in 16 legislative acts, typically found in maritime-related legislation. These waivers are granted without specifying the reason or details about the vessels. Some waivers have been granted to vessels that are not commercially significant, owned by nonprofit entities, or require waivers due to technicalities. Since 1989, Congress has granted Jones Act waivers to over 130 vessels in various legislative acts, often due to technicalities or non-commercial ownership. Specific conditions are placed on the vessel's use, with waivers granted during wartime as well. The Jones Act waivers have been granted for various reasons, including national defense interests during wartime. Waivers were issued during World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and conflicts in 1991 and 2011. The executive branch can issue waivers in the interest of national defense, allowing expedited oil shipments in response to military conflicts. The Jones Act waivers have been granted for national defense reasons during wartime, allowing expedited oil shipments in response to military conflicts and natural disasters. Waivers were granted in 1991 and 2011 for the Persian Gulf War and conflict in Libya, as well as for fuel resupply after natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017. Congress also included a role for MARAD in checking availability of resources in 2008. The Jones Act waivers have been granted for national defense reasons during wartime and natural disasters, with MARAD checking availability of resources in 2008. Waivers were granted for Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey, Irma, and Maria, allowing foreign-flag vessels to transport heavy equipment. In 2005 and 2006, waivers were granted for foreign-flag heavy-lift vessels to transport radar systems and an oil rig. A waiver request in 1992 to transport replicas of Christopher Columbus's ships was denied. CBP has consistently denied Jones Act waivers for heavy-lift vessels used in offshore oil rig construction. CBP has consistently denied Jones Act waivers for heavy-lift vessels used in offshore oil rig construction, despite safety concerns raised by Coast Guard and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. National defense waivers are not issued for economic reasons. CBP has denied Jones Act waivers for economic reasons, stating that national defense waivers are only issued for high standards. In 1976, some Members of Congress sought to extend the Jones Act to the U.S. Virgin Islands for national security reasons. In 1976, Members of Congress argued for extending the Jones Act to the U.S. Virgin Islands for national security reasons due to vulnerability of offshore supply lines. Refineries in the U.S. Northeast considered seeking a Jones Act waiver in 2014 to ship crude oil from Texas. In 2018, the U.S. exported 40-80 million barrels of crude oil per month on foreign-flag tankers. Refineries in the U.S. considered seeking a Jones Act waiver to ship crude oil from Texas. The United States exported 40-80 million barrels of crude oil per month on foreign-flag tankers in 2018. Additionally, the U.S. has begun exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) by ship while still importing LNG by ship, with no domestic LNG shipping on Jones Act tankers. The United States is exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) by ship while still importing LNG by ship, with no domestic LNG shipping on Jones Act tankers. Puerto Rico is seeking a waiver of the Jones Act to receive bulk shipments of LNG from the U.S. mainland. Recent controversies over the Jones Act have concerned the oceangoing ship and offshore supply vessel sectors. Puerto Rico is seeking a waiver of the Jones Act to receive bulk shipments of LNG from the U.S. mainland. The Jones Act covers various types of vessels, including oceangoing ships, tankers, and passenger vessels. As of March 2018, there were 99 oceangoing ships in the Jones Act-compliant fleet, with tankers being the largest category. As of March 2018, the Jones Act-compliant fleet had 99 oceangoing ships, with tankers being the largest category. The fleet includes 57 tankers, 24 container ships, 7 roll on/roll off vessels, and 2 dry bulk vessels. The Jones Act-compliant fleet consists of 99 oceangoing ships, including tankers, container ships, roll on/roll off vessels, dry bulk vessels, and general-cargo vessels. The fleet has significantly decreased in size since 1950, with larger ships but a lower aggregate carrying capacity. The Jones Act fleet has shrunk to less than a quarter of its 1950 size, with larger ships but lower carrying capacity. A significant drop in fleet size occurred in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In a 1967 congressional hearing, Alan Boyd stated the U.S. merchant marine was \"too small, too old, and too unproductive.\" The Lyndon B. Johnson Administration aimed to revitalize the industry without excessive federal funding or protectionism. The U.S. merchant marine is considered too small, old, and unproductive. The Lyndon B. Johnson Administration called for the repeal of the Jones Act, aiming to revitalize the industry without excessive federal funding or protectionism. Domestic ships have lost market share to railroads and pipelines, despite economic advantages like not needing rights-of-way. Ocean carriers, unlike railroads and pipelines, can move more cargo efficiently without the need for rights-of-way. Despite being slower, many shippers prefer ships for lower costs and reliable delivery schedules. The Jones Act fleet serves domestic trade routes in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico where overland modes are not available. The Jones Act fleet operates in domestic trade routes serving Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico where shippers have limited alternatives. While it has preserved a U.S. maritime industry, it has not met the goal of increasing the nation's commerce. Congress amended the policy goals in the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 to include providing shipping service on all routes. The Jones Act fleet, operating in domestic trade routes to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, aims to sustain a growing merchant marine. However, it falls short of providing shipping service on all essential routes and having the best equipped vessels as mandated by the Merchant Marine Act of 1936. The Jones Act fleet does not meet the goal of having the best equipped and most suitable types of vessels. Certain ship designs, like \"project cargo\" or \"heavy-lift\" vessels, are not represented in the fleet, hindering the transportation of oversized equipment. The Department of Defense has used waivers of the Jones Act for national defense purposes. The Jones Act fleet lacks project cargo and heavy-lift vessels, hindering transportation of oversized equipment. Department of Defense uses waivers for national defense purposes. Jones Act operators face obstacles in competing internationally due to higher cost structure. The Jones Act fleet faces obstacles in competing internationally due to higher cost structure. Two dry bulk ships and one chemical tanker in the fleet are nearly 40 years old, hindering their activity. No LNG tankers are in the fleet despite new domestic markets. The Jones Act fleet lacks LNG tankers despite new domestic markets from the shale gas boom. The high cost of U.S.-built and U.S.-crewed ships has led to the development of articulated tug barges (ATBs) as a unique vessel design in the market. Over 150 ATBs are estimated to be operating in the Jones Act trades. The U.S. market has developed articulated tug barges (ATBs) in response to the high cost of U.S.-built and U.S.-crewed ships. Over 150 ATBs are estimated to be operating in the Jones Act trades. ATBs are more capable than flatwater barges in handling sea swells but less reliable and efficient over longer voyages compared to tanker ships. They sail closer to the coasts, which could pose a higher risk of grounding. ATBs are less efficient than tanker ships on longer voyages due to their slower speed and smaller size. The notch between the barge and tug creates more water resistance. ATBs carry more cargo, mainly oil, on coastal voyages. The El Faro, a Jones Act general cargo ship, sank in a hurricane in 2015. The El Faro, a Jones Act general cargo ship, sank in a hurricane in 2015. Built in 1975, it had open lifeboats instead of closed ones with auto launchers required on newer ships. Coast Guard concerns about the U.S.-flag fleet's condition were raised after the El Faro incident. The U.S.-flag fleet's condition is a concern beyond the El Faro incident, with other vessels also in substandard condition due to age. The older ships are more likely to breakdown and are difficult to maintain, as highlighted by the Coast Guard's findings. The U.S.-flag fleet's condition is a concern due to aging vessels that are more likely to breakdown and difficult to maintain. In February 2019, the crew of the 46 year-old Jones Act containership Matsonia found a crack in the hull. The fleet is relatively young now due to new shipbuilding efforts to comply with emissions requirements. The Jones Act oceangoing fleet has become younger due to new shipbuilding efforts to comply with emissions requirements. Currently, 35 ships are 21 years old or older, down from 64 ships in 2007. The Great Lakes fleet, consisting of dry bulk ships and large barges, is considerably older than the oceangoing fleet. The Great Lakes fleet includes 33 dry bulk ships and large barges carrying iron ore, limestone, and coal for steelmaking and cement. The largest 1,000-foot freighters were built between 1972 and 1981, while the second-largest class, around 700 feet long, dates back to the 1940s and 1950s, with some vessels rebuilt in the 1970s. Ships in freshwater like the Great Lakes can have longer lifespans than oceangoing vessels. The Great Lakes fleet includes 33 dry bulk ships and large barges carrying iron ore, limestone, and coal for steelmaking and cement. Ships on the Great Lakes can have longer lifespans than oceangoing vessels. Domestic tonnage on the Great Lakes has declined steadily since the 1950s. The Canadian Great Lakes fleet shows the impact of vessel import policy on a domestic fleet. The tonnage on the Great Lakes has decreased by half since the 1950s. Canada's fleet stopped adding new ships after imposing a 25% tariff on imported vessels in 1985. The tariff was repealed in 2010, leading to the construction of over 35 new dry bulk ships for the Great Lakes. These ships cannot transport cargo between U.S. points. Since 2010, over 35 new dry bulk ships have been constructed in other countries for service on the Great Lakes, following Canada's repeal of the import tariff. Thousands of tugs and barges transport dry and liquid bulk commodities on inland rivers, with tonnage dominated by corn, soybeans, and coal. Overall tonnage on the system has been flat or slightly declining since 1990. Since 1990, overall tonnage on the system has been flat or declining slightly. One of the two leading manufacturers of river barges ceased operation in April 2018 in response to the fall-off in demand for coal deliveries by barge. The Dredging Act of 1906 requires that vessels engaged in dredging in U.S. waters be U.S.-built, -operated, and -crewed. The Dredging Act of 1906 (Stat. 204) mandates that dredging vessels in U.S. waters must be U.S.-built, -operated, and -crewed. It was enacted after dredging in Galveston Bay following a devastating 1900 hurricane. In 1988, the Jones Act was amended to include valueless material as \"merchandise,\" requiring dredge spoil to be transported in Jones Act-qualified vessels. This regulation increases the cost of dredging U.S. harbors significantly. The ban on foreign-built dredgers and operators under the Jones Act significantly raises the cost of dredging U.S. harbors. Despite increased federal spending on navigation dredging, there has not been a corresponding increase in the volume of material dredged. Limited supply of dredging vessels, rising costs of fuel, steel, and labor, and stricter environmental requirements contribute to the cost increases. The cost of dredging U.S. harbors is increasing due to factors such as limited supply of vessels, rising fuel and labor costs, and stricter environmental requirements. The U.S. privately owned fleet is older and smaller compared to leading European dredging firms, whose fleet capacity is much larger. The European dredging firms have a larger and more modern fleet of hopper dredges compared to the U.S. firms. When the Army Corps bids for harbor work requiring a hopper dredge, one of the four U.S. firms is often the sole bidder. There are periods when an insufficient number of dredges are available for upcoming dredging projects. When the Army Corps schedules dredging projects, there are times when there are not enough dredges available. Mobilization and demobilization of equipment can make up over one-third of total project costs in the U.S. market. Foreign firms use heavy-lift vessels to transport their dredge fleets, which are not available in the Jones Act fleet. The size of the OSV fleet can fluctuate with changes in the oil market. The offshore supply vessel fleet consists of about 1,800 vessels, mainly working in the Gulf of Mexico. Foreign-built vessels are essential for construction in deeper waters, requiring dynamic positioning propulsion systems. Annual construction of vessels ranged between 4 and 53 over the last decade. The offshore supply vessel fleet, averaging 32 vessels, relies on foreign-built vessels with dynamic positioning systems for construction in deep waters. However, there is a lack of similar vessels in the Jones Act fleet for installing wind towers in deeper waters. Congress has enacted programs since 1920 to designate other fleets for sealift support, highlighting perceived shortcomings in the domestic fleet's ability to serve as a naval auxiliary in times of war or national emergency. The Jones Act, established in the maritime policy, has perceived shortcomings in the domestic fleet's ability to serve as a naval auxiliary in times of war or national emergency. Congress has enacted programs since 1920 to designate other fleets for sealift support, but the shrinking U.S. mariner pool raises concerns about crewing a reserve sealift fleet. In 2014, Congress directed the Department of Transportation and the Department of Defense to develop a national sealift strategy. The U.S. mariner pool size raises doubts about crewing a reserve sealift fleet. In 2014, Congress directed the Department of Transportation and Defense to develop a national sealift strategy, which is yet to be issued. Jones Act oceangoing ship crews could support military sealift, with mariners having six months of shore leave per year expected to crew government-owned cargo ships for military purposes. Jones Act mariners have six months of shore leave per year and crew a reserve fleet of government-owned cargo ships for military sealift purposes. The Jones Act crew consists of about 3,380 merchant mariners, which is 29% of the total mariner pool needed for the reserve fleet. The remaining mariners come from the U.S.-flag privately owned international fleet enrolled in the Maritime Security Program. The government-owned reserve fleet relies on Jones Act mariners and commercial mariners from the Maritime Security Program and Military Sealift Command. While there is enough commercial mariner capacity for a 180-day surge, a longer sealift effort would face a shortage of about 1,800 mariners. MARAD estimates a shortfall of about 1,800 mariners for a prolonged sealift effort lasting more than 180 days. This shortage has been a consistent issue for decades, even when the mariner pool was larger in the past. For example, in 2004, TRANSCOM found a similar shortage when the mariner pool was 16,900 for 59 ships in the RRF. The Department of Defense Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) found a shortage of mariners in 2004 when the mariner pool was 16,900 for 59 ships in the RRF. In 1991, the mariner pool was 25,000 for 96 ships, indicating a consistent issue with mariner shortages even in the past. The Jones Act's maritime policy aimed for a commercial fleet capable of providing sealift during wartime, but additional military sealift fleets have since been established. The Jones Act aimed for a commercial fleet capable of providing sealift during wartime, but additional military sealift fleets have been established, including the RRF, MSC, and MSP. The RRF consists of 46 ships with a skeleton crew of about 600 mariners, requiring an additional 1,200 mariners once activated. The Military Sealift Command (MSC) fleet, controlled by TRANSCOM, consists of 46 ships with a skeleton crew of 600 commercial mariners. An additional 1,200 mariners would be needed to sustain operations once activated. MSC ships are mostly crewed by civilian mariners who are federal employees. The Maritime Security Program (MSP) ships, established by Congress in 1996, receive an operating subsidy of $5 million per vessel per year and heavily rely on government cargoes. The MSP ships, established by Congress in 1996, receive a $5 million operating subsidy per vessel per year to cover the cost of American crews and rely on government cargoes. MARAD advocates for the U.S. maritime industry, ensuring military utilization of MSP ships before MSC ships. Jones Act operators must use U.S.-built ships, while the military sealift fleet mainly consists of more economical foreign-built ships. The military prioritizes using MSP ships over MSC ships, which are more cost-effective foreign-built vessels. There is a suggestion to require domestically built sealift fleet to share the higher cost nationally, making coastwise ships more price-competitive. To provide oceangoing shipbuilding capability, a domestically built sealift fleet could be required, with the higher cost shared nationally. Lower-cost coastwise ships would compete with other transportation methods, increasing the mariner pool and repair work for U.S. shipyards. The sealift ships could be designed to military specifications for flexibility and avoid conflicts with commercial needs. The military seeks cargo ships with flexible capabilities, including ramps or onboard cranes for unloading cargo at underdeveloped ports. The majority of the military sealift fleet consists of product tankers, Ro/Ro ships for tanks and trucks, and container ships for ammunition and supplies. The military sealift fleet consists of product tankers, Ro/Ro ships for tanks and trucks, and container ships for ammunition and supplies. The military's preference for versatility conflicts with the commercial fleet's trend towards specialized and larger ships driven by cost efficiency. General cargo and break-bulk ships with onboard cranes have been replaced by container ships without cranes, impacting commercial mariners. The trend towards specialized and larger ships driven by cost efficiency has replaced general cargo and break-bulk ships with onboard cranes with container ships without cranes. Commercial mariners may lack experience operating cargo cranes in foreign ports. The largest container ships require more depth than many ports can provide. Ro/Ro ships have been replaced by \"pure car carriers\" that maximize passenger car capacity. The largest container ships need more depth than many ports can offer. Cost pressures have led to engines that prioritize fuel efficiency over speed, which is a drawback for military sealift ships. Stricter sulfur emission regulations have pushed operators to switch to LNG-fueled engines or install scrubbers, impacting cargo space and lacking military utility. The shift to LNG-fueled engines or scrubbers due to stricter sulfur emission regulations impacts cargo space and lacks military utility. There is a growing disparity between military vessel designs and commercial carriers, as well as crew skill sets. The Jones Act contributes to military sealift by preserving a shipyard industrial base with the knowledge and skills to build and repair ships. The Merchant Marine Act of 1970 aims to maintain a shipyard industrial base with the expertise to construct and repair ships, despite U.S. shipyards building few oceangoing vessels annually without achieving economies of scale. The U.S. shipyards typically build only two or three oceangoing ships per year, with gaps between orders. One shipyard reported low employment and no vessels under construction as of March 31, 2019. Another shipyard relies heavily on Navy orders, while smaller vessels like tour boats, ferries, and barges are built by a larger number of shipyards. The shipyards building smaller vessels lack dry docks of sufficient size to repair large ships, leading to delays in servicing the government-owned sealift fleet. The fleet is aging, with many vessels in need of repair, but there is an insufficient number of large dry docks available. The government-owned sealift fleet, averaging 44 years old, requires repairs due to a lack of large dry docks. Some vessels have failed safety inspections and are not seaworthy, with one ship even developing a hole in its hull during a readiness exercise. The Navy's plan to revitalize the reserve fleet involves building new vessels, extending the service life of current ships, and repairing them in domestic shipyards. The Navy's plan to recapitalize the reserve fleet includes building new vessels, repairing ships to extend their service life, and purchasing used foreign-built ships due to cost and time constraints. Repairing vessels has been more expensive and time-consuming than projected, prompting consideration of accelerating the purchase of foreign-built ships. The Navy is considering accelerating the purchase of used, foreign-built ships due to cost and time constraints, as building new ships in U.S. yards is significantly more expensive. The Tariff Act of 1930 imposes a 50% duty on nonemergency repairs on U.S. flag ships done in foreign shipyards to support U.S. shipyards, but many U.S.-flag international trading ships still opt for foreign repairs due to lower costs."
