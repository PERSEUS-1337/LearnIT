    "content": "This report analyzes forest management provisions in the 115th Congress compared to prior laws. Enacted through two legislative vehicles, the Stephen Sepp Wildfire Suppression Funding and Forest Management Activities Act and the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, both laws address forest management from three perspectives. The 2018 farm bill, signed into law on December 20, 2018, included provisions for forest management on federal lands. This report focuses on the changes to Forest Service management of federal forests. The 2018 farm bill included provisions for forest management on federal lands, focusing on changes to Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management management of their respective lands. The report provides background information on the National Forest System and BLM's public lands, as well as an overview of laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. The report discusses the management of federal lands by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, covering laws like the National Environmental Policy Act and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. It also analyzes provisions enacted by the 115th Congress affecting forest management activities and procedural requirements. The report summarizes provisions enacted by the 115th Congress affecting project planning, wildland fire management, forest management, and restoration programs for federal lands managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. It discusses relevant issues, changes made in the 115th Congress, and potential issues for Congress in each category. The report broadly discusses relevant issues, summarizes changes made in the 115th Congress related to forest management, and highlights potential issues for Congress. It includes in-depth coverage of some provisions, reflecting the complexity of the issue and congressional interest. The Appendix contains side-by-side tables comparing forest-related provisions in each law to prior law. Approximately 145 million acres of the 193-million-acre National Forest System consists of forests and woodlands. Congress directed specific actions regarding forestry assistance programs and research. Approximately 145 million acres of the 193-million-acre National Forest System consists of forests and woodlands. Congress directed management of national forests to protect watersheds, provide a continuous timber supply, and authorized the sale of trees. Official uses of national forests include recreation, livestock grazing, energy development, and wildlife protection. The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 expanded the official uses of national forests to include recreation, livestock grazing, energy and mineral development, and protection of wildlife and fish habitat. Management of resources is to be coordinated for multiple use and sustained yield, maintaining resource outputs without impairing them. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 requires the Forest Service to prepare comprehensive land and resource management plans for each National Forest System unit, with public involvement. Plans must comply with cross-cutting laws that apply broadly to all federal actions. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 mandates the development of forest plans for each NFS unit with public involvement. These plans must comply with cross-cutting laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. Forest plans outline desired resource conditions but do not authorize specific on-the-ground actions. Projects are the on-the-ground actions that implement the forest plan prepared for a National Forest System (NFS) unit. These projects, such as timber harvests and trail maintenance, must align with the resource objectives in the forest plans and follow FS procedures to ensure compliance with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. Projects must align with forest plan resource objectives and follow FS procedures to ensure compliance with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands, including 38 million acres of woodlands and forests, primarily in the western United States. BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands, including 38 million acres of woodlands and forests in the western United States. These lands are managed under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield, similar to the NFS. The 2.6 million acres of Oregon and California Railroad (O&C) Lands and Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) Lands in western Oregon are managed for permanent forest production under sustained yield principles. The 2.6 million acres of Oregon and California Railroad (O&C) Lands and Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) Lands in western Oregon are managed for permanent forest production under sustained yield principles, providing timber, protecting watersheds, offering recreational opportunities, and supporting local economies. FLPMA directs BLM to prepare and maintain resource management plans consistent with on-the-ground activities. FLPMA directs BLM to prepare and maintain resource management plans for Oregon and California Railroad (O&C) Lands and Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) Lands in western Oregon. Proposed activities must align with these plans and comply with laws such as NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. NEPA requires federal agencies to assess environmental impacts before final decisions are made. Compliance with NEPA depends on the proposal's impact level. NEPA mandates federal agencies to evaluate environmental impacts of proposed actions before final decisions are made. Compliance with NEPA varies based on the level of impacts, with significant impacts requiring an environmental impact statement (EIS) and uncertain impacts necessitating an environmental assessment (EA) or a finding of no significant impact (FONSI). An agency may prepare an environmental assessment (EA) to determine if an EIS is needed or issue a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) through a Decision Notice when impacts are uncertain. For actions requiring an EA or EIS, the agency evaluates impacts and alternatives, including taking no action. The analysis in the EIS or EA/FONSI informs the agency's decision-making process. Categorical exclusions (CEs) cover actions with no significant environmental effects. Categorical exclusions (CEs) are categories of actions that do not have a significant environmental impact and are excluded from the requirement to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or an Environmental Assessment (EA). These CEs are identified by agencies based on past experience and some are established in statute by Congress. Individual agencies may determine additional documentation needed for a CE. In its list of CEs, FS distinguishes between actions that generally do not require further documentation and those that require a decision memorandum as part of the administrative record supporting the decision to approve the proposal as a CE. Each federal agency has identified actions that require an EIS, an EA resulting in a FONSI, or can be approved as a CE in their agency-specific NEPA procedures. The federal agencies have identified actions that may require further analysis in an EA or EIS based on resource conditions termed extraordinary circumstances, such as flood plains, municipal watersheds, and endangered species habitats. The presence of extraordinary circumstances like flood plains, municipal watersheds, endangered species habitats, wilderness areas, roadless areas, and archaeological sites may require further analysis in an EA or EIS. Identifying potential environmental impacts under NEPA helps determine additional environmental requirements for a project. The NEPA process helps identify potential environmental impacts for a project, which can trigger additional environmental review and consultation requirements under laws like ESA and NHPA. Compliance with NEPA serves as an umbrella process for environmental requirements. The NEPA process identifies project impacts that may trigger additional environmental review and consultation requirements under laws like ESA and NHPA. Compliance with NEPA is essential for addressing environmental impacts and ensuring adherence to federal laws. HFRA aims to expedite planning for hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration projects on NFS and BLM lands to reduce wildfire risk. The Hazardous Fuel Reduction and Forest Restoration projects on NFS and BLM lands aim to reduce wildfire risk by removing biomass that fuels fires. HFRA allows expedited planning for specific projects covering up to 20 million acres of federal land. Relevant terms like At-Risk Community are defined under HFRA. The Hazardous Fuel Reduction and Forest Restoration projects on NFS and BLM lands aim to reduce wildfire risk by removing biomass that fuels fires. HFRA authorized an expedited planning and review process for projects covering up to 20 million acres of federal land, defining terms like At-Risk Community as areas prone to large-scale wildland fire disturbances. Authorized Hazardous Fuels Reduction Projects (HFRA Projects) involve methods such as prescribed fire, wildland fire use, and mechanical methods to reduce hazardous fuels. Fire Regimes and Condition Classes are terms used to describe historical frequency and intensity changes. Fire regimes and condition classes are terms used to describe the historical frequency and intensity of fire patterns across a landscape. They are used to prioritize and assess hazardous fuel reduction projects, including those in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) areas. The Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) is an area within or adjacent to an at-risk community with a community wildfire protection plan (CWPP) or within a specified distance to an at-risk community without a CWPP. HFRA projects can be conducted in the WUI, on specified areas within a municipal watershed with moderate or significant departure from historical fire regimes, on damaged land, or on lands with threatened and endangered species habitat threatened by wildfire. HFRA projects are allowed in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) and on lands with a departure from historical fire regimes, damaged land, or threatened species habitat. Projects must be consistent with the land management plan and cannot occur in designated wilderness areas. Certain projects must focus on thinning, prescribed fire, or other specified actions. HFRA projects must align with the land management plan and cannot take place in designated wilderness areas. Covered projects must focus on thinning, prescribed fire, or removing small trees to modify fire behavior, while maximizing large tree retention. FS established an objection process for proposed HFRA projects, requiring objections to be filed within 30 days of draft decision documents publication. The FS established an objection process for proposed HFRA projects, requiring objections to be filed within 30 days of draft decision documents publication. Objections are limited to parties that submitted specific comments during the comment periods and may only be on issues raised within those comments. If no comments were received on a project, no objections will be accepted. HFRA also set forth requirements for judicial review. The HFRA established an objection process for proposed projects, requiring objections to be filed within 30 days of draft decision documents publication. Objections are limited to parties that submitted specific comments during the comment periods and may only be on issues raised within those comments. If no comments were received on a project, no objections will be accepted. HFRA also set forth requirements for judicial review, allowing for judicial review in federal court if the objector is not satisfied with the agency's decision after the administrative review process. Only issues raised during the public comment period and administrative review may be considered during judicial proceedings. Congress directed FS to replace the post-decisional administrative appeals process with the pre-decisional objection process for all FS projects. The Chief of the Forest Service can declare a non-HFRA project an emergency and proceed directly to implementation. The Chief of the Forest Service may declare a non-HFRA project an emergency and proceed directly to implementation. The 2014 farm bill added a new Section 602 to HFRA, authorizing landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS. The Forest Service can designate insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS based on declining forest health, risk of tree mortality, or hazard trees. Approximately 74.5 million acres nationwide have been designated. The FS may prioritize projects to reduce risk, extent, or increase resilience. The Forest Service has designated approximately 74.5 million acres nationwide for insect and disease treatment areas to reduce risk and increase resilience. Projects initiated before the end of FY2018 are considered hazardous fuel reduction projects subject to HFRA regulations. Collaboration with state, local, and tribal governments is required for project development. Projects initiated before the end of FY2018 for hazardous fuel reduction are subject to HFRA regulations, including a collaborative process with state, local, and tribal governments, consideration of best available science, and retention of old-growth and large trees. Projects within the WUI require analysis of the proposed action and one action alternative, especially if within 1.5 miles of an at-risk community. Projects planned within the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) under HFRA regulations require analysis of the proposed action and one action alternative. If the proposed action is within 1.5 miles of an at-risk community, only analysis of the proposed action is needed. Outside of the WUI, the no-action alternative must also be considered. Congress authorized the Forest Service to designate eligible National Forest System (NFS) areas as Insect and Disease (I&D) areas, prioritize projects in those areas, and implement them through an expedited process. As of March 2019, the Forest Service has proposed 206 projects in 59 national forests and 18 states under the authority to designate NFS areas as I&D areas. 20 projects are being evaluated using EA analysis procedures, 3 using an EIS, and the remaining 183 using a CE. In some states, all eligible lands have been designated, making the expedited project planning procedures broadly available but nullifying any prioritization benefit. The Forest Service has proposed 206 projects in 59 national forests and 18 states under the authority to designate NFS areas as I&D areas. Of these, 20 projects are being evaluated using EA analysis procedures, 3 using an EIS, and the remaining 183 using a CE. The 2014 farm bill introduced a new Section 603 to HFRA, allowing certain projects to be categorically excluded from NEPA requirements, known as the Farm Bill CE. The 2018 Farm Bill added hazardous fuels projects as a priority project category eligible for implementation through the Farm Bill CE, exempt from pre-decisional administrative review objections. Projects must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements or consider the best available science to be eligible for the 2014 Farm Bill CE. The 2014 Farm Bill CE eligibility requirements include compliance with CFLRP or consideration of best available science, retention of old-growth trees, transparent collaborative process, and road decommissioning within three years. Maintenance of existing roads is allowed. Projects under the 2014 Farm Bill CE must be transparent, nonexclusive, and meet specific requirements. They cannot establish new permanent roads, but temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years. Maintenance and repairs of existing roads are allowed. Projects are limited to 3,000 acres and must be located within designated I&D areas or in specific fire regime groups. FS policy requires documenting decisions using a decision memorandum. The FS policy requires documenting decisions on proposals using the Farm Bill CE through a decision memorandum, after determining if resource conditions at the site result in any extraordinary circumstances. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill expanded HFRA authorities, including the definition of authorized fuel reduction projects to include fuel breaks. The FY2018 omnibus bill amended HFRA to include fuel breaks and fire breaks as authorized fuel reduction projects, expanding the planning and implementation requirements for both FS and BLM. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized procedures to expedite priority projects in Insect and Disease (I&D) areas, including projects to reduce hazardous fuels as a priority category. This allows for the planning and implementation of fuel or fire breaks using the Farm Bill CE within I&D areas. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized procedures to expedite priority projects in Insect and Disease (I&D) areas, including hazardous fuels reduction projects. The bill established new statutory CEs to expedite planning and implementation, such as a CE for wildfire resilience. The 2018 farm bill established new statutory CEs for wildfire resilience projects related to greater sage grouse or mule deer habitat, available to both FS and BLM. The potential impact of these new CEs on project planning and implementation is difficult to assess. The 2018 farm bill established new statutory CEs for wildfire resilience projects related to greater sage grouse or mule deer habitat, available to both FS and BLM. These CEs allow for larger projects (up to 3,000 to 4,500 acres) to be planned and implemented more efficiently, potentially helping achieve landscape-level goals. Using a CE for environmental review can expedite the process from planning to implementation. The 2018 farm bill established new statutory CEs for wildfire resilience projects related to greater sage grouse or mule deer habitat, allowing larger projects (up to 3,000 to 4,500 acres) to be planned and implemented more efficiently. Using a CE for environmental review can expedite the process from planning to implementation, improving agency efficiency. A 2014 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that FS took an average of 177 days to complete CEs, compared with 565 days for EAs in FY2012. In FY2012, FS took 177 days to complete CEs, compared to 565 days for EAs. A GAO report from FY2008 to FY2012 showed FS used CEs less frequently and took longer compared to other agencies. Concerns exist about conducting large projects without detailed environmental reviews. Section 202 of the FY2018 omnibus added a Wildfire Resilience CE to HFRA for hazardous fuel projects. The Wildfire Resilience CE, established under Section 605 of HFRA in the FY2018 omnibus, is similar to the Farm Bill CE and is for hazardous fuel reduction projects in designated areas on NFS lands. FS policy requires a decision memo to use the Farm Bill CE after assessing for significant environmental effects. Eligible projects must meet specific criteria. The decision to use the Farm Bill CE for eligible projects must comply with CFLRP requirements or prioritize the retention of old-growth trees for resiliency. Projects must follow a collaborative and transparent process, avoid new permanent roads, and decommission temporary roads within three years. Projects under the Farm Bill CE must prioritize resiliency, use best available science, and involve a collaborative and transparent process. They cannot establish new permanent roads, must decommission temporary roads within three years, and cannot exceed 3,000 acres. Projects located within the WUI are prioritized, but those outside may be considered if in specified fire regime groups. Maintenance and repairs of existing roads are allowed for project implementation. The law prioritizes projects in WUI areas but allows projects in Condition Class 2 or 3 in Fire Regime groups I, II, or III with high wildfire hazard potential. The Secretary must submit an annual report on authorized CEs to congressional committees and GAO. Seven projects were proposed in FY2018 under this authority. The Wildfire Resilience CE requires projects to meet location and purpose requirements similar to those under the 2014 Farm Bill CE. Projects must be in designated I&D areas and meet specified fire regime condition classes. Projects outside the WUI must also have very high wildfire hazard potential. Projects within the WUI have additional requirements. The Wildfire Resilience CE specifies projects in designated I&D areas must meet specified fire regime condition classes and very high wildfire hazard potential. Projects in the WUI are prioritized and must address hazardous fuels reduction, while the Farm Bill CE also covers insect and disease infestation projects. Congress directed FS to evaluate if extraordinary circumstances are present for the Wildfire Resilience CE. The Farm Bill CE is available for projects addressing insect and disease infestation. Congress directed FS to evaluate if extraordinary circumstances are present for the Wildfire Resilience CE, which includes projects in designated I&D areas meeting specified fire regime conditions and addressing hazardous fuels reduction in the WUI. The 2018 farm bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to establish a CE for projects to protect, restore, or improve greater sage-grouse and/or mule-deer habitat within one year of enactment. The projects must be located in a sagebrush steppe ecosystem for either species, or concurrently for both species if the project is in both mule deer and sage-grouse habitat. The 2018 farm bill directs the establishment of a CE for projects to protect, restore, or improve greater sage-grouse and/or mule-deer habitat within one year of enactment. Projects must be consistent with the existing resource management plan and comply with DOI Secretarial Order 3336. Specific activities may include removal of juniper trees, cheat grass, and other nonnative vegetation, targeted livestock grazing, and herbicide use. The law outlines specific activities for projects to protect sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat, including removing nonnative vegetation, targeted grazing, and herbicide use. Projects are restricted from certain areas and must not exceed 4,500 acres. Temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years. Projects must adhere to specific restrictions and prohibitions, such as no new permanent roads and a maximum size of 4,500 acres. Temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years. Projects on NFS lands are limited to designated I&D areas. Agencies must consider extraordinary circumstances and landscape-scale habitat projects when determining the use of the CE. The law directs agencies to consider efficacy of landscape-scale habitat projects, likelihood of population declines without vegetation management, and need for habitat restoration before using the CE. A 20-year monitoring plan is required. The CE has similarities to other CEs but differs in project purposes and requirements. The Endangered Species Act aims to conserve endangered species and their ecosystems. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to conserve endangered species and their ecosystems through a collaborative process. Species can be listed as endangered or threatened based on the risk of extinction. Administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the ESA covers terrestrial, freshwater, and certain marine species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) lists plants and animals as endangered or threatened based on extinction risk. Federal agencies must ensure their actions do not harm listed species. Federal agencies must consult with FWS or NMFS if their actions may harm endangered or threatened species or their critical habitat, known as a Section 7 consultation. This consultation is not required for actions dictated by statute, only discretionary ones. The Secretary issues a biological opinion (BiOp) specifying terms and conditions for federal actions to avoid harm to species or critical habitat. If the proposed action jeopardizes species or habitat, the Secretary must suggest reasonable alternatives. The Secretary issues a biological opinion with terms and conditions to avoid harm to species or critical habitat. If the proposed action jeopardizes species or habitat, reasonable alternatives must be suggested. Most consultations result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or offer alternatives to proceed. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to how Section 7 consultation requirements interact with land and resource management plans for NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands. The FY2018 omnibus enacted changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land and resource management plans in NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands in Oregon. It specifies that listing a species as threatened or endangered does not require consultation to update a forest plan unless it is older than 15 years. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for forest plans on NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands in Oregon. Consultation is not required to update a forest plan unless it is older than 15 years, controversially setting a new precedent for implementing the ESA. The FY2018 omnibus made controversial changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for forest plans on NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands in Oregon. Some argue that the changes set a new precedent for implementing the ESA by not requiring consultations for existing land management plans after critical habitat designation. Supporters believe the changes provide flexibility and consistency in implementing plans. The enacted changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for forest plans in Oregon aim to provide flexibility by not requiring consultations for existing plans after critical habitat designation. Supporters argue this allows for consistency and fewer delays in plan implementation. Opponents fear negative impacts on species if harmful activities are prescribed in plans without consultation. Critics of the changes to Section 7 consultation requirements in Oregon argue that not allowing for consultation or re-consultation for listed species and critical habitat changes could harm species and their habitat. They are concerned that the time lag before consultation is required may be long enough to negatively impact species. Proponents of the change argue that projects under a plan still undergo consultation, making plan consultation redundant. The federal government's wildland fire management responsibilities include various activities such as fuel reduction, prevention, detection, and suppression. Changes in funding for wildfire suppression were made in the FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill. Critics argue that plans at a higher level could impact the cumulative effect of projects, while proponents believe consultation for projects under a plan makes plan consultation redundant. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill changed how Congress appropriates funding for wildfire suppression, added requirements for wildfire risk mapping, and altered aspects of hazardous fuel reduction programs for FS and DOI. This included expediting priority projects in designated NFS areas. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill changed how Congress appropriates funding for wildfire suppression and altered aspects of hazardous fuel reduction programs for FS and DOI. This included expediting priority projects in designated NFS areas and expanding the definition of authorized fuel reduction projects. Funding for wildland fire management is provided through discretionary appropriations to both FS and DOI. Congress provides discretionary appropriations for wildland fire management to both FS and DOI through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. DOI allocates the funding to the Office of Wildland Fire and four agencies\u2014BLM, Bureau of Indian Affairs, National Park Service, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Funding is provided for the Suppression Operations program within FS's and DOI's Wildland Fire Management account, covering firefighter salaries, equipment, aviation operations, and incident support for wildfire response. Overall, funding is provided to the Suppression Operations program within the Wildland Fire Management account for the control of wildfires on federal land, including firefighter salaries, equipment, aviation operations, and incident support. If suppression funding is depleted, funds can be transferred from other accounts. Appropriations for wildland fire management have increased significantly since the 1990s. Overall, appropriations to FS and DOI for wildland fire management have increased considerably since the 1990s, with a significant portion of the increase related to rising suppression costs. This often leads to fire borrowing, as FS and DOI frequently require more suppression funds than are appropriated to them, prompting concerns about the impact on other agency programs. Congress has typically enacted supplemental funding in response to this issue. Wildfire suppression funds for FS and DOI often fall short, leading to fire borrowing and concerns about impacts on other agency programs. Congress has historically provided supplemental appropriations to address this issue, sometimes waiving procedural and budgetary controls for wildfire spending. The 115th Congress explored options to provide wildfire spending outside of these constraints. The 115th Congress established a new mechanism for wildfire suppression funding outside of budgetary constraints in the FY2018 omnibus. Discretionary spending is currently subject to statutory limits under the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Budget Control Act of 2011 imposes statutory limits on discretionary spending, with sequestration as enforcement for exceeding limits. Certain spending is exempt from limits under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. Certain spending, including wildfire suppression operations, is exempt from discretionary spending limits under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. This exemption was added in the FY2018 omnibus and will continue through FY2027. A new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations will be added to nondefense discretionary spending limits starting in FY2020 through FY2027. This adjustment applies to emergency aspects of wildland firefighting, emergency management activities, and repayment of necessary funds. It will be triggered for appropriations exceeding the 10-year average spending level for wildfire suppression operations calculated for FY2015. The new adjustment for wildfire suppression operations will be added to nondefense discretionary spending limits from FY2020 to FY2027. It applies to emergency aspects of wildland firefighting, management activities, and necessary fund repayment. The adjustment is triggered for appropriations exceeding the 10-year average spending level for wildfire suppression operations calculated for FY2015. The adjustment amount is capped each fiscal year, starting at $2.25 billion in FY2020 and increasing by $0.1 billion annually to reach $2.95 billion in FY2027. The adjustment for wildfire suppression operations will be added to nondefense discretionary spending limits from FY2020 to FY2027, capped at $2.95 billion in FY2027. Congress can appropriate funds for wildfire suppression above the FY2015 baseline without being subject to discretionary spending limits. In FY2020 and FY2021, Congress can appropriate funds for wildfire suppression operations above the FY2015 baseline, subject to discretionary limits. For example, in FY2020, Congress could allocate up to $3.64 billion for suppression operations, with $1.39 billion as the baseline. In FY2019, FS and DOI received a total of $2.05 billion for suppression purposes. The wildfire funding fix potentially allows for up to $3.64 billion in FY2020 for suppression operations, with $1.39 billion as the baseline. FS and DOI received $2.05 billion in FY2019 for suppression. The BCA statutory limits for discretionary spending are in effect until FY2021, potentially easing barriers for additional wildfire funds. The BCA statutory limits for discretionary spending are in effect until FY2021, potentially easing barriers for additional wildfire funds. However, it is uncertain if Congress will continue to provide fire borrowing authority once the wildfire adjustment takes effect in FY2020. The wildfire funding fix would provide fire borrowing authority to agencies starting in FY2020. Section 103 of the FY2018 omnibus requires prompt submission of a request for supplemental appropriations if wildfire suppression funds are estimated to be exhausted within 30 days, giving Congress notice of the need for additional funding. Additional action from Congress would be required to ensure agencies have access to funds for federal services in response to wildfires. The wildfire funding fix in FY2020 would require Congress to take additional action if suppression funds are depleted within 30 days. Concerns include lack of reporting on suppression obligations and accountability for spending. The FY2020 wildfire funding fix ties suppression spending to the FY2015 baseline without inflation adjustments, raising concerns about oversight and accountability. However, this fix is only a temporary procedural change and does not address key issues like improving cost forecasting or evaluating suppression methods. The Fire Modeling Institute developed a Wildfire Hazard Potential index to aid in strategic planning and fuel management decisions at a national scale. The index considers vegetation, fuels, wildfire likelihood, intensity, and past wildfire locations to assess the potential difficulty of suppressing a wildfire. The Wildfire Hazard Potential index aids in national planning and fuel management decisions by assessing the potential for difficult-to-suppress wildfires. Approximately 226 million acres in the US are classified as high or very high WHP, with 53% being federal land and the remaining 47% state, tribal, other public, or private lands. Approximately 226 million acres in the US have a high or very high Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP), with 53% federal land and 47% state, tribal, other public, or private lands. The WHP data, when combined with spatial data, can estimate wildfire risk to resources and assets. The FY2018 omnibus directs the Forest Service to pair WHP with spatial data for community use. The FY2018 omnibus directs the Forest Service to pair the Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) with appropriate spatial data for community use, to develop web-based wildfire hazard severity maps for at-risk communities adjacent to NFS lands or affected by wildland fire. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill require FS and BLM to submit reports to Congress on specified topics related to wildland fire management, with the first report due by December 30, 2021 if the wildfire funding fix is used. The omnibus bill requires reports on wildland fire management to be submitted to Congress by December 30, 2021 if the wildfire funding fix is utilized. The reports will detail the use of the funding fix and overall spending on wildland fire management. The report to be submitted to Congress by December 30, 2021 will detail the use of the wildfire funding fix and overall spending on wildland fire management. It will analyze fire size, costs, regional location, risk-based factors influencing suppression management decisions, and lessons learned from a statistically significant sample of large fires. The 2018 farm bill mandates a report to Congress on wildfire, insect infestation, and disease prevention on federal land. The report must analyze cost drivers, effectiveness of fuel treatments, and impact of investments in preparedness activities. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior are required to submit a report to Congress on wildfire, insect infestation, and disease prevention on federal land. The report must include information on the number of acres treated for prevention, areas categorized as high fire risk, and other relevant data. The first report is due within 180 days of the farm bill's enactment and annually thereafter. The agencies must report annually on federal land treatment for wildfire, insect infestation, and disease prevention, including high fire risk areas, wildfire impact, timber production, road maintenance needs, and other measures for land maintenance and improvement. Forest restoration activities aim to enhance resilience and resistance to disturbance events on federal land by establishing or reestablishing ecological processes and functioning. This includes measures to improve water quality and ecosystem function. Forest restoration aims to establish or reestablish ecological processes to enhance resilience and resistance to disturbance events on federal land. Activities may include thinning trees to reduce density and prescribed fires to mitigate wildfire intensity and facilitate post-fire recovery. Forest restoration on federal land involves activities like prescribed fire to reduce understory vegetation and biomass buildup, mitigate wildfire intensity, and aid post-fire recovery. BLM's authority for restoration projects comes from FLPMA, while FS's authority stems from responsibilities to protect the NFS and manage national forests for multiple use and sustained yield. The Organic Administration Act of 1897 mandates managing national forests for multiple use and sustained yield. Congress has authorized specific forest restoration programs for FS and BLM, including watershed condition framework and water source protection. The 115th Congress established new programs for FS and BLM, including watershed condition framework and water source protection. These programs allow partnerships with stakeholders for forest restoration and management activities as part of the \"Shared Stewardship\" approach. The FS and BLM partner with stakeholders for forest restoration and management activities under the \"Shared Stewardship\" approach to address land management concerns at a landscape-scale. These programs aim to accelerate forest restoration to mitigate insect infestations, reduce wildfire risks, and provide benefits to surrounding communities. Title IV of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 established the CFLRP to fund collaborative forest restoration programs that aim to mitigate insect infestations, reduce wildfire risks, and provide benefits to surrounding communities by supporting local industries and promoting new markets for restoration by-products. Stakeholders generally support these programs, although some have raised concerns about specific aspects. The CFLRP was established by the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 to fund collaborative forest restoration programs for priority forest landscapes. Collaboration must be inclusive and transparent, involving diverse stakeholders and meeting RAC requirements. Priority landscapes must be at least 50,000 acres of NFS lands in need of restoration. Priority forest landscapes for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) must be transparent, nonexclusive, and at least 50,000 acres in size. Proposals should focus on NFS lands in need of restoration, incorporate the best available science, and include projects for maintaining old-growth stands and reducing hazardous fuels. Access to wood-processing infrastructure is also important. Proposals for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program must focus on maintaining old-growth stands, reducing hazardous fuels, and avoiding new permanent roads. The Secretary of Agriculture can select and fund up to 10 proposals per fiscal year, with a requirement for annual accomplishments reports and 5-year status reports to specified congressional committees. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program allows the Secretary of Agriculture to select and fund up to 10 proposals per fiscal year, with 23 proposals funded since FY2010. Each proposal includes individual projects to achieve forest restoration goals over a specified time period. Up to 50% of project costs can be covered by a fund, with an annual authorization of up to $40 million. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program funds individual projects to achieve forest restoration goals over a specified time period. The program provides up to $4 million per year for project implementation, with a total annual appropriation of $40 million. The funding cannot be used for project planning costs. The program has been successful in making progress towards its goals. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program provides $40 million annually for project implementation, with a dedicated funding commitment that ensures long-term stability and predictability. While successful in achieving land management objectives and benefiting local economies, some may argue that resources are directed away from NFS lands not covered by selected projects. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program provides $40 million annually for project implementation, ensuring long-term stability and predictability. Some feel it falls short in fostering new markets for wood products or reducing treatment costs, despite improving relationships with stakeholders. Collaboration has focused on simple issues and not resolved more controversial ones. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, allocating up to $80 million annually through FY2023. The Secretary of Agriculture can extend funding for existing projects for up to 10 years with a one-time waiver, as long as eligibility criteria are met. Collaboration has mainly focused on simple issues, with limited progress on more complex or controversial ones. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, allowing the Secretary of Agriculture to extend funding for existing projects for up to 10 years with a one-time waiver. The law also included the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture as recipients of program status reports. Reauthorization and extension of eligibility could lead to projects continuing beyond the initial timeframe, with potential for more projects to be selected and funded if Congress appropriates to the new authorization level. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, allowing funding for existing projects to be extended for up to 10 years with a one-time waiver. The program, initially a pilot in Colorado in 2001, is now available nationwide for NFS and BLM lands through good neighbor agreements. States can conduct restoration work on public lands under approved agreements. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, allowing funding for existing projects to be extended for up to 10 years with a one-time waiver. States can conduct restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands under approved agreements, including treating insect- and disease-infested trees, reducing hazardous fuels, and other activities to improve forest, rangeland, and watershed health. Prohibited treatments in designated wilderness areas. The 2014 farm bill authorized activities for forest and land health, such as wildlife projects and tree planting. Prohibited treatments in designated wilderness areas and did not include road construction. States can perform the work but must comply with federal laws. The 2014 farm bill authorized activities for forest and land health, such as wildlife projects and tree planting, with states allowed to perform the work while complying with federal laws. Special treatment is given for revenue from wood products on federal lands, with Master Agreements between states and FS or BLM outlining the scope of agreements. SPAs detail specific project terms and conditions, with FS executing 48 MAs and 105 SPAs in various states. The good neighbor authority serves as an umbrella for Supplemental Project Agreements (SPAs), outlining specific terms for project implementation. FS has executed 48 MAs and 105 SPAs in multiple states, covering 82 national forests. GNAs focus on specific project types like timber production, wildlife, hazardous fuels management, and other activities. It is perceived as successful in enhancing state-federal relationships and promoting cross-boundary cooperation. The good neighbor authority focuses on timber production, wildlife, hazardous fuels management, and other activities. It is seen as successful in enhancing state-federal relationships and leveraging state resources. Concerns exist about the sustainability of future GNA work. Changes were made to the authority in the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill made changes to the good neighbor authority, allowing for forest restoration activities on NFS roads and expanding availability to include Indian tribes and county governments. Funds received by a state through timber sales under a GNA can be retained and used by the state until FY2023. The 2018 farm bill expanded the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) to include federally recognized Indian tribes and county governments. Funds from timber sales under a GNA can be retained by the state until FY2023. Payments made by counties under a GNA project are not subject to revenue-sharing laws, potentially increasing cross-boundary restoration opportunities. The expansion of the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) to tribes and county governments has the potential to increase its use significantly, leading to more cross-boundary restoration work and leveraging nonfederal resources. However, this expansion may also increase administrative demands on agencies like FS or BLM, including contract administration and oversight of project implementation. Concerns also arise regarding the distribution of receipts from timber sales, with some preferring revenue-sharing with county governments for GNA projects. Stewardship contracting, established as a pilot program in 1999 and made permanent in 2014, allows FS and BLM to enter into multi-year contracts for land management goals. The 2014 farm bill made stewardship contracting authority permanent, allowing FS and BLM to enter into multi-year contracts combining timber sales and service activities to achieve land management goals. The 2014 farm bill made stewardship contracting authority permanent for FS and BLM, allowing them to combine timber sales and service activities to achieve land management goals such as improving forest health and reducing fire hazards. The 2014 farm bill made stewardship contracting authority permanent for FS and BLM, allowing them to combine timber sales and service activities to achieve land management goals such as improving forest health and reducing fire hazards. FS and BLM can deposit excess timber sale revenue in their Stewardship Contracting Fund for use on other stewardship projects without further appropriation. Contracts can be awarded on a best-value basis, considering past performance, proposal quality, and other factors. The 2014 farm bill made stewardship contracting authority permanent for FS and BLM, allowing them to combine timber sales and service activities to achieve land management goals. Contracts can be awarded on a best-value basis, considering past performance, proposal quality, and other factors. FS and BLM may give procurement preference for contractors using wood products innovatively. Annual reports on stewardship contracts are required. Stewardship contracting is viewed favorably, leading to increased restoration opportunities and economic benefits for stakeholders. Stewardship contracting, viewed favorably by stakeholders, offers increased restoration opportunities and economic benefits. Some concerns include the potential incentive to remove ecologically important trees for more service work. Some stakeholders argue for more certainty and market support in stewardship contracting. Concerns include the potential incentive to remove ecologically important trees for more service work, distribution of receipts, revenue-sharing requirements with county governments, up-front financial obligations, and slow implementation pace. The complexity of integrating the program makes initial assessment difficult. The initial implementation of stewardship contracting faced challenges due to integrating different contract types and poor record-keeping. Despite initial difficulties, agencies improved their contracting systems, increased annual contracts, and expanded coverage. However, a 2015 USDA OIG report highlighted issues with FS' contract administration and record-keeping for stewardship contracts. The 2015 USDA OIG report found issues with FS' contract administration and record-keeping for stewardship contracts, leading to new guidance in 2016 and changes in the FY2018 omnibus allowing 20-year stewardship contracts. The FY2018 omnibus authorized FS and BLM to enter into 20-year stewardship contracts in areas classified in Fire Regime Groups I, II, and III. The law also allowed a procurement preference for contractors promoting innovative use of forest products and included a cancellation ceiling for stewardship contracts. The law authorized FS and BLM to include a cancellation ceiling in stewardship contracts, allowing funds to be obligated in stages. Excess revenues can be used to cover liabilities from cancelled contracts. Congressional notification is required for contracts with a cancellation ceiling over $25 million without proposed funding. The law allows FS and BLM to include a cancellation ceiling in stewardship contracts, enabling funds to be obligated gradually. Congressional notification is necessary for contracts with a cancellation ceiling exceeding $25 million without proposed funding. This approach resolves concerns about upfront financial obligations and allows excess revenue to offset costs, providing market certainty for forest management. The use of 20-year stewardship contracts and procurement preference can increase market certainty for forest products industries and promote innovation in forest restoration. Protection of watersheds is a key goal of NFS programs, but inadequacies in FS's watershed programs were noted in a 2006 assessment report by OMB. The NFS aims to protect watersheds, which is a key goal of their programs. However, a 2006 assessment report by OMB highlighted deficiencies in FS's watershed programs, including lack of water quality data and inconsistent national prioritization. FS committed to improving by developing performance measures, enhancing data collection, and prioritizing watershed management on NFS lands. FS committed to improving their watershed programs by developing long-term performance measures, enhancing water quality data, and prioritizing watershed management on NFS lands. They developed a Watershed Condition Framework to classify and prioritize watersheds, leading to the development and implementation of restoration action plans to achieve program goals. The FS developed a Watershed Condition Framework to classify and prioritize watersheds on NFS lands, leading to the development of restoration action plans. In 2017, a USDA OIG report highlighted inadequacies in FS' management of the program, prompting the codification of the WCF program in the 2018 farm bill. The 2018 farm bill codified the Watershed Condition Framework program for NFS land, assigning specific responsibilities and priorities to the Secretary of Agriculture. The program allows the Forest Service to evaluate watershed conditions, establish assessment criteria, and identify up to five priority watersheds for restoration. The 2018 farm bill established the Watershed Condition Framework program for NFS land, allowing the Forest Service to evaluate and classify watershed conditions, identify priority watersheds for protection and restoration, and develop restoration action plans. The 2018 farm bill established the Watershed Condition Framework program for NFS land, allowing the Forest Service to prioritize protection and restoration activities on priority watersheds and achieve desired conditions. It also authorizes emergency designation for rehabilitation of watersheds impacted by wildfires. Water source protection is an authorized activity of many FS programs. The NFS allows for watershed protection, including water source protection, through authorized activities such as cooperative agreements for restoration and enhancement purposes with various entities. Federal funds may be used if deemed in the public interest, with costs shared with nonfederal partners. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing FS to enter into multi-year partnership agreements with nonfederal partners to protect and restore NFS watersheds serving as sources of municipal water. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, authorizing FS to enter into multi-year partnership agreements with nonfederal partners to protect and restore NFS watersheds that serve as sources of municipal water. FS may develop a water source management plan with nonfederal partners to carry out forest management activities for watershed protection and restoration. FS is authorized to conduct forest management activities to protect municipal water supplies and restore forest health. They can conduct a single environmental analysis for the development of water source management plans or individual projects. FS can accept cash, donations, and services from partners to implement the plans, with contributions matching federal funding, creating a Water Source Protection Fund. The law authorizes the use of federal funding and assistance from partners to implement water source management plans. A Water Source Protection Fund is established to match partner donations, with $10 million in annual appropriations authorized through FY2023. Various provisions in the FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill relate to federal forest land management, including designating NFS lands as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The 2018 farm bill included provisions for federal forest land management, such as designating NFS lands as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Section 8626 of the bill designated a new wilderness area and expanded existing areas in NFS lands in Tennessee, including the establishment of the Upper Bald River Wilderness on the Cherokee National Forest covering approximately 9,038 acres. The 2018 farm bill designated a new wilderness area and expanded five existing areas in NFS lands in Tennessee. The Upper Bald River Wilderness was established on the Cherokee National Forest, covering 9,038 acres. Additionally, over 10,500 acres were added to existing wilderness areas on the Cherokee National Forest. These areas are to be managed in accordance with the Wilderness Act, restricting commercial activities and motorized access. The 2018 farm bill designated new wilderness areas and expanded existing ones in NFS lands in Tennessee, including Wilderness, Little Frog Mountain, and Sampson Mountain. These areas are managed according to the Wilderness Act, prohibiting commercial activities and motorized access. Provisions in the FY2018 omnibus and farm bill changed how federal land is acquired, exchanged, or disposed of, establishing new programs and authorities. For example, the 2018 farm bill authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to lease up to 10 isolated areas. The 2018 farm bill and FY2018 omnibus provisions changed how federal land is acquired, exchanged, or disposed of. For example, the farm bill established a program for leasing isolated parcels for administrative sites, while the omnibus reauthorized a program for selling or exchanging BLM lands for administrative purposes. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the Forest Service Facility Realignment and Enhancement program, allowing for the conveyance of administrative sites or undeveloped parcels of NFS land. Additionally, the bill modified the Small Tracts Act by expanding eligibility requirements and included other provisions. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the Forest Service Facility Realignment and Enhancement program, expanding eligibility requirements and authorizing exchanges or sales for specific parcels and entities. The bill also allowed the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to issue rights-of-way for BLM and NFS lands. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for BLM and NFS lands, allowing specific use for various purposes including water infrastructure and transportation systems. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for BLM and NFS lands for various types of infrastructure and systems. Cost-recovery fees are charged for processing and monitoring applications, as well as an annual land use rental fee. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for infrastructure on BLM and NFS lands. Cost-recovery fees are charged for processing applications and monitoring activities, along with an annual land use rental fee based on land value and communication use type. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for infrastructure on BLM and NFS lands, with cost-recovery fees for processing applications and monitoring activities. There are rental fee schedules based on land value for linear ROWs and communication sites. The 115th Congress directed FS to update their process and fee schedule for communication sites and established new regulations for activities within electricity ROWs. The 115th Congress directed FS and BLM to issue new regulations for activities within electricity ROWs and utility ROWs to address concerns about wildfire ignitions. Power line ignitions are associated with fires that spread due to weather conditions causing vegetation to come into contact with power lines. The 115th Congress directed FS and BLM to issue new regulations for activities within electricity transmission and distribution ROWs to address concerns about wildfire ignitions. Some believe confusing administrative processes hinder ROW permit-holders from conducting necessary maintenance activities to mitigate fire risks. Others place more responsibility on permit holders. The 115th Congress directed FS and BLM to issue new regulations for activities within electricity transmission and distribution ROWs to address concerns about wildfire ignitions. Some believe administrative processes hinder permit holders from mitigating fire risks, while others place more responsibility on them. Provisions aim to improve processes for obtaining approvals and implementing vegetation management projects on federal lands, but concerns remain about balancing project implementation speed with accountability and adherence to federal land laws. Some provisions specify responsibilities for wildfire suppression costs within ROWs. Some provisions specify responsibilities for wildfire suppression costs within electricity transmission and distribution ROWs on federal lands, with concerns about the balance between project implementation speed and accountability. Others worry about the potential implications of limiting damages and liability for ROW permit holders. Some argue that limiting damages and liability for ROW permit holders could prompt agency action on maintenance requests and prevent passing unexpected costs to ratepayers. Section 8705 of the 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of... Section 8705 of the 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to issue regulations revising the process for special use authorizations on NFS lands for communications uses, with a focus on streamlining, standardizing, and considering applications on a competitively neutral basis. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to revise the process for special use authorizations on NFS lands for communications uses. The law specified that the new process must be streamlined, uniform, and standardized, applications must be considered on a competitively neutral basis, and lease terms must be for a minimum of 15 years. Regulations must establish a fee structure based on processing costs, with fees deposited into a new Treasury account for managing communication sites. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to revise the process for special use authorizations on NFS lands for communications uses, establishing a fee structure based on processing costs and creating a new Treasury account for managing communication sites. This includes activities such as needs assessments, programmatic analyses, developing management plans, training, and improving access to communication sites. The FY2018 omnibus amended FLPMA to establish new guidelines for vegetation management, facility inspections, and maintenance on federal land with electric transmission facilities. The law directed FS and BLM to issue guidance for these activities within ROWs, outlining review and approval processes. The law directed FS and BLM to issue guidance for vegetation management, facility inspections, and maintenance activities within electric transmission and distribution ROWs. It outlines the process for reviewing, approving, and modifying plans submitted by ROW permit holders. Owners can develop and submit plans for approval to conduct activities within their ROW. The law authorizes owners to develop and submit plans for approval by the Secretary for activities within their ROW. It also allows certain management activities without approval in specific circumstances. FS and BLM are directed to identify NEPA categorical exclusions. Training programs are encouraged for FS and BLM. The law directs the Secretaries to propose regulations for NEPA categorical exclusions within one year and finalize them within two years. It also encourages training programs for vegetation management and electrical systems. The FY2018 omnibus specifies ROW permit holder liabilities related to vegetation management activities. The 2018 farm bill established a pilot program related to vegetation management activities in the ROW, limiting liability for damages or injury to $500,000 for activities conducted by a ROW holder under certain conditions. FS and BLM must report on the impacts of the liability clauses to Congress within four years of enactment. The 2018 farm bill established a pilot program for utility ROW permit holders on NFS land, allowing them to develop vegetation management plans with FS approval. The program excludes national grasslands and land utilization projects and sets specific requirements. FS and BLM must report on the impacts of liability clauses to Congress within four years of enactment. The pilot program allows utility ROW permit holders to develop vegetation management plans for NFS lands within their ROWs, subject to FS approval. Participants can also pay for and perform projects on specified NFS lands within 75 feet from the ROW, adhering to FS and state regulations. Participants are responsible for project costs, with the possibility of FS contributing funds at their discretion. Participants in the pilot program on NFS lands must follow FS and state regulations for fire prevention and vegetation removal. They are responsible for project costs, but FS may contribute funds. The Secretary of Agriculture can retain funds provided by participants for the pilot program. FS must report program status to Congress every two years. Participants must reimburse FS for wildfire costs. The law requires participants in the pilot program on NFS lands to follow fire prevention regulations and reimburse FS for wildfire costs caused by their operations. FS must report program status to Congress every two years. The pilot program on NFS lands requires participants to follow fire prevention regulations and reimburse FS for wildfire costs caused by their operations. The program limits reimbursement costs to $500,000 in certain circumstances and differs from the FY2018 omnibus program specific to electricity ROWs. The FS pilot program under the 2018 farm bill applies to electricity, natural gas, and related infrastructure. The FY2018 omnibus program for electricity ROWs differs from the FS pilot program under the 2018 farm bill, which also includes natural gas and related infrastructure. The farm bill pilot limits participant responsibilities to wildfire and vegetation management, while the omnibus program caps liability costs for participants. Counties with NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands receive payments based on prior year revenue, with an optional payment system authorized by SRS as an alternative to revenue-sharing payments. The SRS authorized optional payments to counties with NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands based on revenue generated in the prior year. Payments were determined by a formula considering historic revenue, land acreage, and county per capita income. Title I FS payments were designated for education and roads, while Title II payments were retained by the agency for projects. Title I FS payments were allocated for education and roads, while Title II payments were retained by the agency for projects on the lands. Title III payments were designated for county programs such as fire prevention, county planning, and emergency services. Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) were established to provide advice and recommendations to the agencies. Title II of the law established Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) to improve collaborative relationships and provide advice to agencies. RACs consist of 15 members representing various interests, including outdoor recreation, timber industry, environmental organizations, and local elected officials. The authorized payment level for SRS payments was set at 95% of the previous year's payment level. The authorized payment level for Secure Rural Schools (SRS) payments was set at 95% of the previous year's level. SRS payments were extended multiple times until FY2016, after which counties received lower revenue-sharing payments when SRS payments were not authorized. The Secure Rural Schools (SRS) payments were last authorized in FY2016. Counties received lower revenue-sharing payments in FY2017. The FY2018 omnibus reauthorized SRS payments for FY2017 and FY2018. The reauthorization set the FY2017 payment level at 95% of the last authorized payment. The reauthorization of Secure Rural Schools (SRS) payments in FY2018 and FY2019 included changes in payment allocation and expanded uses for Title III funds. The reauthorization expired at the end of FY2018. The reauthorization of Secure Rural Schools (SRS) payments in FY2018 and FY2019 included changes in payment allocation and expanded uses for Title III funds. The reauthorization expired at the end of FY2018, with additional changes enacted in the 2018 farm bill despite the law's expiration. The 2018 farm bill made changes to the RAC membership requirements and established a pilot program for the Secretary to appoint RAC members in Montana and Arizona. The Tribal Forest Protection Act authorized agreements with Indian tribes for forest projects on Indian trust or restricted lands. The Tribal Forest Protection Act (TFPA) allows the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to collaborate with federally recognized Indian tribes for forest projects on Indian trust or restricted lands, as well as adjacent NFS and BLM lands. Projects aim to address forest restoration needs, fire threats, or other risks to tribal lands or communities, considering unique tribal factors. Evaluation is based on a \"best value basis\" and specific tribally related criteria. The Tribal Forest Protection Act (TFPA) allows collaboration between the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of the Interior, and federally recognized Indian tribes for forest projects on Indian trust or restricted lands. Projects address forest restoration needs, fire threats, or other risks to tribal lands, considering unique tribal factors. The 2018 farm bill extended the good neighbor authority to tribes and authorized the Secretary to evaluate tribe requests on a \"best value basis\" in relation to tribally related factors. The 2018 farm bill extended the good neighbor authority to tribes and authorized self-determination contracts with federally recognized tribes for specified federal Indian programs. These contracts allow tribes to perform administrative functions on NFS land, with the Secretary of Agriculture carrying out delegated responsibilities. The 2018 farm bill extended the good neighbor authority to tribes and authorized self-determination contracts with federally recognized tribes for specified federal Indian programs. These contracts allow tribes to perform administrative functions on NFS land, with the Secretary of Agriculture carrying out delegated responsibilities. Congress may consider oversight of the agencies' implementation of the new laws and implications of changes in forestry provisions enacted by the 115th Congress. The 115th Congress enacted forestry provisions related to oversight of agencies' implementation of new laws. Congress may be interested in how these changes address concerns with federal forest management, such as the backlog of restoration treatments on NFS lands. The Forest Service reports around 52-58 million acres at high risk, with only 2-6 million acres treated annually, potentially taking 9-29 years to eliminate the backlog. The Forest Service reports a backlog of restoration treatments on NFS lands, with around 52-58 million acres at high risk of infestation. They accomplish 2-6 million acres of treatments annually, potentially taking 9-29 years to eliminate the backlog. Hazardous fuels are accumulating three times faster than the rate of treatment, prompting FS to propose increasing the scale and scope of forest management projects for restoration treatments. Administrative process barriers are identified as impeding progress towards these restoration efforts. FS has proposed increasing the scale and implementation of forest management projects, specifically for forest restoration treatments. Administrative process barriers, including agency decision-making processes related to NEPA, are identified as hindering progress towards these restoration goals. The public challenges agency decisions, hindering forest projects. Implementation issues like NEPA delays planning. Administrative barriers, like funding and training, also slow down project planning. Provisions by the 115th Congress aim to improve agency efficiencies. Barriers such as inadequate funding and training hinder agency implementation of project planning requirements. Provisions by the 115th Congress aim to expedite planning and review processes for projects like hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration. Expanding the use of Healthy Forests Restoration Act authorities and NEPA Categorical Exclusions could speed up project implementation for FS and BLM. Expanding the use of Healthy Forests Restoration Act authorities and NEPA Categorical Exclusions could expedite project implementation for FS and BLM, but some stakeholders are concerned about changes to decision-making processes and potential environmental impacts. The legal framework for federal forest management is being criticized for limiting citizen participation and potentially worsening environmental impacts. Concerns about forest health and fuel levels have been ongoing for decades, with recommendations made in the past to invest more in reducing hazardous fuels in high-risk ecosystems. In 1988, wildfire levels were raised in Yellowstone National Park. The National Commission on Wildfire Disasters recommended investing more in reducing hazardous fuels in high-risk ecosystems. Recommendations were made in 1995 to increase hazardous fuel treatments to 3 million acres per year by 2005. In 1999, the GAO recommended developing a strategy to reduce fuels for forest health and wildfire risk mitigation. In 2006, the OIG raised concerns about the FS' hazardous fuels reduction program. In 2006, the OIG raised concerns about the FS' hazardous fuels reduction program and recommended developing guidance and controls for projects and funding. In 2016, a report assessed FS' progress in implementing recommendations from 2006, highlighting issues with prioritizing, tracking, and reporting on hazardous fuels reduction projects. The 2016 OIG report assessed FS' progress in implementing recommendations from the 2006 report, identifying ongoing issues with prioritizing, tracking, and reporting on hazardous fuels reduction projects. Concerns about project implementation have persisted, with a significant percentage of fuel reduction decisions being appealed in various fiscal years. Approximately 24% of fuel reduction decisions signed in FY2001 and FY2002 were appealed, while 20% of fuel management projects in FY2006 through FY2008 were challenged. Academic studies show that complex projects are more likely to be challenged, along with factors like timber harvests and public involvement. HFRA, passed in 2003, addressed these issues. Despite provisions in the HFRA to expedite hazardous fuels reduction projects, the number of NFS areas needing treatment has continued to rise. This suggests that the streamlined decision-making approach of the HFRA may not have been successful and calls for a broader approach. The HFRA approach to expedite hazardous fuels reduction projects has not been successful as the number of NFS areas needing treatment continues to increase. Some suggest a broader application of the HFRA approach, as seen in legislation enacted during the 115th Congress. Side-by-side comparisons of forest-related provisions in the FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill to prior laws are provided in tables. The forest-related provisions in the FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill are compared to prior laws, excluding provisions that do not directly impact forest management."
