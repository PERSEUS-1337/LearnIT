    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commission on Probabilistic Methods Act\". The Congress recognizes the wide applicability of probabilistic methods in improving efficiency and reducing overdesign in government programs. Integration of these methods in business practices has saved billions for companies, but Federal use lags behind industry. Probabilistic methods offer better understanding of safety and environmental risks, leading to more business-friendly outcomes. Federal use of probabilistic methods is less advanced than in industry, but they hold promise for better understanding of safety and environmental risks. Proper application can lead to more business-friendly regulations and reduce overdesign costs. Integrating these methods in federally funded design efforts could improve product specifications and reduce associated costs. Appropriate use within Department of Transportation programs could lead to significant benefits. The appropriate use of probabilistic methods within Department of Transportation programs could lead to more reliable and cost-effective components in the transportation system, benefiting various federal agencies. The Administrator of the Research and Special Programs Administration shall establish the Commission on Probabilistic Methods to improve transportation system reliability and cost-effectiveness for federal agencies. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will identify how these methods can benefit the Department of Transportation, assess their potential for maximizing ROI and enhancing public safety, evaluate the technology, recommend practical techniques, and create models for quantifying uncertainties in major programs. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend guidelines for practical use, establish models for quantifying uncertainties in Department of Transportation programs, identify key technology areas for development, recommend implementation guidelines for probabilistic technology, suggest reliability levels for public safety, recommend probabilistic-based safety test guidelines, and advise on creating required databases. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend reliability levels for public safety, probabilistic-based safety test guidelines, guidelines for creating required databases, means of expediting technology transfer, and identifying legal and cultural barriers to the effective use of probabilistic methods at the Department of Transportation. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend methods for decision-making involving funds at the Department of Transportation, identify barriers to effective use of probabilistic methods, make recommendations for their use in programs, institutionalize values, and suggest pilot projects for technology evaluation. SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP. The Commission shall consist of 19 members including a chairperson from an engineering society, four members from higher education, four members from government, four members from industry, one member each from labor, environmental community, and public interest, and a representative from the Department of Defense appointed by the Secretary of Defense. The Commission consists of 19 members, including representatives from various sectors such as labor, environmental community, public interest, Department of Defense, Department of Commerce, and National Institutes of Health. Members are appointed by the Administrator and serve specific terms. The Commission consists of 19 members appointed by the Administrator, with members serving for the life of the Commission. Members serve without pay but receive travel expenses. A quorum is constituted by 10 members. The Commission consists of 19 members appointed by the Administrator, serving without pay but receiving travel expenses. A quorum is 10 members, with the initial meeting to occur within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Within 6 months of the initial meeting, the Commission must provide a written agenda for its activities to the Administrator. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT. The Commission consists of 19 members appointed by the Administrator, serving without pay but receiving travel expenses. A quorum is 10 members, with the initial meeting to occur within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Within 6 months of the initial meeting, the Commission must provide a written agenda for its activities to the Administrator. The Department of Transportation will provide administrative support to the Commission as needed. The Commission can hire experts and consultants for temporary services. It can also obtain necessary information directly from US departments or agencies and use the United States mails. The Commission can request information from US departments or agencies and use the United States mails as needed. The Commission will provide an interim report to the Administrator within 2 years of its initial meeting and a final report within 36 months. The final report will include findings, conclusions, and recommendations. The Commission will terminate after submitting the final report. SEC. 8. TERMINATION.\n\nThe Commission will terminate 10 days after submitting its final report. Section 14(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act will not apply to the Commission.\n\nSEC. 9. BUDGET ACT COMPLIANCE.\n\nSpending authority authorized by this Act will be effective only as provided in appropriation Acts."
