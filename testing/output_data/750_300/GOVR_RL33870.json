The President requested $324.2 million for FY2008, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. For FY2007, the President requested $216.0 million for national programs only, not including state grants. For FY2007, the President requested $216.0 million for national programs under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $526.0 million, including $310 million for state grants, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million, also including $310 million for state grants. Congress appropriated $568.8 million for the program in FY2006. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, including $310 million for state grants. The program continues to operate at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution through February 15, 2007. This report discusses the 107th Congress SDFSCA reauthorization and appropriations for the program. The 107th Congress SDFSCA reauthorization and appropriations fund the SDFSC program, a federal initiative to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. State grants are awarded to SEAs, LEAs, and outlying areas in all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico under the No Child Left Behind Act. The 107th Congress SDFSCA reauthorization and appropriations fund the SDFSC program, a major initiative to prevent drug abuse and violence in schools. State grants are awarded to SEAs, LEAs, and outlying areas in all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico, with funds also going to the Governor for creating programs to deter youth from drug use and violence in schools. National programs are supported through discretionary funds for projects aimed at preventing drug abuse and violence across all educational levels. For FY2002, $650 million was authorized for state grants and national leadership projects to prevent drug abuse and violence across all educational levels. 1% or $4.75 million is reserved for Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; 1% or $4.75 million is reserved for programs for Indian youth; and 0.2% is reserved for programs for native Hawaiians. For FY2002, $650 million was authorized for state grants and national leadership projects to prevent drug abuse and violence across all educational levels. Funds are reserved for Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, programs for Indian youth, and programs for native Hawaiians. The remaining funds are distributed to states, DC, and Puerto Rico based on population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. No state receives less than 0.5% of the total allotted or the amount received in FY2001. If total appropriations are less than FY2001 levels, adjustments are made. The state grants for the preceding fiscal year are distributed based on population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. Each state receives no less than 0.5% of the total allotted amount or the funding received in FY2001. If total appropriations are below the FY2001 level, each state receives an equal proportional share of its FY2006 grant. Funds may be redistributed if a state cannot utilize them within two years. Additionally, a 10% increase in national program funds is contingent on a 10% increase in state grant funding. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act included a limitation on increasing funds for national programs unless state grant funding increased by at least 10% from the previous fiscal year. The limitation provision was negated for FY2006, but since the national programs appropriation was less than FY2005, the limitation did not apply. For FY2007, the Administration did not propose funding for state grants, so the limitation provision was not relevant. 20% of the total state allotment goes to other states if funds cannot be used within two years. For FY2007, the Administration did not propose funding for state grants, so the limitation provision was not relevant. 20% of the total state allotment goes to the Governor for competitive grants and contracts. The Governor can use up to 3% for administrative costs. An SEA must distribute at least 93% of its allotment to LEAs for drug and violence prevention programs. 60% of these funds are based on LEAs' ESEA Title I amounts. In FY2002, SEAs may use up to 3% of funds for administrative costs. LEAs must distribute at least 93% of their allotment for drug and violence prevention programs, with 60% based on ESEA Title I amounts and 40% on school enrollments. LEAs can use up to 2% of state funds for administrative costs. In FY2002, SEAs could use up to 3% of their allotments for administrative costs. Additionally, they could use 1% of their allotment to implement a uniform management information and reporting system (UMIRS) to collect data on truancy rates, violence, and drug-related crimes in schools. SEAs may use up to 5% of funds for state activities such as capacity building, technical assistance, training, evaluation, and program improvement services. The state grants component of the SDFSC program was rated \"ineffective\" by the Administration's PART instrument in 2002 and 2006 due to a lack of demonstrated program effectiveness. The state grants component of the SDFSC program was rated \"ineffective\" by the Administration's PART instrument in 2002 and 2006. The program provided funding to approximately 64% of LEAs, but the funds were deemed too small to support quality interventions. The state grants program did not have a track record of producing measurable results. The state grants program under the SDFSC was found to be ineffective by the Administration's PART instrument due to funding constraints and lack of measurable outcomes. As a result, the program was proposed to be terminated in order to prioritize higher-impact national programs. The Administration's PART instrument found the state grants program under the SDFSC to be ineffective due to funding constraints and lack of measurable outcomes. As a result, the program was proposed to be terminated to prioritize higher-impact national programs that could provide direct support to select LEAs in sufficient funding amounts potentially making a difference in drug and violence prevention efforts. The Department of Education plans to use national survey data to assess the effectiveness of state grants for drug and violence prevention programs. The Department of Education will use national survey data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System to evaluate the impact of state grants for drug and violence prevention programs. This evaluation includes measuring the effectiveness of interventions and providing grants and technical assistance to improve data collection and program outcomes. Funding is authorized for national programs from FY2002 to FY2007. The Department of Education will use national survey data to evaluate state grants for drug and violence prevention programs. Funding for national programs is authorized from FY2002 to FY2007 to improve data collection and program outcomes. The ED Secretary can consult with other agencies to administer programs aimed at preventing violence and illegal drug use among students. Up to $2 million may be reserved for evaluating the national impact of the SDFSC program. The Attorney General administers programs to prevent violence and drug use among students. Up to $2 million may be reserved for evaluating the national impact of the SDFSC program. The National Coordinator Initiative allows LEAs to recruit, hire, and train coordinators for middle schools. Middle school students are targeted for drug prevention efforts. The SDFSC program allowed LEAs to hire and train coordinators for middle schools to prevent drug use and violence among students. Funding for the initiative was terminated in FY2004. National program funds could be allocated to states based on school-aged population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. Funding for the SDFSC program was terminated in FY2004. National program funds may be allocated to states based on school-aged population and ESEA Title I, Part A concentration grants. Competitive grants may be awarded to LEAs for developing programs to reduce alcohol abuse in secondary schools. Grants may be awarded to LEAs and community-based groups for mentoring programs in middle schools to assist children in transitioning to secondary school. Other initiatives include grants for reducing alcohol abuse in secondary schools. The ED Secretary can make grants to assist localities affected by hate crimes and establish a School Security Technology and Resource Center at Sandia National Laboratories. The Attorney General will administer resources for LEAs to assess and improve school security, including technology evaluation and implementation. A National Center for School and Youth Safety will be created to provide emergency assistance, establish a student hotline for reporting violent behavior, and offer consultation on school safety. The SDFSC program, jointly created by the ED Secretary and the Attorney General, provides emergency assistance to local communities in response to school safety crises. It establishes an anonymous student hotline for reporting possible violent behavior, offers consultation on school safety, compiles information on best practices for violence prevention, and provides outreach to rural and impoverished communities. For FY2008, the President requested $324.2 million for the program, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. The President requested $324.2 million for the SDFSC program in FY2008, with $100 million for state grants and $224.2 million for national programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $526.0 million, including $310 million for state grants and $216.0 million for national programs. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million for the program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $492.5 million for the SDFSC program, with $310 million for state grants and $182.5 million for national programs. This is $276.5 million more than requested but $76.3 million less than the FY2006 appropriation. For FY2006, the President requested $317.3 million for the SDFS program, but Congress appropriated $568.8 million, including $346.5 million for state grants and $222.3 million for national programs. The Administration cited fiscal constraints for not requesting state grant funding and deemed the state grants component ineffective. In FY2007, the President requested $216.0 million for national programs, $6.3 million less than the previous year. For FY2008, funding for the mentoring program was not requested. For FY2007, the President requested $19 million for the mentoring program as it was the final year of a two-year phase-out. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended the requested amount. Congress had appropriated $49.3 million for FY2006 as requested by the President. The Administration requested $19 million for the mentoring program in FY2007, which was the final year of a two-year phase-out. Congress appropriated $49.3 million for mentoring in FY2006, with a slight reduction due to budget cuts. Funding for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction program was not requested by the Administration from FY2005 to FY2008, but Congress allocated $32.7 million for it in FY2005 and FY2006. The Administration did not request funding for the Alcohol Abuse Reduction (AAR) program from FY2005 through FY2008, as it was considered duplicative of other activities. Congress allocated $32.7 million for AAR in FY2005 and FY2006, with slight reductions in funding due to budget cuts. In FY2007, the House Appropriations Committee did not recommend funding for AAR, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $32.4 million, the same as the previous year. The program continued to operate at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $32.4 million for the AAR program, the same as the previous year. The SDFSC program operates at FY2006 levels under a continuing resolution through February 15, 2007. The Gun-Free Schools Act is now part of the SDFSCA program, requiring LEAs to expel students bringing weapons to school. The Gun-Free Schools Act is now part of the SDFSCA program, requiring LEAs to expel students bringing weapons to school, with the option for modification on a case-by-case basis. States must have laws in place for this provision, but can still provide educational services to expelled students in alternative settings. LEAs receiving assistance through GFSA funds must comply with expulsion requirements and provide details on the circumstances leading to expulsions. Each LEA receiving GFSA funds must comply with expulsion requirements for students bringing weapons to school. They must report details annually to the ED Secretary, including the school's name, number of students expelled, and type of firearms involved. LEAs must have a policy to report students with weapons to the justice system. GFSA does not apply to lawfully stored firearms in locked vehicles. LEAs receiving GFSA funds must report students bringing weapons to school to the criminal justice system. Exceptions include lawfully stored firearms in locked vehicles or for approved activities. Bills related to school safety during the 109th Congress mostly died except for H.R. 3010. During the 109th Congress, bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced, but most died except for H.R. 3010. This bill, the Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2006, included an amendment requiring a study on the effectiveness of violence prevention programs funded under SDFSCA, but it did not become law. During the 109th Congress, bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced, but most died except for H.R. 3010. This bill included an amendment for a study on the effectiveness of violence prevention programs funded under SDFSCA, but it did not become law. Other measures introduced included bills for bullying and gang prevention, bullying and harassment prevention programs, school violence prevention, and student and teacher safety. During the 109th Congress, bills related to school safety and violence prevention were introduced, including H.R. 283, H.R. 284, H.R. 3655, H.R. 5295, S. 1974, and S. 4028. H.R. 283, the Bullying and Gang Prevention for School Safety and Crime Reduction Act of 2005, aimed to amend SDFSCA to cover bullying. The Prevention for School Safety and Crime Reduction Act of 2005 (H.R. 283) introduced by Representative Sanchez aimed to cover bullying and gang prevention, drug and violence prevention. It would have amended the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to create accountability-based programs for enhancing school safety. H.R. 284, introduced by Representative Shimkus, was also related to school safety. H.R. 284, introduced by Representative Shimkus, aimed to include bullying and harassment prevention programs under the definition of violence in the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. The School Violence Prevention Act of 2005 (H.R. 3655) and the Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006 (H.R. 5295) aimed to address bullying and harassment by including them under the definition of violence and implementing prevention programs. The Student and Teacher Safety Act of 2006 (H.R. 5295) introduced guidelines for state and local prevention programs, requiring LEAs to have policies allowing teachers to search students under reasonable suspicion. The act was passed by the House and referred to the Senate HELP Committee. The Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005 (S. 1974) introduced by Senator Bill Nelson required LEAs to have policies allowing teachers to search students under reasonable suspicion for weapons, drugs, or dangerous materials on school property. Non-compliance would result in denial of SDFSCA funds after FY2008. The Drug Free Varsity Sports Act of 2005 (S. 1974) required LEAs to comply with policies allowing teachers to search students for weapons, drugs, or dangerous materials on school property to receive SDFSCA funds. The Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006 (S. 4028) aimed to reauthorize SDFSCA and increase state grants authorization levels. The Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006 (S. 4028) aimed to reauthorize SDFSCA, increase state grants authorization levels, allocate funds for national programs, and require LEAs to hire gang prevention and drug prevention coordinators. The Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006 aimed to reauthorize SDFSCA, increase state grants authorization levels, allocate funds for national programs, and require LEAs to hire gang prevention and drug prevention coordinators. Additionally, the bill would have reserved $50 million for mentoring program grants, prioritizing elementary and middle school children in rural and high crime areas, troubled homes, or schools with violence problems. The Fighting Gangs and Empowering Youth Act of 2006 aimed to reauthorize SDFSCA and allocate funds for national programs. The bill would have added an Anti-Gang Discretionary Grant, reserving $50 million for nonprofit groups to create programs combating gang activity in schools and communities, with priority given to programs targeting teens in high-crime areas. The Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act (SAVE Act) introduced in the 110th Congress aims to assist public schools in combating gang activity in high-crime communities. Priority is given to programs targeting teens in areas with above-average crime rates. The SAVE Act, introduced by Representative McCarthy in 2007, would allow students in unsafe school environments to transfer to a safe public school within the same district or a private charter school. Counseling or removal of offenders would be options under the bill. The SAVE Act, introduced by Representative McCarthy in 2007, aims to allow students in unsafe school environments to transfer to a safe public school within the same district or a private charter school. The bill also includes options for counseling or removal of offenders. H.R. 354, a proposed legislation, differs from current law by not using the term \"persistently dangerous\" and ensures that students who become victims of violent crimes can attend a safe school. H.R. 354 allows students in unsafe school environments to attend a safe public school within the same district or a public charter school. It does not use the term \"persistently dangerous\" and ensures students can transfer if they become victims of violent crimes on school grounds, while riding a school bus, or attending a school function. Counseling or removal of offenders is also provided as an option. In anticipation of reauthorization in the 110th Congress, H.R. 354 was referred to the House Education and Labor Committee. The Administration recommends restructuring the SDFSC program to focus on creating safe, drug-free school environments and consolidating national programs into a flexible grant program with priorities on managing emergencies and violence. The Administration proposes consolidating the SDFSC national programs into one flexible grant program focusing on creating safe, drug-free school environments. The program would prioritize managing emergencies, violence prevention, character education, and improving the learning environment for high academic standards. Congress may also consider requiring schools to report school crime data. Congress may consider requiring K-12 schools to report up-to-date school crime data to law enforcement agencies, as there is currently no federal mandate for this. Existing data on school crime is based on self-reported surveys and academic studies, not actual incidents reported to law enforcement. DOJ's expertise in public safety could be valuable in addressing this issue. The Department of Justice (DOJ) may be better suited to handle school safety and crime data collection instead of the Department of Education (ED) due to DOJ's expertise in public safety and crime analysis. DOJ maintains the Uniform Crime Reporting System and has the necessary experience for this task. The effectiveness of state grant programs managed by ED was questioned in a PART assessment due to a lack of evidence showing their impact. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is suggested to take the lead in school safety and crime data collection, as they have expertise in this area. The effectiveness of state grant programs managed by the Department of Education (ED) was questioned in a PART assessment. One suggestion is to restructure the responsibility for the state grant program, with ED focusing on certain areas like drug and alcohol prevention, while school safety programs could be under DOJ. The Department of Justice (DOJ) may oversee school safety, security, and emergency preparedness programs, while drug and alcohol prevention programs could remain under the Department of Education (ED) in collaboration with public health experts at HHS. Legislation could allow K-12 schools to apply for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding for increased security measures against potential terrorist attacks. K-12 schools may apply for DHS funding for security and emergency preparedness against terrorist attacks. There are concerns about unintended consequences of the Unsafe School Choice provision in the ESEA. State education officials may face pressure to define persistently dangerous schools in a way that local schools never meet the criteria, leading to potential underreporting of school crime and violence due to political and administrative implications. Legal concerns may also arise as definitions of \"persistently dangerous\" vary between states. Some school officials may underreport school crime and violence to avoid being labeled as persistently dangerous, impacting their ability to receive funding for violence prevention grants. The 'persistently dangerous' component of NCLB lacks funding to help schools improve safety programs. The lack of corroborating data hinders schools from qualifying for grants. The 'persistently dangerous' component of NCLB lacks funding to improve school safety programs, while federal and state budgets cut school safety funds."
