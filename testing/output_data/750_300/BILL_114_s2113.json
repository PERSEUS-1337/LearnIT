    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Act of 2015\". Congress acknowledges the importance of crowdsourcing and citizen science. Congress recognizes the benefits of using incentive prizes and challenges, such as paying only for success, setting ambitious goals without predicting the outcome, involving a broader group of people, and bringing diverse perspectives to problem-solving. The benefits of using incentive prizes and challenges include paying only for success, setting ambitious goals, involving a broader group of people, and bringing diverse perspectives to problem-solving. Granting Federal agencies the authority to use crowdsourcing and citizen science will remove ambiguity, encourage their appropriate use, and increase cost-effectiveness. Granting Federal agencies the authority to use crowdsourcing and citizen science will remove ambiguity, encourage appropriate use, and stimulate broader public participation in the innovation process. Crowdsourcing projects offer unique benefits, such as improving government service delivery with lower resource investments. The benefits of using crowdsourcing and citizen science for Federal agencies include improving service delivery with lower resource investments, connecting citizens to agency missions, and acquiring data at a greater geographic extent and frequency than conventional methods. Citizen science benefits include advancing scientific research through group discovery and diverse perspectives. It enables citizens to gather, analyze, and share data to address community concerns. Citizen science has additional benefits such as accelerating scientific research, improving science literacy, furthering science diplomacy, and building trust and understanding. Citizen science accelerates scientific research, improves science literacy, furthers science diplomacy, and builds trust and understanding. Federal agencies should provide incentives to engage and retain participants in crowdsourcing and citizen science projects. Federal agencies should consider meaningful incentives to engage and retain participants in crowdsourcing and citizen science projects, such as receiving attribution, learning new skills, connecting with others, and contributing to solving meaningful problems. Engaging participants in crowdsourcing and citizen science projects can be incentivized by receiving attribution, learning new skills, connecting with others, and contributing to solving meaningful problems for the benefit of society. Crowdsourcing and citizen science are encouraged through various incentives like attribution, skill development, networking, and addressing significant societal issues. Citizen science is a form of open collaboration where individuals or organizations participate in various scientific processes, including formulating research questions, project design, conducting experiments, data collection and analysis, interpreting results, developing technologies, making discoveries, and solving problems. Citizen science involves individuals or organizations participating in scientific processes such as collecting and analyzing data, interpreting results, developing technologies, making discoveries, and solving problems. Crowdsourcing is a method to obtain services, ideas, or content by soliciting voluntary contributions from a group, especially online. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and \"Federal agency\" refers to a government agency. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and \"Federal agency\" excludes legislative branch agencies. The term \"participant\" refers to individuals or entities volunteering in crowdsourcing projects. A \"related entity\" includes Federal Government contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, users, customers, and cooperating parties. The term \"related entity\" encompasses Federal Government contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, users, customers, cooperating parties, grantees, investigators, fellows, and detailees of a Federal agency. Federal agencies are authorized to use crowdsourcing and citizen science approaches to further their missions. Federal agencies, or multiple agencies working together, can use crowdsourcing and citizen science to advance their missions. The head of a Federal agency can accept voluntary services from participants under this section. Under title 31, United States Code, a Federal agency head can accept voluntary services from participants for crowdsourcing or citizen science projects, as long as the services are uncompensated and do not displace any government employees. Federal agency heads can accept voluntary services for crowdsourcing or citizen science projects as long as participants are not financially compensated and will not displace government employees. Participation in these projects must be promoted to encourage broad involvement, and agencies can determine the level of consent required from participants. Each Federal agency can determine the level of consent, registration, or acknowledgment required from participants in crowdsourcing or citizen science projects. Disclosures regarding privacy, intellectual property, and data ownership must be made during the consent process. In seeking consent for projects, a Federal agency must disclose privacy, intellectual property, data ownership, compensation, and other terms clearly to participants. Consent can be obtained electronically or in writing for volunteer service terms in crowdsourcing projects. Federal agencies can obtain consent electronically or in written form from participants for crowdsourcing or citizen science projects. Projects involving human subjects must adhere to regulations, and agencies should strive to make data available while ensuring security and privacy. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must comply with regulations outlined in part 46 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations. They should aim to make data collected from these projects open and available to the public in machine-readable formats. Participants must be informed of how the data will be used and whether the agency will retain ownership of it. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must inform participants about the expected uses of the data, ownership retention, data availability for public use, and participant authorization to publish data. Additionally, agencies should strive to make technologies and applications accessible despite Federal Government intellectual property rights. Federal agencies conducting crowdsourcing or citizen science projects must inform participants about data usage, ownership, availability, and publication authorization. Technologies and applications developed through such projects should be made open to the public, and participants must agree to assume risks and waive claims against the Federal Government. Participants in citizen science projects must agree to assume risks and waive claims against the Federal Government, except for claims based on willful misconduct. Federal agencies coordinating these projects must prioritize scientific integrity. Participants in citizen science projects must agree to assume risks and waive claims against the Federal Government, except for claims based on willful misconduct. Federal agencies coordinating these projects must prioritize scientific integrity and ensure participants adhere to relevant policies. Federal agencies engaged in crowdsourcing or citizen science may partner with private sector entities to share administrative duties. Federal agencies can partner with private sector entities, state, tribal, local, or foreign government agencies to share administrative duties for crowdsourcing and citizen science activities. Funding can come from Congress appropriations or external sources.
