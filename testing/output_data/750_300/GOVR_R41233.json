    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from discretionary appropriations provided by Congress. Programs focus on housing issues for low-income households, including rental assistance for the poor, elderly, and disabled. Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance are the main programs. HOME and Community Development Block Grants are flexible block grant programs. HUD's funding primarily comes from discretionary appropriations by Congress. The department's main programs focus on housing assistance for low-income households, including the elderly and disabled. Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance account for a significant portion of funding. Additionally, HOME and Community Development Block Grants support various housing and community development activities for low-income families. Other specialized grant programs address the needs of homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers and developers of multifamily rental buildings. HUD's grant programs assist communities in meeting the needs of homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages for lower-income home buyers and developers of affordable rental buildings. Surplus funds from FHA are used to support the insurance fund and offset administrative costs, with excess funds sometimes used to supplement the HUD budget. Emergency supplemental funding has also been provided to the HUD budget, with nearly $20 billion allocated for recovery assistance to communities affected by disasters. In recent years, HUD's budget has received significant emergency supplemental funding, including over $20 billion for recovery assistance after Hurricane Katrina. The economic stimulus legislation provided over $13 billion to HUD's programs. Regular funding for HUD has increased by 57% in the past nine years. Table 1 shows HUD's total enacted appropriations over the past five years, with a 57% increase in regular funding in the past nine years. The growth rate has been increasing in recent years, with year-over-year increases of 5% or more, peaking at nearly 12% in FY2010. Adjusting for inflation, the real funding growth has been less robust. HUD's budget has seen year-over-year increases of 5% or more, reaching nearly 10% in FY2009 and almost 12% in FY2010. Adjusting for inflation, the real funding growth has been less robust, with a 17% increase over a nine-year period. Most of the growth occurred in the last two years, with various components making up HUD's annual funding. HUD's funding growth has been significant in the last two years, with various components making up HUD's annual funding, including regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets. Funding for HUD's programs and activities primarily comes from regular annual appropriations, also known as discretionary appropriations, which determine the amount obligated and spent each year. Congress may also provide emergency appropriations in response to disasters. Congress determines funding for HUD's programs through annual appropriations acts, with additional emergency appropriations provided in response to disasters. These emergency funds are separate from regular appropriations and are subject to limits on new discretionary funding. Congress may adjust regular appropriations to stay within these limits. Congressional appropriators must adhere to limits on new non-emergency discretionary funding by either reducing regular annual appropriations or finding offsets. HUD's regular annual appropriations are partially offset through rescissions and offsetting receipts from fees paid by partners or clients. The total net budget authority for HUD is determined by new appropriations and offsets from rescissions, receipts, and collections. This net budget authority is the \"cost\" of the HUD budget estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. It is important for federal budgeting but may not accurately reflect the funding for HUD's programs and activities. The net budget authority for HUD is determined by new appropriations and offsets, not necessarily reflecting the actual funding for programs. Net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased 57% between FY2002 and FY2010, from over $29 billion to over $46 billion, masking important trends. The net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased 57% between FY2002 and FY2010, from over $29 billion to over $46 billion. However, this increase is not solely due to increased appropriations for HUD programs. Regular annual appropriations grew by only 37% during this period. The net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased by 57% from FY2002 to FY2010, reaching over $46 billion. This growth was partially due to a 37% increase in regular annual appropriations, while offsetting receipts and collections decreased by more than 70% and rescissions by 96%. During FY2002-FY2010, the net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased by 57%, with a 37% growth in regular appropriations. The growth in appropriations was mainly due to the expansion of HUD's Section 8 voucher and project-based rental assistance programs, which saw a 70% increase in funding. During FY2002-FY2010, appropriations for Section 8 programs grew by over 70%, accounting for about 57% of HUD's regular appropriations in FY2010. Funding for other HUD programs also began to grow in FY2009 and FY2010. Offset receipts declined by more than 70% during this period. In FY2002-FY2010, Section 8 funding increased by over 70%, becoming a significant portion of HUD's regular appropriations in FY2010. Other HUD programs also saw growth in funding during FY2009 and FY2010. The decline in offsetting receipts, mainly from FHA mortgage insurance programs, was over 70%, dropping from over $3 billion in FY2004 to under $0.5 billion in FY2010. The annual appropriations process typically starts with the President's budget request in the prior fiscal year. The HUD appropriations have decreased significantly from over $3 billion in FY2004 to under $0.5 billion in FY2010. The annual appropriations process begins with the President's budget request, followed by hearings and crafting of legislation by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Legislation must be enacted before September 30 to avoid a government funding lapse. The appropriations process starts with the President's budget request and ends with legislation enacted before September 30 to avoid a government funding lapse. In cases where Congress doesn't finish appropriations by the fiscal year end, short-term continuing resolutions are enacted to maintain funding at prior levels. The FY2011 appropriations process lasted over a year, ending with P.L. 112-10 signed into law on April 15, 2011. The FY2011 appropriations process for HUD began with the President's budget release on February 1, 2010, and ended with P.L. 112-10 signed into law on April 15, 2011. It spanned two calendar years and two Congresses, with the President's budget requesting about $45.6 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a 1% decrease from FY2010. The President's FY2011 budget request for HUD, released in February 2010, requested $45.6 billion in net new budget authority, a 1% decrease from FY2010. This decrease would actually result in a 3% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. The budget proposed offsetting the increase with a substantial rise in offsetting collections and receipts from changes to FHA mortgage insurance programs. The President's budget requested funding increases for Section 8 programs, homeless programs, and HUD's research needs, while decreasing funding for programs for the elderly, persons with disabilities, and public housing repairs. No new funding was requested for other programs. The President's budget requested decreased funding for programs for the elderly, persons with disabilities, and public housing repairs, while no new funding was requested for the brownfields redevelopment program. The FY2011 HUD funding bill approved by the House would have provided about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President, resulting in a 1% increase in net new budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs in aggregate. The House-approved FY2011 HUD funding bill provided about $1 billion more than the President's request, rejecting proposed cuts to housing programs for the elderly, persons with disabilities, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. It also rejected funding for initiatives like Choice Neighborhoods and Transforming Rental Assistance, but was not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a FY2011 HUD funding bill that would have provided about $1 billion more for HUD than requested by the President. The bill also included a 1% increase in net new budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. It rejected the President's proposed cuts to housing programs. The Senate bill for FY2011 HUD funding included a 1% increase in budget authority and a 5% increase in appropriations for HUD programs. It rejected proposed cuts to housing programs for elderly and disabled individuals, public housing capital funding, and the brownfields program. The bill also provided funding for the President's Transforming Rental Assistance initiative and Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. However, the bill was not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress. The Senate committee bill for FY2011 HUD funding included funding for the President's Transforming Rental Assistance initiative and Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. The bill was not enacted before the end of the 111th Congress, leading to a series of continuing resolutions to maintain funding at FY2010 levels. The first continuing resolution for FY2011 budget lasted from October 1, 2010, until December 3, 2010. Subsequent CRs extended the original CR through December 18, 2010, and December 21, 2010. The last CR approved before the end of the 111th Congress was set to expire on March 4, 2011, leaving funding decisions for the remainder of FY2011 to the 112th Congress. This CR also extended funding for HUD programs and FHA mortgage limits through the end of FY2011. The previous continuing resolutions for FY2011 budget extended funding for HUD programs and FHA mortgage limits through the end of FY2011. The latest bill, H.R. 1, proposed funding many HUD accounts at FY2010 levels but with cuts, resulting in about $5 billion less in aggregate appropriations (11%) for HUD programs. H.R. 1 proposed funding HUD accounts at FY2010 levels with cuts, resulting in $5 billion less in aggregate appropriations (11%) for HUD programs compared to FY2010. The Senate failed to pass H.R. 1 and a Senate Amendment to H.R. 1, which would have increased funding for HUD by nearly $6 billion without rescinding any FY2010 funding. It would have reduced net budget authority from FY2010 by over $1 billion but increased aggregate appropriations by about $900 million. The Senate failed to pass H.R. 1 and a Senate Amendment to H.R. 1, which would have increased funding for HUD by nearly $6 billion without rescinding any FY2010 funding. It would have reduced net budget authority from FY2010 by over $1 billion but increased aggregate appropriations by about $900 million. The 112th Congress approved a short-term CR (H.J.Res. 44, P.L. 112-4) to fund the government through March 18, 2011, continuing funding for most accounts at FY2010 levels. The 112th Congress approved a short-term CR (H.J.Res. 44, P.L. 112-4) to fund the government through March 18, 2011. Funding for most accounts remained at FY2010 levels, but some accounts, including HUD's Community Development Fund, were reduced below FY2010 levels. The CDF was funded approximately $195 million lower than FY2010, equivalent to the amount previously allocated for congressional earmarks. The Community Development Fund (CDF) funding was reduced by approximately $195 million below the FY2010 level under H.J.Res. 44. This reduction was equivalent to the amount previously allocated for congressional earmarks. Congress then passed another short-term CR (H.J.Res. 48) which continued the funding reduction for the CDF. The short-term CR (H.J.Res. 48, P.L. 112-6) continued funding through April 8, 2011, maintaining most HUD accounts at FY2010 levels. However, funding for the CDF was reduced. Another short-term CR (P.L. 112-8) extended funding through April 15, 2011, with reductions in public housing operating funds and restrictions on CDF funds for earmarks. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 (P.L. 112-10) provided year-long FY2011 appropriations for various government agencies, including HUD. It funded some HUD programs at FY2010 levels, reduced funding for some programs, and increased funding for the two Section 8 programs. The Defense; Division B of the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011 provided year-long FY2011 appropriations for various government agencies, including HUD. It funded some HUD programs at FY2010 levels, reduced funding for some programs, and increased funding for the two Section 8 programs. The act also included an across-the-board 0.2% rescission from all non-defense discretionary accounts, including those in HUD's budget, resulting in an estimated $41.1 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a decrease of about 11% from the FY2010 enacted level. The requested decrease in net new budget authority for HUD would only represent a 4% decrease in appropriations for HUD programs in aggregate, due to an increase in offsetting collections and receipts from the FHA mortgage insurance programs. FHA insures mortgage loans made by private lenders to eligible borrowers, who pay upfront and monthly fees for the insurance, making mortgage credit more widely available. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgage loans for eligible borrowers, who pay upfront and monthly fees for the insurance. This helps make mortgage credit more widely available and at a lower cost. The FHA home loan insurance programs are administered through two program accounts in the HUD budget: the Mutual Mortgage Insurance/Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund account (MMI/CMHI) and the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance Fund account (GI/SRI). The Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund is the largest of the FHA insurance funds. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program into the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, creating two risk categories within the fund. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program into the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, establishing two risk categories: MMI Purchase and Refinance, and MMI HECM. The GI/SRI Fund provides insurance for riskier home mortgages, multifamily rental housing, and special-purpose loans. This section focuses on single-family loans insured under the MMI Fund. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) determines the cost of federal loan insurance based on the net present value of expected cash flows from insured loans. Cash inflows for the MMI Fund mainly come from insurance premiums paid by borrowers. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) calculates the cost of federal loan insurance by considering the net present value of expected cash flows from insured loans. Cash inflows for the MMI Fund primarily consist of insurance premiums paid by borrowers, while cash outflows mainly involve payments to lenders for loan defaults. The net value of these cash flows is expressed as a subsidy rate, which is a percentage of the volume of insured loans. If cash inflows exceed outflows, the subsidy rate is negative, reflecting net income from business activities shown as negative outlays in the budget. The subsidy rate is determined by comparing cash inflows and outflows from insured loans. It is expressed as a negative number if cash inflows exceed outflows and as a positive number if outflows exceed inflows. The subsidy rate is applied to the expected loan volume to calculate the credit subsidy needed for a federal credit program. Actual cash flows over the life of the loans may differ from projections. The budget rules require an appropriation of credit subsidy in the budget year that loans are originated. Agencies must periodically revise initial subsidy estimates based on actual loan experience. The MMI Fund historically has a negative subsidy rate, generating money for the government. The MMI Fund has historically had a negative subsidy rate, making money for the government by generating more fees than claims paid out. It does not typically require an appropriation from Congress to operate, although it does receive funding for administrative expenses. The fund is now divided into two risk categories: MMI Purchase and Refinance, and MMI HECM. The MMI Fund is divided into two risk categories: MMI Purchase and Refinance, and MMI HECM. The Purchase and Refinance category is estimated to have a negative subsidy rate of -2.59% for FY2011, generating about $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy. The Administration estimated that the Purchase and Refinance risk category of the MMI Fund would generate about $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy in FY2011, partly due to proposed FHA reforms. The Congressional Budget Office projected a smaller negative credit subsidy for this category. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the MMI Purchase and Refinance risk category would generate a smaller negative credit subsidy of around $1.9 billion, including $960 million without proposed changes and an additional $902 million with HUD-proposed reforms. Despite being lower than the Administration's projections, CBO still forecasted that this category of the MMI Fund would be profitable in FY2011. The CBO projected a smaller negative credit subsidy of around $1.9 billion for the MMI Purchase and Refinance risk category, including $960 million without proposed changes and an additional $902 million with HUD-proposed reforms. Despite differences with the Administration's projections, CBO still expected this category to be profitable in FY2011. The FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) was enacted in April 2011, leading to an upward revision of FHA's estimates for negative credit subsidy. This was mainly due to an increase in the annual premium charged by FHA starting in April 2011. The President's FY2012 budget request indicated that this premium change would result in a -3.92% subsidy rate for the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category for the remainder of FY2011, or a weighted average of -3.25% for FY2011 as a whole. The FY2011 appropriations law led to an increase in FHA's estimates for negative credit subsidy, with a -3.92% subsidy rate for the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category for FY2011. FHA's estimates of offsetting receipts for this category in FY2011 increased to nearly $10 billion by the time the FY2012 budget was released. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 moved the HECM program into the MMI fund, with a positive credit subsidy of 0.83% requiring a $250 million appropriation. HUD made changes in FY2010 to avoid a positive credit subsidy for the HECM program. In FY2011, HUD proposed changes to the HECM program to avoid a positive credit subsidy. This included increasing borrowers' annual insurance premiums and adjusting the formula for initial loan sizes to potentially eliminate the need for a subsidy. HUD proposed changes to the HECM program in FY2011 to avoid a positive credit subsidy by increasing borrowers' annual insurance premiums and adjusting the formula for initial loan sizes. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 would have provided less credit subsidies than the Administration's estimate for HECMs in FY2012. The final FY2012 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) directed HUD to make adjustments to the HECM program to achieve a zero credit subsidy. The demand for FHA-insured mortgages has been increasing due to tightening lending standards in the private market. FHA insured 18.7% of new single-family mortgages in FY2009, up from about 2% in FY2006, leading to higher mortgage insurance premiums paid into the MMI Fund. The demand for FHA-insured mortgages has been increasing in recent years, with FHA insuring 18.7% of new single-family mortgages in FY2009, up from about 2% in FY2006. The higher volume of mortgages insured by FHA has led to an increase in mortgage insurance premiums paid into the MMI Fund. Despite the average credit score on FHA-insured loans improving to the 690s, compared to the 650s in late 2007, the default rate on past FHA-insured loans is still rising, putting strain on the MMI Fund. The MMI Fund must maintain a capital reserve ratio of at least 2% as mandated by Congress in 1990. The ratio was only 0.53% in FY2009, the first time it fell below the required level since the mandate was put into effect. During FY2009, FHA's capital reserve ratio fell to 0.53%, below the required 2%. To address concerns, FHA proposed changes to its single-family mortgage insurance programs, including increasing the annual mortgage insurance premium. Some changes can be implemented administratively, while others require congressional action. FHA has proposed changes to its single-family mortgage insurance programs, including increasing the annual mortgage insurance premium. Congress sets a statutory cap on the premium amounts that FHA can charge. FHA increased annual mortgage insurance premiums to 0.9% for loans with a loan-to-value ratio of 95% or higher, and 0.85% for loans below 95% starting October 4, 2010. On April 18, 2011, premiums were raised to 1.15% for downpayments of 5% or less, and 1.10% for downpayments greater than 5%. FHA increased annual insurance premiums to 1.15% for downpayments of 5% or less and 1.10% for downpayments greater than 5% on April 18, 2011. The upfront mortgage insurance premium was also raised to 2.25% for loans endorsed on or after April 5, 2010. FHA raised upfront premium to 2.25% for loans endorsed on or after April 5, 2010, and later lowered it to 1% for loans endorsed on or after October 1, 2010. FHA also increased annual insurance premiums and adjusted downpayment and credit score requirements. FHA proposed changes to downpayment and credit score requirements, with borrowers having credit scores between 500 and 579 needing a 10% downpayment, while those with scores of 580 or above would still require a 3.5% downpayment. Additionally, FHA suggested reducing the maximum limit on seller concessions from 6% to 3%. FHA proposed reducing seller concessions from 6% to 3% and increasing oversight of FHA-approved lenders. The FHA proposed changes in downpayment and credit score requirements in a notice published on July 15, 2010. They also plan to increase oversight and enforcement of FHA-approved lenders, with the need for Congress to grant additional enforcement authority. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 5072) aimed to give FHA the power to require lenders to indemnify FHA for claims on non-compliant mortgages and fraud cases. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 (H.R. 5072) aimed to give FHA broader authority to terminate lenders with high default rates and establish a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Risk Management and Regulatory Affairs. The FHA Reform Act of 2010 aimed to address high default rates by establishing a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Risk Management and Regulatory Affairs within FHA. It also proposed giving FHA the authority to contract with outside credit risk analysis sources and allocate appropriations for staff to review lender performance. HUD provides capital grants and rental assistance through the Section 202 and Section 811 programs to nonprofit developers for building or rehabilitating housing units for elderly and disabled residents. Supportive services are optional in Section 202 but mandatory in Section 811. Over 106,000 units of Section 202 housing have been funded by HUD capital grants. In the Section 202 program, property owners may provide supportive services to residents, while in the Section 811 program, supportive services are required. HUD has funded over 106,000 units of Section 202 housing and over 30,000 units of Section 811 housing. The President proposed no new funding for Section 202 or Section 811 housing in FY2011 to allow for program redesign. The President's proposal would result in reduced funding for the Section 202 and Section 811 programs, with Section 202 and related programs funded at $274 million compared to $825 million in FY2010, and Section 811 receiving $90 million compared to $300 million in FY2010. The House-passed appropriations bill (H.R. 5850) and the Senate committee-passed bill are also mentioned. The Living Conversion program would have been funded at $274 million in FY2011, compared to $825 million in FY2010. The Section 811 program would have received $90 million in FY2011, compared to $300 million in FY2010. Both the House-passed appropriations bill (H.R. 5850) and the Senate committee-passed bill (S. 3644) did not follow the President's recommendations to redesign the programs or stop producing new units. The proposed funding for Section 202 would have remained at $825 million, while H.R. 5850 would have provided $300 million for the Section 811 program and S. 3644 would have provided $200 million. In FY2011, H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed different funding levels for the Section 202 and Section 811 programs. H.R. 5850 allocated $300 million for Section 811, while S. 3644 allocated $200 million. The difference was due to the treatment of Section 811 vouchers, with both bills moving funding for voucher renewals to the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance account. In FY2010, $87 million of the Section 811 appropriation was allocated for voucher renewals, with nearly $114 million planned for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee report noted a $100 million funding decrease for the Section 811 account due to moving voucher renewals to the Section 8 account. Congress ultimately allocated $400 million for Section 202 and related programs and $150 million for the Section 811 program in FY2011. In FY2011, Congress allocated $150 million for the Section 811 program, with $67 million used for voucher renewals split between Section 811 and Section 8 tenant-based accounts. This is $20 million less than the previous year's allocation for Section 811 voucher renewals. In FY2011, $67 million was allocated for Section 811 voucher renewals, $20 million less than the previous year. Additionally, $89 million was provided for Service Coordinators and $39 million for the Assisted Living Conversion program within the Section 202 funds. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is the largest assistance program administered by HUD. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is funded through the tenant-based rental assistance account, which is the largest assistance program administered by HUD. The account funds annual renewal funding for almost 2.3 million vouchers used by families to subsidize housing and covers administrative costs for PHAs. Funding comes from current year appropriations and advance appropriations for the following fiscal year. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is funded through the tenant-based rental assistance account, which covers administrative costs for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) that administer the program. Funding comes from current year appropriations and advance appropriations for the following fiscal year. The level of funding for voucher renewals and allocation to PHAs has been a key debate in the HUD appropriations process since FY2004. The funding allocation for voucher renewals in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program has been a key debate in the HUD appropriations process. Questions revolve around the sufficiency of funding to cover all leased vouchers and whether it will be allocated efficiently to serve as many families as possible while controlling costs. Congress provided over $16 billion for voucher renewals in FY2010, directing HUD to allocate funds to PHAs based on their voucher costs and prior year utilization. In FY2010, Congress allocated over $16 billion for voucher renewals in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, aiming to allow PHAs to serve more families efficiently while controlling costs. HUD adjusted PHAs' prior year costs for inflation to determine funding eligibility, covering over 99% of PHAs' formula eligibility. However, in FY2009, PHAs were not fully utilizing their vouchers, with only about 94% under lease. In FY2010, Congress allocated over $16 billion for voucher renewals in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program. PHAs were not fully utilizing their vouchers in FY2009, with only about 94% under lease. As a result, PHAs were not provided enough funding in FY2010 to fund all of their vouchers, only those they had been using. The President's FY2011 budget requested about $17 billion in new budget authority for voucher renewals. The President's FY2011 budget requested about $17 billion in new budget authority for voucher renewals, with HUD estimating that it would be sufficient to fund about 95% of all vouchers in use. The funding allocation would be based on prior year costs and utilization, with the Secretary given the authority to reduce allocations to PHAs with unspent reserve funding and reallocate funding as needed. The budget requested funding allocation based on prior year costs and utilization, with the Secretary having the authority to adjust allocations for PHAs with unspent reserves. PHAs with low reserves could receive increased funding to serve more families. The President also requested Congress to lift the ban on \"over-leasing\" to facilitate additional increases in leasing. The President's budget requested Congress to lift the ban on \"over-leasing\" to increase leasing for PHAs, potentially serving more families. The budget amount requested may not be enough to fund all 2.3 million vouchers authorized by Congress. The House bill allocated $150 million less for renewals than the President's budget request. The House bill allocated $150 million less for renewals than the President's budget request, citing lower inflation estimates. The committee report stated that the funding in H.R. 5850 would be enough for the program's renewal needs and expressed support for funding all vouchers in use. The committee report on H.R. 5850 indicated that the allocated funding for renewals was lower than the President's budget request. Despite this, the committee believed the funding would meet the program's renewal needs and expressed support for funding all vouchers in use. The formula for renewal funding in H.R. 5850 closely followed the President's request but did not include the reallocation authority requested. The committee stated that major authorization changes for the program were needed, which fell outside the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee. The committee report on H.R. 5850 noted that the funding for renewals was lower than the President's request. The committee believed the funding would meet the program's needs but did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President. The bill aimed to change the funding formula to base PHA funding on prior calendar year spending, reflecting the program's cycle. S. 3644 would have funded renewals below the President's request, citing revised estimates of need. The Senate bill, S. 3644, aimed to fund renewals below the President's request, using revised estimates of need. It proposed allocating funding based on calendar year spending instead of fiscal year spending, similar to H.R. 5850. However, like the House bill, it did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President due to concerns about potential cost increases. The Senate bill, like the House bill, did not include the reallocation authority requested by the President, citing concerns about cost increases. The committee report also highlighted worries about cost management in the program and directed HUD to report back on plans for better financial monitoring of PHAs. Both H.R. 1 and the final FY2011 appropriations law did not change the funding allocation formula from FY2010, providing less for renewals than requested by the President but more than in FY2010. Neither H.R. 1 nor the final FY2011 appropriations law made changes to the funding allocation formula from FY2010. Both provided less for renewals than requested by the President, but more than in FY2010. The President's budget requested Congress to fund the renewal of mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities in the Section 8 account, with HUD requesting $114 million for this purpose in FY2011. Both the House and Senate bills proposed to adopt this request. HUD requested $114 million in FY2011 to renew mainstream vouchers for persons with disabilities in the Section 8 account. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) allocated less than requested for Section 811 renewals, directing funds to renew vouchers issued since 2007. Renewal funding for vouchers issued before FY2007 was provided in the Section 811 account. The appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) allocated less than requested for Section 811 renewals, directing funds to renew vouchers issued since 2007. Each PHA has a contract with HUD for authorized vouchers, totaling around 2.3 million allocated across PHAs. Congress may create additional vouchers, including replacement and new vouchers. In recent years, Congress has allocated additional vouchers for specific special populations or purposes, such as families in the child welfare system and homeless veterans. Incremental vouchers are provided for families being displaced from other HUD programs. For FY2011, the President's budget requested $85 million for new vouchers for supportive housing for families and individuals at risk of homelessness. The President's budget for FY2011 requested $85 million for new vouchers for supportive housing for families and individuals at risk of homelessness. The House bill from the 111th Congress included funding for the President's homelessness demonstration request, vouchers for homeless veterans, and assistance for families displaced by the 2005 hurricanes. The Senate bill from the 111th Congress also supported the President's homelessness demonstration. The Senate bill from the 111th Congress would have funded the President's homelessness demonstration, provided $75 million for VASH vouchers, $66 million for families displaced by hurricanes, and $16 million for the Family Unification Program (FUP). H.R. 1 included no funding for new incremental vouchers, but the final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) provided about $50 million for VASH vouchers. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) provided $50 million for VASH vouchers and $16 million for the Family Unification Program (FUP), which offers vouchers to families in the child welfare system. The project-based rental assistance account funds existing Section 8 contracts between HUD and property owners to subsidize low-income families' rent. HUD provides subsidies to private multifamily property owners to bridge the gap between low-income families' payments and agreed-upon rents. Contracts for this program, last entered into in the early 1980s, require new annual appropriations once they expire. As more contracts expire, more appropriations are needed to maintain the subsidies. In FY2011, the President requested over $9 billion for project-based rental assistance, a 10% increase from the previous year. HUD states that this funding should cover all contracts needing renewal and amendment funding. In FY2011, the President requested over $9 billion for project-based rental assistance, a 10% increase from the previous year. HUD's Congressional Budget Justifications indicate that an estimated $662 million would be needed to meet amendment needs. The account has been funded using current year and advance appropriations since FY2009, and the President requested this model to continue in FY2011. In FY2011, the President requested funding for project-based rental assistance, with an increase from the previous year. Both House and Senate bills proposed to adopt the President's funding level, but the final appropriations law provided less than requested. President Obama's budget requested $350 million. President Obama's FY2011 budget requested $350 million for a new \"Transforming Rental Assistance\" initiative to streamline HUD's rental assistance programs and increase residential mobility options for HUD-assisted tenants. The final FY2011 appropriations law provided just under $120 million less than the President's request. The President's budget requested funding for a new project-based rental assistance program to increase residential mobility options for HUD-assisted tenants. This new assistance would allow families to take their subsidies with them if they choose to move to a new unit of private market housing, similar to the Section 8 project-based voucher program. The President's budget proposed a new project-based rental assistance program to enhance residential mobility for HUD-assisted tenants. This assistance allows families in targeted properties to transfer their subsidies when moving to private market housing, similar to the Section 8 project-based voucher program. The goal is to transfer 300,000 units, including public housing properties owned by local PHAs without a Section 8 voucher program and properties owned by PHAs willing to combine administrative activities. The President's budget proposed a new project-based rental assistance program to transfer 300,000 units, including public housing properties owned by local PHAs without a Section 8 voucher program, properties owned by PHAs willing to combine administrative activities, and multifamily properties with old forms of rental assistance. HUD would select properties in the first and third categories, while properties in the second category would compete by submitting plans to HUD. The majority of the $300 million funding requested would be used for this program. The proposed new project-based rental assistance program aims to transfer 20,000 units, with properties in different categories selected by HUD. Most of the $300 million funding would cover the difference in subsidy levels, with additional funds allocated for PHA activities, landlord outreach, and technical assistance. The President's budget includes a proposal for a new project-based rental assistance program. $50 million would be used for combining PHA activities and promoting tenant mobility, while $10 million would go towards technical assistance and program evaluation. HUD plans to submit legislation to Congress for this initiative, known as the Preservation, Enhancement, and Transformation of Rental Assistance Act. The Preservation, Enhancement, and Transformation of Rental Assistance Act, available on HUD's website, did not receive funding in H.R. 5850 or S. 3644. Committees expressed concerns about the proposal's development and unknown future costs. Funding for the Transforming Rental Assistance initiative was not included in H.R. 1 or the final FY2011 appropriations law. The public housing program, established in 1937, offers rental units for very low-income families. The Transforming Rental Assistance initiative was not funded in H.R. 1 or the final FY2011 appropriations law. The public housing program provides rental units for very low-income families and is HUD's oldest housing assistance program. Congress continues to support over 3,100 PHAs that maintain more than 1.2 million units. HUD provides funding to PHAs through the operating fund to cover maintenance and utility costs. HUD provides funding to over 3,100 Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) for maintenance and utilities through the operating fund. The capital fund supports large projects and modernization. HOPE VI grants aid in redeveloping distressed housing for mixed-income communities. The President's FY2011 budget proposed increased funding for the operating fund and decreased funding for other areas. The President's FY2011 budget requested increased funding for the Public Housing operating fund and decreased funding for the public housing capital fund, citing the previous capital funding received from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The President's FY2011 budget requested increased funding for the Public Housing operating fund and decreased funding for the public housing capital fund, citing previous capital funding received from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. PHAs can transfer up to 20% of their capital funding to cover operating expenses, allowing more capital funds to be spent on capital needs. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed funding the operating fund at the President's request and included a $500 million increase over the President's request for the capital fund. The Senate bill proposed funding the operating fund at the President's request with a $500 million increase for the capital fund. It included a $50 million set-aside for grants to provide early childhood education in public housing and required $10 million for safety measures. H.R. 1 suggested cutting over $1 billion from the public housing capital fund. The final FY2011 funding law (P.L. 112-10) allocated funds for public housing capital and operating funds, with a higher capital fund than proposed in H.R. 1 but less than FY2010. The operating fund received about $10 million less than H.R. 1, which could be offset by PHAs' program reserves. The President proposed a mandatory offset of PHA reserves in his FY2012 budget. The final FY2011 funding law allocated funds for public housing capital and operating funds, with a higher capital fund than proposed in H.R. 1 but less than FY2010. The operating fund received about $10 million less than H.R. 1, which could be offset by PHAs' program reserves. The President proposed a mandatory offset of PHA reserves in his FY2012 budget. Additionally, the President's budget requested no new funding for HOPE VI, instead requesting $250 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, a new Obama Administration proposal modeled after the HOPE VI program. The FY2011 funding law allocated funds for public housing capital and operating funds, with a higher capital fund than proposed in H.R. 1 but less than FY2010. The President's budget requested no new funding for HOPE VI, instead asking for $250 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, a new Obama Administration proposal to revitalize distressed neighborhoods. This initiative broadens the scope of HOPE VI by offering competitive grants to various entities for the transformation, rehabilitation, and replacement of HUD public and assisted housing. The funding for revitalizing distressed neighborhoods includes $200 million for HOPE VI and up to $65 million for a Choice Neighborhoods demonstration. The House and Senate in the 111th Congress had different positions on funding for these programs in FY2011. In FY2011, the House and Senate in the 111th Congress had differing positions on funding for HOPE VI and Choice Neighborhoods. H.R. 5850 proposed $200 million for HOPE VI, while S. 3644 suggested $250 million for Choice Neighborhoods. HUD drafted legislation for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, and the House Financial Services Committee discussed the topic in March 2010. In July 2010, the House Financial Services Committee ordered reported the Public Housing Reinvestment and Tenant Protection Act of 2010 (H.R. 5814), which included authorization of the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative. The final FY2011 funding law provided just under $100 million for HOPE VI, with a $65 million set-aside from FY2010. This allowed for the majority of HOPE VI funding to be used for Choice Neighborhoods in FY2011. The FY2011 funding law allocated nearly $100 million for HOPE VI, with a $65 million set-aside from FY2010. This funding may be used for Choice Neighborhoods. The Housing Trust Fund, established in 2008, aims to provide a dedicated funding source for affordable housing activities. The Housing Trust Fund, established in 2008, aims to provide a permanent funding source for affordable housing activities, focusing on rental housing for extremely low-income families. Contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were intended as the funding source but were suspended in 2008 due to financial difficulties. The Housing Trust Fund's funding from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was suspended in 2008 due to financial difficulties, leaving the fund without a source of funding. Despite the possibility of other funding sources, no money has been directed to the fund yet. The President's FY2011 budget requested $1 billion in mandatory funding for the Housing Trust Fund, to be offset elsewhere in the budget. Despite requests in the President's FY2010 and FY2011 budgets for $1 billion in mandatory funding for the Housing Trust Fund, no funding has been directed to the fund yet. Congress did not provide any funding in the FY2010 appropriations law, and subsequent bills also did not include funding for the Housing Trust Fund. The FY2010 and FY2011 appropriations laws did not provide funding for the Housing Trust Fund despite requests in the President's budgets. Legislative proposals in the 111th Congress aimed to fund the Housing Trust Fund, but none were enacted before adjournment. The Transformation Initiative, proposed in President Obama's FY2010 budget, aims to strengthen HUD's research and technology. The Transformation Initiative, proposed in President Obama's FY2010 budget, aims to strengthen HUD's research and technology capacities through funding for research, program demonstrations, technical assistance, and information technology. The initiative also includes provisions for reducing mortgage fraud and allowing the Secretary to transfer up to 1% from most accounts in HUD's budget for transformation purposes. The funding request for the Transformation Initiative involves appropriations for reducing mortgage fraud and allowing the Secretary to transfer up to 1% from most accounts in HUD's budget to a transformation fund. In FY2010, Congress provided $20 million for addressing mortgage fraud and authorized the 1% transfer authority, resulting in a fund of $239 million instead of the potential $435 million. In FY2011, the President requested a $20 million appropriation for combating mortgage fraud and a 1% transfer authority. The transformation fund could have received almost $470 million under the requested authority. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included the $20 million for combating mortgage fraud and a limited version of the transfer authority. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included the requested $20 million for combating mortgage fraud and a limited version of the President's requested transfer authority. The House and Senate bills proposed limits on the department's discretion by giving directions on fund allocation. The 111th Congress proposed limits on HUD's discretion in fund allocation, focusing on core department needs. Oversight of Transformation Initiative funding was deemed critical by the Senate report. The Senate report emphasized the importance of oversight for Transformation Initiative funding, limiting HUD's flexibility in fund allocation. The Committee recommended minimum funding levels for IT modernization and technical assistance, while H.R. 1 did not include the authority for transfers under the Initiative. The bill allocated $71 million for modernizing FHA's systems and updated computer programs for the Section 8 voucher, instead of the $20 million requested for combating mortgage fraud. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) included $71 million for new FHA and Section 8 voucher computer systems, allowing HUD transfer authority under the Transformation Initiative but from a limited number of accounts. The Administration's budget for FY2011 also included community development initiatives. The final FY2011 appropriations law included funding for new FHA and Section 8 voucher computer systems, allowing HUD transfer authority under the Transformation Initiative from a limited number of accounts. The Administration's budget for FY2011 included community development initiatives aimed at transforming or restructuring CDBG and related programs. Funding for CDBG would continue at FY2010 levels, while the Rural Innovation Fund and earmarked programs like the Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative would be eliminated. The FY2011 budget proposed funding CDBG at FY2010 levels and eliminating funding for the Rural Innovation Fund, Neighborhood Initiative, and Economic Development Initiative. New initiatives included Catalytic Competition Grants and the Capacity Building Clearinghouse. Other programs like the University Community Fund and Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program were also revamped. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposed reducing funding for Community Development Fund activities from $4.450 billion to $4.380 billion. This reduction would defund Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants, used for congressional earmarks, with savings redirected to other programs. The FY2011 budget proposed a $70 million reduction in Community Development Fund activities by defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants used for congressional earmarks. Savings would fund Sustainable Communities Initiative, University Community Fund, and a new Catalytic Investments Competition Grants initiative for economic development in distressed communities. No new funding was requested for the Brownfields Economic Development Initiative Account. The President's budget proposed defunding Neighborhood Initiative and Economic Development Initiative grants to fund new Catalytic Investments Competition Grants for economic development in distressed communities. The Administration argued that the Brownfields Economic Development Initiative Account duplicates other federal programs. The House bill recommended a $4.382 billion appropriation for Community Development Fund activities, including $89.3 million for congressional earmarked funds for Economic Development Initiative and Neighborhood Initiative. The House bill, H.R. 5850, recommended a $4.382 billion appropriation for CDF activities, including $89.3 million for congressional earmarked funds for EDI and NI projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill, S. 3644, recommended a $4.450 billion appropriation for CDF activities, with $193 million for EDI and NI projects. Both bills also recommended continued funding for Administration initiatives. The Senate bill, S. 3644, recommended $193 million for EDI and NI projects. Both the House and Senate bills suggested continued funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and University Community Fund at their FY2010 levels. The final FY2011 appropriations law, P.L. 112-10, allocated $3.501 billion for the CDF account, a 21.2% decrease from the proposed amount. The final FY2011 appropriations law, P.L. 112-10, allocated $3.501 billion for the CDF account, which is 21.2% less than the previous year. Funding for CDBG formula grants was reduced by 16.4%, and the Sustainable Communities Initiative saw a 33% decrease. The Brownfield Economic Development Initiative was not funded. The CDF account, funded at $3.501 billion under P.L. 112-10, saw a 21.2% decrease from the previous year. Funding for CDBG formula grants was reduced by 16.4%, and the Sustainable Communities Initiative grant program experienced a 33% cut. Brownfield Economic Development Initiative was not funded. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, authorized under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, is a significant source of federal financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development. In 2010, CDBG formula funds were awarded to various entitlement communities, states, and insular areas. In 2010, CDBG formula funds were awarded to 1,151 entitlement communities, 50 states, Puerto Rico, and insular areas. The funds can be used for activities benefiting low- and moderate-income persons, eliminating slums or blight, or addressing threats to public health and safety. The Administration proposed freezing funding for the CDBG program at over $3.9 billion for FY2011. The Administration proposed freezing funding for the CDBG program at over $3.9 billion for FY2011. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed funding the CDBG formula grant program slightly higher than the President's request and the program's FY2010 funding level of $3.943 billion. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing CDF account funding by 66.3% below FY2010 levels. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing the CDF account by 66.3% below FY2010 levels and prohibiting funds for earmarks and the SCI. Funding allocation instructions for the CDBG program were not included in the bill. The CDBG program allocates funds to states, entitlement communities, insular areas, and Indian tribes. The House-passed H.R. 1 reduced CDF account funding by 66.3% and did not include allocation instructions for the CDBG program. The final FY2011 appropriations law allocated $3.508 billion for the program. The final FY2011 appropriations law allocated $3.508 billion for activities in the CDF account, including $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. This included a 0.2% mandatory across-the-board rescission and a 1% discretionary transfer to HUD's Transformation Initiative. The FY2011 appropriations law allocated funds for CDF activities, with a mandatory cut reducing the CDF account by $7 million. A 1% discretionary transfer moved $35 million to HUD's Transformation Initiative. The Administration proposed a new initiative for economic development projects in distressed areas through the Catalytic Competition Grants Program (CCGs). The Administration proposed a $148.5 million initiative for economic development in distressed areas through the Catalytic Competition Grants Program (CCGs). Unlike CDBG funds, CCG program funds would be awarded competitively to various entities for reclaiming vacant property for green infrastructure projects. The proposed Catalytic Competition Grants Program would award funds competitively to public, nonprofit, and for-profit entities for reclaiming vacant property for green infrastructure projects and economic development activities in distressed areas. Neither the House-passed nor the Senate Committee-passed bills included funding for the program. The Administration requested $148.5 million for its Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to assist small- and medium-sized businesses in targeted neighborhoods and cover administrative costs. Neither H.R. 1 nor the final FY2011 appropriations law appropriated funds for this proposal. The SCI appropriations are to be used for Regional Integrated Planning Grants. The Administration requested $148.5 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) to fund Regional Integrated Planning Grants in FY2011. This component involves competitive awards to regional organizations in metropolitan areas to develop models for sustainable communities in collaboration with various federal agencies. The Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) collaborates with federal agencies to award grants for sustainable development in metropolitan areas. HUD plans to grant $3 million to larger areas and $500,000 to smaller areas for housing, transportation, energy, and land use planning. HUD's Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) awards grants to metropolitan areas for sustainable development. $500,000 is allocated to areas with populations under 500,000 for housing, transportation, energy, and land use planning improvements. Community Challenge Grants (CCGs) are competitively awarded to reform building codes and zoning ordinances to promote sustainable growth. Congress appropriated $40 million for CCG activities in FY2010. HUD has proposed grant awards not exceeding $2 million for sustainable growth and discouraging inefficient land use patterns. The Administration requested an unspecified amount for a joint HUD-Department of Transportation research initiative in FY2011 to evaluate benefits and tradeoffs of various efforts, with a portion of funds allocated for evaluating long-term benefits of Regional Integrated Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants. The proposal includes a research initiative to evaluate benefits and tradeoffs of different efforts, with $2 million allocated for assessing long-term benefits of Regional Integrated Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants. Additionally, a Capacity Building Program and Tools Clearinghouse is proposed to improve technical capacity of various organizations and lenders. The proposal seeks funding to improve technical capacity of regional organizations, local jurisdictions, community-based organizations, developers, and private sector lenders through the Office of Sustainable Housing and Communities within HUD. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 propose continued funding for the Administration's Sustainable Communities Initiative at $148.5 million, with a requirement to award at least $25 million for the Regional Integrated Planning Grant component. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 proposed continued funding for the Administration's Sustainable Communities Initiative at $148.5 million. They also recommended allocating $25 million for the Rural Innovation Fund to assist in addressing housing and poverty-related issues. Additionally, a provision was included to set aside $5 million in the Rural Innovation Fund. The bills proposed funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and the Rural Innovation Fund to address housing and poverty-related issues. $5 million was set aside for rural Indian tribes for revolving loan funds and technical assistance. The bills also supported HUD's Transformation Initiative with discretionary transfer power. The bills proposed funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and the Rural Innovation Fund to address housing and poverty-related issues. $5 million was set aside for rural Indian tribes for revolving loan funds and technical assistance. The bills also supported HUD's Transformation Initiative with discretionary transfer power, allowing up to 1% of CDF appropriations to be transferred. P.L. 112-10 appropriated $99.8 million for SCI activities, including Regional Integration Planning Grants and Community Challenge Grants, representing a 33% reduction from FY2010 funding levels. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to pledge their annual CDBG allocations as collateral for redevelopment activities. The FY2011 funding level for Challenge Grants represents a 33% reduction from FY2010. The Section 108 loan guarantee program allows states and entitlement communities to use their CDBG allocations as collateral for redevelopment activities, with the ability to borrow up to five times their annual CDBG allocations for qualifying activities. The Administration's budget proposed doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling from $250 million in FY2010 to $500 million in FY2011. The Administration's budget proposed doubling the Section 108 loan guarantee program's loan commitment ceiling from $250 million in FY2010 to $500 million in FY2011 to help local governments finance large-scale projects at a rate slightly above Treasury yields. Additionally, the Administration proposed revamping the program by charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program. The Administration proposed increasing the Section 108 loan guarantee program's loan commitment ceiling to help finance large-scale projects. They suggested charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers to eliminate the need for a credit subsidy. This proposal was rejected by Congress, with both House-passed and Senate Committee-passed bills recommending to maintain the program as is. H.R. 5850 recommended a loan commitment ceiling of $427 million with a credit subsidy of $10 million, while S. 3644 recommended a ceiling of $275 million. The House-passed and Senate Committee-passed bills recommended continuing the Section 108 loan guarantee program as is. H.R. 5850 proposed a loan commitment ceiling of $427 million with a credit subsidy of $10 million, while S. 3644 suggested a ceiling of $275 million. P.L. 112-10 maintained the program at a commitment level of $275 million with a credit subsidy of $5.988 million. The Administration's FY2011 budget proposed a redesign of the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed a redesign of the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program, with a credit subsidy of $5.988 million. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed a redesign of the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program, with a credit subsidy of $5.988 million. The program is currently managed by intermediaries such as the Local Initiative Support Corporation, the Enterprise Community Partners, and Habitat for Humanity. It provides funding for training, education, grants, loans, and other financial assistance to enhance the capabilities of community development organizations and support affordable housing activities for low- and moderate-income individuals. The Administration's budget for FY2011 proposed increasing funding for capacity building by $10 million, establishing it as a stand-alone account. Grant funds would be competitively awarded to intermediaries with expertise in housing and community development. Grant funds would have been competitively awarded to national and regional intermediaries with local affiliates and partnerships, or consortia of intermediaries with demonstrated expertise in housing and community development. The assistance provided would have been used to help CDCs, CHDOs, and local governments develop the capacity for community development and affordable housing activities benefiting low- and moderate-income individuals through training and education programs. CDCs, CHDOs, and local governments would have received assistance to enhance their capacity for community development and affordable housing activities benefiting low- and moderate-income individuals. Funding would have supported training, education, loans, grants, market research, organizational assessments, and other activities determined by HUD. Grantees would have needed to meet a 3:1 match from private sector sources. The House-passed and Senate Committee-passed bills did not include funding for this initiative. Successful grantees were required to meet a 3:1 match from private sector sources. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 recommended continuing funding for capacity building activities by organizations like the Local Initiative Support Corporation, Enterprise Community Partners, and Habitat for Humanity under the Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program account. P.L. 112-10 also continued to fund capacity building through SHOP. The Self-Help and Assisted Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) account funds capacity building activities through grants to organizations like Habitat for Humanity. Prospective homebuyers contribute \"sweat equity\" with the help of volunteers. HUD provides grants through SHOP to organizations experienced in self-help homeownership. Prospective homebuyers contribute \"sweat equity\" with volunteer assistance. The account also funds the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program and the Housing Assistance Council, which addresses rural housing needs. The Housing Assistance Council (HAC) provides technical assistance and funds to local housing and community development organizations through national intermediaries to address the housing needs of the rural poor. HAC supports local organizations in developing housing and homeownership opportunities in rural America. The President's FY2011 budget did not include funding for the SHOP account, noting that activities traditionally funded through SHOP are eligible for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program block grant. The President's FY2011 budget did not include funding for the SHOP account. Instead, it proposed $60 million for a new Capacity Building account to fund various capacity-building activities previously supported by SHOP. Both H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 allocated a total of $82 million for the SHOP. The FY2011 budget proposed $60 million for a new Capacity Building account to fund activities previously supported by the SHOP account. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 allocated $82 million for the SHOP, including $27 million for SHOP itself, $50 million for capacity building, and $5 million for HAC. Funding levels remained the same as FY2010 in the final FY2011 appropriations law. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) maintained funding for rural capacity-building activities at the same levels as FY2010, with a total of $81.8 million allocated for various account activities, including $26.9 million for SHOP, $49.9 million for Section 4 Capacity Building, and $4.9 million for the Housing Assistance Council. HUD also planned to transfer $818,360 to the Transformation Initiative account. HUD allocated $4.9 million for the Housing Assistance Council and planned to transfer $818,360 to the Transformation Initiative account. The Housing Counseling Assistance Program provides grants to HUD-approved agencies for various counseling services. The Housing Counseling Assistance Program offers competitive grants to HUD-approved agencies for housing counseling services, including pre-purchase and post-purchase homeownership counseling, mortgage delinquency counseling, and counseling for renters, the homeless, or seniors seeking reverse mortgages. Congress has increased funding for this program in response to rising mortgage default and foreclosure rates since 2006. Funding for the Housing Counseling Assistance Program has increased in recent years due to concerns about rising mortgage default and foreclosure rates since 2006. Between FY2003 and FY2007, funding was steady at $39-42 million, but it rose to $87.5 million in FY2010. The President's FY2011 budget requested $88 million for the program, which was also included in H.R. 5850 in the 111th Congress. In the 111th Congress, funding for the Housing Counseling Assistance Program was set at $88 million, matching the President's budget request. However, in the 112th Congress, funding for the program was eliminated in the final FY2011 appropriations law, resulting in an $87.5 million decrease. The House-passed bill H.R. 1 during the 112th Congress did not include funding for HUD's housing counseling program for FY2011. The final FY2011 appropriations law eliminated funding for this program, resulting in an $87.5 million decrease from FY2010. Critics argue that HUD housing counseling funding overlaps with the NeighborWorks National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program, but HUD funding can be used for a wider variety of counseling types. HUD has also faced criticism for not distributing housing counseling grants effectively. The NeighborWorks National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program funding (NFMCP) is different from HUD funding, which can be used for various counseling types. Congress has allocated separate funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling to NeighborWorks America since FY2008, instead of HUD. HUD has been criticized for slow distribution of housing counseling grants. Since FY2008, Congress has allocated additional funding for foreclosure mitigation counseling to NeighborWorks America instead of HUD. This funding is now known as the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP), managed by NeighborWorks, an independent nonprofit corporation. NeighborWorks America receives annual appropriations from Congress for community reinvestment activities, including mortgage foreclosure counseling. In FY2008, it received $120 million in regular funding and an additional $180 million for foreclosure counseling. Congress allocated extra funding in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. NeighborWorks America received $180 million specifically for mortgage foreclosure counseling activities in FY2008, which was 50% more than its regular base appropriation. Additional appropriations have been made since then, with the President's budget requesting $113 million for the NFMCP in FY2011. H.R. 5850 and S. 3644 included $113 million and $125 million respectively for the NFMCP. In FY2011, funding for the NFMCP was $113 million in H.R. 5850 and $125 million in S. 3644, with S. 3644 allocating $24 million more for housing activities than the House-passed bill or the President's budget. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) maintained funding for the NFMCP at $65 million, the same as FY2010. The final FY2011 appropriations law (P.L. 112-10) did not make any changes to the funding for the NFMCP, keeping it at $65 million. Housing counseling agencies support the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) for foreclosure prevention. The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) provides financial incentives to lower mortgage payments for troubled borrowers. Housing counseling is required for homeowners with high debt-to-income ratios, funded by the NFMCP. Borrowers eligible for HAMP are encouraged to seek assistance from housing counselors. Native American Housing Block Grants (NAHBGs) are formula-based grants for Indian tribes to provide housing assistance primarily to low-income American Indian and Alaskan Native households. Housing counseling agencies funded by the NFMCP and HUD provide assistance to borrowers eligible for HAMP.
