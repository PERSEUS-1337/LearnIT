    "content": "The Bush tax cuts, enacted in 2001 and 2003, were set to expire in 2010. This included lower rates for long-term capital gains and dividends, with a 0% tax rate for certain taxpayers. Without action, rates would have increased to pre-2003 levels. President Obama proposed retaining lower rates for middle-income taxpayers. President Obama proposed to retain the 15% and 0% tax rates for lower- and middle-income taxpayers, but to tax dividends and capital gains at 20% for higher-income individuals. The tax rates were temporarily extended through 2012 by the Tax Relief Act of 2010, and the final resolution in 2013 was to tax capital gains for higher-income individuals. The Tax Relief Act of 2010 temporarily extended tax rates through 2012. In 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act increased capital gains taxes for higher-income individuals. The revenue gain from this increase depends on behavioral responses assumed by the JCT and Treasury Department. The Obama Administration estimated that allowing the Bush tax cuts for capital gains to expire would have raised $16 billion in revenue in FY2019. The current effective capital gains tax rate was 13.3% in 2008 and would have increased to 17.9% in 2019, resulting in a revenue difference of $40 billion. Based on CBO projections, the effective capital gains tax was 13.3% in 2008 and would have increased to 17.9% in 2019, resulting in a revenue difference of $40 billion. Supporters of increasing taxes on capital gains have proposed applying mark-to-market rules to address potential behavioral responses. Some supporters of increasing taxes on capital gains propose applying mark-to-market rules to tax gains as accrued, eliminating the realization response for affected assets. Assets less easily valued could be subject to look-back treatment to increase taxes for the same after-tax earnings. This approach aims to address behavioral responses but comes with complexities. The proposal to increase taxes on capital gains suggests applying mark-to-market rules to tax gains as accrued, eliminating the realization response. This approach aims to address behavioral responses but comes with complexities. Realizations responses in revenue projections were publicly discussed in the late 1980s, affecting revenues and sparking a contentious debate. The report discusses how responses in revenue projections by revenue-estimating agencies in the late 1980s affect revenues. It suggests that the Obama Administration's projections and those of the JCT may underestimate revenue gains from allowing lower capital gains tax rates to expire. Economists and policymakers are concerned about potential reductions in capital gains realizations. The Obama Administration's revenue projections and those of the JCT may underestimate revenue gains from allowing lower capital gains tax rates to expire. Taxpayers can choose to realize capital gains, which can affect potential revenue. There is concern about a reduction in revenue from capital gains taxes due to reduced realizations. Tax increases could potentially lose revenue if the response is significant. Postponing realizations until death can allow gains to escape taxation entirely, creating an incentive to delay selling assets. Capital gains realizations responses are typically measured by elasticity, representing the percentage change in response. If realizations are postponed until death, gains can escape tax entirely, creating an incentive to delay selling assets. Capital gains realizations responses are measured by elasticity, showing the percentage change in realizations in response to tax changes. The elasticity of capital gains tax measures the percentage change in realizations in response to tax changes. A higher elasticity value indicates a smaller revenue gain or loss. If the elasticity is less than one, a tax increase gains revenue; if greater than one, it loses revenue. The ratio of revenue gain projected to the gain realized with no behavioral response is one minus the elasticity. The elasticity of capital gains tax determines the revenue impact of tax changes. A higher elasticity value indicates a smaller revenue gain or loss. Three types of elasticities are relevant to capital gains realizations and revenues, including the permanent elasticity for longer-term tax law changes. The three types of elasticities relevant to capital gains realizations and revenues are the permanent elasticity for longer-term tax changes, the short-run elasticity for short-term responses, and the transitory elasticity for temporary tax changes. The transitory elasticity measures the response to temporary tax changes, which can occur due to varying incomes of wealthy individuals and pre-announced tax changes. This effect poses challenges in estimation and impacts tax realizations. The discussion focuses on the short-term effects of shifting realizations to take advantage of lower tax rates. This response is often seen in the context of a capital gains tax cut, where taxpayers realize gains sooner due to lower tax rates. In response to a capital gains tax cut in the late 1980s, taxpayers may realize accrued gains sooner due to lower tax rates. However, the short-term response could be limited if there was a recent surge in realizations, as seen in 1986 due to pre-announced tax changes. In the late 1980s, a surge in realizations occurred due to pre-announced tax changes. Short-term responses to tax cuts may be limited if recent gains have already been exhausted. An increase in taxes that is not pre-announced may not elicit a similar short-term response as a tax cut. In the late 1980s, a surge in realizations occurred due to pre-announced tax changes. Short-term responses to tax cuts may be limited if recent gains have already been exhausted. An increase in taxes that is not pre-announced may not elicit a similar short-term response as a tax cut. There is no reason to expect that short-run responses apply to a tax increase that is not pre-announced, as it will not cause a contraction in realizations. The stock of gains that has not been realized because of taxes will simply remain unrealized, with no effect on realizations. Transitory responses to tax changes can occur due to temporary fluctuations in income and taxes, even without changes in the law. This was more pronounced before 1987 when capital gains were subject to graduated rates. In the period before 1987, transitory responses to tax changes were more pronounced for capital gains subject to graduated rates. Statistical estimates of realizations responses are based on various functional forms, with elasticities rising proportionally with the tax rate. The elasticity of capital gains rises proportionally with the tax rate. Elasticities should be reported with reference to the assumed tax rate, such as the 22% rate. The elasticities discussed in the 1990 debate reflect this rate. Capital gains realizations elasticities are expected to be negative, but in this report, they will be stated in absolute value. This formulation also leads to a revenue-maximizing tax. The report discusses capital gains realizations elasticities and their relationship to tax rates. The elasticities will be stated in absolute value, leading to a revenue-maximizing tax rate. The 22% rate is considered appropriate as a starting point for tax increases. The 22% tax rate is seen as a suitable starting point for tax increases, taking into account various factors such as the net investment income tax and overall marginal tax rates estimated by the Congressional Budget Office and the Department of the Treasury. These considerations do not apply to taxes on dividends. The Department of the Treasury estimates a 21.3% marginal tax rate for long-term capital gains, while dividends are taxed at a lower rate of 18.4%. In 1990, the George H. W. Bush Administration proposed increasing the top rate on capital gains from 20% to 28%. In 1990, the George H. W. Bush Administration proposed increasing the top rate on capital gains from 20% to 28% to address revenue cost concerns. Revenue-estimating agencies began investigating behavioral responses and realizations elasticities during the late 1980s. The Administration and the Joint Committee on Taxation used different elasticities in their forecasts. In 1990, the Administration and JTC used different elasticities to forecast capital gains revenues. Two types of data were used: aggregate time series and micro-data studies. Micro-data studies analyzed individual taxpayers' realizations in relation to their tax rates, including cross-section, pooled cross-section time-series, and panel studies. Estimates of the realizations response ranged from 0.3 to almost 4, indicating varying revenue implications based on tax rate changes. Estimates of the realizations response varied dramatically, from 0.3 to almost 4, with implications for revenue depending on the elasticity. Aggregate time series estimates ranged from 0.3 to 0.9, while individual taxpayer data estimates ranged from 0.55 to 3.8, highlighting serious issues with estimation methods. Estimates of the realizations response varied widely, from 0.3 to 4, with implications for revenue depending on the elasticity. The range of estimated responses highlighted serious issues with estimation methods, especially for individual taxpayer data. The JCT considered time series results more reliable and estimated their own elasticity using this approach. The Treasury did not provide a specific methodology for their number, reporting it as a conservative choice based on realizations estimates. Researchers faced challenges in estimating the realizations response, preferring individual data over aggregation to avoid bias and information loss. Distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses, especially for high-income individuals, was a significant issue. It is difficult to control for changing factors over time when using individual data to distinguish between permanent and transitory responses to income fluctuations. Tax rates also vary over time, leading individuals to time realizations to coincide with low rates. This concern precluded relying on simple cross-section results for permanent responses, as revenue-estimating entities did not rely on larger elasticities produced by some micro-data. The concern about cashing in assets when income is low precluded relying on simple cross-section results for permanent responses. Panel data studies reported smaller but still significant elasticities above one in some cases. The panel data studies examined individual tax rates over several years, using the average of current, previous, and future tax rates as a permanent rate. These studies reported smaller elasticities, but some were still well above one. The Treasury may have chosen a larger elasticity based on panel results, despite aggregate time series data suggesting otherwise. The Treasury chose a larger elasticity than suggested by aggregate time series data, despite panel studies also showing a large elasticity. Panel studies attempted to address transitory effects but may not fully correct for them due to prolonged periods of higher or lower income. Although panel studies could control for some transitory effects, the available panels were limited to a few years. Panel studies attempted to control for transitory effects, but the available panels were limited to a few years. The proposed tax cuts were not enacted at that time, although they were eventually reduced in 1997 and again in 2003. The range of realizations elasticities, even if confined to time series estimates, is uncertain. The proposed tax cuts were not enacted at that time, although they were eventually reduced in 1997 and again in 2003. Researchers focused on producing more precise estimates after a sharp spike in realizations in 1986. In 1986, there was a significant increase in realizations, rising from $170.6 billion to $324.4 billion, then falling to $144.2 billion in 1987. This spike occurred in December and was seven times higher than the previous year. The increase coincided with a tax increase for the following years, highlighting concerns about transitory responses in econometric studies. The tax increase in 1986 led to a significant spike in realizations, raising concerns about transitory responses in econometric studies. Additional academic studies starting in 1990 further highlighted these concerns. The CBO, JCT, and Treasury use various practices to estimate revenues. CBO's realizations estimate is part of a statistical study projecting capital gains realizations. Table 1 shows coefficients for elasticity, with studies ranked by elasticity size. Gravelle's study in Table 1 was not econometric. Large elasticities from studies suggest unrealistically high realizations. Gravelle's study in Table 1 highlighted the limit to realizations response, noting that realizations cannot exceed accruals. The study provided data on the ratio of realizations to accruals over time, emphasizing the relationship between tax rates and average values. The study found that the upper limit of the realizations elasticity is 0.5, indicating that individuals would sell every asset every year in the absence of taxes and transaction costs. This limit is lower than estimates from other studies and suggests that some assets may not be sold even under ideal conditions. The upper limit of the realizations elasticity is 0.5, implying individuals would sell every asset annually without taxes and transaction costs. However, some assets are unlikely to be sold even in ideal conditions, leading to a lower elasticity. This study was conducted in 1991 and reports both the upper limit and midpoint of the findings. The study conducted in 1991 found that the realizations to accruals level was estimated at 46% and the tax rate was estimated at 18.4%. More recent evidence from 1989-2013 showed a similar ratio of 48% and a tax rate of 17.3%, supporting the limits to realizations elasticities found in the initial Gravelle study. Recent evidence from 1989-2013 supports the limits to realizations elasticities found in the initial Gravelle study. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen panel study suggests that if all income and transactions taxes were eliminated, realizations could increase 4.25 times their current value, but accruals suggest they could only double. The study also corrected the elasticity for the 1980s, indicating a similar elasticity of 3.2 to cross-section results. The Burman and Randolph study used state tax rate variation to estimate the permanent elasticity, finding a statistically insignificant small elasticity. Panel studies couldn't address transitory issues seen in cross-section studies. The Burman and Randolph study, along with subsequent studies by Auerbach and Siegel, used state tax rate variation to estimate elasticities. They found a small permanent elasticity and a large transitory elasticity, falling below the upper limit of elasticities. Auerbach and Siegel replicated their approach with different years and found similar results, consistent with the Gravelle estimate of limits. Most subsequent studies incorporated state tax rates. The Auten and Joulfaian study and the Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study had the highest elasticities among individual panel studies, likely due to adding state tax rates and having a longer panel. Time series effects became more important in these studies. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study added state tax rates and had a longer panel, affecting their elasticities. Their estimates may reflect timing responses rather than permanent responses. Sensitivity analysis produced a wide range of estimates. The Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen study provided sensitivity analysis with a wide range of estimates based on different specifications, variables, and time periods. The Gillingham and Greenlees study added a few years of data to earlier studies. The Gillingham and Greenlees study added a few years of data to earlier studies, while other time series studies added more years. The time series results show varying elasticities, falling within the range of studies from the 1980s. The time series studies show that adding more years of data results in lower elasticities. Results fall within the range of studies from the 1980s, with some studies exceeding the upper limit estimated by Gravelle. Australian data was used in one study, while state studies showed slightly higher results than the Gravelle study's upper limit. The state studies by Bakija and Gentry, using aggregate data over time grouped by state, found results slightly above the upper limit estimated by Gravelle. They emphasize the importance of controlling for state fixed effects, showing coefficients rising from 2.91 to 3.88 without these controls. The elasticities in their study are closer together and lower than those in studies from the 1980s. JCT's current coefficient is similar to estimates used during the 1990 debate. The elasticities in Table 1 are lower and closer together compared to studies from the 1980s. Both JCT and Treasury estimates appear high and likely understate the revenue to be gained. The JCT and Treasury estimates for raising the tax rate on capital gains may be understating the potential revenue gains. Table 2 compares revenue estimates based on elasticities and CBO projections for 2019. Based on CBO's estimates for 2019, raising the tax rate on capital gains by five percentage points could result in a revenue gain ranging from $31.4 billion to $1 billion per year. The estimates are adjusted down to $180 billion to reflect short-term gains taxed at ordinary rates. The revenue gain as a percentage of static gain ranges from a reduction of 26% to 97%. The revenue gain for a five-percentage-point tax rate increase ranges from $31.4 billion to $1 billion per year, with a reduction of 26% to 97% compared to static gain. Measures like accrual-based taxation, including a look-back method, could increase capital gains revenues from $10.3 billion to $43.2 billion by taxing unrealized gains. The look-back method, if implemented, could significantly increase capital gains revenues by taxing unrealized gains, potentially collecting $222 billion on unrealized gains in a steady state. The Auten and Joulfaian panel study is considered reliable, although it may overstate the permanent effects due to transitory elasticity effects. The Auten and Joulfaian panel study, despite being reliable, may overstate permanent effects due to transitory elasticity. The Dowd, McClellan, and Muthitacharoen study produced the largest elasticity, showing differing estimates from different subperiods, indicating fragility in the estimates. Eichner and Sinai's time series results include more years than Gillingham. The elasticity estimates from different subperiods show fragility in the results. Eichner and Sinai's time series results include more years than Gillingham, suggesting their preference. The elasticity is likely below 0.5 based on various studies and limit calculations. This indicates that revenue gains may be understated. Post-1980s econometric studies and limit calculations support these findings. Based on Gravelle's limit calculations, the elasticity is likely below 0.5, indicating that revenue gains from increasing the tax rate by five percentage points may be underestimated. Post-1980s econometric studies and limit calculations support these findings, suggesting potential revenue gains that are three times higher than projected by the JCT. Using the Gravelle upper limit, revenues could be 45% larger than current projections. The Gravelle upper limit suggests revenue gains from increasing capital gains tax rates could be three times higher than projected by the JCT, potentially underestimating the actual gains. The appendix details the method of calculating taxes and modeling realizations and revenues based on elasticity estimates. The method of calculating taxes and modeling realizations and revenues is based on a semi-log function. The elasticity of realizations with respect to taxes can be estimated using this function. The relationship between taxes and gains can be modeled using a semi-log function. The elasticity of gains with respect to taxes can be estimated through this function, with the revenue equation being derived accordingly. The revenue equation can be restated in its original form as R = tAe -bt. The revenue maximizing tax rate occurs when (1-bt) equals zero, which is at 1/b. The revenue maximizing tax rate is determined by setting (1-bt) equal to zero, resulting in a rate of 1/b. For example, if b is 2, the optimal tax rate is 50%, and if b is 5, the optimal rate is 20%. The look-back method adjusts basis to achieve the same net on a sale as if taxes were paid on an accrual basis. The look-back method adjusts basis to achieve the same net on a sale as if taxes were paid on an accrual basis. This method decreases basis to increase taxable gain. To determine the growth rate g, the formula is g = (S/B) (1/T) -1. The formula to find the new basis B* is [B(1+ ((S/B) 1/T -1)(1-t)) T -S(1-t)]/t. The look-back method adjusts basis to achieve the same net on a sale as if taxes were paid on an accrual basis. The formula to find the new basis B* is [B(1+ ((S/B) 1/T -1)(1-t)) T -S(1-t)]/t. Appendix B discusses elasticities found in studies of the 1980s, categorized based on information available for a choice of realizations response during the 1990 debate. During the 1990 debate, studies on capital gains realizations and tax rates faced challenges. The debate included discussions on the type of data to use and the fundamental approaches employed. Elasticities were reported at a 22% tax rate, with citations provided in Appendix C. The debate over capital gains realizations and tax rates involved challenges in choosing between aggregate time series data and individual taxpayer data. Aggregate time series results ranged from 0.3 to 0.9, while estimates based on individual observations varied from 0.55 to almost 4. The pooled time-series, cross-section regression estimate likely reflects a combination of both approaches. Estimates based on micro data varied from 0.55 to almost 4, showing individual variability. Using individual data is preferred over aggregate data to avoid information loss and bias in results. It is challenging to control for all changes over time that can impact realizations. Estimates based on individual data show significant variability, highlighting the importance of avoiding aggregation to prevent bias. Controlling for all time-related changes is challenging, with potential factors like transaction costs and asset price discrepancies leading to overstated estimates. Despite concerns, many researchers consider aggregate time series results more reliable due to severe issues with individual data sets. The effective capital gains tax rate is a key variable in regression analysis, but it is actually influenced by the amount of realizations itself, posing a serious econometric problem. Different techniques, such as using the first dollar tax rate or maximum statutory rates, could be used to address this issue. The effective capital gains tax rate in regression analysis is influenced by the amount of realizations. Various techniques can be used to address this econometric problem, such as the first dollar tax rate, maximum statutory rates, predicted gains, or instrumental variables methods. Endogeneity issues are more severe in individual cross-section data compared to aggregate time series data. The endogeneity issues with explanatory variables are more severe in individual cross-section data compared to aggregate time series data. The problem of distinguishing between permanent and transitory responses is also important when using individual data. fluctuations in income and tax rates over time can lead individuals to time realizations to coincide with periods of low tax rates. Since income and tax rates fluctuate over time, individuals may try to time realizations to coincide with low rates. Attempts to address this issue with panel studies have limitations, as lower income periods can persist for years. Studies on realizations since the 1980s have been reviewed. Studies since the 1980s have reviewed realizations, with one study using a six-year small panel to replicate previous studies and finding varying elasticities. Slemrod and Shobe (1990) conducted a study using a six-year small panel to replicate previous studies on elasticities. They found large elasticities, confirming potential issues with previous studies and highlighting problems with short panels. The study by Slemrod and Shobe (1990) found large elasticities in their six-year small panel study, similar to previous research from the 1980s. However, their results were statistically insignificant and may capture transitory effects. These results were excluded from further analysis. The study by Gillingham and Greenlees (1992) extends a previous time series analysis covering 1954-1985, making changes in approaches used by CBO to replicate results. They use an instrumental variables technique with taxes on predicted gains as an instrument. The authors made three changes to the CBO study. First, they used an instrumental variables technique with taxes on predicted gains. This increased the coefficient and elasticity. Second, they suggested using the maximum tax rate as an instrument, further increasing the coefficient and elasticity. They also argued for better data utilization. The authors made several adjustments to the CBO study, including using an instrumental variables technique with taxes on predicted gains and the maximum tax rate. They also argued for better data utilization and extended the time period through 1989. The authors used instrumental variables technique with taxes on predicted gains and the maximum tax rate, extending the time period through 1989. Excluding 1986, they found estimates of 3.4 and 3.5 using the predicted gains instrument, and 5.4 and 5.3 for the maximum rate, with corresponding elasticities. The authors used instrumental variables technique with taxes on predicted gains and the maximum tax rate, extending the time period through 1989. Excluding 1986, they found estimates of 3.4 and 3.5 using the predicted gains instrument, and 5.4 and 5.3 for the maximum rate, with corresponding elasticities. The crucial issue is whether to use the predicted gains rate or the maximum rate as an instrument for this time-series regression. The authors argue that micro-data approaches are superior. Using the maximum rate as an instrument for time-series regression poses problems due to changes in the law over time. The coefficient of 3.4 is reported in Table 1. The Burman and Randolph study is considered innovative for separating permanent and transitory effects. The Burman and Randolph study, considered innovative, separated permanent and transitory effects using state tax rates. The authors included the first dollar current tax rate as an instrument for transitory effects. Taxpayers with low current income would have transitory rates below their permanent rates, while those with high income would have higher rates. The authors separated permanent and transitory effects using state tax rates. They included the first dollar current tax rate as an instrument for transitory effects, with taxpayers experiencing varying rates based on their income levels. The estimated elasticity was not statistically significant due to limited variation in tax rates, but a transitory elasticity of 6.45 was observed. The study estimated an elasticity of 0.22 at a 22% tax rate, with a transitory elasticity of 6.45. Other studies also used state tax rates to analyze permanent responses, with an elasticity of 0.65 reported. The study by Auerbach and Siegel (2000) replicated results from Burman and Randolph using panel data from 1985 to 1994. They found an elasticity of 0.33 at the mean tax rate. Auerbach and Siegel (2000) replicated Burman and Randolph's results using panel data from 1985 to 1994. They found an elasticity of 0.33 at the mean tax rate, with a coefficient of 1.126 at a 25% tax rate. They also reported a transitory elasticity of 4.9 at a 22% rate. Auerbach and Siegel replicated Burman and Randolph's results, finding a transitory elasticity of 4.9 at a 22% tax rate. They also reported a higher permanent elasticity of 1.75 compared to 0.33. This magnitude of elasticity is similar to that found in studies in the 1980s. However, their approach may add a transitory element to the permanent tax rate. The 1.126 coefficient is reported in Table 1, indicating a larger elasticity due to the addition of the current first dollar rate. A separate regression for very wealthy and \"sophisticated\" taxpayers showed essentially no response. Eichner and Sinai's findings using the Burman and Randolph methodology are discussed. The study by Eichner and Sinai (2000) found no response from very wealthy and sophisticated taxpayers when analyzing sales of complex financial products. Excluding certain years from the analysis resulted in a coefficient of 2.18, indicating an elasticity of 0.48 at a 22% tax rate. The coefficient is 2.28, with an elasticity of 0.5. Excluding 1997 has some significance. In a semi-log specification, excluding both years results in a coefficient of 2.18, implying an elasticity of 0.48 at a 22% tax rate. Various specifications were attempted, including an instrumental variables method using the top marginal tax rate, yielding an estimate of 3.8 and an elasticity of 0.84. Excluding 1997 led to a coefficient of 5.13 and an elasticity of 1.13. Using the top marginal tax rate poses challenges due to differences with the average tax rate. The coefficient changes when excluding 1997, ranging from 2.18 to 5.13 with elasticities between 0.48 and 1.13. Different specifications with changes in tax rates resulted in elasticities from 0.83 to 1.46, but many coefficients were not statistically significant. This approach may reflect more temporary factors. The analysis of tax rate changes resulted in elasticities ranging from 0.83 to 1.46, with many coefficients not statistically significant. The 2.28 coefficient is reported in Table 1, reflecting more transitory elements. Auten and Joulfaian (2004) used a longer micro-data panel to estimate permanent and transitory effects, similar to panel studies of the 1980s. The analysis by Auten and Joulfaian (2004) uses a longer micro-data panel to estimate permanent and transitory effects of state tax rates. Their estimate shows a lower elasticity compared to studies from the 1980s, possibly due to time series elements. They find an elasticity of 0.72 at a 20% tax rate and 0.79 at a 22% tax rate. The Evans study conducted a cross-section regression using public use file data to estimate elasticities typically between 2 and 5, with an elasticity of 0.72 at a 20% tax rate and 0.79 at a 22% tax rate. The study by Bakija and Gentry (2014) uses a 50-year panel of state data with changes in combined federal and state tax rates, aggregated by state with fixed effects. The main concern is the limitations of cross-section studies and the inability to interpret findings as permanent realizations elasticities. Bakija and Gentry (2014) study uses a 50-year panel of state data on changes in federal and state tax rates, with state- and time-fixed effects. The identification for the effects comes from changes in state marginal tax rates. Tests show omitting fixed effects raises elasticities. Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen (2015) use standard panel methods in their study. The study by Dowd, McClelland, and Muthitacharoen (2015) examines the effects of changing specifications on elasticities, finding that omitting state-fixed effects and year-fixed effects raises the elasticities. The study uses a 10-year panel with year-fixed effects to control for transitory effects from law changes. Sensitivity analysis with different specifications and time subperiods is also provided. The study by Minas, Lim, and Evans (2018) uses Australian data from 1988 to 2015 to analyze the effects of capital gains tax changes. It includes year-fixed effects to control for transitory effects from law changes and provides sensitivity analysis with different specifications and time subperiods.
