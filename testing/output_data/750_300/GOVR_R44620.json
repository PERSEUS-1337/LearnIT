    "content": "A biologic or biological product is a therapeutic drug or vaccine made from living organisms like human, animal, yeast, or microorganisms. They consist of proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, or cells used in transplantation. Biosimilars are similar but not identical to brand-name biologics made by pharmaceutical companies. A follow-on biologic is a drug similar but not identical to the brand-name biologic, made by a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company. Unlike chemical drugs, biologics are made from living organisms and are more complex in structure. The molecular structure of a commonly used chemical drug is much smaller and simpler than a biologic drug. For example, aspirin has nine carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and four oxygen atoms, while Remicade, a biologic drug, has over 6,000 carbon atoms, almost 10,000 hydrogen atoms, and about 2,000 oxygen atoms. Inflectra, a biosimilar to Remicade, was FDA approved in April 2016. The FDA regulates both biologics and chemical drugs through the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). The FDA regulates biologics and chemical drugs through the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). CBER oversees traditional biologics, gene therapy products, cellular therapy products, and human tissue used in transplantation. CDER regulates prescription brand-name and generic drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and most therapeutic products. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) regulates prescription brand-name and generic drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and most therapeutic biologics, including monoclonal antibodies like infliximab used to treat Crohn's disease. Monoclonal antibodies like infliximab, cytokines, and growth factors are regulated by CDER. Monoclonal antibodies bind to specific substances in the body and can carry drugs. Cytokines control the immune system and are used to fight cancer and infections. Growth factors regulate cell division and survival. Biologics and biosimilars are substances that stimulate or suppress the immune system to help fight cancer, infections, and other diseases. They include interleukins, interferons, colony-stimulating factors, growth factors like somatropin, enzymes that speed up chemical reactions in the body, and immunomodulators like vaccines. Enzyme inhibitors may also be used in cancer treatment to block enzymes needed for cancer cell growth. Enzyme inhibitors and immunomodulators like vaccines are used in cancer treatment to block enzymes needed for cancer cell growth and stimulate the immune system to fight diseases. Biologics and biosimilars, referred to as specialty drugs, require special handling and are usually administered via injection or infusion into the bloodstream. Specialty drugs were previously dispensed by pharmacies with specialized facilities and personnel. Biologics, also known as specialty drugs, are administered via injection or infusion into the bloodstream. These drugs require special handling and are expensive, with some biologic medications costing over $250,000 per patient annually. Spending on biologics has been increasing. The annual cost of certain biologic medications, like Soliris and Vimizim, can exceed $250,000 per patient. Spending on biologics in the United States reached $105.5 billion in 2016, with a 13% increase from the previous year. Biologics subject to biosimilar competition accounted for $3.2 billion in spending, with original biologics accounting for $2.9 billion and biosimilars for $0.3 billion. Biologics spending has been increasing by 10% annually since 2011. In 2016, biologics spending in the United States was $105.5 billion, with $2.9 billion spent on original biologics and $0.3 billion on biosimilars. Biologics spending has been increasing by 10% annually since 2011. Medicare Part B program spending has been driven by increases in biologics, which accounted for 63% of prescription drug spending in 2014. Biologic drugs are often more expensive in the United States compared to Europe and Canada. In 2016, biologics spending in the United States was $105.5 billion, with $2.9 billion spent on original biologics and $0.3 billion on biosimilars. Biologics spending has been increasing by 10% annually since 2011. Medicare Part B program spending has been driven by increases in biologics, which accounted for 63% of prescription drug spending in 2014. Biologic drugs are often more expensive in the United States than in Europe and Canada, with biosimilars in Europe reducing prices for biologics by up to 33%. Congress has made efforts to lower the price of chemical drugs through legislation like the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act. The 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act was passed by Congress to lower drug prices by allowing FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, resulting in a 61% price reduction for one drug in Portugal. This Act has been successful in providing lower-cost alternatives for biologics as well. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows FDA approval of generic chemical drugs, reducing drug prices by 60% to 90% for consumers. Generic drug companies save costs by avoiding clinical trials and initial research expenses. They must prove to the FDA that their product is identical to the original before marketing. Generic drug companies save costs by avoiding clinical trials and initial research expenses incurred by brand-name manufacturers. They must demonstrate to the FDA that their product is identical to the original before marketing, allowing them to rely on the FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness. Generic drugs are considered interchangeable with their reference (brand-name) drug and other generics using the same reference. The sponsor of the generic drug must also meet manufacturing process standards and reporting requirements. The biotechnology industry developed its first human therapeutic agents in the 1980s, including human insulin, human growth hormone, alpha interferon, tissue plasminogen activator, and erythropoietin. In 1982, FDA approved the first human drug developed by the biotechnology industry, human insulin (Humulin-R), followed by human growth hormone (Protropin) in 1985, alpha interferon (Intron-A) in 1986, tissue plasminogen activator (Activase) in 1987, and erythropoietin (Epogen) in 1989. Biological products are regulated by FDA through a biologics license application (BLA) under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Regulatory responsibility for biological products was transferred from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to FDA in 1972. After the transfer of regulatory responsibility from the NIH to the FDA in 1972, biological products are now regulated under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). The approval of chemical prescription drugs is done through the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) via new drug applications (NDA) or abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA). The Hatch-Waxman Act allowed for the approval of generic drugs under the FFDCA but did not include a mechanism for follow-on biologics/biosimilars under the PHSA. Consequently, companies could only submit follow-on biologics applications for FDA review after the Hatch-Waxman Act. After the transfer of regulatory responsibility from the NIH to the FDA in 1972, biological products are now regulated under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). The Hatch-Waxman Act allowed for the approval of generic drugs under the FFDCA but did not include a mechanism for follow-on biologics/biosimilars under the PHSA. Companies were effectively blocked from submitting follow-on applications for therapeutic biologics licensed under the PHSA. In 1941, Congress gave the FDA authority over marketing insulin, a small protein regulating sugar metabolism. Despite being similar to biologics, insulin was regulated as a drug, not a biologic by NIH. Insulin, along with a few other natural source biological products, was regulated as a drug by the FDA rather than as a biologic by the NIH. Other products included glucagon, human growth hormone, hormones for infertility, menopause, osteoporosis, and certain medical enzymes. Despite similarities with biologics, these products were treated as drugs under the FFDCA. The FDA lacked clear regulatory authority to approve biosimilars for specialty biologic drug products, leading to market competition issues as patent protection approached expiration. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association advocated for FDA to establish a regulatory system for biosimilars, while the Biotechnology Industry Organization filed a citizen petition with the FDA. The FDA lacked clear regulatory authority for biosimilar approval, leading to market competition issues. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association advocated for FDA to establish a regulatory system, while the Biotechnology Industry Organization filed a petition hindering biosimilar approval. In contrast, Europe had fewer barriers, with the European Medicines Agency authorizing the first biosimilar in 2006, followed by several more in subsequent years. In April 2006, the European Medicines Agency authorized the first biosimilar product, Omnitrope, for marketing in Europe. The FDA approved Omnitrope in the United States in June 2006 after a court ruling in favor of Sandoz, the sponsor. Many more biosimilar products were authorized in Europe and the US in the following years. The court ruled in favor of Sandoz, the sponsor of Omnitrope, stating that the FDA must consider the application submitted in 2003. The 505(b)(2) pathway was used to approve Omnitrope in 2006. The 505(b)(2) pathway, established by the Hatch-Waxman Act, was utilized for the approval of Omnitrope in 2006. The FDA stated that this approval did not set a precedent for other follow-on biologic drugs, indicating that Congress would need to amend the law for approval of similar products. In 2010, Congress created a new regulatory pathway under Section 351(k) of the PHSA for biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. In March 2010, Congress established a new regulatory authority for FDA via the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009, allowing for an abbreviated licensure pathway for biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. FDA was also authorized to collect user fees from the industry. Under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009, FDA was given authority to approve biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The terms biosimilar and interchangeable are defined by FDA. A biological product can be considered biosimilar if it is highly similar to the reference product with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. The FDA defines biosimilar products as being \"highly similar\" to the reference product with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. To be considered interchangeable, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any patient, with no greater risk in alternating or switching between the two products. The FDA defines biosimilar products as being \"highly similar\" to the reference product with no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity, and potency. Interchangeable products may be substituted for the reference product by a pharmacist without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider. FDA held a public meeting in 2010 to gather input before releasing guidance on the new biosimilars pathway. The FDA held a public meeting in November 2010 to gather perspectives from industry and the public before developing guidance on the biosimilars pathway. Three draft guidance documents were released in February 2012, with final guidance issued in April 2015. Additional guidance on biosimilars has also been released by the FDA. The FDA released guidance documents on biosimilars in April 2015, outlining the requirements for companies seeking to market these products in the US. The application process involves submitting data from analytical, animal, and clinical studies to demonstrate biosimilarity. The agency may determine certain studies are unnecessary for approval. The FDA requires companies to submit data from analytical, animal, and clinical studies to demonstrate biosimilarity for approval. Any changes to the manufacturing process must be demonstrated for comparability to maintain product quality. For example, Remicade underwent 37 manufacturing changes. The FDA requires demonstration of comparability for product quality attributes before and after manufacturing changes. Remicade underwent 37 changes between 1998 and October 2014, each requiring a demonstration of comparability through various assays. FDA and the drug industry manage variability in biological products effectively. The FDA and drug industry manage variability in biological products effectively. FDA has approved seven biosimilars for marketing in the United States, but sales of five biosimilars have been delayed by brand-name manufacturers. Patent infringement lawsuits have delayed the marketing launch of three U.S. biosimilars. Pfizer has FDA approval to market biosimilar Inflectra. The marketing launch of three U.S. biosimilars is being delayed by patent infringement lawsuits filed by brand-name manufacturers. Pfizer has FDA approval to market biosimilar Inflectra and has sued Johnson & Johnson for anticompetitive tactics. Such practices could negatively impact sales of another recently approved biosimilar, Renflexis. The high costs of pharmaceuticals, especially biologics, have sparked interest in the government's role in developing new therapeutics. Six out of seven biosimilars were originally discovered by scientists at public-sector research institutions. In March 2015, FDA approved Zarxio (filgrastim-sndz), the first biosimilar product in the US, marketed by Sandoz Inc. It is biosimilar to Neupogen (filgrastim) by Amgen Inc. In March 2015, FDA approved Zarxio, the first biosimilar in the US, marketed by Sandoz Inc. It is biosimilar to Neupogen by Amgen Inc. Zarxio is approved for the same indications as Neupogen. In April 2016, FDA approved a second biosimilar, Inflectra, which is biosimilar to Remicade by Janssen Biotech, Inc. In April 2016, FDA approved a second biosimilar, Inflectra (infliximab-dyyb), which is biosimilar to Remicade (infliximab) by Janssen Biotech, Inc. Inflectra is made by Celltrion, Inc., in the Republic of Korea, for Pfizer. In late November 2016, Pfizer began marketing the biosimilar Inflectra in the United States at a price 15% below Remicade. Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J in September 2017 alleging anticompetitive practices related to biosimilar-exclusion contracts. Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J for anticompetitive practices involving exclusionary contracts with health insurers, threatening to withhold rebates unless they agreed to block coverage for Inflectra and other biosimilars. The rebate incentivizes insurers to prefer J&J's higher-priced Remicade over Pfizer's biosimilar. The rebate offered by J&J for Remicade creates a financial incentive for insurers to prefer the brand-name drug over Pfizer's biosimilar, Inflectra. This tactic, known as a \"rebate trap,\" involves withdrawing rebates on the brand-name drug if the biosimilar manufacturer offers a substantial price discount to insurers. The branded manufacturer can respond to the price discount offered by the biosimilar by creating a \"rebate trap,\" where withdrawing rebates on the branded biologic doubles the payer's cost for patients. Even with a 60% lower price for the biosimilar, if only 50% of patients switch, payer costs increase due to the rebate trap. The rebate trap can increase payer costs even with a 60% lower price for the biosimilar if only 50% of patients switch from the branded biologic. To avoid this trap, a near-complete switch of patient users from the branded biologic to the biosimilar is necessary, but many chronic diseases have a low proportion of new patients to the therapy. According to Pfizer's lawsuit, providers have declined to purchase Inflectra for patients covered by insurance plans, with about 90% of healthcare providers using infliximab not purchasing any Inflectra at all as of September 1, 2017. The lawsuit states that healthcare providers have declined to purchase Inflectra, with almost no national commercial health insurer covering the product. Inflectra has secured less than 4% of total infliximab unit sales in the US since its FDA approval in April 2016. J&J has raised the list price of Remicade by close to 9% and increased government reimbursements by over $190 per dose. If J&J's anticompetitive practices continue, Pfizer warns of further consequences. In April 2016, J&J raised the list price of Remicade by close to 9% and increased government reimbursements by over $190 per dose. Pfizer filed a lawsuit against J&J for anticompetitive practices, stating that these tactics could hinder competition in the biologic market. J&J's president of Janssen Biotech, Scott White, defended their pricing strategy, claiming they are competing on value and price. In response to the Pfizer lawsuit, J&J's Scott White defended their pricing strategy, stating that competition is bringing down the cost of Remicade. FDA approved a third biosimilar, Erelzi, which is biosimilar to Enbrel. In August 2016, FDA approved Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, manufactured by Sandoz. Enbrel, originally discovered by scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital, is one of the top-selling drugs in the world. Erelzi is approved for all indications on the Enbrel label. Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, is one of the top-selling drugs in the world and in the United States. The approval of Erelzi is based on comprehensive data confirming its similarity to the US-licensed reference product, Enbrel. Clinical studies included comparative pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers and an effectiveness and safety study in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. Erelzi, a biosimilar to Enbrel, has been approved based on studies in healthy volunteers and patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. The release date for marketing is pending due to a lawsuit filed by Amgen against Sandoz and Novartis. Another biosimilar, Amjevita, has also been approved as a biosimilar to Humira. In April 2018, a trial is scheduled for Amjevita, a biosimilar to Humira, approved by the FDA in September 2016. Humira, a top-selling drug, was originally discovered by scientists at Rockefeller University and Scripps. Abbott Laboratories was licensed by the FDA in 2002 to market Humira. Amjevita is approved for 7 indications, while Humira is approved for 10 indications. Amjevita, a biosimilar to Humira, was approved for 7 indications, while Humira is approved for 10 indications. Due to patent infringement litigation, Amjevita may not be available until 2018. FDA approved Renflexis, a biosimilar to Remicade, in April 2017. Renflexis is a biosimilar to Remicade, approved by the FDA in April 2017. It is made by Samsung Bioepsis and launched in partnership with Merck in the United States at a price 35% lower than Remicade. In August 2017, FDA approved Cyltezo, a biosimilar to Humira, manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim. Humira was originally discovered by scientists at Rockefeller University and Scripps. Abbott Laboratories was licensed by FDA in 2002. Cyltezo, a biosimilar to Humira (adalimumab) manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim, is facing a launch delay due to a lawsuit filed by AbbVie alleging patent infringement. FDA approved Mvasi, a biosimilar to Avastin (bevacizumab) made by Amgen, in September 2017. AbbVie filed a lawsuit against BI on August 2, 2017, alleging infringement of eight Humira patents, delaying the launch of Cyltezo. In September 2017, FDA approved Mvasi, a biosimilar to Avastin manufactured by Amgen. Avastin, a top-selling drug in the US, is marketed by Genentech. The proprietary name of a drug product is the trademarked name used for marketing, usually capitalized with a superscript R in a circle (\u00ae). The Purple Book lists biological products licensed by FDA under the PHS Act, including biosimilar and interchangeable products, with the date of licensure. Appendix D provides examples of proprietary names for CDER and CBER licensed biological products. The Purple Book lists FDA licensed biological products, including biosimilars and interchangeables, with their licensure dates. Appendix D provides examples of proprietary names for these products. The nonproprietary name, also known as the generic name, is used in drug labeling and regulation. FDA released guidance on nonproprietary naming of biological products in August 2015, finalized in January 2017. The FDA released guidance on the nonproprietary naming of biological products in August 2015, finalized on January 12, 2017. The guidance provides the FDA's rationale for naming conventions for biosimilars, using the term \"proper name\" instead of \"nonproprietary name\" as per the PHSA. The nonproprietary name designated for each originator biological product, related biological product, and biosimilar product will be a proper name combining the core name. The FDA guidance on naming biological products specifies a naming convention using a core name and a unique four-letter suffix devoid of meaning. The core name, like filgrastim, is combined with the suffix, such as filgrastim-xzwy, for identification. FDA is still deciding on the suffix format for interchangeable products. For originator biological products, FDA will use a core name as the reference product's name. The FDA is considering a unique suffix format for interchangeable products. In Europe, reference drugs and biosimilars use the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) system. WHO selects INNs based on expert advice. In Europe, reference drugs and biosimilars use the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) system, selected by the WHO. The WHO released the Biological Qualifier (BQ) proposal in 2016 to uniquely identify biological substances for prescription and dispensing of medicines. The Biological Qualifier (BQ) is an independent code used with the INN to uniquely identify biological substances for prescription and pharmacovigilance. There is a debate between biosimilar industry groups and innovator companies on naming schemes for biologic products. The Federal Trade Commission expressed concerns about FDA's naming proposal in October 2015. Innovator companies prefer a naming scheme that distinguishes between reference biologic products and biosimilars. The Federal Trade Commission expressed concern that FDA's naming proposal could lead to physicians incorrectly believing biosimilars differ significantly from reference biologics, potentially hindering market development and competition. The FTC expressed concern that FDA's naming proposal could deter physicians from prescribing biosimilars, impeding market development and competition. Historically, all originator biologics with the same nonproprietary name have similarities in pharmacological and chemical relationships. The FDA's proposal aims to use the same USAN for each biosimilar and its reference biologic. The FDA's proposal to use the same nonproprietary name for biosimilars and their reference biologics may lead to misconceptions about their differences, potentially impacting physician prescribing habits and market competition. Participants at an FTC workshop on biosimilars argue that differences in nonproprietary names could lead to misconceptions about biosimilars being identical to reference biologics, instilling fear and misunderstanding. Physicians need to understand that variability is inherent in biologics, even within the same product batches. The labeling of prescription drug products provides crucial information on safety and effectiveness. The labeling for prescription drug products conveys safety and effectiveness information to healthcare providers, allowing them to determine if the product is suitable for a specific patient. FDA issued a final rule in 2006 on the content and format of labeling for prescription drug products, including biological products. The FDA issued a final rule in 2006 on the content and format of labeling for prescription drug products, including biological products. Prescription drug product labeling contains information necessary for safe and effective use, approved by the FDA based on thorough analysis of the NDA or BLA submitted by the applicant. It is written for healthcare practitioners for professional supervision. The FDA requires prescription drug labeling to include essential information for safe and effective use, tailored for healthcare practitioners. This includes a highlights section with warnings, indications, dosage, contraindications, warnings, adverse reactions, drug interactions, and other necessary details. The FDA requires prescription drug labeling to include essential information for safe and effective use, tailored for healthcare practitioners. This includes indications, dosage, contraindications, warnings, adverse reactions, drug interactions, and other necessary details. FDA released draft guidance on biosimilar labeling in March 2016, recommending a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in the highlights section. The biosimilar product is not required to have the same labeling as the reference product. FDA released guidance on biosimilar labeling in March 2016, recommending a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in the highlights section. The biosimilar product is not required to have the same labeling as the reference product, and comparative data should not be included in the labeling to avoid confusion. Comments on the FDA guidance showed differing views. The FDA guidance on biosimilar labeling recommends a \"Biosimilarity Statement\" in the highlights section. The generic industry prefers less information in biosimilar labeling, while the brand-name industry wants more. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association (now called the Association for Accessible Medicines) finds the Biosimilarity Statement unnecessary and potentially confusing, while BIO, representing brand-name pharmaceutical makers, supports more information in labeling. The Generic Pharmaceutical Association (now called the Association for Accessible Medicines) opposes the Biosimilarity Statement in biosimilar labeling, deeming it unnecessary and potentially confusing to patients and healthcare providers. In contrast, BIO, representing brand-name pharmaceutical makers, supports providing more information in labeling to ensure transparency for prescribing physicians. Under the BPCIA, biological products approved as drugs under the FFDCA will transition to biological licenses under the PHSA in March 2020. This provision affects a small set of biological products such as insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, infertility treatments, menopause and osteoporosis hormones, and certain enzymes. FDA released draft guidance on biosimilarity labeling transparency for prescribers. The FDA released draft guidance in March 2016 regarding the transition of certain biological products to biological licenses under the PHSA by March 2020. This includes products like insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, infertility treatments, menopause and osteoporosis hormones, and certain enzymes. The FDA guidance released in March 2016 outlines the transition of certain biological products to biological licenses under the PHSA by March 2020. This includes products like insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, infertility treatments, menopause and osteoporosis hormones, and certain enzymes. The guidance specifies that a marketing application for a biological product must be submitted under section 351 of the PHS Act, with an exception allowing submission under section 505 of the FD&C Act until March 23, 2020, for products approved under section 505 before March 23, 2010. An application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&C Act must be submitted by March 23, 2010. However, if there is a biological product approved under section 351(a) of the PHS Act that could be a \"reference product,\" an application under section 505 cannot be submitted. An approved application under section 505 will be considered a license under section 351 of the PHS Act by March 23, 2020. Applications for biological products approved under the FD&C Act will no longer exist after this date. The FDA's interpretation states that applications for biological products approved under the FD&C Act will no longer exist after March 23, 2020, and will be replaced by approved BLAs under the PHSA. Any pending applications for biological products subject to the transition provisions should be withdrawn and resubmitted under the PHSA. The FDA's interpretation states that applications for biological products approved under the FD&C Act will no longer exist after March 23, 2020, and will be replaced by approved BLAs under the PHSA. The FDA suggests that pending applications be withdrawn and resubmitted under the PHSA, which may cause delays in the approval and availability of competing biological products. Additionally, any unexpired exclusivity associated with an approved NDA for a biological product subject to the BPCI Act would cease to have any effect. The FDA's interpretation states that any unexpired period of exclusivity associated with an approved NDA for a biological product subject to the BPCI Act would cease to have any effect after March 23, 2020. However, orphan drug exclusivity would still apply to the drug for the protected use. Industry groups, like the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, have raised concerns about the FDA's policy. The FDA's policy on exclusivity can block drug approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act or biological product licensing under section 351 of the PHS Act. Industry groups, including the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, have raised legal and trade concerns. Transitional biological products are not eligible for the 12-year biologics exclusivity period if not first licensed under the PHSA as per the BPCIA. The FDA's policy on exclusivity can block drug approval under section 505 of the FD&C Act or biological product licensing under section 351 of the PHS Act. Industry groups have raised concerns about the 12-year biologics exclusivity period for transitional biological products not first licensed under the PHSA as per the BPCIA. The FDA states that this exclusivity period could impede biosimilar or interchangeable product competition until 2032. Interchangeable products can be substituted for the reference product by a pharmacist without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider. Generic drugs are considered interchangeable with their reference drug and other generics using the same reference drug. After the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act, pharmacists were allowed to substitute generic drugs for brand-name drugs without the need for a healthcare provider's intervention. However, assessing interchangeability for biosimilars is a separate process. In January 2017, the FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability. The FDA released draft guidance on interchangeability for biosimilars in January 2017. The comment period for this guidance was extended to May 19, 2017. The FDA has not yet approved an interchangeable product. In Europe, the EMA evaluates biosimilar medicines for authorization but does not make determinations on interchangeability. The EMA evaluates biosimilar medicines for authorization but does not recommend interchangeability. Individual member states decide their own policies on interchangeability, with some allowing interchangeability unless proven otherwise. In the United States, FDA regulates the drug product while states regulate interchangeability. In the United States, FDA regulates drug products while states regulate pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), 37 states have considered legislation on biosimilar substitution, with 27 states and Puerto Rico enacting varying provisions. In the United States, 27 states and Puerto Rico have enacted legislation regarding biosimilar substitution, with varying provisions. FDA gained authority to collect user fees from manufacturers of brand-name drugs and biological products in 1992 through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). This agreement included performance goals and the use of fees. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) allowed FDA to negotiate performance goals with industry and use fees from prescription drug user fees to support new product application reviews. This increased FDA staff and reduced review times for standard applications. Congress later granted similar authority for medical devices, animal drugs, and generic human drugs. The FDA utilized user fees to increase staff for application reviews and reduce review times. Congress extended this authority to medical devices, animal drugs, and generic human drugs. User fees accounted for 43% of the FY2016 FDA budget. The Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 allowed FDA to collect fees for biosimilar reviews from 2012 to 2017. Under BsUFA I, FDA collected fees from industry for biosimilar product development activities from October 2012 to September 2017. The program included fees for products in the development phase to generate revenue and provide assistance to industry sponsors in the early stages of developing biosimilar products. The Biosimilar Product Development (BPD) program aims to generate fee revenue and assist companies in early biosimilar product development. There are 64 BPD programs for 23 reference products as of February 2017. Companies can opt out but need to pay a reactivation fee. Small businesses may have the biosimilar biological product application fee waived for their first application. The Biosimilar Product Development program allows companies to opt out of the biosimilar biological product development program, with the option to pay a reactivation fee to resume. The FDA provides information on BsUFA fees collected annually and how they are spent. The five-year biosimilars user fee authority was set to expire on October 1, 2017, leading to discussions for the reauthorization of the program - BsUFA II. The Biosimilar Product Development program allows companies to opt out of the biosimilar biological product development program, with the option to pay a reactivation fee to resume. FDA provides information on BsUFA fees and their spending. BsUFA II program reauthorization process involved public meetings, negotiation sessions with industry, draft agreement posting, and final recommendation submission to Congress for reauthorization. The Biosimilar User Fee Act (BsUFA) II program was reauthorized through the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017. FDA faced challenges in meeting BsUFA I goals due to staffing issues. President Trump signed the reauthorization into law on August 18, 2017. FDA faced challenges in achieving BsUFA I goals for advisory meetings with industry due to lack of staff. The new hiring authorities in the 21st Century Cures Act will strengthen staff capacity and modernize hiring practices. The FDA has implemented enhancements to increase resources capacity and improve recruitment and retention of scientific staffing to meet performance goals and lower healthcare costs under BsUFA II. Changes include dropping supplement and establishment fees, retaining BPD fees, and renaming the product fee to BsUFA Program fee with a limit of five assessments per sponsor. Under BsUFA II, healthcare costs are being addressed by dropping supplement and establishment fees, retaining BPD fees, and renaming the product fee to BsUFA Program fee with a limit of five assessments per sponsor. The FDA and industry estimate a need of approximately $45 million in FY2018 to cover BsUFA program costs, with a possible adjustment not exceeding $9 million. The FDA and industry estimate that approximately $45 million will be needed in FY2018 to cover the BsUFA program costs, with a possible adjustment not exceeding $9 million. The federal government focuses more on basic or preclinical research, while the pharmaceutical industry directs more research funding towards clinical trials. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements can be challenging when distinguishing between basic and applied research. The pharmaceutical industry focuses on clinical trials over discovery research. Distinguishing credit for therapeutic advancements between basic and applied research is challenging. Concerns over high drug costs have prompted a closer look at the federal role in developing new therapeutics. Studies have tried to quantify the impact of publicly funded research on new drug discovery. Some studies have analyzed the contribution of publicly funded research to new drug discovery. One study found that a small percentage of new drugs approved by the FDA originated from non-industry sources. Another study focused on innovative new drugs, known as new molecular entities (NMEs). Between 1998 and 2007, 24.1% of new molecular entities and new biologics approved by the FDA originated from publicly funded work. Another study in 2011 by Stevens et al. claimed to be more comprehensive, finding that 1,541 drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 onwards had origins in various sources. The Stevens study in 2011 found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from publicly funded research. Of the 348 applications granted priority review, 19% came from publicly funded labs. The authors found that 46.2% of new-drug applications from public-sector research institutions received priority reviews, compared to 20.0% from private-sector research. This suggests that drugs discovered by public-sector research institutions are more likely to be considered significant improvements by the FDA. The authors found that drugs discovered by public-sector research institutions are more likely to be considered significant improvements by the FDA, with potential for important clinical effects. The 2011 Stevens study defined the role of Public Sector Research Institutions (PSRIs) in drug discovery and commercialization. The 2011 Stevens study highlighted the importance of Public Sector Research Institutions (PSRIs) in drug discovery and commercialization. It emphasized that drugs discovered by PSRIs are more likely to be considered significant improvements by the FDA, with potential for important clinical effects. The study excluded the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies that have led to the creation of new drug classes. The study excluded platform technologies developed with public funds, such as recombinant DNA technology, bacterial production methods, antibody production methods, glycosylated protein production methods, and gene silencing methods, as they were not used to develop specific drug candidates by PSRI scientists. The study excluded platform technologies developed with public funds, such as recombinant DNA technology, bacterial production methods, antibody production methods, glycosylated protein production methods, and gene silencing methods, as they were not used to develop specific drug candidates by PSRI scientists. These platform technologies enabled the development of many FDA-approved products, and without them, many new drugs would not have been developed, impacting the pharmaceutical industry economically. According to Stevens et al., 2011, 36 biologic drugs were discovered at least in part by PSRIs in the past 40 years. The pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by the discovery of 36 biologic drugs by PSRIs in the past 40 years. Biological products are regulated under the Public Health Service Act, while chemical drugs are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This section provides a brief history of these acts and relevant laws related to biologics. The FDA regulates chemical drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was the first national regulation for biologics, setting new precedents for pre-market government review. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 was groundbreaking as the first premarket approval statute in history, shifting from post-market to pre-market government review. It focused on the manufacturing process of biological products in response to deaths from tetanus contamination. Facilities had to be inspected before a federal license was issued to market them. The Biologics Control Act of 1902 required facilities manufacturing biological products to be inspected before a federal license was issued. It predated the Pure Food and Drugs Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which replaced the former in 1938. The Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906 focused on controlling new drugs for safety but lacked controls over manufacturing establishments. It was replaced by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938, which required drug manufacturers to submit a new drug application demonstrating safety before marketing. The Biologics Control Act was revised with the Public Health Service Act in 1944, specifying that licensed biological products are subject to regulation. The Biologics Control Act was revised and recodified in 1944 under the Public Health Service Act, specifying that licensed biological products are subject to regulation under the FFDCA. A biological product is defined as a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, vaccine, blood component, or analogous product for the prevention, treatment, or cure of human diseases. The Public Health Service Act regulates biological products like vaccines, blood components, and allergenic products for disease prevention or treatment. These products may also fall under the definition of drugs for diagnosis, cure, or prevention of diseases in humans or animals. The Public Health Service Act regulates biological products like vaccines, blood components, and allergenic products for disease prevention or treatment. Most biological products under the PHSA also meet the definition of a drug under the FFDCA. The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 amended the PHSA to require a single biological license application (BLA) instead of separate licenses. The Public Health Service Act (PHSA) was amended by the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) to require a single Biological License Application (BLA) for biological products. The PHSA allows for immediate license suspension in case of public health danger. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) of 2009, part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), established a licensure pathway for biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, creating a licensure pathway for biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. It also established FDA-administered regulatory exclusivity periods and procedures for resolving patent disputes. Regulatory responsibility for biologics was initially delegated to the Hygienic Laboratory after the 1902 Biologics Act. Regulatory responsibility for biologics was transferred from the NIH to the FDA in 1972. The FDA's Bureau of Drugs and Bureau of Biologics merged in 1982 to form the National Center for Drugs and Biologics. In 1988, the Center for Drugs and Biologics split into CDER and CBER. In 1988, the Center for Drugs and Biologics split into the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). CBER moved to the new FDA headquarters in October 2014. Determining jurisdictional status of biotechnology products has been challenging for the FDA and industry. In 1991, FDA established an Intercenter Agreement between CBER and CDER to regulate traditional biologics and biotechnology products. FDA announced in 2002 its intention to reorganize the review process for these products. The FDA reorganized review responsibilities in 2002, transferring most therapeutic biologics from CBER to CDER. This allowed CBER to focus on vaccines, blood safety, gene therapy, and tissue transplantation. On June 30, 2003, responsibility for most therapeutic biologics was transferred from CBER to CDER. Biological products transferred to CDER are regulated as licensed biologics under Section 351 of the PHSA. Examples of products transferred to CDER include monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulators, growth factors, and cytokines. Remaining at CBER are traditional biologics such as vaccines, allergenic products, and blood products. Traditional biologics include vaccines, allergenic products, antitoxins, antivenins, venoms, and blood products, including recombinant versions of plasma derivatives."
