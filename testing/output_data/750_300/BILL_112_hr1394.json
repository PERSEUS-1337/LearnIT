    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011\". Congress finds that lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, with 28% of all cancer deaths attributed to it. In 2010, there were 222,520 new diagnoses and 157,300 deaths from lung cancer. Projections suggest a 46% increase in incidence for women and a 58% increase for men between 2010 and 2030. According to Clinical Oncology in 2009, the incidence of lung cancer is projected to increase by 46% for women and 58% for men between 2010 and 2030. Among minority communities, the increase in lung cancer incidence could range from 74% to 191%. Lung cancer causes more deaths annually than colon, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers combined. The 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is only 15%, significantly lower than breast, prostate, and colon cancers. The 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is only 15 percent, while breast cancer has a 5-year survival rate of 89 percent, prostate cancer 99 percent, and colon cancer 65 percent. Lung cancer receives the least funding among major cancers despite its high mortality rate. The National Cancer Institute highlighted the lack of funding for lung cancer research compared to other cancers, emphasizing the need for an integrated research program. Radon was identified as the second leading cause of lung cancer besides smoking. The President's National Cancer Advisory Board Report of 2010 identified radon as the second leading cause of lung cancer, along with 15 other environmental contaminants. Hormonal and genetic factors may also play a role in the onset of lung cancer. Nearly 20 percent of lung cancer patients have never smoked. Lung cancer, the most stigmatized cancer, is often blamed on patients, whether they smoked or not. Nearly 20% of lung cancer patients never smoked, and 60% are former smokers. It is the sixth leading cause of cancer death in non-smokers, with two-thirds of cases in women. It is the leading cause of cancer death in the overall population and every major ethnic group. Lung cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer death, with a higher impact on African-American males. Military personnel and veterans exposed to carcinogens are at risk. Two-thirds of lung cancer cases in non-smokers are women. Military personnel, veterans, and munitions workers exposed to carcinogens like Agent Orange, silica, arsenic, uranium, beryllium, and battlefield fuel emissions have an increased risk for lung cancer. Only 16 percent of lung cancer cases are diagnosed early, with no specific targets for early detection or treatment included in health initiatives like \"Healthy People 2010\" or \"Healthy People 2020\". An actuarial analysis by Milliman Inc. in 2009 highlighted these issues. An actuarial analysis by Milliman Inc. in 2009 showed that early detection of lung cancer could save over 70,000 lives annually in the US. A National Cancer Institute study in 2009 projected the cost of lost lives to lung cancer to exceed $433 billion by 2020, but a 4% annual decline in mortality could cut that in half. The National Cancer Institute projected that the value of life lost to lung cancer will exceed $433 billion by 2020, but a 4% annual decline in mortality could reduce that amount by more than half. In 2010, the National Lung Screening Trial found 20% fewer lung cancer deaths among participants screened with low-dose helical CT scans compared to standard chest x-rays. The Congress emphasizes the need for a national public health priority to reduce lung cancer mortality and calls for a comprehensive program coordinated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This program aims to address all aspects of lung cancer and reduce mortality among current smokers, former smokers, and non-smokers. The Congress calls for a Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program under the Public Health Service Act to reduce mortality among smokers and non-smokers. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates the Secretary to implement a comprehensive program within 180 days in consultation with various health agencies and stakeholders. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 requires the implementation of a program to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020, involving the National Institutes of Health in research grant prioritization. The Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2011 mandates a program led by the National Institutes of Health to reduce lung cancer mortality by 50% by 2020. This involves strategic grant prioritization by the National Cancer Institute and funding for research on predispositions to lung cancer and its interrelationship with other diseases. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is expanding research programs to include predispositions to lung cancer, interrelationship with other diseases, and diagnosis and treatment. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering is receiving funds to develop screening, diagnostic, surgical, and drug testing innovations for imaging as a biomarker. The Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering is accelerating the development of screening, diagnostic, surgical, treatment, and drug testing innovations to utilize imaging as a biomarker and reduce lung cancer mortality.

Additionally, funds are being provided to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for implementation. The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering is implementing interventions programs to reduce lung cancer mortality. Funds are also being provided to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for research programs on lung cancer incidence. Additionally, funds are allocated to the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities for collaboration on prevention, early detection, disease management research, and outreach programs addressing the impact of lung cancer. The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities collaborates on lung cancer research and outreach programs to address the impact on minority populations. Funds are provided to the Food and Drug Administration for establishing quality standards in healthcare settings. The Radiologic Health department is tasked with establishing quality standards and guidelines for facilities conducting lung cancer screening using computed tomography, updating standards as needed for technological advancements, and conducting annual surveys to review compliance and assess dose and accuracy performance. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide funds for a Lung Cancer Early Detection Program targeting low-income, uninsured, and underserved populations at high risk for lung cancer, offering early detection services. The Lung Cancer Early Detection Program provides access to early detection services for low-income, uninsured, and underserved populations at high risk for lung cancer. Funds are allocated for research on environmental contaminants associated with lung cancer in the workplace and for implementing measures to reduce lung cancer risk. State, tribal, and federal requirements are also included. The Lung Cancer Early Detection Program aims to provide early detection services for high-risk populations. It allocates funds for research on workplace-related lung cancer risks and implementing risk reduction measures. State, tribal, and federal plans must include measures to reduce lung cancer mortality.
