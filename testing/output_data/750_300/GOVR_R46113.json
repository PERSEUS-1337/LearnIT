Roughly two-thirds to three-fourths of the annual funding for DHS operations comes from discretionary appropriations, with the remainder from fee revenues, trust funds, and mandatory spending. Annual appropriations for DHS are typically organized into five titles, with the first four grouping components thematically and the fifth providing general direction to the department. Components of other agencies were brought together to form DHS in 2003, amidst ongoing budget cycles. When DHS was established in 2003, components of other agencies were brought together over a matter of months, in the midst of ongoing budget cycles. Congress and the Administration continued to provide resources through existing account structures when possible. In 2014, DHS began working on a new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) to standardize appropriations format across components. Operating with over 70 different appropriations and over 100 Programs, Projects, and Activities was noted in a 2015 interim report. DHS started working on a new Common Appropriations Structure (CAS) in 2014 to standardize appropriations format. In 2015, they highlighted the challenges of operating with multiple appropriations. After negotiations with Congress, DHS implemented the CAS in FY2017, converting legacy structures to a four-category format.

Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation and determines the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from spending more than the budget authority allows. Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation, determining available amounts for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than authorized by Congress, which may be indefinite in amount. Budget authority can be on a one-year, multiyear, or no-year basis. Budget authority can be provided on a one-year, multiyear, or no-year basis. One-year budget authority is available for spending only in a specific fiscal year, while multiyear budget authority allows spending over a specified time period. No-year budget authority can be spent indefinitely. Obligations are incurred when federal agencies engage in transactions that create a legal requirement for spending. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and outlays. Obligations are incurred when agencies enter into contracts or receive services, creating a legal requirement for payment. Outlays are the funds actually spent during the fiscal year. Budget authority may be obligated in one fiscal year but spent in a future year, especially with certain contracts. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorizes payments to be made from the Treasury. It consists of discretionary and mandatory spending, with discretionary spending not mandated by existing law. Discretionary funded agencies and programs, as well as appropriated entitlement programs, are funded each year in appropriations acts. Gross budget authority for federal agencies includes discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is annually appropriated by Congress, while mandatory spending is provided in laws outside of appropriations acts. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority and resulting outlays provided in laws other than appropriations acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year and are included in appropriations acts. Within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offset funds are collected by the federal government as part of a business-type transaction. DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offset funds are collected by the federal government as part of a business-type transaction, not considered federal revenue. DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. Some collections offset agency's discretionary budget authority, while others offset agency's mandatory spending. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Some entitlements are funded by permanent appropriations. The DHS budget contains mandatory entitlement programs such as the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts. Secret Service retirement pay is a permanent appropriation, while Coast Guard retirement pay is annually appropriated. Additionally, the budget includes offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress. The DHS budget includes offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress but are available for obligation. The maximum budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process. Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget, which are then allocated among congressional committees. In a two-stage congressional budget process, Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget. These totals are then allocated among congressional committees, known as 302(a) allocations, for enactment in annual appropriations bills. The appropriations committees further allocate the discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each appropriations bill. The appropriations committees allocate 302(a) discretionary funds among subcommittees for each appropriations bill. These amounts, known as 302(b) allocations, must not exceed the 302(a) allocation to enforce budget discipline. Adjustments to 302(b) allocations can be made during the year by the appropriations committee issuing a report with revised suballocations for the appropriations bills. The 302(b) allocations are subject to budget discipline and may be adjusted during the year by the appropriations committee. Table A-1 compares the 302(b) allocation for FY2020 with the President's request and House and Senate subcommittee allocations for the Homeland Security appropriations bill. Amendments were adopted in the House full committee markup of the FY2020 DHS. The House full committee markup of the FY2020 DHS appropriations bill included amendments that increased the bill by $3.066 billion over its discretionary allocation, later revised to $1.9 billion. These provisions were not included in the final FY2020 DHS annual appropriations act. The Budget Control Act established enforceable discretionary limits for defense and nondefense spending. The Budget Control Act set discretionary limits for defense and nondefense spending, with adjustments made by subsequent legislation. Most of the DHS budget falls under nondefense spending, with provisions for adjustments to cover overseas operations, emergency spending, and disaster relief. Most of the DHS budget is nondefense spending, with provisions for adjustments to cover overseas operations, emergency spending, and disaster relief. The Budget Control Act allows adjustments for discretionary budget authority in DHS appropriations, with exceptions for emergency spending and overseas operations. Disaster relief adjustments are limited, determined by a formula set by the Office of Management and Budget until FY2019. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the formula for disaster relief cap adjustment until FY2019, increasing the allowable adjustment size by adding 5% of emergency-designated funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act. Unused adjustment capacity now carries over indefinitely. OMB released a sequestration preview report for FY2020 in August 2019. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the formula for disaster relief cap adjustment, increasing the allowable adjustment size by adding 5% of emergency-designated funding for major disasters under the Stafford Act. OMB released a sequestration preview report for FY2020 in August 2019, estimating the allowable adjustment for disaster relief at $17.5 billion, the second-largest in history. This estimate includes the 10-year average, emergency-designated Stafford Act spending since 2012, and carryover from the previous year. The estimated allowable adjustment for disaster relief in FY2020 is $17.5 billion, the second-largest in history. It includes the 10-year average, 5% of emergency-designated Stafford Act spending since 2012, and carryover from the previous year. The final adjustment may still vary from this estimate."
