    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Truancy Prevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction Act of 1998\". Congress finds that truancy is a significant indicator of a young person's struggles, leading to school dropouts and increased likelihood of welfare dependence, unemployment, and criminal behavior. Truancy is a major factor in criminal behavior, with high rates linked to daytime burglary and vandalism. Up to 44 percent of violent juvenile crime occurs during school hours, and 75 percent of children aged 13-16 arrested for crimes are truants. Some cities report up to 70 percent of unexcused student absences, with total daily absences reaching 4,000. Truancy leads to criminal behavior, with high rates linked to daytime burglary and vandalism. Society faces social and economic costs due to truancy, with only 34% of inmates completing high school education. Truants and high school dropouts have a significant impact on the nation. Truancy prevention programs can reduce crime rates and improve school attendance. Lack of targeted funding hinders effective truancy prevention efforts. Parents may be unaware of their child's truancy, leading to long-term economic costs. SEC. 3. GRANTS.
