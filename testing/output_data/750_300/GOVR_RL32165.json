    "content": "China maintained a currency peg to the U.S. dollar from 1994 to July 21, 2005, at an exchange rate of 8.28 yuan to the dollar. The Chinese central bank controlled the peg by buying or selling dollar-denominated assets to balance demand for the yuan. This kept the exchange rate stable despite economic changes. The Chinese government maintained a currency peg to the U.S. dollar at an exchange rate of 8.28 yuan to the dollar from 1994 to July 21, 2005. Economic factors changed towards the end of the peg, leading to the yuan likely appreciating if it had been floating. The Chinese government then announced on July 21, 2005, that the yuan's exchange rate would become adjustable based on market supply and demand. The Chinese government changed its currency policy on July 21, 2005, allowing the yuan's exchange rate to be adjustable based on market supply and demand. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the yuan was immediately adjusted from 8.28 to 8.11, representing a 2.1% appreciation. The yuan would be allowed to fluctuate by 0.3% according to the Chinese government. The Chinese government implemented a new currency policy in July 2005, allowing the yuan's exchange rate to be determined by market forces. The U.S. dollar's exchange rate against the yuan was adjusted from 8.28 to 8.11, appreciating by 2.1%. The yuan was permitted to fluctuate by 0.3% daily against a basket of currencies, later increased to 0.5%. Despite being not fully convertible internationally, China maintained strict controls over capital transactions, resulting in a \"managed float\" where market forces influence the yuan's movement but government intervention slows its appreciation. Since July 2005, China has allowed the yuan to appreciate slowly, accumulating foreign reserves rapidly. China's foreign exchange reserves grew from $403 billion in 2003 to $1.7 trillion in March 2008, with a large trade surplus of $262 billion in 2007. The government maintains controls over capital transactions, resulting in a \"managed float\" where market forces influence the yuan's movement but government intervention slows its appreciation. China's foreign exchange reserves grew rapidly from $403 billion in 2003 to $1.7 trillion in March 2008, with a trade surplus of $262 billion in 2007. The yuan has appreciated 16% against the dollar since 2005, causing concerns about the U.S. economy's stability due to the dollar's significant devaluation. The falling value of the dollar has raised concerns about destabilizing the U.S. economy. Despite the increase in the yuan's value, China has been hesitant to make significant currency changes due to its own economic worries. China's reluctance to adjust its currency policy despite the yuan's increase has not alleviated concerns in the United States. This paper examines the economic issues surrounding China's current currency policy, including US concerns and China's hesitance to change. It also delves into China's fixed exchange rate regime and studies on determining its real exchange rate, as well as factors contributing to the US-China trade imbalance. China's fixed exchange rate regime, economic studies on China's real exchange rate, U.S.-China trade imbalance causes, consequences of China's currency policy for both countries, China's foreign exchange reserves, U.S. federal debt purchases, policy options to induce China to reform currency policy. Many U.S. policymakers and business representatives believe China's undervalued currency has led to a significant trade deficit with the United States, reaching $256 billion in 2007. They suggest inducing China to reform its currency policy through current legislation in Congress. China's undervalued currency has led to a growing U.S. trade deficit, impacting various manufacturing sectors and prompting other East Asian countries to keep their currencies weak against the dollar to compete with Chinese goods. Many analysts argue that China's currency policy leads other East Asian countries to intervene in currency markets to stay competitive with Chinese goods. Groups are urging the Bush Administration to pressure China to revalue its currency or allow it to float freely. President Bush and officials have criticized China's currency policy, advocating for market-determined exchange rates. President Bush and Administration officials have criticized China's currency policy, advocating for market-determined exchange rates. The Administration initially rejected calls to pressure China to abandon its currency peg, instead seeking to encourage reform through a joint technical cooperation program. China to reform its financial system and adopt a more flexible currency policy, with growing complaints from Members over China's currency policy and introduction of numerous currency bills. The Senate failed to reject an amendment imposing a tariff on Chinese goods if China did not appreciate its currency. This led to negotiations for a vote on a bill sponsored by Senator. The Senate failed to reject a 27.5% tariff on Chinese goods if China did not appreciate its currency. Senate Republican leadership negotiated an agreement for a vote on S. 295 sponsored by Senator Schumer. Supporters of the bill threatened to bring it up for a vote in 2006 but were convinced not to by Administration and Chinese officials. Numerous other currency bills were also introduced. Supporters of S. 295 threatened to bring the bill up for a vote on two separate occasions in 2006, but were convinced not to by Administration and Chinese officials. Significant events regarding China's currency policy included a 4.1% increase in import prices from China from April 2007 to April 2008, the largest 12-month increase since December 2003. U.S. imports from China in the first three months of 2008 were also reported. The U.S. Census Bureau reported a 4.1% increase in import prices from China from April 2007 to April 2008, the largest 12-month increase since December 2003. The Bank of China also reported an appreciation of 15.9% in the exchange rate with the dollar since July 2005. China's foreign exchange reserves reached $1.68 trillion at the end of March 2008. On April 14, 2008, the Bank of China reported that China's foreign exchange reserves reached $1.68 trillion at the end of March 2008. The China Investment Corporation (CIC) was officially launched on September 29, 2007, with an initial capitalization of $200 billion, making it one of the world's largest state-owned funds. On December 15, 2007, the CIC announced a $5 billion investment in Morgan Stanley. China stated on August 13, 2007, that it had no plans to sell off its dollar assets.

On December 15, 2007, the CIC announced a $5 billion investment in Morgan Stanley. In response to rumors, China stated on August 13, 2007, that it had no plans to sell off its dollar assets. Additionally, regulations requiring domestic firms to convert foreign exchange holdings into yuan were eliminated in June 2007. The government eliminated regulations for domestic firms to convert foreign exchange holdings into yuan in June 2007. The International Monetary Fund clarified currency manipulation as policies affecting exchange rates to increase net exports. On May 17, 2007, 42 House Members filed a petition with the U.S. Trade Representative regarding currency manipulation. The IMF clarified currency manipulation as policies affecting exchange rates to increase net exports. On May 17, 2007, 42 House Members filed a petition with the U.S. Trade Representative over China's currency practices. The USTR's office declined the petition on June 13, 2007. The USTR's office declined a petition regarding currency manipulation under the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, which requires the Treasury Department to report on exchange rate policies of countries with large surpluses and determine if they manipulate their currencies for unfair trade advantages. Treasury has been issuing reports on this semi-annually. The Treasury Department reports on exchange rate policies of countries with large surpluses to prevent currency manipulation for unfair trade advantages. China was cited for manipulating its currency in the past due to a dual exchange rate system and restrictions on foreign exchange access by domestic firms. No country has been designated as a currency manipulator since 1994. Since 1994, China has not been designated as a currency manipulator, but the Treasury Department has increased its focus on China's currency policy and reforms, especially since the July 2005 currency reform. Treasury reports have criticized China for not fully implementing commitments to make its exchange rate mechanism more flexible. Since China reformed its currency in July 2005, Treasury has observed that China's new managed float exchange rate regime has not fully implemented its commitment to increase the role of market forces in determining the yuan's value. The new mechanism, described as based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies, does not appear to significantly influence the daily closing level of the yuan. Trading behavior suggests that the new mechanism remains unchanged. The Treasury Department stated that China's currency reforms, described as based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies, did not significantly impact the daily closing level of the yuan. Despite this, China was not cited as a currency manipulator under U.S. trade law due to assurances from Chinese officials about their commitment to market-determined currency flexibility and promoting domestic growth. The Treasury Department's June 2007 report stated that China's currency reforms, based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies, did not significantly impact the daily closing level of the yuan. Despite China's currency being undervalued and heavy intervention in currency markets, it did not meet the technical requirements for currency manipulation under U.S. trade law. Treasury continues to raise concerns with Chinese officials regarding the exchange rate regime. The Treasury Department's December 2007 report highlighted that China needed to accelerate the appreciation of the RMB's exchange rate to minimize risks for the global economy. Despite criticism, Treasury has not labeled China as a currency manipulator since 1994, citing its interventions to control the exchange rate with the dollar. Many Members have criticized Treasury's decision not to label China as a currency manipulator despite its interventions to control the exchange rate with the dollar, current account surpluses, and trade surpluses with the United States. Legislation may be enacted to revise the criteria for currency manipulation determination. Chinese officials argue that their currency policy is not solely for promoting exports. Chinese officials argue that their currency policy is not meant to promote exports or discourage imports, but rather to foster economic stability and investor confidence. They believe that abandoning the current currency policy could lead to an economic crisis and harm export industries during economic reforms. Chinese officials are concerned that changing the currency policy could lead to an economic crisis, especially damaging export industries during economic reforms. They also worry about rising unrest in rural areas due to income disparities and government corruption. Appreciating the currency could lower domestic food prices. Chinese officials are concerned about the rising level of unrest in rural areas due to income disparities and government corruption. They argue that appreciating the currency could lower domestic food prices and agricultural exports, but the banking system is not equipped to handle speculative pressures with a fully convertible currency. The Chinese banking system is considered too underdeveloped and burdened with heavy debt to effectively handle speculative pressures that come with a fully convertible currency. This combination, along with poorly regulated financial systems, was seen as a cause of the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. Chinese officials were reportedly considering currency policy reform before the crisis, but the negative impact on East Asian countries with floating currencies convinced them to maintain China's currency peg. Chinese officials were considering reforming their currency policy to make the yuan more flexible in response to the Asian financial crisis. U.S. officials urged China to move quickly on financial sector reforms and allow faster appreciation of the yuan. China is urged by U.S. officials to reform its financial sector and make its currency more flexible, including allowing faster appreciation of the yuan and decreasing intervention in currency markets. Fixed exchange rates have been historically used, including the Bretton Woods system and the international gold standard. China operated under a fixed exchange rate until July 2005. China operated under a fixed exchange rate until July 2005, linking major world currencies from the 1940s to the 1960s. The Chinese central bank maintained a constant yuan-dollar exchange rate by buying or selling currency as needed. This system contrasts with the floating exchange rate used by the United States and the Euro area. China operated under a fixed exchange rate system until July 2005, maintaining a constant yuan-dollar exchange rate by buying or selling currency as needed. The primary alternative would be a floating exchange rate system, where supply and demand determine the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar. When economic circumstances change, the relative demand for a country's currency also changes. If China had a floating exchange rate, its currency would likely have appreciated in recent years due to productivity and quality improvements. The relative demand for a country's currency can change with economic circumstances. If China had a floating exchange rate, its currency would likely have appreciated in recent years due to productivity and quality improvements. To maintain an exchange rate peg, the central bank must adjust currency supply to match market demand by increasing or decreasing foreign exchange reserves. The central bank adjusts currency supply to match market demand by increasing or decreasing foreign exchange reserves, as required by the balance of payments accounting identity. Net exports and private capital inflows affect the need to increase foreign exchange reserves to maintain the exchange rate peg. The central bank adjusts currency supply to match market demand by increasing or decreasing foreign exchange reserves. Excess demand for yuan has led to an increase in foreign reserves through buying dollars. The Chinese central bank holds U.S. financial securities instead of U.S. dollars. Since 2005, China has maintained a peg by increasing foreign reserves through buying dollars from the public in exchange for yuan. The Chinese central bank holds U.S. financial securities, primarily U.S. Treasury securities. China has been rapidly accumulating foreign reserves, becoming the world's largest holder in 2006. China has been rapidly accumulating foreign exchange reserves since 2005, surpassing Japan in 2006 to become the world's largest holder. By 2007, China's reserves grew to $1.53 trillion, with a significant increase of $463 billion in 2006-2007. Despite allowing the yuan to appreciate by 16% against the dollar, China no longer purchases enough foreign reserves to maintain a fixed exchange rate regime. Since 2005, China has been accumulating foreign exchange reserves rapidly, becoming the world's largest holder in 2006. By 2007, its reserves reached $1.53 trillion, with a $463 billion increase in 2006-2007. Despite a 16% appreciation of the yuan against the dollar, China no longer buys enough foreign reserves to maintain a fixed exchange rate regime. The current situation is best described as a \"managed float,\" where market forces determine the yuan's movement, but government intervention slows its appreciation. Some of China's neighbors also have managed floats or intervene in currency markets occasionally. China's government is retarding the yuan's appreciation through market intervention, still pegging it to the dollar. Neighboring countries like Malaysia also maintain managed floats, while Japan intervened in currency markets to keep its currency low against the dollar. The rapid accumulation of foreign reserves suggests that the yuan would appreciate more if allowed to freely float. Foreign exchange reserves are essential for financing international trade. The Chinese government is accumulating foreign exchange reserves to prevent the yuan from appreciating against the dollar. This accumulation has outpaced GDP and imports growth in recent years, indicating a possible influence on the yuan's value if allowed to freely float. China's foreign exchange reserves have grown significantly in recent years, outpacing GDP and imports growth. The composition of these reserves, including the share held in U.S. assets and the reasons for the increase, remains largely unknown. China's foreign exchange reserves have grown significantly in recent years, outpacing GDP and imports growth. The composition of these reserves, including the share held in U.S. assets and the reasons for the increase, remains largely unknown. It is also unclear what portion of the annual reserve growth is due to new accumulations, valuation changes, exchange rate effects, or reinvestment of earnings. Economic activity is influenced by the real exchange rate rather than the nominal rate, with China experiencing higher inflation than the United States from 1994 to 1997, leading to divergence between real and nominal exchange rates. From 1994 to 2003, China experienced higher inflation than the United States, leading to divergence between real and nominal exchange rates. This caused the real exchange rate to appreciate from China's perspective, making their exports more expensive. However, from 1997 to 2003, the real and nominal exchange rates converged as China's inflation rate became lower than that of the U.S. In 2003, the Chinese exchange rate reached its lowest level since 1994 in real terms, making their exports cheaper. In 2003, the Chinese exchange rate reached its lowest level since 1994 in real terms, making their exports progressively less expensive. The value of the yuan has since risen, bringing it almost back to its 1998 level in real terms. Appreciation in the nominal exchange rate has played a role in this adjustment. The yuan has almost returned to its 1998 level in real terms. In the long run, real exchange rates return to their market value whether fixed or floating. If demand for Chinese goods increases, the yuan would appreciate if floating, or adjust through price if fixed. The trade surplus with the United States persists as long as the fixed exchange rate remains below the market value, leading to relatively inexpensive Chinese exports and expensive U.S. imports. This surplus, along with net remittances, equals the capital flowing from China to the United States, including private Chinese citizens purchasing U.S. assets. The trade surplus with the United States persists due to the fixed exchange rate, leading to inexpensive Chinese exports and expensive U.S. imports. This surplus, along with net remittances, equals the capital flowing from China to the United States. Chinese citizens purchase U.S. assets, and the central bank accumulates dollar reserves, increasing the supply of yuan and causing inflation in China. Rising prices make exports costlier and imports cheaper, eventually returning the trade surplus to its equilibrium value. The inflation rate in China rises due to an increase in the supply of yuan. As prices increase, exports become more expensive abroad and imports cheaper. The trade surplus eventually returns to its equilibrium value, showing that undervaluing a fixed exchange rate does not provide a lasting competitive advantage. Floating exchange rates adjust more quickly to reach equilibrium compared to fixed exchange rates. Undervaluing a fixed exchange rate does not offer a lasting competitive advantage for a country's exporters and import-competing industries. Floating exchange rates adjust more quickly to reach equilibrium compared to fixed exchange rates, limiting a country's ability to use monetary and fiscal policy to counteract changes in the business cycle. A fixed exchange rate, like China's peg, limits a country's policy flexibility during economic downturns. This loss of autonomy is less significant for small countries tied to larger neighbors with shared business cycles. China's use of capital controls helps limit the loss of monetary autonomy compared to most countries with fixed exchange rates. China uses capital controls to limit the loss of monetary autonomy compared to other countries with fixed exchange rates. The currency is convertible on a current account basis but not on a capital account basis, with strict regulations on foreign currency holdings and exchange purchases within China. China's capital controls restrict the outflow of money, allowing the country to maintain some control over its monetary and fiscal policies. Foreign currency holdings must be turned over to China's state bank in exchange for yuan, and purchases of foreign exchange are closely regulated. Despite a fixed exchange rate, China retains flexibility due to restrictions on capital leaving the country. The yuan's value has remained stable since 1994, and it would appreciate if the central bank stopped increasing foreign reserves, but the exact amount is uncertain. The central bank's increasing foreign reserves may impact the yuan's value, which has remained stable since 1994. There is uncertainty about how much the yuan would appreciate, with limited data available until June 2005 to estimate its sensitivity to exchange rate changes. Various estimates of the yuan's undervaluation have been discussed, focusing on those with clear derivation explanations. This report evaluates estimates of the yuan's undervaluation, grouped into two methodological categories: the \"fundamental equilibrium exchange rate\" and the \"purchasing power parity\" methods. One method, the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER) method, estimates misalignments in exchange rates based on current account balances. The fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER) method estimates misalignments in exchange rates based on current account balances, believing they are temporarily out of line with their \"fundamental\" value. This method calculates how much the exchange rate must change to achieve the desired current account adjustment, but it is a controversial approach among economists. The fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER) method estimates misalignments in exchange rates based on current account balances. It calculates the necessary exchange rate adjustment to achieve balance, but this approach is controversial among economists. Ernest Preeg estimated the yuan was undervalued by 40% in 2003, although this claim lacked formal analysis. Ernest Preeg estimated that the yuan was undervalued by 40% in 2003, based on rule-of-thumb estimates. He observed that the increase in Chinese foreign exchange reserves equaled 100% of the trade surplus less net foreign direct investment in the first six months of 2002. Preeg concluded that the entire trade surplus less net foreign direct investment would be zero without the increase in foreign exchange reserves. Chinese trade surplus less net foreign direct investment in the first six months of 2002 would be zero without the increase in foreign exchange reserves. A 1% decline in the dollar leads to a $10 billion decline in the US trade deficit, requiring a 40% decline in the dollar to eliminate the $400 billion trade deficit in 2002. The Chinese trade surplus plus net FDI flows equaled 100% of the increase in foreign exchange reserves. The U.S. trade deficit needs to decline by 40% to eliminate it, as it equaled about $400 billion in 2002. The Chinese trade surplus plus net FDI flows equaled 100% of the increase in foreign exchange reserves. The yuan was estimated to be 15%-25% undervalued in 2003, with an underlying current account surplus of 2.5%-3% of GDP. The Institute for International Economics (IIE) estimates that the yuan was 15%-25% undervalued in 2003, with a current account surplus larger than the actual surplus. It suggests reducing the surplus by $50 billion to achieve equilibrium, leading to a deficit of 1%-1.5% of GDP. The revaluation needed for this reduction is significant due to the extensive use of imports in Chinese exports. Goldman Sachs Economic Research Group estimates that the yuan was 9.5%-15% undervalued, with a significant revaluation needed to reduce the current account surplus and achieve equilibrium in China's overall balance of payments. Goldman Sachs estimates the yuan was 9.5%-15% undervalued in 2003, suggesting a revaluation to reduce the U.S. current-account deficit. They argue for a 9.5%-15% revaluation to achieve equilibrium in China's balance of payments, based on elasticity estimates of export and import changes with exchange rate adjustments. Goldman Sachs suggests a 9.5%-15% revaluation of the yuan to reduce the U.S. current-account deficit. Virginie Coudert and Cecile Couharde estimate China's underlying current account deficit to be between 1.5% and 2.8% of GDP. Goldman Sachs suggests a 9.5%-15% revaluation of the yuan to reduce the U.S. current-account deficit. Virginie Coudert and Cecile Couharde estimate China's underlying current account deficit to be between 1.5% and 2.8% of GDP, with the yuan being 44%-54% undervalued against the dollar in 2003. These estimates are not based on econometrically estimated economic models but on simple \"rule of thumb\" assumptions. The estimates of the yuan's undervaluation are not based on econometrically estimated economic models but on simple \"rule of thumb\" assumptions. The main source of contention is the definition of an \"equilibrium\" current account balance. All estimates are based on the appreciation needed for China to achieve this balance. The estimates of the yuan's undervaluation are based on the definition of an \"equilibrium\" current account balance, with authors using their own opinions and assumptions. Changing the assumed equilibrium balance can significantly impact the estimated undervaluation. Some economists argue that the current account balance would always be close to zero in equilibrium, but countries with different saving and investment rates may willingly lend to and borrow from each other for long periods of time. Changing the assumed equilibrium current account balance can greatly affect the estimated undervaluation of the yuan. The Preeg, IIE, and Goldman Sachs estimates suggest that China's current account balance is actually a deficit, as they allow for foreign direct investment inflows. If they had used a balanced equilibrium measure instead of a deficit, their estimates of the yuan's undervaluation would have been smaller. The current account position is a deficit, and using a balanced equilibrium measure would result in smaller estimates of the yuan's undervaluation. It is unclear why requiring China to borrow from the rest of the world is any less sustainable than the current arrangement where China is lending. Increasing foreign reserves is necessary to prevent China's net foreign indebtedness from rising. China needs to increase foreign reserves to prevent its net foreign indebtedness from rising. Capital controls and net FDI inflows make it challenging to determine the equilibrium current account balance in China. Maintaining capital controls post-currency reform could help stabilize the current account balance. If China maintains capital controls after currency reform, the current account balance may remain stable. However, if capital controls are eliminated, the economic situation would change significantly, leading to persistent borrowing or lending by private Chinese citizens and resulting in a trade deficit or surplus. If private Chinese citizens lent as much to the United States as the Chinese central bank currently does, the trade deficit would remain unchanged. If private capital outflows exceeded the increase in foreign reserves, the yuan would depreciate. China's high national saving and investment rates make it uncertain if China would be a net borrower or lender. If capital outflows exceed the increase in foreign reserves, the yuan would depreciate. It is uncertain if China would be a net borrower or lender if their currency floated and capital controls were abolished. Bosworth argues that China's high internal saving rate can finance its investment, allowing China to offset FDI. The exchange rate in China is considered \"market determined\" due to capital controls restricting portfolio investment flows. Bosworth suggests that China's high internal saving rate can finance its investment, allowing China to offset FDI with official outflows in foreign reserve accumulation. Wang argues that China's equilibrium current account surplus may be larger than estimated, suggesting the yuan is overvalued. The FEER approach is also considered in determining the exchange rate. Based on estimates from other developing economies, China's equilibrium current account surplus may be larger than the actual surplus, suggesting the yuan is overvalued. The FEER approach believes the U.S. trade deficit is unsustainable and revaluing the yuan would help reduce it. The argument goes beyond China fixing the yuan at a low level, suggesting the dollar is incorrectly valued as well. The yuan is believed to be undervalued by 54%, with the dollar, yen, and euro also being misvalued in 2003. The sustainability of the trade deficit is debated, with no widely accepted theoretical approach. If the dollar and trade deficit were unsustainable, investors would sell U.S. assets and the deficit would decrease. The sustainability of the trade deficit is debated, with no widely accepted theoretical approach. Evidence suggests the U.S. trade deficit is not unsustainable in the next few years, as it has lasted several years without hindering economic growth. If the Chinese central bank stopped... The U.S. trade deficit has not hindered economic growth, and a reduction in the deficit may not solely be attributed to China's actions. If China's central bank stopped buying U.S. assets, other countries could still lend to the U.S., potentially widening other bilateral trade deficits. Even if China's overall trade surplus were eliminated, it might still run a bilateral trade surplus with the United States. International experience suggests that countries with overall trade deficits can have both surpluses and deficits with different trading partners. Comparing to other East Asian countries can provide insight into what China's current account balance might be in equilibrium. The United States has trading partners with whom they have surpluses and deficits. International experience suggests that China's current account balance in equilibrium could be similar to other East Asian countries. These countries have had mixed experiences with some running deficits and others surpluses. Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, countries like Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand have shifted to running large current account surpluses, indicating a challenging environment for developing world borrowing. This trend is also observed in countries like Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan, which already had industrialized and maintained current account surpluses. China's large foreign exchange reserves and current account surplus are similar to other countries in the region with different exchange rate regimes. Estimates of the yuan's undervaluation based on purchasing power parity theory suggest potential arbitrage opportunities. The theory of purchasing power parity (PPP) states that the same good should have the same price in different countries to prevent arbitrage opportunities. The Economist's Big Mac Index estimated China's currency was undervalued by 56% in 2007, comparing the price of a Big Mac in China and the US. The Big Mac Index is seen as a light-hearted guide to exchange rates, comparing the price of a Big Mac in China and the US. However, relying too heavily on it has drawbacks as it only applies to tradeable goods, not factoring in the services associated with the hamburger. Li Ong estimates that 94% of the Big Mac's value comes from these services, such as employee wages and restaurant rent. The Big Mac Index compares prices of Big Macs in different locations, but it doesn't consider the non-tradeable services that make up 94% of the burger's value. Factors like employee wages and rent affect the price, so purchasing power parity may not accurately reflect the true value. This results in a Big Mac being more expensive in New York City compared to the rural south, suggesting a dollar in the rural south is undervalued. The Big Mac Index compares prices of Big Macs in different locations, but it doesn't consider non-tradeable services that make up most of the burger's value. Purchasing power parity may not accurately reflect the true value as prices are consistently lower in developing countries than industrialized countries. Economists have tried to estimate the yuan's value by controlling for divergences from PPP, but caution is advised as PPP has been unreliable in reality. Some economists estimate the yuan's value by controlling for predictable divergences from PPP, but caution is advised as PPP only predicts exchange rates over the long run. Estimates based on PPP can identify any country's currency as overvalued or undervalued, with limited changes over time even with significant trade deficit fluctuations. Economist Jeffrey Frankel argues that income level can be regressed on the exchange rate using a cross-sample of countries to find a predictable relationship between a country's income level and its equilibrium exchange rate based on PPP. He estimates that China's exchange rate was undervalued by 36% in 2000, speculating that the undervaluation has increased since then. Coudert and Couharde estimate the yuan to be undervalued by 41%-51% in 2003. Economist Jeffrey Frankel estimates China's exchange rate was undervalued by 36% in 2000, suggesting it has increased since then. Coudert and Couharde estimate the yuan to be undervalued by 41%-51% in 2003. Frankel acknowledges caveats to this analysis, including the long-term nature of PPP, other factors not considered in the regression, and the need for gradual exchange rate adjustments. The regression analysis explains 57% of the data variation, suggesting that market-determined exchange rates can diverge from PPP due to capital flows. Gradual exchange rate adjustments are recommended to avoid economic disruption. An appreciation of the renminbi may not immediately impact the U.S. trade deficit or employment. Theoretical rationale is needed to link income levels to exchange rate values to avoid spurious correlations. Theoretical rationale is needed to link income levels to exchange rate values to avoid spurious correlations. One rationale is the \"Balassa-Samuelson\" effect, where as countries get richer, their exchange rates are predicted to appreciate. Another proxy is the ratio of the consumer price index to the producer price index. If the proxy is inaccurate, the results will be as well. Income levels can be used as a proxy to measure differences in productivity growth. The ratio of the consumer price index to the producer price index is another proxy. Studies estimated the yuan to be undervalued by 18% to 47% in 2003 using this proxy. The yuan was found to be undervalued by 47% in 2003 using a proxy and net foreign assets in a study of G20 countries. However, another study suggested that the yuan was only modestly undervalued in 2003, cautioning that the price index proxy may be inaccurate for China. Cheung et al. replicated results showing the yuan as significantly undervalued but noted limitations in the estimates. Cheung et al. replicated results showing the yuan as significantly undervalued but pointed out limitations in the estimates. They found that the undervaluation estimates were not statistically significant, indicating uncertainty about the yuan's undervaluation. Adjusting for serial correlation reduced the estimated undervaluation. The yuan's undervaluation estimates are uncertain and become smaller when adjusting for serial correlation. Adding explanatory variables like trade openness also reduces the estimated undervaluation. Changes in the model, such as time period or sample omission, greatly affect the estimate. The Treasury Department's report on exchange rates discusses economic models and methodology. The Treasury Department's December 2006 report on exchange rates highlights the challenges in estimating a currency's \"misalignment\" using economic models. It notes that model changes, like altering the time period or sample, can significantly impact the estimate. The report emphasizes that there is no single model that accurately explains exchange rate movements and that conclusions can vary based on the variables used. Despite these limitations, examining such models can provide valuable insights into understanding exchange rates.

It emphasizes that no single model accurately explains exchange rate movements and that conclusions can vary based on variables used. To understand exchange rate movements, it suggests focusing on serious misalignments, using real effective exchange rates, utilizing multiple models, and analyzing empirical data, indicators, policies, and institutional factors. The Treasury Department's report emphasizes that no single model accurately explains exchange rate movements. It suggests focusing on protracted misalignments where currency adjustments are not occurring, supplementing judgments with empirical data, indicators, policies, and institutional factors, and considering market-based reasons for currency misalignment. Critics of China's currency peg often point to the U.S.-China trade imbalance as evidence of the yuan being undervalued. Critics of China's currency peg often cite the U.S.-China trade imbalance as proof of the yuan being undervalued. However, bilateral trade balances are influenced by structural causes and exchange rate effects. Despite a $256 billion merchandise trade surplus with the U.S. in 2007, China's overall trade surplus was $262 billion. China's trade surplus with the United States in 2007 was $256 billion, but its overall trade surplus was $262 billion. The yuan's undervaluation against the dollar does not explain all trade imbalances, as China also runs deficits with other countries like Taiwan, South Korea, and others. China's trade surplus with the United States in 2007 was $256 billion, but its overall trade surplus was $262 billion. Despite the yuan's undervaluation against the dollar, China also runs deficits with other countries like Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. U.S. exports to China have been increasing sharply, outpacing exports to other major trading partners. In 2007, U.S. exports to China increased significantly, surpassing exports to other major trading partners. China became the third largest U.S. export market, with a growing level of imports contributing to the trade deficit. The growing level of imports from China is largely driven by export-oriented multinational companies, particularly from East Asia, that have shifted production to China for its low-cost labor. Data shows a significant increase in China's exports produced by foreign-invested enterprises, rising from 1.9% in 1986 to 57.1% in 2007. The share of exports and imports from Foreign-Invested Enterprises (FIEs) in China has significantly increased over the years. In 1986, FIEs accounted for only 1.9% of exports, but by 2007, this share had risen to 57.1%. Similarly, FIEs represented 5.6% of imports in 1986, which increased to 58.5% by 2007. FIEs in China import raw materials for assembly and export final products, leading to trade deficits with East Asian countries and surpluses with high consumer demand countries like the United States. The rise of Foreign-Invested Enterprises (FIEs) in China has led to an increase in exports and imports. FIEs import raw materials for assembly and export final products, resulting in trade deficits with East Asian countries and surpluses with high consumer demand countries like the United States. Analysts believe that the growing U.S. trade deficit with China is due to China becoming a production platform for foreign companies, rather than unfair trade policies. This shift in trade dynamics could impact the bilateral trade deficit independently. The rise of Foreign-Invested Enterprises (FIEs) in China has led to a significant increase in exports and imports, with a focus on export-oriented manufacturing. This growth in FIEs is strongly linked to the rapid increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) in China, which has contributed to the rise in the U.S. trade deficit with China. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in China grew significantly from $1.9 billion in 1986 to $74.8 billion in 2007, with a focus on export-oriented manufacturing. The U.S. trade deficit with China began to increase rapidly in the early 1990s, coinciding with a rise in FDI and exports by Foreign-Invested Enterprises (FIEs). FIEs import roughly 80% as much as they export, having little effect on China's overall trade balance. Foreign multinational companies have shifted production to China from other East Asian countries. Foreign multinational companies have shifted production to China from other East Asian countries, with FIEs importing 80% as much as they export. In 2007, China became the largest foreign supplier of computer equipment to the U.S., with a 51.5% share of total imports. In 2007, China became the largest foreign supplier of computer equipment to the U.S. with a 51.5% share of total imports. Japan's ranking fell to 4th place, with a 7.0% share of shipments, and a significant drop in the value of its shipments by over half. U.S. imports of computer equipment from China rose by 436% in the past seven years, while the total value of U.S. imports from the world of these commodities only rose by 26%. The increase in Chinese computer production is largely due to foreign companies moving manufacturing facilities to China. Critics argue that an undervalued yuan benefits Chinese exports to the U.S. by making them cheaper, boosting China's export industries and attracting foreign investment. An undervalued currency in China benefits export businesses and attracts foreign investment, particularly from U.S. firms. This policy boosts China's export industries and technology transfers but makes imports more expensive for Chinese consumers and firms. An undervalued currency in China benefits export businesses and attracts foreign investment, particularly from U.S. firms, but makes imports more expensive for Chinese consumers and firms. This policy may impede the efficient allocation of resources in the Chinese economy in the long run. In the short run, a revaluation of the yuan could reduce aggregate spending in China by raising imports and reducing exports. Whether this would be desirable depends on the current state of the Chinese economy. Some argue that revaluation would help prevent inflation from rising, while others believe it could be economically and socially disruptive due to a large pool of underemployed labor in rural China. China's currency policy limits the government's ability to use monetary policy. Many economists argue that China's undervalued yuan absorbs a large pool of underemployed labor in rural areas, making revaluation potentially disruptive. They believe China's currency policy hinders the government's use of monetary policy for stable economic growth, leading to an economy overly reliant on fixed investment and exports. This could ultimately undermine the financial viability of the banking system. China's currency policy is criticized for leading to an economy overly dependent on fixed investment and exports, potentially undermining the banking system's financial viability by increasing easy credit and non-performing loans. Additionally, the policy attracts \"hot money\" for speculative ventures like real estate and the stock market. China's currency policy has led to an influx of \"hot money\" into speculative ventures like real estate and the stock market. Banks are limited in using interest rates to regulate investments, as raising rates could attract more foreign capital. Low interest rates in a booming economy may hinder efficient capital allocation and lead to overproduction in certain sectors. China's large foreign exchange reserves could facilitate a quicker move towards full currency convertibility. Low interest rates in a booming economy may hinder efficient capital allocation and lead to overproduction in certain sectors. China's large foreign exchange reserves could facilitate a quicker move towards full currency convertibility, but also come with opportunity costs for funding development needs and improving social systems. The accumulation of foreign reserves by China has opportunity costs, as the funds could be used for infrastructure, education, social safety net, and bank recapitalization. This can lead to a less expensive yuan, benefiting Chinese exports to the US but making US exports to China more expensive. The accumulation of foreign reserves by China leads to a cheaper yuan, benefiting Chinese exports to the US and making US exports to China more expensive. This causes a rise in the US trade deficit and reduces aggregate demand in the short run. China is the second largest supplier of imports to the US. China's exports to the United States, mainly labor-intensive consumer goods, contribute to the rise in the US trade deficit and impact aggregate demand. Many of these products do not directly compete with US domestic producers, but certain industries like machine tools, hardware, plastics, furniture, and tool and die are affected. Many U.S. industries, including machine tools, hardware, plastics, furniture, and tool and die manufacturers, are concerned about the competitive challenge posed by China due to an undervalued Chinese currency. U.S. producers also import capital equipment and inputs from China, such as computer parts. The undervalued yuan in China affects U.S. industries like computer firms that import parts from China, increasing their competitiveness in global markets. U.S.-invested enterprises benefit from the undervalued exchange rate. This also impacts U.S. borrowers when the country runs a current account deficit with China. Many imports from China are produced by U.S.-invested enterprises benefiting from an undervalued exchange rate. This leads to a current account deficit with China, resulting in capital flows from China to the United States. Chinese investments in U.S. assets drive capital investment in plant and equipment, lowering U.S. interest rates and increasing firms' willingness to invest. Citizens investing in U.S. assets leads to increased capital investment in plant and equipment due to lower interest rates. This boosts aggregate spending in the short run and expands the economy in the long run by increasing the capital stock. Household spending on goods like consumer durables and housing also rises with the capital inflow from China. China's capital inflow into the United States, particularly through U.S. Treasury securities, benefits the economy by lowering interest rates and funding federal budget deficits. China held $397 billion in U.S. Treasury securities as of September 2007, making it the second largest foreign holder after Japan. China is the second largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities, with $397 billion as of September 2007. If the U.S. trade deficit with China is eliminated, Chinese capital inflow would stop, leading to higher interest rates for the U.S. government. This would increase the budget deficit. An undervalued yuan can increase the U.S. consumption of goods, impacting the terms-of-trade and potentially leading to higher interest rates on U.S. Treasuries. This could result in an increase in the government's budget deficit. The undervalued yuan can impact the terms-of-trade by increasing U.S. consumption of goods and potentially leading to higher interest rates on U.S. Treasuries. This could result in an increase in the government's budget deficit. The rise of the yuan against the dollar may also impact the price of Chinese products sold in the United States, as seen in the 4.1% increase in import prices from China reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The undervalued yuan can impact the terms-of-trade by increasing U.S. consumption of goods and potentially leading to higher interest rates on U.S. Treasuries. This could result in an increase in the government's budget deficit. Import prices from China increased 4.1% from April 2007 to April 2008, the largest 12-month increase recorded since December 2003. Critics argue that the low value of the yuan has significantly affected the U.S. manufacturing sector, leading to job losses. Critics argue that the undervalued yuan has significantly impacted the U.S. manufacturing sector, resulting in job losses. However, there is no clear link between job losses and imports from China, as manufacturing output has reached an all-time high and the overall trade deficit is still increasing. The growing trade deficit, not limited to China, is still increasing. U.S. manufacturing employment has fallen due to productivity growth, not a decline in output. There is a long-term trend shifting U.S. employment from manufacturing to the service sector, driven by changing technology and comparative advantage. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment is attributed to changing technology and comparative advantage, leading to a shift towards service sector jobs. Globalization has resulted in the U.S. producing knowledge- and technology-intensive goods for trade with countries like China, who excel in labor-intensive production. This trend has led to more manufacturing overseas and less in the United States. Trade with countries like China, who specialize in labor-intensive production, has led to a shift of manufacturing abroad and a decline in the United States. Alan Greenspan stated that an increase in the value of the Chinese currency would not significantly boost manufacturing activity or jobs in the U.S. Alan Greenspan testified in 2005 that an undervalued yuan does not significantly increase manufacturing activity or jobs in the United States. It leads to a shift in U.S. production towards firms benefiting from lower interest rates caused by Chinese capital inflows, particularly capital-intensive and consumer durables firms. The undervalued yuan leads to a shift in U.S. production towards firms benefiting from lower interest rates caused by Chinese capital inflows, particularly capital-intensive and consumer durables firms. This is expected to have no medium- or long-run effect on aggregate U.S. employment or unemployment, as evidenced by the trade deficit with China widening while the overall unemployment rate has fallen. However, the gains and losses in employment and production caused by the trade deficit will not be evenly dispersed across regions and sectors of the economy. The unemployment rate decreased from 6.3% in 2003 to around 5% in 2008. The trade deficit's impact on employment and production will vary across regions and sectors. While the compositional shift in output doesn't harm overall U.S. output and employment in the long run, short-term consequences may occur if the trade sector's output falls faster than U.S. recipients of Chinese capital rise, leading to temporary declines in spending, employment, and inflation rates. If output in the trade sector falls faster than U.S. recipients of Chinese capital rise, there could be temporary declines in spending, employment, and inflation rates. Government macroeconomic policy adjustment and market forces can compensate for this by expanding other elements of aggregate demand. The U.S. economy is at full employment, and government policy and market forces can offset any decline in the trade sector by boosting other areas of demand. Shifting to a higher capital base would increase the economy in the long run, with U.S. workers benefiting from higher productivity and wages. China is a significant trading partner, but only accounted for a portion of U.S. imports in 2007. The United States has a trade deficit with China, but shifting to Chinese-owned capital could lead to higher productivity and wages for U.S. workers. This imbalance is due to a domestic imbalance between saving and investment, which has been ongoing for the past two decades. The United States has a trade deficit with China due to a domestic imbalance between saving and investment. Over the past two decades, the US has seen a decline in saving as a share of GDP, leading to a negative government saving rate. This imbalance results in foreigners using their savings to finance profitable investments in the US. China has a high gross national saving rate compared to the United States, leading to a trade deficit between the two countries. The US has low household and government saving rates, causing foreigners to finance investments in the US. China's gross national saving rate is significantly higher than the United States, leading to a trade deficit. The US relies on foreign borrowing to fund its investment needs due to lower saving rates. China has a higher gross national saving rate compared to the United States, resulting in a trade deficit. The US needs to borrow from abroad for investments, while China has excess savings to invest overseas. This difference is reflected in their current account balances, with China at 9.0% of GDP and the US at -6.2%. Both countries would need to adjust their saving and investment patterns to reduce the US trade deficit and China's trade surplus in the long term. China and the United States have significant differences in their gross national saving rates, leading to a trade deficit. China's current account balance is at 9.0% of GDP, while the US is at -6.2%. Both countries would need to adjust their saving and investment patterns to address the trade imbalance in the long term. Some analysts believe that China is moving towards boosting consumer spending to achieve this goal. The Treasury Department's report in November 2005 highlighted China's commitment to sustainable domestic policies as a key factor in not designating them as a currency manipulator. The Treasury Department's November 2005 report on International Economic and Exchange Rate Policies noted China's commitment to sustainable domestic growth as a reason for not designating them as a currency manipulator. However, concerns remain about China's transition from export reliance to consumption-driven GDP growth. Economists prioritize the overall trade deficit over bilateral trade balances. The United States relies on exports and domestic investment for GDP growth, with government policy having indirect effects on consumption patterns. Economists prioritize the overall trade deficit over bilateral balances, as countries naturally have varying trade relationships. The US has a trade deficit with Austria and a surplus with the Netherlands, highlighting concerns about its low saving rate and reliance on foreign investment. The United States has a trade deficit with Austria and a trade surplus with the Netherlands, despite both countries using the euro. The US is heavily reliant on foreign financing for its investment opportunities, with a significant portion of capital coming from China. The dollar depreciated against various currencies from January 2002 to January 2008. The dollar depreciated by 24% in nominal terms and 22% in inflation-adjusted terms from January 2002 to January 2008. Economists fear a sudden plummet in value could cause severe dislocations for the U.S. economy. Some economists fear that the large trade deficit could lead to a sudden and severe depreciation of the dollar, causing dislocations in the U.S. economy. Some economists worry about a sudden and rapid adjustment in the dollar value, leading to dislocations in U.S. financial markets. This scenario, although unlikely, could have significant economic costs and may be worth guarding against. The dollar has not depreciated rapidly since 2002 due to central banks in China and other developing countries accumulating foreign reserves to prevent their currency from appreciating against the dollar. Other Asian countries may continue this policy as long as China does. Other Asian countries may feel compelled to accumulate foreign reserves to prevent their currency from appreciating against the dollar, following China's lead. This commitment to support the value of the dollar by China and other developing countries has provided a sense of security for private investors in U.S. assets despite the large trade deficit. If China and other countries were to stop intervening in currency markets, the dollar could experience a significant and sudden decline. If China and other countries were to stop intervening in currency markets, the dollar could experience a significant and sudden decline. The United States could pressure China to make exchange rate reforms, such as making the yuan fully convertible or allowing gradual currency appreciation. Options for currency reform in China include making the yuan fully convertible, allowing gradual currency appreciation, reducing intervention in currency markets, widening the fluctuation band, and implementing financial sector reforms for greater currency flexibility. The debate on the best approach to achieve these goals has led to proposed legislation in the 110th Congress to induce China to reform its exchange rate regime. Options to induce China to reform its exchange rate regime, including proposed legislation, have sparked a policy debate. Some Members of Congress are frustrated with the Treasury Department's failure to designate China as a currency manipulator since 1994, believing that such a designation would increase pressure on China to reform its currency. Treasury is already negotiating with China on this issue. The Treasury Department's November 2005 currency report states that designating countries as currency manipulators is complex and requires negotiation. Proposed legislation aims to identify \"fundamentally misaligned currencies\" to pressure China to reform its currency. Proposed legislation such as H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 796, and S. 1607 (110th Congress) would require Treasury to identify \"fundamentally misaligned currencies\" instead of manipulated currencies. S. 1677 would mandate Treasury to cite a country for currency manipulation regardless of intent. These bills could lead to China being designated, increasing pressure on Treasury for currency reform. The possibility of China being designated as having a misaligned currency would increase pressure on the Treasury to push for currency reform. The U.S. government could negotiate directly with China to change its exchange rate policy, as President Bush and officials believe it is detrimental to China's economy and global growth. The U.S. government, led by President Bush, is pushing for currency reform in China, believing that its current policy is harmful to both China's economy and global growth. Efforts have been made to assist China in reforming its financial sector and promoting policies to increase domestic consumption and reduce reliance on exports and fixed investment. High-level talks like the Strategic Economic Dialogue are used to encourage China to adopt these reforms. China has been encouraged to adopt policies promoting domestic consumption and reducing reliance on exports and fixed investment through high-level talks like the Strategic Economic Dialogue. The U.S. has pressured China to reform its currency policy in G-7 finance meetings since 2004. The United States has been pressuring China to reform its currency policy in G-7 finance meetings since 2004, seeking to build consensus within the G-7 to put more pressure on China to make its currency more flexible. This includes potentially linking China's future membership in the G-7 to such reforms. The United States could build consensus within the G-7 to pressure China on currency reform or persuade China to engage in talks with other East Asian economies on exchange rate policy. Other East Asian countries fear uncompetitiveness if they make unilateral currency changes without China's matching adjustments. Proponents argue that other East Asian countries fear uncompetitiveness in exports if they change their currency value without China's matching adjustments. The US could urge the IMF to work with China on understanding economic risks and promoting balanced growth through policy tools like increased domestic consumption. The key in negotiations would be convincing China that liberalizing its exchange rate system is beneficial. The U.S. government could pressure China to liberalize its exchange rate system by threatening trade sanctions. Legislation like H.R. 1002 proposes additional tariffs on Chinese imports unless their currency appreciates. Some Members support legislation, such as H.R. 1002, that would impose tariffs on imports from China unless its currency appreciates. Proponents believe threats of tariffs were effective in prompting China to reform its currency policy in 2005 and should be used again. Opponents argue that sanctions would violate WTO rules and could have negative consequences. Some proposals aim to impose sanctions on currency policy to press China for reform without violating WTO rules. For example, S. 1607 would restrict certain countries with misaligned policies from U.S. government procurement and multilateral bank loans. Some proposals, like S. 1607, aim to impose sanctions on countries with misaligned currency policies to press for reform without violating WTO rules. This includes denying access to U.S. government procurement, voting against new multilateral bank loans, and cutting off financing by the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Critics have accused China of violating WTO rules with its currency policy, and the United States could potentially file a case with the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body to address this issue. The United States could file a case with the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body against China's currency peg. If ruled in favor, China would need to adjust its currency policy to comply with WTO rules. Failure to comply could lead to trade sanctions. Using the WTO allows for a multilateral approach, but there is no guarantee of a favorable ruling. Alternatively, the US could consider initiating a Section 301 case under US trade law. The United States could consider a unilateral approach by initiating a Section 301 case under US trade law, which may lead to trade sanctions. However, using the WTO dispute resolution procedures would likely be required by US obligations. Failure to do so could result in China filing a WTO case against the United States. The United States may need to pursue a Section 301 case with the WTO regarding China's exchange rate policy. In 2004, the Bush Administration rejected two Section 301 petitions on this issue. Several petitions were filed by various groups, including 30 Members of Congress, seeking to have the United States bring a case before the WTO against China over its currency practices. The USTR declined a Section 301 petition in June, expressing doubts about winning such a case in the WTO. H.R. 321, H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 796, S. 1607, and S. 1677 were involved in this issue. The USTR declined a petition in June regarding bringing a case against China over its currency policy. Legislation such as H.R. 321, H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 796, S. 1607, and S. 1677 aim to address currency manipulation through the WTO and modernize rules from 1947. US countervailing laws allow parties to seek relief. The U.S. calls for WTO to update rules on currency manipulation for trade advantage. Countervailing laws allow relief from subsidized imports. Commerce Department now applies laws to non-market economies like China. In November 2006, the Commerce Department pursued a countervailing case against certain Chinese paper products, imposing preliminary countervailing duties ranging from 11 to 20%. Despite China being a non-market economy, Commerce argued that economic reforms have made some sectors relatively market-based, allowing for identification of subsidies. Some Members argue that China's currency policy is a form of export subsidy that should be addressed under U.S. countervailing laws. Proposed bills like H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 364, and S. 796 aim to apply U.S. countervailing laws to non-market economies and address currency misalignment or manipulation. Some Members argue that China's currency policy is seen as an export subsidy actionable under U.S. countervailing laws. Proposed bills like H.R. 782, H.R. 2942, S. 364, and S. 796 aim to address currency misalignment or manipulation in non-market economies. Critics raise concerns about the difficulty in determining the subsidy level from China's currency and the potential challenges in the WTO against U.S. countervailing measures. Critics argue that China's undervalued currency harms U.S. industries by affecting the price of Chinese exports. Proposed bills like H.R. 2942 and S. 1607 aim to factor in the impact of misaligned currencies on export prices when determining subsidy levels. U.S. antidumping laws allow relief for imports sold below fair value and causing harm to U.S. industries. The impact of China's undervalued currency on U.S. industries is a major concern, with proposed bills like H.R. 2942 and S. 1607 aiming to address this issue by factoring in currency misalignment when determining antidumping duties. Critics question the feasibility of accurately assessing currency undervaluation and its compatibility with WTO rules, suggesting alternative options like utilizing U.S. trade remedy laws related to China's WTO accession. One option to address the impact of China's undervalued currency on U.S. industries is to utilize U.S. trade remedy laws, such as invoking safeguard provisions under Sections 421-423 of the 1974 Trade Act, to impose restrictions on imported Chinese products causing market disruption to domestic producers. This could provide temporary relief for affected U.S. firms. The Bush Administration invoked the special China textile and apparel safeguard multiple times due to a surge in Chinese exports causing market disruption to U.S. domestic producers. An agreement was reached in November 2005 to limit certain textile and apparel exports from China to the United States until the end of 2008. The Bush Administration invoked the special China textile and apparel safeguard multiple times due to a surge in Chinese exports causing market disruption to U.S. domestic producers. An agreement was reached in November 2005 to limit certain textile and apparel exports from China to the United States until the end of 2008. H.R. 782 and S. 796 would require that exchange rate misalignment by China be considered a factor in making determinations of market disruption under the China-specific safeguard. H.R. 782 and S. 796 would consider China's exchange rate misalignment in determining market disruption under the China-specific safeguard. Policy analysts suggest addressing China's currency policy as part of a broader U.S. trade strategy to encourage economic and trade reforms and address various complaints about China's trade practices. Some analysts argue that U.S. policymakers should address China's currency policy as part of a comprehensive trade strategy to push for economic reforms and address complaints. The Administration's approach in SED talks involves urging China to increase domestic consumption and adjust its currency policy for long-term trade balance. Policymakers also emphasize pressing China to comply with WTO commitments, particularly on market access issues. The United States aims to address China's trade policy by focusing on pressing China to comply with its WTO commitments, including market access and protection of intellectual property rights. This approach is seen as a long-term solution to global trade imbalances. The United States aims to address China's trade policy by pressing China to comply with its WTO commitments, which includes market access and intellectual property rights protection. This approach is believed to be a more effective strategy compared to pushing for currency reform, as it leverages multilateral rules and legal processes within the WTO. Additionally, proponents argue that China is more likely to adhere to international rules than respond to direct U.S. pressure. Supporters of the policy argue that China's leaders are more likely to adhere to international rules than respond to direct U.S. pressure. Concerns have been raised about China's large holdings of U.S. federal debt, with claims that China could use it as a political tool against the United States. A recent article mentioned China's ability to make the dollar collapse by selling off its U.S. Treasuries if trade sanctions were imposed to force currency reform. Chinese government officials from leading think tanks stated that China could potentially make the dollar collapse by selling off its U.S. Treasuries if trade sanctions were imposed to force currency reform. This raised concerns among U.S. policymakers, prompting Senator Charles Grassley to seek clarification from the Chinese government. In response to concerns about China potentially causing the dollar to collapse by selling off U.S. Treasuries, Senator Charles Grassley sought clarification from the Chinese government. The Chinese ambassador assured that China had no plans to drastically adjust its foreign reserves, emphasizing the importance of dollar-denominated assets in China's investment portfolio. The People's Bank of China stated that dollar-denominated assets are crucial in China's foreign exchange reserves, emphasizing responsible investment. While selling off a large portion of these assets could impact the dollar's value, it is unlikely China would take such a drastic step due to potential negative consequences. China is unlikely to sell off a large portion of its dollar-denominated assets in international currency markets. Such a move could lead to a sharp appreciation of the yuan against the dollar, resulting in capital loss for China and lower value of its remaining U.S. assets. It could also reduce economic growth in the United States and diminish U.S. demand for imports, including those from China. The Chinese government launched the China Investment Corporation (CIC) in 2007 to manage foreign exchange reserves. The CIC will manage over $200 billion and may diversify away from dollar-denominated assets. This could potentially affect U.S. interest rates. China's holding of Treasury securities has increased very little since 2007. If China diversifies away from dollar-denominated assets, it may impact U.S. interest rates. Allowing the yuan to be determined by market forces could boost U.S. exports and reduce the bilateral trade deficit with China. Allowing the yuan to appreciate could boost U.S. exports, reduce the trade deficit with China, and lead to higher interest rates in the United States. This would require U.S. borrowers to find new lenders for financing, potentially impacting investment spending and the long-run size of the U.S. economy. A sudden decline in Chinese demand for U.S. assets could lead to a drop in the value of the dollar, potentially destabilizing the U.S. economy. Rising inflation in the United States coupled with a rise in the value of the yuan could also have negative effects. A sudden decline in Chinese demand for U.S. assets could destabilize the U.S. economy by causing a drop in the value of the dollar. Rising inflation in the United States could lead to higher import prices if the yuan appreciates, adding to inflationary pressures. If the relative demand for Chinese goods and assets decreases in the future, the floating exchange rate would depreciate, reversing the effects. The move to a floating exchange rate typically involves eliminating capital controls that restrict citizens from buying and selling foreign currency. China opposes a floating exchange rate due to fears of large capital outflows caused by concerns over the safety of deposits in the state banking system. China opposes a floating exchange rate due to fears of large capital outflows caused by concerns over the safety of deposits in the state banking system. This could lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate, impacting U.S. exporters and import-competing firms, potentially expanding the U.S. bilateral trade deficit. The United States would still borrow heavily from China, but it would now be private citizens buying U.S. assets instead of the Chinese central bank. China could attempt to float its exchange rate while maintaining its capital controls, eliminating the possibility of currency depreciation due to private capital outflow. This may make it harder to impose effective capital controls, as a fluctuating currency would incentivize evasion. Maintaining the status quo is another option. One option is to maintain the status quo, where the central bank exchanges newly printed yuan for U.S. assets, causing prices in China to rise until the real exchange rate aligns with the market rate, reducing the U.S. bilateral trade deficit. China's high saving rate and the United States' low saving rate contribute to their trade imbalances. Adjusting the real exchange rate over time could reduce the U.S. bilateral trade deficit, benefiting American exporters and import-competing firms. However, this solution does not guarantee the elimination of the trade deficit. China's high saving rate and the United States' low saving rate contribute to their trade imbalances. Despite efforts to adjust the real exchange rate, the bilateral trade deficit may persist. China's low-cost labor and productivity gains continue to drive export growth to the United States. China's exports to the United States are likely to keep growing due to its combination of low-cost labor and productivity gains, regardless of the exchange rate regime. The appreciation of the yuan since 2005 has not reduced the trade deficit. U.S. policymakers are concerned about China's currency policy, the trade deficit, decline in manufacturing employment, and China's economic rise. China's exchange rate has slowly appreciated since 2005. China's currency policy is closely tied to concerns about the U.S. trade deficit with China, the decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs, and China's economic growth.
