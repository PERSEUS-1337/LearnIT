The \"America's Border Security Act of 2007\" requires the use of surveillance equipment by the Department of Defense to assist in monitoring the international land borders of the United States to prevent illegal immigration. Within 6 months of the Act's enactment, a report must be submitted to Congress detailing the current use of Defense equipment for border surveillance and assessing risks to citizens. The Department of Defense uses equipment to assist the Secretary of Homeland Security in surveilling the US international land borders and assessing associated risks. The plan includes increasing the use of Defense equipment for surveillance activities and providing equipment and support by the Secretary of Defense. During a 1-year period, the Secretary of Homeland Security will conduct a pilot program using unmanned aerial vehicles for border surveillance along the US-Canada international border. The plan includes utilizing Department of Defense equipment to assist in surveillance activities and providing support from the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Homeland Security will conduct a pilot program using unmanned aerial vehicles for border surveillance along the US-Canada international border.

The Secretary of Homeland Security is mandated to improve satellite communications for Border Patrol agents, their stations, and residents in remote areas along international borders, as well as other border security agencies. This includes enhancing communication between Border Patrol agents and residents in remote areas, and between border security agencies and State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. SEC. 6. UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to acquire and maintain at least 5 unmanned aerial vehicles and related equipment for patrolling the US international borders. This includes additional sensors, critical spares, satellite command and control, and other necessary operational support equipment. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 to fund these activities. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 to fund the acquisition and maintenance of unmanned aerial vehicles for patrolling US international borders. Amounts appropriated are authorized to remain available until expended. SEC. 7. SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to develop and implement an aerial surveillance program using unmanned aerial vehicles to enhance border security between the United States and Canada as part of the surveillance technologies programs. The Secretary of Homeland Security is mandated to fully integrate aerial surveillance technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles, to enhance border security along the international borders of the United States with Canada and Mexico. The program aims to continuously monitor every mile of these borders, considering various surveillance technologies and assessing their feasibility and advisability. The Secretary of Homeland Security will consider aerial surveillance technologies, assess their feasibility for addressing border threats, consult with the Secretary of Defense on deployment along international borders. The Secretary of Homeland Security will consult with the Secretary of Defense on deploying technologies along international borders and with the FAA on airspace coordination for the aerial surveillance program. The aerial surveillance program developed under this subsection will use various technologies in different terrains near international borders to assess their effectiveness. The curr_chunk discusses evaluating technologies near international borders for border security, considering previous experiences, cost-effectiveness, technical complexity, liability, safety, and privacy concerns. The Secretary of Homeland Security may continue using aerial surveillance technologies for border security while assessing their effectiveness.

The Integrated and Automated Surveillance Program integrates motion sensor alerts with cameras that automatically pan and tilt towards triggered sensors. Cameras do not require manual operation, have flexible views, and their footage can be viewed at designated centers using a standard process for collection and cataloging. The Integrated and Automated Surveillance Program allows surveillance video from cameras to be viewed at designated centers, with a standard process for collecting and reporting intrusion data. Future technology investments can be integrated with existing systems, and performance measures are used to evaluate the program's effectiveness. The Integrated and Automated Surveillance Program aims to develop performance measures to evaluate results and increase response effectiveness in monitoring illegal intrusions along US borders. Plans are in place to streamline site selection and environmental assessment processes for installing surveillance technology infrastructure. Standards are being developed to enhance the Program. The Integrated and Automated Surveillance Program aims to streamline site selection and environmental assessment processes for installing surveillance technology infrastructure. Standards are being developed to expand the use of existing structures and deploy nonpermanent surveillance platforms to increase mobility and identify illegal activities.
