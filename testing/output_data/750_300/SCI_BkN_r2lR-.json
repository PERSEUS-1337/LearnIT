    "content": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence focus on identifying analogies across domains without supervision, particularly in cross-domain image mapping. While progress has been made in translating images, visual fidelity often falls short in matching samples from different domains. This paper introduces AN-GAN, a matching-by-synthesis approach that outperforms current techniques in finding exact analogies between datasets. The task involves finding analogous images in domain B for every image in domain A, breaking down the cross-domain mapping into domain alignment and learning the mapping function. Humans have the remarkable ability to make analogies between unseen domains without prior supervision, which is crucial for leveraging previous knowledge to inform new situations. This is exemplified in the AN-GAN approach, which excels in cross-domain image mapping by iteratively solving domain alignment and learning the mapping function tasks. As alignment improves, unsupervised translation quality approaches that of full supervision. Humans can make analogies between unseen domains without supervision, crucial for leveraging previous knowledge. This is important for Artificial Intelligence to identify analogies between multiple domains. AI success has been in supervised problems, but analogy identification is different as no explicit examples are given in advance. Several approaches have been proposed recently. Recently, approaches have been proposed for unsupervised mapping between different domains using sets of images without explicit correspondences. The methods learn a mapping function that can map an image from one domain to its likely appearance in another domain. The methods aim to learn a mapping function that can transform images from one domain to another, ensuring that the distributions of the mapped images are similar to the target domain and that the cycle constraint is satisfied. The task involves identifying analogies between pairs of examples in different domains. In this paper, the task involves identifying analogies between pairs of examples in different domains using a fixed non-linear transformation. The translated images often lack visual fidelity due to constraints on distributions and inversion properties, rather than exemplar-based constraints. In this work, the problem of analogy identification is addressed by adding exemplar-based constraints to improve performance in visual analogy identification. The method is effective even when only some sample images have exact analogies, and it can find correspondences between sets. Our method for visual analogy identification can recover high performance even when only some sample images have exact analogies. It can find correspondences between sets without exact correspondences available. By retrieving examples instead of mapping them, our method yields better visual quality. Additionally, using domain alignment allows for a two-step approach to training a domain mapping function, which is more accurate than previous unsupervised mapping approaches. By aligning domains, a two-step approach for training a domain mapping function is achieved, resulting in better accuracy than previous unsupervised methods. This method aims to identify analogies between datasets without supervision, closely related to image matching techniques. This paper discusses a method for identifying analogies between datasets without supervision, related to image matching techniques. The approach involves matching by synthesis across domains, similar to unsupervised style-transfer and image-to-image mapping methods. Image matching is a key computer vision task, with various approaches like pixel and feature-point matching. Deep neural networks are used for dataset matching, while generic visual features are relevant for unsupervised scenarios. However, standard visual features struggle with different domains. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are also important in this context. In experiments, standard visual features like VGG-16 BID15 struggle to match different domains. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have been a breakthrough in image synthesis, especially for image to image translation tasks. Image to image translation work often utilizes GANs to generate realistic images by training a generator network G and a second network D. The generative architecture is based on BID12, creating images based on input images rather than random noise. Unsupervised mapping does not require supervision beyond sets. The specific generative architecture used for image mapping is based on BID12, focusing on creating images from input images rather than random noise. Unsupervised mapping, which does not require supervision beyond sample images from two domains, has been recently applied for image to image translation and translating between natural languages. The mapping methods aim to generate a mapped version of the sample in the other domain rather than retrieving the best matching sample in the new domain. Supervised mapping methods focus on training with matching pairs of input and output images, using techniques like GANs and the U-net architecture. This approach differs from unsupervised mapping, which aims to generate a mapped version of a sample in another domain without retrieving the best matching sample. The link between source and target images is strengthened using the U-net architecture of BID14. Supervised mapping methods, like BID2, have shown improved results with perceptual loss without GANs. Our method for analogy identification involves two sets of images in domains A and B. Recently, BID2 showed enhanced mapping results in supervised settings by utilizing perceptual loss without GANs. The method for analogy identification involves matching indexes between two sets of images in domains A and B to find analogous pairs. An iterative approach is presented for mapping images from the source. The iterative approach presented aims to find matching indexes between images in domains A and B to create analogous pairs. A GAN-based distribution approach is used to map images from the source domain to the target domain, optimizing the distribution of the mapped images to appear identical to the target domain images. The mapping function T AB is trained to transform images from domain A to appear as if they belong to domain B. A discriminator D is trained to enforce distributional alignment between the transformed images and images from domain B. The goal is to make it difficult for the discriminator to distinguish between the distributions of the two domains. The mapping function T AB transforms images from domain A to domain B, while the discriminator D enforces distributional alignment between the transformed images and images from domain B. The goal is to make it difficult for the discriminator to distinguish between the distributions of the two domains. Additional constraints like circularity and distance invariance have been effectively added to improve the distribution-constraint. Additional constraints such as circularity and distance invariance have been effectively added to improve the distribution-constraint. The popular cycle approach involves training one-sided GANs in both directions and ensuring that the translated images recover the original ones. The two-sided cycle loss function yields mapping functions from A to B and back, providing matching between samples and synthetic images in the target domain. The two-sided approach in mapping functions from A to B and back does not provide exact correspondences between domain images. A method for exact matches between domains is described, where for every A domain image xi, there exists an analogous B domain image ymi. The task is to find the set of indices mi for exact matches. The method described provides exact matches between A and B domain images by finding a set of indices for matching pairs. A match matrix \u03b1i,j is used to match A domain image xi with a mixture of B domain images, and vice versa. The goal is to achieve a binary mapping function T_AB of high quality. The method aims to create a match matrix \u03b1i,j between A and B domain images, with a binary mapping function T_AB. The optimization involves a perceptual loss and relaxed binary constraints on \u03b1i,j for computational efficiency. The optimization process involves a relaxed binary constraint on \u03b1i,j and an entropy constraint to encourage sparse solutions. The positivity and sum constraints on \u03b1 are enforced using an auxiliary variable \u03b2 passed through a Softmax function. The relaxed formulation can be optimized using SGD with the significance of the entropy term adjusted to control the solutions. The relaxed formulation of the optimization process enforces constraints on \u03b1 using an auxiliary variable \u03b2 passed through a Softmax function. By adjusting the significance of the entropy term, solutions can converge to the original correspondence problem. Iteratively updating T AB for N epochs and then updating \u03b2 for N epochs achieves excellent results. AN-GAN is a cross domain matching method that achieves excellent results by iteratively updating T AB and \u03b2 for N epochs, with a good initialization of T AB being essential for performance. The method requires full mapping only once at the beginning of the \u03b1 iteration. The AN-GAN method introduces a cross domain matching approach using exemplar and distribution based constraints. It includes three types of constraints: distributional loss, cycle loss, and exemplar loss to improve matching performance. The AN-GAN method introduces constraints for cross-domain matching: distributional loss, cycle loss, and exemplar loss. The optimization problem involves adversarially training discriminators D A and D B. Initial burn-in period ensures distribution alignment before optimizing individual images. The optimization process involves setting initial values for \u03b2 in equation Eq. 6, followed by a burn-in period of 200 epochs with \u03b4 = 0 to align distributions. The exemplar-loss is optimized through iterations of \u03b1 and T, with specific learning rates and decay factors. Shared \u03b2 parameters are used for both mapping directions in the experiments. In the optimization process, initial values for \u03b2 are set followed by a burn-in period. The learning rate for the exemplar loss is decayed after 20 epochs. Different loss functions were explored for determining similarity between actual and synthesized examples. The Laplacian pyramid loss showed improvement in supervision. In experiments, different loss functions were tested for similarity between actual and synthesized examples. While Euclidean or L1 loss functions were not perceptual enough, the Laplacian pyramid loss provided some improvement. The best results were achieved using a perceptual loss function, as seen in prior works. The loss function extracts VGG features for each image and uses the features from the second convolutional layer in each block. Our loss function extracts VGG features for images I1 and I2, using different numbers of feature maps based on image resolution. L1 loss on pixels is also used to consider colors. The perceptual loss function is defined using feature maps \u03c6m1 and \u03c6m2, with Np pixels and Nm features in layer m. This method is considered effective for image comparison. The perceptual loss function uses feature maps \u03c6m1 and \u03c6m2 for images I1 and I2, with Np pixels and Nm features in layer m. The method is unsupervised matching as features are not tailored to specific domains. Matching experiments were conducted on public datasets to evaluate the approach. The approach involves unsupervised methods for cross-domain matching, evaluated through experiments on public datasets. Various scenarios were tested, including exact matches between A and B domain images. The method was compared against existing solutions like Unmapped-Pixel and Unmapped-VGG, with the latter being computationally heavy due to feature size. The method involves unsupervised cross-domain matching using different loss functions. CycleGAN-Pixel and CycleGAN-VGG are trained using specific equations and then nearest neighbors are computed in the target domain using L1 loss and VGG feature loss, respectively. The VGG features are subsampled for computational efficiency. The authors' CycleGAN code is used to train CycleGAN-VGG with VGG loss for nearest neighbor computation in the target set. AN-GAN is trained with \u03b1 iterations only and with both \u03b1 and TXY iterations. The method is evaluated on 4 public exact match datasets including Facades and Maps. The method is evaluated on 4 public exact match datasets: Facades with building facades aligned with segmentation maps, Maps with aligned Maps and satellite images, Zappos50K dataset with images of shoes, and Amazon handbags dataset. Edge images were automatically detected using HED for both shoe and handbag datasets. The Zappos50K dataset contains around 137k images of Amazon handbags. Edge images were automatically detected using HED. The datasets were down-sampled to 2k images each for memory complexity. The method was compared with five others for exact correspondence identification. A and B images were shuffled prior to training to recover the full match function. In a comparison of methods for exact correspondence identification, A and B images are shuffled before training to recover the match function. Results show that matching using pixels or deep features cannot solve the task due to differences in the domains. The results show that matching between domains using pixels or deep features cannot solve the task due to differences in the domains. CycleGAN and pixel-loss matching improve performance, but there is still room for improvement. Matching perceptual features between source and target images using VGG is another method that enhances performance for image retrieval tasks. The next baseline method improved performance by matching perceptual features between source and target images using VGG features. Exhaustive search was too computationally expensive, so subsampling features was necessary. Perceptual features outperformed pixel matching, and linear combinations of mapped images were matched instead of single images. The method of matching linear combinations of mapped images using \u03b1 iterations presented significant improvements in performance. This approach is less sensitive to outliers and uses the same \u03b2 parameters for both sides of the match to improve identification. The exemplar loss alone should recover a plausible solution for the matches between domains and the mapping function. The method presented significant improvements by using a distributional auxiliary loss to aid optimization. The exemplar loss alone did not converge, but with the auxiliary losses, it was able to converge through \u03b1 \u2212 T iterations. The distribution and cycle auxiliary losses are essential for successful analogy finding in our full-method AN-GAN. Our full-method AN-GAN utilizes the full exemplar-based loss to optimize the mapping function for improved performance in analogy finding. Experiments with datasets where a percentage of matches were unavailable showed significantly better results in both matching directions. In experiments with datasets where a percentage of matches were unavailable, images were randomly removed from the A and B domain datasets. M % of samples in each domain did not have a match in the other domain, while (1 \u2212 M )% of images had exact matches. The task was to identify correct matches for all samples with matches in the other domain. The evaluation metric was the percentage of images with exact matches out of the total. The evaluation metric is the percentage of images with exact matches out of the total. Results show that the method can handle scenarios where not all examples have matches, with comparable results even when 10% of samples do not have matches. In scenarios where not all examples have matches, results are comparable to the clean case even when 10% of samples do not have matches. Most datasets with 25% of samples without matches do not show significantly lower results. AN-GAN has achieved a 90% match rate with up to 75% of samples not having matches, notably in the Facades dataset. The main objective is identifying exact analogies, but testing the approach on scenarios without exact analogies is also interesting. In this experiment, the method is evaluated on finding similar matches in scenarios where exact analogies are not available. The DiscoGAN architecture from BID9 is used for mapping in the Shoes2Handbags scenario, as CycleGAN is not effective for non-localized mapping. Several analogies are observed in FIG2 for the Shoes2Handbags dataset. The DiscoGAN architecture BID9 is used for mapping in the Shoes2Handbags scenario. In FIG2, analogies are observed for the dataset. The quality of DiscoGAN mapping varies, with AN \u2212 GAN providing better matches. The method aligns datasets with high accuracy. The DiscoGAN architecture is used for mapping in the Shoes2Handbags scenario, with AN \u2212 GAN providing better matches than DiscoGAN. A two-step approach is suggested for training a mapping function between unaligned datasets: (i) Find analogies using AN \u2212 GAN, and (ii) Train a standard mapping function using self-supervision from stage (i). Alignment accuracy of 97% was achieved for the Facades dataset, used to train a fully self-supervised mapping function with Pix2Pix.

Alignment accuracy of 97% was achieved for the Facades dataset, used to train a fully self-supervised mapping function with Pix2Pix. The supervised mapping is far more accurate than unsupervised mapping, which is often unable to match the correct colors. Our method, based on AN-GAN, provides accurate image mapping by finding correspondences between domains, effectively making the unsupervised problem supervised. It outperforms CycleGAN and achieves similar results to fully supervised methods. The self-supervised approach performs similarly to fully supervised methods and much better than CycleGAN. Our self-supervised method, based on AN-GAN, outperforms CycleGAN and achieves similar results to fully supervised methods on the edges2shoes and edges2handbags datasets. The use of an appropriate loss and larger architecture enabled by ANGAN-supervision yields improved performance over CycleGAN and is competitive with full-supervision. The study evaluated a self-supervised method using AN-GAN, which outperformed CycleGAN and achieved similar results to fully supervised methods on datasets. The method was also tested on point cloud matching, showing competitive performance with full-supervision methods. The experiments involved point cloud matching using a self-supervised method and the Bunny benchmark. The model's success rate in achieving alignment for various rotation angles was tested. The architecture used for both CycleGAN and the method included a fully connected network with hidden layers, BatchNorm, Leaky ReLU activations, and a linear affine matrix mapping function. The architecture for both CycleGAN and the method involved a fully connected network with hidden layers, BatchNorm, Leaky ReLU activations, and a linear affine matrix mapping function. A loss term was added to encourage orthonormality of the weights of the mapper, with success rates compared for different rotation angles. Our method significantly outperforms the baseline results reported in BID17 for large angles, achieving an RMSE alignment accuracy of 0.05. The success rates for different rotation angles show that our method is effective for low dimensional transformations and settings without exact matches.

The algorithm for cross domain matching in an unsupervised way introduces the exemplar constraint to improve match performance. The method was evaluated on public datasets for full and partial exact matching. The exemplar constraint was introduced to improve match performance in cross-domain matching. The method significantly outperformed baseline methods on public datasets for full and partial exact matching, even in cases where exact matches were not available. Future work will explore matching between different modalities like images, speech, and text. Future work is needed to explore matching between different modalities such as images, speech, and text, as current distribution matching algorithms are insufficient for this challenging scenario. New algorithms would need to be developed to achieve this goal."
