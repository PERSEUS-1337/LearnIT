Interest in renewable energy has since increased due to rising petroleum prices. The 2008 farm bill built upon the renewable energy policies of the 2002 farm bill, aiming to promote the adoption of renewable energy systems and reduce energy import dependence. Biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel receive federal support through tax incentives, loans, grants, and regulatory programs. The 2008 farm bill, following the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, supports biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel through federal incentives and regulatory programs to reduce energy import dependence. It reflects the increased role of biofuels mandated by the renewable fuels standard, emphasizing production from cellulosic feedstocks. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 supports biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel through federal incentives and regulatory programs to reduce energy import dependence. The expansion of the renewable fuels standard (RFS) in EISA emphasizes the production of biofuels from cellulosic feedstocks, with a significant increase in the overall RFS to 36 billion gallons by 2022. This includes specific targets for biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol, reflecting concerns about economic and environmental issues associated with corn starch-based ethanol. The emphasis on cellulosic ethanol reflects concerns about economic and environmental issues associated with corn starch-based ethanol. Escalating commodity prices since 2007 have led to sharp increases in livestock feed costs, export prices, and domestic food price inflation. Ethanol production in 2010 used nearly 40% of U.S. corn production, leading to a drawdown of corn stocks and price increases. Ethanol's profitability depends on petroleum and corn prices. In 2010, ethanol production used nearly 40% of U.S. corn production, leading to a drawdown of corn stocks and price increases. Ethanol's profitability depends on petroleum and corn prices, with rising petroleum prices increasing demand for ethanol and corn. The \"food versus fuel\" debate intensified during the 2008 farm bill debate, highlighting potential problems with replacing gasoline consumption with corn-based ethanol. The debate over replacing gasoline consumption with corn-based ethanol intensified during the 2008 farm bill debate, as food price inflation accelerated both in the U.S. and globally. Several federal programs supporting renewable energy production, including the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), originated outside of the farm bill. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and federal tax credits for biofuel blenders have legislative origins outside of the farm bill. The RFS, which requires an increasing volume of biofuels in the national fuel supply, started with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and was expanded in EISA. Tax credits for biofuel blenders were first included in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and extended in the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. The 2008 farm bill significantly increased programs to support biofuels production. The 2008 farm bill (P.L. 110-246) expanded programs to support biofuels production, including corn starch-based ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, and biodiesel. It contains an energy title (Title IX) covering various energy and agricultural topics with a focus on biofuels. Research provisions are in Title VII and tax and trade provisions in Title XV. The 2008 farm bill focuses on biofuels, including corn starch-based ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, and biodiesel. Title IX contains provisions related to renewable energy, while Title VII covers research and Title XV addresses tax and trade. The bill maintains the structure of Title IX from the Senate-passed version and includes new provisions in Section 9001, with additional sections directing studies on biofuels infrastructure and renewable fertilizer. The 2008 farm bill focuses on biofuels, with new provisions in Section 9001 replacing those from the 2002 bill. Sections 9002 and 9003 direct studies on biofuels infrastructure and renewable fertilizer. Key provisions include a new cellulosic ethanol production tax credit, promotion of cellulosic feedstocks production, marketing infrastructure, and refinery development, as well as grants and loan guarantees for biofuels research and production. The 2008 farm bill focuses on biofuels, with provisions for production tax credit, promotion of cellulosic feedstocks, marketing infrastructure, refinery development, grants and loan guarantees for biofuels research and production, incentivizing cellulosic ethanol feedstock production, studies on market and environmental impacts of biofuels use, federal procurement of bio-based products, bio-products certification program, rural energy efficiency and self-sufficiency support. The 2008 farm bill includes provisions for biofuels, such as production tax credits, promotion of cellulosic feedstocks, marketing infrastructure, and grants for research. It also supports rural energy efficiency, reauthorizes biofuels research programs, and promotes the use of biodiesel. The 2008 farm bill energy title provides financial incentives and support for the production of advanced biofuels, mainly cellulosic. This includes grants and loan guarantees to leverage industry investments in new technologies and infrastructure. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) supports the production of dedicated crop and forest cellulosic feedstocks, along with incentives for post-production activities. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP, Section 9001) and the Biorefinery Assistance program (Section 9001) support the production of advanced biofuels through incentives for feedstock production and refinery construction. Increased funding for advanced biofuels research is provided under the Agricultural Bioenergy Feedstock and Energy Efficiency Research and Extension Initiative (Section 7207) and the Sun Grant Program (Section 7526). Cellulosic ethanol is produced from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin derived from plants, supported by increased funding for advanced biofuels research under programs like the Agricultural Bioenergy Feedstock and Energy Efficiency Research and Extension Initiative and the Sun Grant Program. Various agricultural products serve as viable feedstock for advanced biofuels production. Ethanol is produced from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin derived from plants, with various agricultural products serving as viable feedstock. Cellulosic feedstock such as prairie grasses and fast-growing woody crops offer long-term supply potential, along with waste biomass materials. Native prairie grasses like switchgrass may provide environmental benefits over corn-based ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol production from various feedstocks like wood processing mill residues, urban wood wastes, and agricultural residues is not yet on a commercial scale, with only a few small refineries starting limited production in 2010. The slow progress has led the EPA to waive and reduce cellulosic biofuel mandates. Only a few small refineries began limited production of cellulosic ethanol in 2010. The EPA reduced RFS mandates for cellulosic biofuels due to slow progress, with mandates dropping from 100 million gallons in 2010 to 6.5 million gallons, from 250 million gallons in 2011 to 6.6 million gallons, and from 500 million gallons in 2012 to a range of 3.5 to 12.9 million gallons. Title XV of the 2008 farm bill extends tax credits and tariffs on ethanol, including a producer tax credit of $1.01 per gallon. Title XV of the 2008 farm bill extends tax credits and tariffs on ethanol to promote cellulosic ethanol production. A producer tax credit of $1.01 per gallon applies to ethanol produced from qualifying cellulosic feedstocks, while an ethanol blender tax credit of $0.45 per gallon (reduced from $0.51) applies to all ethanol blended. The ethanol import tariff of $0.54 per gallon was also set. The ethanol blender tax credit was reduced to $0.45 per gallon in January 2009, while the ethanol import tariff of $0.54 per gallon was extended to the end of 2010. Proponents argue that the tariff protects the U.S. ethanol industry from lower-cost imports and offsets the blender tax credit available to all ethanol blended in the U.S. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the ethanol blender tax credit and import tariff until the end of 2011 to benefit the U.S. ethanol industry and offset lower-cost imports. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the ethanol blender tax credit and import tariff until the end of 2011 at the current rates. The tariff exceeds the blender tax credit by nine cents, imposing a punitive duty on imported ethanol. The farm bill includes provisions for reports on the impact of ethanol production on the farm economy and the environment. The farm bill includes provisions for reports assessing the impact of increased ethanol production on the farm economy, environment, and consumer food prices. Studies such as the Comprehensive Study of Biofuels and the Biofuels Infrastructure Study will be conducted by various government agencies. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program also requires an assessment of the economic impacts of expanded cellulosic biomass. The 2008 farm bill authorizes over $1 billion in mandatory funding for FY2008 through FY2012 for various biofuel-related programs, including the Biomass Crop Assistance Program and the Biomass Research and Development Program. This is an increase from the $800 million authorized in the 2002 farm bill. The 2008 farm bill authorizes over $1 billion in mandatory funding for various biofuel-related programs, including the Biorefinery Assistance Program, Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, Rural Energy for America Program, Biomass Research and Development Act, and potentially unlimited funding for the Biomass Crop Assistance Program. The 2008 farm bill authorizes over $1.7 billion in discretionary funding for energy-related provisions, with a significant increase in funding compared to the 2002 farm bill. The Biorefinery Assistance Program receives the largest increase in authorization, with mandatory funding through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. The 2008 farm bill authorizes over $1.7 billion in discretionary funding for energy-related provisions, with a significant increase compared to the 2002 farm bill. Mandatory funding is through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation. Programs identified as receiving mandatory funds are funded at these levels unless Congress limits funding through the appropriations process.
