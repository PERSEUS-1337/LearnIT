    "content": "The Department of Defense was funded by continuing resolutions until FY2011, allowing spending at FY2010 levels with restrictions on new programs. On April 15, 2011, an omnibus funding bill for the rest of FY2011 was signed, providing $659.9 billion for DOD activities. On April 15, 2011, an omnibus funding bill (H.R. 1473; P.L. 112-10) was signed, providing $659.9 billion for all DOD activities except military construction, which was a reduction of $18.2 billion from the President's request for FY2011. The bill also allocated $17.8 billion for DOD's military construction budget, a decrease of $2.2 billion from the President's request. H.R. 1473 provided $17.8 billion for DOD's military construction budget, a reduction of $2.2 billion from the President's request. The bill included $4.4 billion in reductions, with $2.0 billion rescinded from prior DOD funds and $1.5 billion cut proportionately from various programs. The bill made significant reductions to various programs, including $2.0 billion rescinded from DOD funds, $1.5 billion cut proportionately from different projects, $723 million from civilian pay, and $125 million from federally funded research and development corporations. Additionally, there were cuts to major weapons programs, such as $1.7 billion from the F-35 Joint Strike program. The bill, H.R. 1473, made significant reductions to major weapons programs, including cuts to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new ground combat vehicle for the Army, and a new mid-air refueling tanker for the Air Force. Additionally, the bill added funds to the budget request for various programs. The bill H.R. 1473 made cuts to major weapons programs, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and a new ground combat vehicle for the Army. It also added funds for various programs, such as $495.0 million for Navy strike fighters, $1.38 billion for National Guard equipment, $661.7 million for medical research, $523.2 million for innovative research, $293.2 million for Israeli missile defense, and $165.0 million for the Military Career Advancement Account program. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act allocated funds for various programs, including $523.2 million for innovative research, $293.2 million for Israeli missile defense, and $165.0 million for the Military Career Advancement Account program. The bill did not include funds for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act allocated funds for various programs, including $523.2 million for innovative research, $293.2 million for Israeli missile defense, and $165.0 million for the Military Career Advancement Account program. The bill did not include funds for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The House passed a bill authorizing $725.9 billion for defense activities, $2.7 million less than requested by the Administration. The Senate version authorized $725.7 billion, a reduction of $240.7 million, but was not acted upon due to opposition to repealing the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The Senate rejected a motion to invoke cloture on a bill that would have repealed the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy for openly homosexual individuals in the military. A compromise version of the bill was negotiated without this provision. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees negotiated a compromise version of the authorization bill (H.R. 6523) that dropped the \"don't ask, don't tell\" provision. The bill was signed by the President on January 7, 2011 (P.L. 111-383) and supported the Administration's budget request, including not adding funds for the C-17 long-range cargo plane production. The House and Senate supported the Administration's budget request in the authorization bill (H.R. 6523). They did not add funds for the C-17 long-range cargo plane production. The House bill authorized a 1.9% increase in military personnel pay, while the Senate bill authorized a 1.4% increase. Additionally, $485 million was authorized for the development of an alternate jet engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The enacted version of the FY2011 bill, H.R. 6523, authorized a 1.4% basic pay raise for military personnel and $485 million for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which was not requested in the budget. The President's FY2011 budget request included $485 million for the alternate engine for the F-35, part of the $738.7 billion budget for national defense. The FY2011 budget for national defense includes $733.3 billion in discretionary spending, with $5.3 billion in mandatory spending for military retirees. This budget also includes $548.9 billion for regular operations of the Department of Defense and $159.3 billion for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The FY2011 budget for national defense includes $733.3 billion in discretionary spending, with $5.3 billion in mandatory spending for military retirees. Additionally, $159.3 billion was allocated for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, bringing the total DOD request for FY2011 to $708.3 billion. An additional $33 billion was requested for FY2010 war costs to cover the deployment of 30,000 troops to Afghanistan. The President's decision to deploy an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan in FY2011 would bring the total number of U.S. troops in the country to 98,000. The requested supplemental funds for war costs in FY2010 would amount to $162.6 billion, with a $159.3 billion request for war costs in FY2011, which was $3 billion lower than the previous year. The Administration requested $159.3 billion for war costs in FY2011, $3 billion less than FY2010. The budget reflected a shift from Iraq to Afghanistan operations. An additional $655 million was allocated for humanitarian relief in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. The FY2010 DOD supplemental funding request was amended to include $655 million for humanitarian relief operations in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. The DOD deployed 18 Navy ships, 830 cargo flights, and nearly 21,000 military personnel. The requested FY2011 base budget would see a 3.4% increase compared to FY2010. The FY2011 base budget requested a 3.4% increase in discretionary spending for security agencies, including the Department of State, Departments of Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security, and the National Nuclear Security Administration. The total requested amount was $719.2 billion. The Administration requested $719.2 billion for discretionary programs of security agencies, a 5.2% increase from FY2010. For non-security agencies, the request was $386.4 billion, a 1.5% decrease from FY2010. The DOD base budget for FY2011 was $548.9 billion, $18.2 billion higher than FY2010. The Administration requested $386.4 billion for non-security agencies in FY2011, a 1.5% decrease from FY2010. The $548.9 billion requested for the FY2011 DOD base budget is $18.2 billion higher than the previous year. This increase would provide a 1.8% real purchasing power increase after adjusting for inflation, continuing the upward trend in DOD base budgets since FY1998. Adjusted for inflation, the FY2011 base budget would be DOD's third largest since the end of the Korean War. The DOD base budgets have shown a steady upward trend since FY1998, with the FY2011 budget being the third largest since the end of the Korean War. The Administration projects annual increases in the base budget for FY2012-FY2015, falling short of the 2% real growth rate recommended by Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The Administration projects annual increases in the DOD base budget for FY2012-FY2015, falling short of the 2% real growth rate recommended by Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to bridge the gap between sustaining the current force and future budgets. Defense Secretary Robert Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to sustain current forces and future budgets amidst economic challenges. He acknowledged the unlikelihood of achieving necessary real growth rates and suggested shifting funds within the budget to support combat forces. Defense Secretary Robert Gates proposed shifting funds within the budget to provide necessary real growth for combat forces by reducing spending on administrative and support activities. This strategy aims to cut overhead costs and maintain current force structure amidst economic challenges. Defense Secretary Robert Gates proposed increasing funding for combat forces by reducing spending on administrative and support functions, aiming to cut overhead costs and transfer savings to force structure and modernization within the budget. The goal is to convert \"tail\" to \"tooth\" for real growth, requiring sustained root-and-branch changes rather than one-time cuts. Defense Secretary Robert Gates proposed shifting about $10 billion from administrative and support functions to combat units to achieve a 3% real increase in the \"tooth\"-related part of the FY2012 DOD budget request. This move aims to reduce overhead costs and increase funding for force structure and modernization. Defense Secretary Robert Gates proposed reallocating $10 billion from administrative and support functions to combat units, aiming for a 3% increase in the \"tooth\"-related part of the FY2012 DOD budget request. Secretary Gates also announced cost-cutting initiatives, including reducing funding for service support contractors, decreasing the number of generals and admirals, and eliminating certain DOD entities. Defense Secretary Robert Gates proposed reallocating $10 billion from administrative and support functions to combat units, aiming for a 3% increase in the \"tooth\"-related part of the FY2012 DOD budget request. He also announced cost-cutting initiatives, including reducing the number of generals and admirals by 50, senior DOD civilians by 150, and eliminating certain DOD entities like the Joint Forces Command and the Business Transformation Agency. Secretary Gates further announced 23 contracting and acquisition initiatives to increase efficiency in DOD's spending on goods and services. Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced 23 contracting and acquisition initiatives to increase efficiency in DOD's spending on goods and services, accounting for about $400 billion of the department's annual budget. Initiatives include an \"affordability target\" for weapons program managers, contracting revisions to reward efficiency, and changes to reduce service contract costs. Members of Congress have raised concerns about the Administration's projected savings. Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced 23 contracting and acquisition initiatives to increase efficiency in DOD's spending on goods and services, accounting for about $400 billion of the department's annual budget. Initiatives include an \"affordability target\" for weapons program managers, contracting revisions to reward efficiency, and changes to reduce service contract costs. Some Members of Congress argue that the Administration's projected budget increases may not be sufficient, leading to potential scaling back of planned acquisition programs. Representative Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon expressed concerns about the impact of limited budget growth on defense programs. In a Heritage Foundation lecture, \"Buck\" McKeon expressed concerns about the impact of limited budget growth on defense programs, stating that a 1% real growth in the defense budget over the next five years would result in a net cut for investment and procurement accounts. Some Members of Congress, like Representative Barney Frank, called for reductions in the DOD budget by terminating unnecessary weapons programs and scaling back overseas military deployments. Representative Barney Frank has called for reductions in the DOD budget based on terminating unnecessary weapons programs and scaling back overseas military deployments, criticizing President Obama's exemption of the military budget from deficit reduction efforts. The FY2011 DOD base budget request amounts to 3.6% of discretionary spending. The FY2011 DOD base budget request is 3.6% of GDP, marking a leveling off in the DOD share of GDP since 9/11. The Administration did not propose significant changes to major weapons programs in its budget request. The FY2011 DOD budget request reflects the strategy and force planning assumptions from the Quadrennial Defense Review, sustaining initiatives from the previous budget. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) reflects a shift in DOD strategic thinking towards preparing U.S. forces for a diverse array of missions, moving away from Cold War-era conventional wars. Key assumptions in the 2010 QDR emphasize the need for readiness in various missions. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) emphasizes the need for U.S. forces to be prepared for a diverse array of missions, moving away from Cold War-era conventional wars. The top priority is fighting and winning ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, with a focus on support for forces engaged in current operations and capabilities for counterinsurgency, stability, and counter-terrorism operations. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) emphasizes the need for U.S. forces to prioritize support for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, focusing on counterinsurgency, stability, and counter-terrorism capabilities. Recommended initiatives include increased funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft. Longer-term initiatives include converting a heavy Army brigade combat team into a Stryker brigade. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) recommends acquiring helicopters, UAVs, improved intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft. It also suggests converting one heavy Army brigade combat team into a Stryker brigade, with the possibility of converting more in the future. The report assumes that no potential adversary in the next 10-20 years will directly challenge U.S. conventional military capabilities. The 2010 QDR assumes that no potential adversary will directly confront U.S. conventional military capabilities in the next 10-20 years. Instead, any foe will challenge U.S. forces asymmetrically using unconventional tactics and technologies. The 2010 QDR challenges the notion of a conflict spectrum and emphasizes the importance of the military's ability to operate effectively in cyberspace. Adversaries may use unconventional tactics and technologies, such as precision-guided missiles and cyber-war campaigns, to exploit U.S. limitations. The 2010 QDR highlights the need for the military to operate effectively in cyberspace, which is considered a critical domain of operations. It emphasizes the importance of defending cyber-networks and calls for steps such as developing a comprehensive approach to DOD operations in cyberspace, increasing cyber expertise within DOD, centralizing command of cyber operations, and fostering collaboration. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of defending cyber-networks and calls for steps such as developing a comprehensive approach to DOD operations in cyberspace, increasing cyber expertise within DOD, centralizing command of cyber operations, and fostering collaboration with other agencies and levels of government to enhance cyber security. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the need for U.S. forces to be able to handle multiple missions simultaneously, including stabilizing other countries, deterring aggressors, counter-insurgency operations, and supporting civil authorities in times of disaster or terrorist attacks. The 2010 QDR highlights the importance of preparing U.S. forces to address asymmetric threats like \"anti-access, area-denial\" capabilities developed by China and other potential adversaries. These capabilities could target U.S. forward bases and naval forces in nearby nations. China and other potential adversaries are developing \"anti-access, area-denial\" capabilities that could target U.S. forward bases and naval forces. These capabilities are crucial for U.S. power projection in regions far from home, supporting alliances in Europe and Asia, and stabilizing other important regions. However, the cost of maintaining these capabilities contributes to the high U.S. defense spending. The cost of power projection capabilities is a reason for high U.S. defense spending. U.S. capabilities are crucial for alliances in Europe and Asia, but they are vulnerable to attack, especially overseas ground bases and naval forces. The QDR recommends countering anti-access strategies by increasing reliance on long-range strike weapons and submarines to protect naval forces from various threats such as anti-ship cruise missiles, submarines, smart mines, and ballistic missiles with maneuverable warheads. The QDR recommends countering anti-access strategies by increasing reliance on long-range strike weapons and submarines. This includes developing offensive electronic attack capabilities and missile defense measures to protect forward deployed forces. The FY2011 base budget request reflects major initiatives in this area. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components, reflecting a 4.7% increase over FY2000. This budget also includes initiatives in offensive electronic attack capabilities and missile defense to protect forward deployed forces. The FY2011 budget request would fund 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components, a 4.7% increase over FY2000. Active-duty end-strength decreased after the collapse of the Soviet Union but rebounded during combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Army and Marine Corps end-strength reached 562,400 and 202,100, respectively. Since the early 1990s drawdown, end-strength across all services was reduced by about one-third. The Army and Marine Corps end-strength rebounded to 562,400 and 202,100 respectively during combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Congress authorized a temporary increase in the Army's active duty strength to 569,400 in 2010, with a $1 billion budget for a 1.4% raise in basic pay effective January 1, 2011. The FY2011 budget included a $1 billion increase for military personnel's basic pay by 1.4%, in line with private-sector pay raises. The Basic Allowance for Housing was also set to rise by 4.2% in FY2011. Congress has typically approved military pay raises 0.5% higher than the Employment Cost Index increase. The FY2011 budget included a $1 billion increase for military personnel's basic pay by 1.4%, in line with private-sector pay raises. Congress has typically approved military pay raises 0.5% higher than the Employment Cost Index increase. Service members currently are better paid than 70% of private sector workers with comparable experience and responsibility. The $340 million proposed for a 1.9% raise for military personnel could be better spent on reenlistment bonuses and special pays for critical specialties. Advocacy groups argue for the raise to close the pay gap with civilian peers. Legislative initiatives in FY2011 DOD funding bills addressed President Obama's decision to revise laws barring openly LGBTQ individuals from military service. The FY2011 DOD funding bills addressed President Obama's decision to revise laws barring openly LGBTQ individuals from military service, with some Members of Congress concerned about the impact on combat units' cohesion and effectiveness. Some Members of Congress are concerned that openly homosexual personnel in combat units could undermine cohesion and combat effectiveness. Critics oppose changing the policy due to stress from deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Legislation introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to repeal the 1993 law and replace it with a nondiscrimination policy based on sexual orientation. President Obama called for repealing the 1993 law on the basis of sexual orientation. The Department of Defense launched a study on implementing a policy of nondiscrimination. Secretary Gates opposed repeal pending completion of the study. The Department of Defense launched a study on implementing a policy of nondiscrimination regarding sexual orientation. Secretary Gates opposed repeal of the 1993 law pending completion of the study. Changes were announced in the department's procedures for enforcement of the current law. In a letter to President Obama, Senators proposed an amendment to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service after completion of the DOD review and certification by key officials. The DOD review has been completed, and key officials have certified to Congress that policies are in place for the repeal of the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military. The Administration acknowledges Congress's decision to move forward with the issue despite preferring to wait for the DOD study to be finished. The Administration supports congressional legislation to repeal 'don't ask, don't tell' despite preferring to wait for the completion of the DOD study. Secretary Gates accepts Congress's decision to move forward with the issue. Secretary Gates supports congressional legislation to repeal 'don't ask, don't tell' despite preferring completion of the DOD study. Federal Judge Virginia A. Phillips ruled the law unconstitutional on September 9, 2010, with a temporary stay issued by the Ninth Circuit on October 19, 2010. In 2010, Judge Phillips enjoined DOD from enforcing 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Act. The Ninth Circuit temporarily stayed the injunction while considering the appeals process. Under Secretary of Defense Clifford Stanley limited authority to discharge service members for homosexual behavior. The FY2011 budget requested $50.7 billion for DOD health care serving 9.5 million beneficiaries. The FY2011 budget request included $50.7 billion for the DOD health care system serving 9.5 million eligible beneficiaries through various medical facilities. The system's cost has more than doubled in the past 10 years and is projected to increase annually at a rate of 5-7% through FY2015. The cost of the DOD medical program is projected to increase annually at a rate of 5-7% through FY2015, accounting for 10% of the planned DOD budget. Factors contributing to the rise in military health care costs include an increase in retirees using TRICARE, higher frequency of eligible beneficiaries using DOD medical services, legislatively mandated benefit increases, and stagnant fees. The cost of the DOD medical program is projected to increase annually due to factors such as more retirees using TRICARE, increased usage of DOD medical services by eligible beneficiaries, legislated benefit expansions, and unchanged fees. The Bush Administration proposed fee increases for non-Medicare eligible TRICARE beneficiaries in FY2007, FY2008, and FY2009, but Congress blocked them each year. The Obama Administration's 2011 budget did not include any fee increase proposals. The Obama Administration did not propose fee increases for TRICARE beneficiaries in their 2011 budget. However, Secretary Gates expressed a desire to work with Congress to control program costs while ensuring care for military personnel and retirees. The FY2011 budget request aimed to increase funding for weapons and equipment procurement, with a slight shift in the allocation of the DOD budget. Secretary Gates emphasized the need for a reasonable tradeoff between cost increases and program sustainability. In FY2011, the DOD budget allocated $189.0 billion for weapons and equipment procurement, with a slight increase from the previous year. The proportion of the budget for procurement increased to 60%, while R&D funding decreased to 40%. This shift was influenced by the transition of major programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter into production, with $11.2 billion allocated in FY2010 and a similar amount in FY2011, with a higher focus on procurement. The FY2011 budget allocated $11.2 billion for the F-35 program, with $2.3 billion for R&D and $9.0 billion for procurement. The Administration proposed cuts in major weapons programs, including no funds for additional C-17 cargo jets or an alternate F-35 jet engine. The FY2011 budget included no funds for additional C-17 cargo jets or an alternate F-35 jet engine, which Congress added funding for in 2009. Some Members of Congress have questioned the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, which aims to develop new ground combat equipment. The Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, with a budget request of $3.2 billion in FY2011, has faced scrutiny for its proposed new Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV). This program replaced the Future Combat System (FCS) and aimed to develop new combat equipment to replace current systems like the M-1 Abrams tank and M-2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle. The Future Combat System (FCS) aimed to develop new combat equipment to replace current systems like the M-1 Abrams tank and the M-2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle. By 2009, efforts involved developing 14 manned and unmanned systems tied together by a communications network. However, Secretary of Defense Gates recommended cancelling the manned ground vehicle (MGV) component of FCS due to unanswered questions in vehicle design strategy and lack of reflection of counterinsurgency lessons. The Army canceled the MGV component of the Future Combat System due to unanswered questions in vehicle design strategy and lack of reflection of counterinsurgency lessons. Instead, they launched the GCV program to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017 based on mature technologies. Congress may question if the Army is rushing the development of the GCV, risking another unsuccessful acquisition. The Army canceled the MGV component of the Future Combat System and launched the GCV program to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017. Congress may question if the Army is rushing the development of the GCV, risking another unsuccessful acquisition. The Army canceled the existing competition for the GCV development contract and revised the performance specifications. The GCV competition was restarted on November 30, 2010. Other elements of the FCS program, such as sensors and unmanned vehicles, were incorporated into the Army's Modernization program. The Army plans to deploy these components to all 73 Army BCTs by 2025. According to the Government Accountability Office, the FCS components have not demonstrated success. The Army's Modernization program aims to deploy components to all 73 Army BCTs by 2025. The FCS components planned for deployment have not proven effective in field exercises. The Navy's FY2011 budget includes funding for nine new battle force ships, including submarines, destroyers, LCSs, and amphibious assault ships. The Navy's FY2011 budget includes funding for nine new battle force ships, including submarines, destroyers, LCSs, and amphibious assault ships. The Navy's shipbuilding plan includes a total of 50 new battle force ships over five years, with half being relatively inexpensive LCSs or JHSVs. The 30-year shipbuilding plan includes 276 ships but does not fully support the 313-ship goal in the long run. The Navy's FY2011 shipbuilding plan includes 276 ships, with projections showing fleet growth to 315 ships by FY2020, peaking at 320 ships in FY2024. However, the plan falls short of fully supporting the 313-ship goal in the long run, with estimates showing a decline in attack submarine and cruiser-destroyer forces in later years. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan includes a fleet growth to 301 ships in FY2039-FY2040. The plan projects a drop in attack submarine and cruiser-destroyer forces in later years. The Navy estimates an average of $15.9 billion per year, while the Congressional Budget Office estimates $19.0 billion per year. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan requires an average of $19.0 billion per year in constant FY2010 dollars, which is 18% more than the Navy estimates. The plan includes developing 12 next-generation ballistic missile submarines to replace the current force. The Navy's plan includes developing 12 next-generation ballistic missile submarines, known as SSBN(X)s, to replace the current force of Ohio-class submarines. The program received funding in the Navy's FY2010 budget and requested additional funding in the FY2011 budget for research and development. The Navy plans to procure the first SSBN(X) in FY2019, with advance procurement funding starting in FY2015. The Navy's FY2010 budget included funding for the development of 12 next-generation ballistic missile submarines, called SSBN(X)s. An additional $672.3 million was requested in the FY2011 budget for research and development. The Navy plans to procure the first SSBN(X) in FY2019, with procurement costs estimated at $6 billion to $7 billion each. Concerns have been raised about the affordability of the SSBN(X) program and its impact on the Navy's long-term shipbuilding program. The Navy's budget includes funding for 12 next-generation ballistic missile submarines, SSBN(X)s, with concerns about affordability and impact on long-term shipbuilding program. Procuring 12 SSBN(X)s during FY2019-FY2033 could lead to reductions in procurement rates for other Navy ships. Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan states limitations in procuring other ship classes while SSBN(X) is being procured. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan states limitations in procuring other ship classes while SSBN(X) is being procured. Options for reducing the cost of the SSBN(X) program include procuring fewer than 12 SSBN(X)s, reducing the number of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), designing the SSBN(X) to carry a smaller SLBM, stretching out the schedule for procuring SSBN(X)s, and making greater use of split funding. Options for reducing the cost of the SSBN(X) program include procuring fewer than 12 SSBN(X)s, reducing the number of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) carried by each SSBN(X), designing the SSBN(X) to carry a smaller SLBM, stretching out the procurement schedule, and utilizing split funding. The FY2010 budget proposed ending procurement of Zumwalt (DDG-1000) class destroyers at three ships and resuming procurement of Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) class Aegis destroyers. The Navy's FY2010 budget proposed ending procurement of Zumwalt (DDG-1000) class destroyers at three ships and resuming procurement of Arleigh Burke (DDG-51) class Aegis destroyers. Congress supported this proposal in the FY2010 defense budget. The Navy's FY2011 budget called for procuring two DDG-51s in FY2011 and six more in FY2012-FY2015, while also terminating the planned CG(X) cruiser program as unaffordable. Instead of procuring CG(X)s around FY2017, the Navy is proposing to build an improved version of the DDG-51. The Navy's FY2011 budget proposed terminating the planned CG(X) cruiser program due to affordability issues. Instead, they plan to build an improved version of the DDG-51, called the Flight III version, starting in FY2016. This new version will carry a smaller version of the new Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) originally intended for the CG(X). The budget requested $228.4 million for research and development. The Navy's FY2011 budget proposed terminating the CG(X) cruiser program due to affordability issues, with plans to build the Flight III DDG-51 starting in FY2016. The new version will carry a smaller AMDR, with a budget request of $228.4 million for research and development. The Aegis BMD program aims to increase the number of BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships from 20 to 38 by the end of FY2015. Some observers are concerned that demands for BMD-capable Aegis ships are growing faster than the number of available ships, potentially straining the Navy's ability to meet regional military commanders' needs for conducting BMD operations. Concerns are rising as demands for BMD-capable Aegis ships are outpacing the availability of ships, potentially straining the Navy's ability to meet regional military commanders' needs for BMD operations. The Aegis BMD program is mainly funded through MDA's budget, with additional funding from the Navy for BMD-related efforts. The proposed FY2011 budgets include $2,161.6 million for the Aegis BMD program from MDA and $457.0 million for BMD-related efforts from the Navy. Congress faces decisions on approving, rejecting, or modifying these budgets. The FY2011 budget requested $2,161.6 million for the Aegis BMD program from MDA and $457.0 million for BMD-related efforts from the Navy. Congress must decide on funding for the Flight III DDG-51 design, Aegis BMD program, and Littoral Combat Ships. The FY2011 budget requested $1.59 billion for the Navy's Aegis BMD program to fund two of 55 planned Littoral Combat Ships (LCS). These small vessels are designed for shallow water operations with interchangeable weapons modules for various missions. The Navy planned to purchase different versions of LCS from Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics before selecting one. The Navy planned to purchase different versions of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) from Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics before selecting one design to build the majority of the LCS fleet. The Navy accelerated its timetable for choosing between the two designs, aiming to select a single design for all LCSs procured in FY2010 and subsequent years. The winning contractor would build 10 LCSs over a five-year period at a rate of two ships per year, followed by a second competition open to all. The Navy planned to purchase different versions of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) from Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics before selecting one design to build the majority of the LCS fleet. The winning contractor would build 10 LCSs over a five-year period at a rate of two ships per year, followed by a second competition open to all bidders for additional LCSs. On November 3, 2010, Navy officials announced a new acquisition strategy seeking approval from Congress. The Navy initially planned to purchase Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) from Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, with each building 10 ships over five years. However, a new acquisition strategy was proposed in 2010 to buy 10 ships from each team. This change was driven by concerns over the aging fighter aircraft inventory across the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. The Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps face a fighter aircraft shortage due to budget constraints on procurement. Air Force projects a shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024, while Navy expects a shortfall of over 100 aircraft by 2018. This poses a key issue for Congress regarding tactical aircraft. The Air Force and Navy are facing fighter aircraft shortages due to budget constraints, with projections of up to 800 aircraft shortfall by 2024 for the Air Force and over 100 aircraft shortfall by 2018 for the Navy. Congress is concerned about the affordability of modernizing the tactical aircraft force, with potential budget challenges ahead. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is a key component of the procurement plans. Observers are concerned about a budget \"train wreck\" in tactical aircraft modernization as acquisition plans clash with limited funding. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is crucial to DOD's plans, aiming to acquire 2,443 JSFs at a cost of over $300 billion. The F-35 program involves acquiring 2,443 JSFs at a cost of over $300 billion. The Administration's FY2011 budget requested $11.3 billion for the program, including research and development funding. The FY2011 budget requested $11.3 billion for the F-35 program, including $2.5 billion for research and development and $8.8 billion for procurement. Concerns exist about the affordability of the F-35 in the face of constrained DOD resources, especially as production rates increase. The F-35 program will require over $10 billion annually in acquisition funding as production rates increase, potentially impacting other DOD programs. Supporters argue that the F-35 is a cost-effective option for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. The British government plans to reduce the number of F-35s purchased as part of defense spending cuts. The British government announced a plan to reduce its defense spending by cutting the number of F-35 planes purchased from 138 to as few as 40. They also decided not to buy the vertical-takeoff version of the plane. Congress has rejected proposals to develop an alternative engine for the F-35 program. The Navy was set to make the second-largest purchase for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Congress has consistently rejected proposals to develop an alternative engine, with approximately $2.5 billion already allocated for the program. The Administration's FY2011 budget aimed to terminate the program, which would require an additional $2.9 billion to complete the development of the F136 engine. In FY2009, Congress allocated $2.5 billion for the Joint Strike Fighter alternate engine program. The DOD estimated an additional $2.9 billion would be needed by 2017 to finish the F136 engine development. Critics argue that terminating the F136 program was driven by immediate budget pressures rather than long-term considerations. Critics argue that the proposal to terminate the F136 alternate engine was influenced by short-term budget constraints rather than considering the long-term benefits of the program. They believe that engine competition on other programs has saved money and improved reliability. Supporters of the termination claim that single-source engine contracts are more common and that long-term affordability is best achieved through multiyear contracts from a single source. Cancelling the F136 engine raises concerns about operational risks for the fleet. Engine production contracts have been the norm, with long-term affordability achieved through multiyear contracts from a single source. Cancelling the F136 engine raises concerns about operational risks, impacts on the defense industrial base, and U.S. relations with allied countries. Eliminating competition may affect efficiency in DOD's acquisition system and pose cost challenges. Continuing F136 development raises concerns about its impact on the F-35 acquisition program, including potential reduction in the number of F-35s acquired and the challenges of supporting two different engines in the field. The Administration's proposed FY2011 defense budget may face challenges in cost control and efficiency in a single-supplier environment. The Administration's proposed FY2011 defense budget requested $863.9 million in Air Force research and development funding for the KC-X tanker program, aiming to replace the aging fleet of KC-135 tankers. This raises concerns about the impact of continuing F136 engine development on the F-35 acquisition program, including potential reduction in the number of F-35s acquired and challenges of supporting two different engines in the field. The Department of Defense released a Request for Proposals for a program to build 179 new KC-X aerial refueling tankers for the Air Force, valued at $35 billion. Bidding closed on July 9, 2010, with three offerors submitting bids, including the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS). The DOD released a Request for Proposals for 179 new KC-X aerial refueling tankers valued at $35 billion. Bidding closed on July 9, 2010, with three offerors submitting bids: EADS, Boeing, and a team of Antonov and U.S. Aerospace. The bids included designs based on Airbus A330, Boeing 767, and An-124 freighter, respectively. The DOD awarded the new tanker contract to Boeing after excluding a bid from Antonov and U.S. Aerospace. EADS decided not to challenge the decision, ending the intense interest in the KC-X acquisition program. The KC-X acquisition program has been of intense interest due to the contract value, job creation, and tanker aircraft's importance to U.S. military operations. DOD's previous attempts to acquire a new tanker have been contentious, shaping the context for the proposed new KC-X competition. The George W. Bush Administration had plans to deploy a modified BMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic. The Obama Administration dropped the Bush Administration's plan to deploy a modified BMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic in favor of the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) to defend Europe and the United States against potential ballistic missile attacks from Iran. The Obama Administration implemented the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) to deploy ships and a land-based Aegis system with Standard missiles to defend Europe and the United States against potential ballistic missile attacks from Iran. They requested $2.27 billion in FY2011 for PAA programs, including $712 million for unique development efforts and $1.56 billion for the Aegis ship-borne BMD system. The FY2011 budget includes $712 million for unique development efforts for the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) and $1.56 billion for the Aegis ship-borne BMD system. The military construction budget for FY2011 is reduced by nearly 20% compared to FY2010, mainly due to decreased spending on facilities for units relocating due to the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. The military construction budget for FY2011 decreased significantly, with a decline from $7.9 billion to $2.7 billion for new facilities for units relocating due to the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. Additionally, funding for military family housing dropped from $2.3 billion to $1.8 billion in the FY2011 request, attributed to the privatization of military family housing. The FY2011 DOD budget saw a decrease in military construction and funding for military family housing, partly due to the privatization of military family housing. The Basic Allowance for Housing has increased over the past decade to cover a larger proportion of service members' housing costs. Members of Congress used the FY2011 DOD bills to oppose the Navy's plan to move to Mayport, FL. The FY2011 DOD budget saw a decrease in military construction and funding for military family housing. The Basic Allowance for Housing has increased to cover a larger proportion of service members' housing costs. Members of Congress opposed the Navy's plan to move to Mayport, FL, one of the five nuclear powered aircraft carriers currently homeported in Norfolk, VA. The Department of Defense's final report on the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review endorses the Navy's desire to establish Mayport as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port for security reasons. The Navy's desire to establish Mayport as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port is endorsed for security reasons. This move would require the construction of new nuclear support facilities in Mayport, Florida, and shift economic activity from Norfolk to Mayport. Members of Congress from Florida have expressed support for this plan. The Navy's proposal to homeport an aircraft carrier at Mayport, Florida, would shift economic activity from Norfolk and is supported by Members of Congress from Florida. The estimated cost of moving a carrier to Mayport is $589.7 million, including $46.3 million for dredging approved by Congress in the FY2010 DOD budget. The Navy's proposal to homeport a carrier at Mayport, Florida, faces opposition from some Members of Congress from Virginia who question the benefits and funding allocation. The estimated cost of the move is $589.7 million, including $46.3 million for dredging approved in the FY2010 DOD budget. The Navy's proposal to homeport a carrier at Mayport, Florida is facing opposition from some Members of Congress who argue that the benefits are uncertain. The Administration's budget includes $139 million for facilities on Guam for Marines moving from Okinawa, with plans to move additional military personnel to Guam from the United States. The Government of Japan and the US Department of Defense have negotiated to move military personnel from Okinawa to Guam by 2014-2016. Guam, a mountainous island with a population of 178,000, is expected to see a permanent increase of up to 56,000 due to the influx of military personnel, their families, DOD personnel, and supporting contractors. The planned influx of military personnel, families, DOD personnel, and contractors to Guam could increase the population by up to 56,000. Analysts also estimate that 25,000 temporary workers may be needed for construction, raising concerns about the island's infrastructure capacity. The U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) is being created to centralize command of DOD networks. The Administration's budget supported the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) to centralize command of DOD networks and coordinate their protection. Reorganization of cyber forces began in October 2008 under Secretary Gates' direction. The Force for Global Network Operations (JTF GNO) was placed under the operational control of the Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare (JFCC NW), responsible for offensive information operations. This integration marked a departure from the historical segregation of offensive and defensive cyber operations. In June 2009, Secretary Gates directed the establishment of U.S. Cyber Command under U.S. Strategic Command for cyber operations. In June 2009, Secretary Gates directed the establishment of U.S. Cyber Command under U.S. Strategic Command for both offensive and defensive cyber operations. The NSA director was nominated to lead the new command while retaining the NSA directorship. Some believe that co-locating offensive and defensive cyber capabilities is the militarization of cyberspace and may impact civilian privacy. The establishment of U.S. Cyber Command under U.S. Strategic Command for offensive and defensive cyber operations has raised concerns about the militarization of cyberspace and potential privacy implications. The Administration's FY2011 budget request included $139 million for U.S. Cyber Command, an increase of $105 million from the previous year. The FY2011 budget request for Air Force Operations and Maintenance included $139 million for U.S. Cyber Command, an increase of $105 million from the previous year. This funding would support the establishment of Cyber Command at Ft. Meade, MD. The FY2011 DOD budget request aimed to rebalance the roles of DOD and the State Department in providing foreign assistance. The FY2011 NDAA legislation did not include two programs previously funded by DOD. The Obama Administration aims to rebalance the roles of DOD and the State Department in providing foreign assistance. The FY2011 NDAA legislation excludes two programs previously funded by DOD, now requested to be funded through the State Department budget. This includes the \"Section 1207\" program and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. In FY2012, the State Department will take responsibility for Iraq police training, funded through the Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISSF). The DOD budget request for FY2011 includes funding for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) for training the Afghan National Police. The Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF) is also up for funding in the State Department budget. The State Department will take over Iraq police training in FY2012 through the Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISSF), while the Department of Defense (DOD) budget includes funding for training the Afghan National Police through the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF). The Pentagon officials are considering maintaining or expanding DOD's role in security assistance despite the State Department's plans to rebalance responsibilities. The Administration is reviewing the division of security assistance authorities between DOD and State. Some Pentagon officials suggest expanding DOD's role despite State Department's plans. Senate Armed Services Committee welcomes the review for enhancing U.S. security assistance. The Senate Armed Services Committee welcomes the review for enhancing U.S. security assistance, as Secretary of Defense Gates emphasizes the importance of advising and mentoring foreign security forces. This aligns with recommendations in the Quadrennial Defense Review Report to strengthen the armed services' capability to train partner nations. Secretary Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mullen emphasize the importance of advising and training partner nations' security forces, aligning with recommendations in the Quadrennial Defense Review Report. Admiral Mike Mullen and Secretary Gates advocate for military power to be considered as a first option, along with diplomacy and other national instruments. They emphasize the need to enhance civilian capabilities to assist foreign governments in conflict prevention and recovery. This new approach integrates defense and diplomacy to complement each other in international relations. The Administration's FY2011 DOD budget request includes funding for various security assistance programs, such as the \"Section 1206\" program and the Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program. This reflects a new approach that integrates defense and diplomacy to complement each other in international relations. The FY2011 DOD budget includes funding for security assistance programs for other countries threatened by terrorists, totaling $489.5 million. It also includes funding for the Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program ($33.3 million) and two new security assistance programs. The FY2011 DOD budget includes funding for security assistance programs for foreign military members and civilian government officials ($1.6 million) and a new Stability Operations Fellowship Program ($5.0 million). Secretary Gates emphasized the need for a modernized national security system, with defense and diplomacy roles adapted to current threats. Some Members are considering legislation for a pooled fund for security assistance involving DOD, State, and USAID. The FY2011 DOD budget includes funding for security assistance programs and a new Stability Operations Fellowship Program. Secretary Gates emphasized the need for modernizing national security roles. Some Members are considering legislation for a pooled fund for security assistance involving DOD, State, and USAID. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act authorizes $725.9 billion for defense-related activities, slightly less than the Administration's request. The House and Senate versions of the FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act authorized $725.9 billion and $725.7 billion respectively for defense-related activities, with the Senate bill facing opposition due to a provision related to the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The Senate rejected a motion to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy in the FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act. The Senate rejected a motion to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy in the FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act, which was later negotiated and signed into law without the provision. The defense authorization bill, H.R. 6523, as enacted, authorizes a total end-strength of 1.43 million members for the active-duty components of the armed services, an increase of 7,400 over FY2010. Funding tables allocating totals among specific programs were not included in the bill. The defense authorization bill, H.R. 6523, authorizes a total end-strength of 1.43 million members for the active-duty components of the armed services, an increase of 7,400 over FY2010. The bill also includes a 1.4% increase in military basic pay, as requested by the Administration. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the Government Accountability Office to assess DOD's use of cash incentives for recruiting and retaining highly qualified individuals into hard-to-fill positions. The final bill did not include provisions for increased monthly allowances for separated married personnel or personnel at risk of hostile fire. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the Government Accountability Office to assess DOD's use of cash incentives for recruiting and retaining highly qualified individuals into hard-to-fill positions, including reviewing the process for identifying specialties for incentives and determining housing allowance sizes for service members. The Senate committee directed GAO to assess the efficiency of DOD's process for determining housing allowance sizes for service members. The final version of the FY2011 defense authorization act did not include a provision to repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service. On May 27, 2011, the House adopted an amendment to H.R. 5136 by Representative Patrick Murphy that would repeal the 1993 legislation barring openly homosexual persons from military service. The repeal would be implemented after the current DOD review is completed and certified by the President, Secretary of Defense, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The House adopted an amendment to repeal the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military after certification by the President, Secretary of Defense, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This provision was agreed upon in negotiations and included in the House bill as Section 536. The House bill, Section 536, included language agreed upon in negotiations for repealing the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military. The Senate Armed Services Committee also voted to include a similar provision in S. 3454. Senator John McCain argued that Senate action on the bill was premature due to the ongoing DOD review of the policy's effects. Senator John McCain opposed Senate action on the bill to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, citing the ongoing DOD review. The cloture motion failed, and the final bill did not include a provision to allow military facilities to provide abortions using private funds. The Senate committee provision to repeal the law prohibiting military facilities from performing abortions was not included in the enacted version of the authorization bill. This would have allowed DOD facilities to provide abortions using private funds, but the provision would have applied to all DOD facilities, foreign and domestic. The enacted version of the authorization bill did not include a House-passed provision for a pilot program allowing officers to pursue varied mid-career educational programs and assignments outside their service to broaden experience and judgment. Participants could skip promotion requirements and commit to longer service. The final version of the bill included provisions from a House-passed bill regarding sexual assault in the military, establishing the position of director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office. The final version of the bill establishes the position of director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office, requires improved protocols for medical care of sexual assault victims in the military, and guarantees access to victim advocates. H.R. 6523 establishes the director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office, improves medical care protocols for military sexual assault victims, and ensures access to victim advocates. It does not include provisions for confidentiality of victim communications, legal assistance, or a hotline for reporting assaults. The bill does require the Secretary of Defense to assess the feasibility of allowing victims to receive help from military legal counsel. H.R. 6523 establishes the director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office, improves medical care protocols for military sexual assault victims, and ensures access to victim advocates. The bill requires the Secretary of Defense to evaluate authorizing sexual assault victims to receive assistance from military legal counsel. It authorizes the Administration's $50.7 billion budget request for DOD's health care program, without including TRICARE fee and pharmacy copayment increases. The House-passed H.R. 5136, the Senate Armed Services Committee's S. 3454, and the final enacted version of the authorization bill (H.R. 6523) all include provisions prohibiting increases in TRICARE fees and pharmacy copayments. TRICARE beneficiaries can now extend coverage to dependent children up to age 26. The final enacted version of the bill, H.R. 6523, includes provisions prohibiting TRICARE fee and pharmacy copayment increases. Beneficiaries can extend coverage to dependent children up to age 26. The final enacted version of H.R. 6523 includes provisions related to TRICARE program administration and training programs for officers in the services' medical corps. This was in response to an incident at Fort Hood in November 2009. The final version of the authorization bill includes provisions related to TRICARE program administration and training programs for officers in the services' medical corps. This was in response to incidents at Fort Hood and a recruiting station in Little Rock in 2009. The final bill included provisions related to TRICARE program administration and training programs for officers in the services' medical corps, in response to incidents at Fort Hood and a recruiting station in Little Rock in 2009. The House provision not included in the final bill would have provided special compensation to persons killed or wounded in those incidents or any subsequent incident targeting service members or DOD civilians affiliated with the U.S. military. The final bill included provisions related to TRICARE program administration and training programs for officers in the services' medical corps. It required the Secretary of Defense to earmark up to $100 million in a fund to implement recommendations of a panel set up by DOD to analyze the Fort Hood incident. Both the House and Senate committee supported the Administration's ballistic missile defense activities, including defending U.S. troops and allies in Europe against ballistic missile attacks from Iran. The House and Senate committee bills supported the Administration's ballistic missile defense activities, including defending U.S. troops and allies in Europe against ballistic missile attacks from Iran. Both bills authorized slightly more than the $10.3 billion requested for missile defense, with additional funding for Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system. The House and Senate committee bills authorized funding for missile defense activities, including support for Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system. The bills allocated $205 million for the development of the system, which intercepts short-range rockets and artillery shells. The total funding for missile defense programs was not specified in the enacted bill. The bill does not specify total funding for missile defense programs, but includes provisions affirming that the New START treaty with Russia will not restrict U.S. missile defense programs. Funding levels for specific programs are detailed in Table A-2. H.R. 6523 affirms that the New START treaty with Russia will not limit U.S. missile defense programs. The Administration requested $2.27 billion in FY2011 for the \"Phased Adaptive Approach\" to defend Europe against ballistic missiles. The FY2011 budget requested $712 million for development unique to the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for European missile defense and an additional $1.56 billion for the Aegis ship-borne BMD system. The final authorization bill requires a DOD report on PAA and imposes restrictions on deployment until certification by the Secretary of Defense. The final authorization bill requires a DOD report on the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) for European missile defense and imposes restrictions on deployment until certification by the Secretary of Defense, similar to those applied to the Bush plan. This includes limits on deploying defenses in Europe until technology is proven effective and on the use of funds for BMD deployments in any country until necessary agreements are ratified. The final version of the bill allows the Secretary of Defense to waive restrictions on deploying ballistic missile defense systems in Europe in the interest of national security. It also authorizes the establishment of a shared early warning system with the Czech Republic. The final version of the bill authorizes the establishment of a shared ballistic missile early warning system with the Czech Republic and includes provisions for future missile intercept capabilities against Iranian ICBMs. The final version of the authorization bill includes statements regarding the development of missile intercept capabilities against Iranian ICBMs and emphasizes that the PAA is not meant to disrupt strategic stability with Russia. It does not include provisions from the House bill that would have restricted the reduction of U.S. nuclear weapons below New START Treaty limits. The final version of the authorization bill includes provisions barring the reduction of U.S. nuclear weapons below New START Treaty limits and expresses concerns about the weakening of U.S. security in the Nuclear Posture Review. The Nuclear Posture Review, published in 2010, weakens U.S. security by ruling out the use of nuclear weapons in response to a non-nuclear attack with chemical or biological weapons. The final version of the authorization bill approved $15.7 billion for Navy shipbuilding, including funding for specific programs such as two DDG-51 Aegis destroyers, two Virginia-class attack submarines, two Littoral Combat Ships, and a high-speed troop and cargo carrier. The budget request included funding for two DDG-51 Aegis destroyers, two Virginia-class attack submarines, two Littoral Combat Ships, an \"intratheater connector\" troop and cargo carrier, an oceanographic research ship, the U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, an LHA-class helicopter carrier, and refueling for the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt. The U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, an LHA-class helicopter carrier, and refueling for the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt received incremental funding in the congressional appropriations process. Incremental funding is common for expensive ships like aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships, allowing costs to be spread out over multiple years. The congressional appropriations process allows for incremental funding of expensive ships like aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships. H.R. 6523 includes provisions for funding a helicopter carrier over two years and a report on the Navy's shipbuilding requirements in relation to the Aegis anti-missile system. H.R. 6523 included a provision for a report on the Navy's shipbuilding requirements related to using cruisers and destroyers with the Aegis anti-missile system for regional BMD deployments. The final authorization bill did not include provisions to prevent a fleet size decline. The final version of the authorization bill did not include provisions to prevent a decline in the size of the fleet. One provision would have blocked the retirement of two large helicopter carriers until replacements are in service, while another would have limited the Navy from retiring more than two ships for every three new vessels commissioned until reaching the goal of 313 ships. The Senate committee noted that the Navy's shipbuilding schedule was overly optimistic. The Senate committee directed assessments on the Navy's shipbuilding plans and their impact on the Marine Corps' amphibious operations. The Navy's shipbuilding schedule was deemed overly optimistic, with concerns about sustaining commercial shipyards. The Senate committee directed assessments on the Navy's shipbuilding plans and their impact on the Marine Corps' amphibious operations. The Navy's plan for 33 amphibious ships may face challenges due to cost increases and construction delays. The Senate committee expressed concerns about cost increases and construction delays potentially hindering the Navy's goal of 33 amphibious ships. The FY2011 defense authorization bill did not address the Navy's plan to replace Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines with the expensive SSBN(X) submarines, which could impact future shipbuilding budgets. The FY2011 defense authorization bill did not address the Navy's plan to replace Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines with the expensive SSBN(X) submarines, which could impact future shipbuilding budgets. The final version of the bill approved a lump-sum authorization for Navy R&D without allocating the total among specific programs. The FY2011 defense authorization bill approved a lump-sum authorization for Navy R&D without specifying program allocations. It did not include a provision limiting Navy spending until a report is submitted. Congress added funds for C-17 production despite objections from past administrations. The FY2011 defense authorization bill included funds for C-17 production despite objections from past administrations. Congress added funds to continue C-17 production, which the Administration warned would be vetoed. The bill also addressed cost overruns in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The FY2011 defense authorization bill included provisions for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, with a Senate committee requirement for a progress assessment plan. The final bill did not limit F-35 procurement until cost and performance milestones were met, authorizing $11 billion for development and 42 planes. The House-passed and Senate committee-approved versions of the FY2011 defense authorization bill authorized $11 billion for the F-35 aircraft development and procurement of 42 planes. The bills rejected a request for an additional F-35 costing $205 million, citing the option to replace the lost aircraft with another fighter slated for retirement. The House-passed bill and Senate committee's bill for the FY2011 defense authorization authorized $11 billion for F-35 aircraft development and procurement. The House bill included $485 million for an alternate jet engine for the F-35, while the Senate bill did not provide additional funds for the second engine. The final bill did not take a specific position on the additional funding for the alternate engine. The final bill for the FY2011 defense authorization did not include a provision from the Senate committee that would have restricted additional funding for the alternate F-35 engine. Secretary Gates stated his intention to recommend a veto if the bill funded the alternate engine. In a May 20, 2010, Pentagon press conference, Secretary Gates reaffirmed his intention to recommend that President Obama veto any defense bill that funded the alternate F-35 engine, citing concerns about the program's feasibility and impact on aircraft procurement budgets. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees are at odds over the potential drop in carrier-borne fighters due to delays in the F-35 program. The Navy's planned aircraft procurement budgets may lead to a decrease in carrier-borne fighters due to F-35 program delays. To address this \"strike fighter gap,\" additional funding for F/A-18E/F model fighters was proposed in both the House-passed and Senate committee-reported bills. The enacted bill does not specify the number of planes authorized. It also includes a provision for the Navy to report to Congress on costs. The enacted bill does not specify the number of F/A-18E/F model fighters authorized. It includes a provision for the Navy to report to Congress on costs and risks related to addressing the projected strike fighter gap. Additionally, $863.9 million is authorized for the development of the KC-X mid-air refueling tanker, with EADS proposing a tanker based on the Airbus A-330 to compete with Boeing. The House-passed and Senate committee-reported bills authorize $863.9 million for the development of the KC-X mid-air refueling tanker. EADS proposed an Airbus A-330 tanker to compete with Boeing. The House adopted an amendment requiring DOD to consider unfair competitive advantages in tanker bids. The House adopted an amendment to consider unfair competitive advantages in bids for the KC-X tanker, specifically focusing on situations where development costs are not fully borne by the offeror. This amendment was prompted by concerns over government subsidies received by EADS for its commercial airliners, potentially giving them an unfair advantage in the bidding process. The House adopted an amendment to address unfair competitive advantages in bids for the KC-X tanker, particularly focusing on concerns about government subsidies received by EADS for its commercial airliners. DOD selected Boeing's tanker design, the KC-46A, and EADS decided not to challenge the decision. Both H.R. 5136 and S. 3454 would deny authorization for part of the Army's requested funding for its Brigade Combat Team Modernization program. The House and Senate Armed Services Committee would deny authorization Fame authorization the part the part the part the $s $s part the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the Gates terminated the Non-Line of Sight missile program in 2009 due to complexity and cost. The House and Senate committees cut funding for the Army's BCT Modernization request, with the House bill making a larger cut. The enacted authorization bill did not specify funding for the BCT program. The House and Senate committees reduced funding for the Army's BCT Modernization request, with the House bill making a larger cut. The enacted authorization bill did not allocate a specific funding level to the BCT program, which includes developing a new family of Ground Combat Vehicles. The House Armed Services Committee recommended a less technologically ambitious approach for the new combat vehicle program. The House Armed Services Committee recommended a less technologically ambitious approach for the new combat vehicle program, urging the Army to focus on developing vehicles meeting basic requirements and allowing for upgrades later. They also included a provision in the bill to limit spending until a detailed analysis of the Army's plans for the new fleet of vehicles is provided. The enacted version of the authorization bill includes a provision for the Army to spend only half of the FY2011 GCV appropriation until a detailed analysis of its plans for the new fleet of vehicles is provided. DOD reduced its funding request to $461 million, which was fully funded in the bill. The House provision to bar funds for planning and design was not included in the enacted bill. The enacted bill fully funds the Administration's request of $461 million. It does not include a provision to bar funds for planning and designing structures at the Naval Station in Mayport, FL, for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The House Armed Services Committee directed the GAO to assess the costs of homeporting a carrier in Mayport and the Navy to report on other options for using the Mayport naval facilities. The House Armed Services Committee directed the GAO to assess the costs of homeporting a carrier in Mayport and the Navy to report on other options for using the Mayport naval facilities. H.R. 6523 authorized $176.0 billion for military construction on Guam, with most of the reduction coming from the planned redeployment of Marine Corps units from Okinawa. The final bill approved funds for improving access roads and wharves in Guam, but denied funding for a Marine base and facilities for Marine aviation squadrons.
