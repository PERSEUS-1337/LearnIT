Congress finds that the right to vote is guaranteed in the US Constitution for all citizens, with Congress having supervisory power over Federal elections. There is no uniform eligibility standard for participating in Federal elections, with different States having varying rules on ex-felon voting eligibility. Different States have different rules regarding the voting eligibility of ex-felons, with 48 States and the District of Columbia prohibiting inmates from voting while serving their sentences. 13 States disenfranchise some or all ex-offenders who have completed their sentences, and even in States that allow ex-offenders to vote, the process to regain that right can be difficult, requiring a pardon or order from the Governor in some cases. In some States, ex-offenders face challenges in regaining their right to vote, with requirements such as a pardon from the Governor or parole board action.

Racially disparate sentencing laws for crack and powder cocaine have disproportionately affected African-Americans. One-third of women in prison are incarcerated for nonviolent drug offenses, with racially disparate sentencing laws disproportionately affecting African-Americans. African-American men are disproportionately impacted by laws that strip felons of their voting rights, with 1,400,000 barred from participating in Federal elections. Minorities, particularly African-American men, are disproportionately affected by laws that revoke felons' voting rights. 1,400,000 African-American men are currently unable to participate in Federal elections due to felony convictions.
