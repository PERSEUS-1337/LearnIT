Jordan, despite performing well on some indicators, was criticized for already receiving significant U.S. aid and having access to private sector capital. Several development analysts argued that Jordan, despite performing well on some indicators, should not be eligible for MCC aid due to already being a large recipient of U.S. aid, having access to private sector capital, and not being a democracy.

Since the \"Arab Spring\" of 2011, there has been a debate on funding democracy promotion in the Arab world. The 9/11 attacks shifted U.S. policy towards supporting democracy in the Middle East.
