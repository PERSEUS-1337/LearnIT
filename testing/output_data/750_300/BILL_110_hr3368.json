    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research and Education Act of 2007\". The findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that pulmonary hypertension is a serious and often fatal condition where blood pressure in the lungs rises to dangerously high levels, leading to heart enlargement and failure. Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension research must be expanded to find a cure or effective treatment. Pulmonary hypertension is a challenging diagnosis often missed in routine medical exams, even in later stages. Collaboration among research centers and increased federal investment are crucial for finding a cure or effective treatment. New diagnostic standards show promise in identifying the disease. In advanced stages, pulmonary hypertension causes severe disability, limiting physical activity and even leading to complete bedrest. New diagnostic standards have improved diagnosis rates for the disease. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first pulmonary hypertension patient registry in 1981, following 194 people with the disease for over a year. Much of what is known about pulmonary hypertension today comes from this study. The cause of the disease is still not fully understood, and there is no cure available. Basic research studies are focusing on the possible involvement of immunologic and genetic factors in the cause and progression of pulmonary hypertension, looking at agents that cause narrowing of the pulmonary blood vessels, and identifying factors that cause growth of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and formation of scar tissue in the vessel walls. Research on pulmonary hypertension is progressing, with a focus on factors causing vessel narrowing and cell growth. There are six FDA-approved medications for the condition, but not all are effective for every patient, and they come with significant side effects impacting quality of life. The number of physicians treating pulmonary hypertension and patients receiving treatment has significantly increased over the past decade, leading to a greater need for medical professional education. Lung transplantation is often a last resort treatment for pulmonary hypertension. The number of physicians treating pulmonary hypertension and patients receiving treatment has grown exponentially over the past decade. In 2001, there were 100 physicians and 3,000 patients, while in 2006, there were an estimated 3,000 physicians and 30,000 patients. Treatment now includes easy-to-administer oral therapies, but effective management remains complicated. In 2006, there were an estimated 3,000 physicians and 30,000 patients receiving treatment for pulmonary hypertension. Education of medical professionals about pulmonary hypertension management is crucial for optimal patient care. Communication among researchers is crucial for future advancements in the fight against pulmonary hypertension, as highlighted during a landmark meeting in December 2006 hosted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Over 500 individuals attended, emphasizing the importance of collaboration in managing this devastating disease. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on pulmonary hypertension research and training. The Director of the Institute will expand research on pulmonary hypertension and establish a Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network to conduct clinical trials for new treatment approaches. The Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network will conduct clinical trials to evaluate new treatment approaches for pulmonary hypertension. It will consist of at least 15 clinical centers, an institute project scientist appointed by the Director, and a data and coordinating center. The Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network includes 15 clinical centers, an institute project scientist, a data and coordinating center, and a data and safety monitoring board. The Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network includes a steering committee with principal investigators from clinical centers, a data and coordinating center, and an institute project scientist. An independent protocol review committee is appointed by the Director. The steering committee determines specific clinical trials to be conducted. The steering committee appointed by the Director determines specific clinical trials for the Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network, including combination therapies and new drug therapy approaches based on cellular defects in pulmonary hypertension. The Institute's research program for pulmonary hypertension includes combination therapies, new drug therapy avenues targeting cellular defects, use of endothelial progenitor cells for replacing abnormal vascular cells, and identifying treatment effects predictive of long-term outcomes. Program management and appointments are overseen by a steering committee appointed by the Director. The Institute is responsible for organizing and supporting a network for pulmonary hypertension research. The institute project scientist monitors subject recruitment and trial progress. The project scientist appointed for pulmonary hypertension research monitors subject recruitment, trial progress, ensures disclosure of conflicts of interest, adherence to Institute policies, and manages fiscal aspects with the grants management specialist. The Director appoints an institute grants management specialist to assist the project scientist in fiscal management of the network. Additionally, the Director appoints the Chair of the steering committee. The Director appoints the Chair of the steering committee, members of the protocol review committee, and the data safety monitoring board. Additionally, a Pulmonary Hypertension Preceptorship and Training Program is established within one year of the enactment of this section. The Director establishes a grant program for a national Pulmonary Hypertension Preceptorship and Training Program to facilitate direct training in pulmonary hypertension. The national Pulmonary Hypertension Preceptorship and Training Program aims to educate and train medical professionals to effectively diagnose, treat, and manage pulmonary hypertension. Training will be provided by experienced specialists in clinical settings to increase the number of physicians in the United States with expertise in this area. The Pulmonary Hypertension Preceptorship and Training Program aims to increase the number of physicians in the United States trained to diagnose, treat, and manage pulmonary hypertension by establishing regional training sites at academic health centers, hospitals, or private medical practices. The Pulmonary Hypertension Preceptorship and Training Program establishes regional training sites at academic health centers, hospitals, or private medical practices in the United States. Each site has a designated contact person, and grant funds are allocated for their stipend. The grant funds allocated for providing stipends to site contacts and establishing recruitment guidelines for health professionals in the program. Authorization of appropriations is also mentioned for carrying out the program. The Institute will establish model guidelines for the program, and there are authorized appropriations for fiscal years 2009 through 2012. Increasing public awareness of pulmonary hypertension. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and share information on pulmonary hypertension, including basic information, incidence, related diseases, importance of early diagnosis, and available treatments. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension through a national non-profit entity with expertise in the field. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2012 for this purpose.
