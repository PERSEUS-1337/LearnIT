    "content": "Aviation war risk insurance covers hostile acts like terrorism, hijackings, and sabotage against airlines. It is essential for airlines to have this insurance for loan agreements, lease agreements, and to meet requirements of some foreign countries. Airlines rely on private insurance markets for catastrophic coverage. After 9/11, there was a worldwide cancellation of third-party liability war risk coverage. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, airlines faced a cancellation of third-party liability war risk coverage in the commercial market. The U.S. government expanded the federal Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to ensure U.S. air carriers could obtain coverage not available in the commercial market. The commercial insurance market has since stabilized, with many airlines now purchasing war risk coverage from private insurers. The U.S. government expanded the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program post-9/11 to provide coverage for U.S. air carriers when commercial insurance was unavailable. Private insurers now offer coverage for passenger and aircraft damage from terrorist attacks, but limited coverage for third-party damage from war or terrorism. Airlines typically have liability and hull risk covered by the same insurers. The study found that airline insurance is a small percentage of total operating costs, with airlines paying approximately $2.3 billion for basic insurance in 2011. This translates to about $60 per flight or $0.80 per passenger, varying based on airline location, size, fleet age, maintenance, safety record, and geographical spread. The price of airline insurance varies significantly depending on factors such as airline location, size, fleet age, and safety record. The private market for aviation risk insurance is deemed adequate, but could change in the event of a major terrorist incident. Commercial insurers provide the majority of airlines with war risk coverage, including U.S. air carriers. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) states that commercial insurers provide most airlines with war risk coverage, including U.S. carriers. The aviation insurance market has been soft in recent years, but a series of losses in 2014, such as the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 and the shooting down of another Malaysia Airlines flight, may lead to premium increases. The aviation insurance market has been soft in recent years, but a series of losses in 2014, including the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 and the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight 17, may lead to increases in insurance premiums. Damage to aircraft in recent attacks on airports further unsettles the aviation risk environment. Some insurers estimate premiums could rise by as much as 50%. Some aviation insurers predict a potential 50% increase in insurance premiums due to recent attacks on airports. War risk insurance premiums could triple, the largest jump since 9/11. However, it is uncertain how the commercial market will react to the losses in 2014. The recent attacks on airports may lead to a potential 50% increase in insurance premiums, with war risk insurance premiums possibly tripling. Uncertainty remains about how the commercial market will react to the losses in 2014, which could result in higher premiums for all-risk policies. The unavailability of private coverage could have significant consequences for U.S. air carriers flying to destinations within the European Union. Since April 30, 2005, EU Regulation 785/2004 requires all air carriers flying within, into, out of, or over EU territory to be insured for aviation-specific liabilities, including war- and terrorism-related risks. Overflights by non-EU air carriers must comply with third-party liability insurance requirements. EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates all air carriers operating within, into, out of, or over EU territory to have insurance for aviation-specific liabilities, including war- and terrorism-related risks. Non-EU carriers conducting overflights must also comply with third-party liability insurance requirements. The regulation has made war risk insurance mandatory for non-EU carriers operating to and from the EU, even though some non-EU countries like the United States may not require it. War risk insurance was provided to the merchant fleet during World War I and World War II, but not for aviation. The federal government provided war risk insurance to the merchant fleet during World War I and World War II. Aviation war risk insurance was not available during these wars due to limited overseas commercial air operations. Prior to 1951, aviation war risk insurance was commercially available but had 48-hour cancellation clauses, causing concerns for operators during the Korean War airlift. In 1951, a law was passed to amend the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, giving the Secretary of Commerce authority to provide war risk insurance. In 1951, a law was passed to amend the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, giving the Secretary of Commerce authority to provide war risk insurance for U.S.- and foreign-flag aircraft operating in the interest of national defense or economy. Coverage included aircraft, cargo, personal effects, and liabilities. Premiums were required. The Secretary of Commerce has the authority to provide war risk insurance for aircraft operating in the interest of national defense or economy. Premium rates are set based on private market analysis, and a revolving fund within the Treasury is funded through premiums and recoveries from losses. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 established a revolving fund within the Treasury for war risk insurance in the private insurance and reinsurance markets. The fund was funded through premiums, salvage, and other recoveries from losses, with the Treasury disbursing returned premiums, losses, settlements, judgments, or other liabilities covered under the insurance program. Any company authorized to offer aviation insurance could underwrite the federally provided war risk insurance, and disagreements regarding claims could be adjudicated in federal district court. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 established a revolving fund for war risk insurance in the private aviation insurance market. Disagreements regarding claims could be settled in federal district court. The program continued under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and was later delegated to the FAA under the Department of Transportation in 1966. The era of international terrorism is often traced back to the hijacking of an El Al Boeing 707 in 1968 by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The hijacking of an El Al Boeing 707 in Rome, Italy, by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) marked the beginning of international terrorism. In August 1969, another hijacking by PFLP members occurred on a Trans World Airlines flight from Rome to Athens, Greece, which was diverted to Damascus, Syria. The hijackers blew up the nose section of the aircraft and held two Israeli passengers hostage for over 40 days. Subsequently, PFLP hijackers attempted to hijack four airliners on September 6, 1970, successfully hijacking three of them. The fourth attempted hijacking, involving an El Al Boeing 707, was thwarted by an armed Israeli guard on board. These events are collectively known as... The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) attempted to hijack four airliners on September 6, 1970, successfully hijacking three. The fourth hijacking, involving an El Al Boeing 707, was stopped by an armed Israeli guard. The hijacked planes were taken to Dawson's Field in Jordan, where they were burned. The fate of the Pan Am 747 hijacked on that day is relevant for discussing insurance coverage for terrorist acts. The Pan Am 747 hijacked on September 6, 1970, was ordered to fly to Beirut and then Cairo, where it was destroyed by an explosive. All passengers escaped, but the aircraft was completely destroyed. The Pan Am 747 was hijacked and flown to Beirut and Cairo, where it was destroyed by an explosive. All passengers escaped, but the aircraft was completely destroyed. The commercial insurance industry was rattled by the event, especially regarding insuring Boeing 747s and growing concerns over terrorist hijackings. Following the Dawson Field hijackings, the FAA expanded federal aviation war risk insurance coverage due to concerns over terrorist hijackings. The government set the rate at 20 cents per $100 of insurance, twice the price charged for commercial insurance prior to the hijackings. The government set the rate for new insurance at 20 cents per $100 of insurance, offered under the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program in response to the Middle East crisis. A federal court decision in 1973 reduced the need for long-term federal insurance coverage for hijacking and terrorist risks. The 1973 federal court decision reduced the need for long-term federal insurance coverage for hijacking and terrorist risks in response to the Middle East crisis. The court ruled that the Pan Am 747 destroyed by hijackers in Cairo was covered under the airline's standard \"all risk\" policy, not its war risk policies, defining \"act of war\" as an operation for military advantage. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the decision, specifying combatants must have significant attributes of sovereignty. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a decision regarding insurance coverage for the Pan Am 747 destroyed in Cairo by hijackers. The court ruled that the definition of \"act of war\" required combatants to have significant attributes of sovereignty, excluding the small group involved in the hijackings in the Middle East. Insurers offering \"all risk\" policies were found liable for the claim on the destroyed aircraft. The court ruling held insurers responsible for the claim on the destroyed aircraft in the Middle East. Prior to 9/11, aviation war risk insurance was issued without premiums under indemnification agreements with the Department of Defense. Over 99% of war risk insurance issued by the FAA in the 1990s was without premiums for DOD charter flights. In the 1990s, over 99% of war risk insurance issued by the FAA for DOD charter flights was without premiums, with premium insurance only available for specific foreign locations deemed necessary for U.S. foreign policy interests. Premium war risk policies were last issued during the first Gulf War in 1990 and 1991. During the first Gulf War in 1990 and 1991, the FAA issued war risk policies to carriers for specific routes in conflict areas. Air carriers canceled flights to the Middle East due to soaring war risk insurance rates, with premiums increasing significantly for flights to Israel. Trans World Airlines and Pan Am suspended flights to Israel and other destinations. Insurance premiums for flights to and from Israel increased twentyfold to $125,000 per flight after Iraqi missiles targeted the country in retaliation for airstrikes. Trans World Airlines and Pan Am suspended flights to Israel and other high-risk locations in the Middle East. Tower Air was the only U.S. carrier to continue operating flights from Israel under a government-issued premium war risk policy. After Iraqi Scud missiles were fired into Israel, Tower Air, the only U.S. air carrier operating flights from Israel, faced insurance issues with FAA. Despite FAA not insuring Tower Air's flights from New York to Tel Aviv, they continued to insure outbound passenger flights from Tel Aviv to New York. In response to the 9/11 attacks, commercial insurers cancelled third-party liability war risk coverage. The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 amended the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to include acts of terrorism in response to the 9/11 attacks. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 extended the program through December 31, 2003. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program was amended by the Stabilization Act of 2001 to include coverage for acts of terrorism. The program was extended through various acts, with the current authority expiring in September 2014. The scope of policies issued under the program was expanded to include coverage for losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, extended through various acts, was expanded by P.L. 107-296 to include coverage for losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew at limits carried by air carriers. Rates were set to match existing commercial insurance policies. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, extended by P.L. 107-296, expanded coverage for aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew to match existing commercial insurance policies. Third-party liability limits were set according to FAA policies, with rates capped at twice the premium paid as of June 19, 2002. Coverage begins from the first dollar. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, extended by P.L. 107-296, expanded coverage for aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew with rates capped at twice the premium paid as of June 19, 2002. Additionally, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA, P.L. 107-297) was passed to address the expensive or unavailable terrorism damage coverage post 9/11 attacks. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) was created to provide broader reinsurance for terrorism losses in the insurance market, including coverage for airlines. If airlines opt for commercial insurance, terrorism losses may still be covered under TRIA. The program has been extended multiple times and is set to expire in December 2014. Differences between the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program and TRIA are discussed in detail. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program provides coverage to 44 U.S. air carriers, with insurance ranging from $100 million to $4 billion per carrier. The total maximum per occurrence coverage for all insured carriers in January 2014 was $68 billion. Premiums paid were also mentioned. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program covers 44 U.S. air carriers with insurance ranging from $100 million to $4 billion per carrier. Total maximum per occurrence coverage in January 2014 was $68 billion. Premiums paid are collected in the Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, which had a balance of $2.2 billion as of July 31, 2014. 17 U.S. air carriers switched to commercial coverage between April and August 2014, leaving FAA insuring 27 carriers, estimated to cover 4% of total RPMs flown by U.S. airlines. Between April and August 2014, 17 U.S. air carriers switched from FAA war risk insurance to commercial coverage. Currently, FAA insures 27 carriers, covering approximately 4% of total RPMs flown by U.S. airlines. Coverage ranges from $100 million to $3 billion per occurrence, with an average of $1.1 billion. Total maximum exposure is $31 billion, a 55% reduction from January 2014. Declining demand led FAA to lower its premium estimate for FY2014. The FAA has reduced its estimate of premiums for the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program due to declining demand, with total maximum exposure currently at $31 billion, a 55% reduction from January 2014. Premium collections for FY2015 are estimated at $18 million, assuming Congress extends the program and no air carriers cancel their policies. The program offers coverage from the first dollar of loss and reimburses 100% of losses with no deductibles. The FAA estimates premium collections for the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program at $18 million for FY2015, assuming Congress extends the program and no air carriers cancel their policies. The coverage includes hull insurance, comprehensive liability insurance, and third-party war risk liability, with no deductibles or coinsurance. The program reimburses 100% of losses from the first dollar of loss, covering risks such as war, invasion, acts of foreign enemies, civil war, rebellion, and insurrection. The FAA's current policy document outlines risks including war (declared or not), invasion, acts of foreign enemies, civil war, rebellion, revolution, insurrection, martial law, military or usurped power, hostile detonation of weapons, strikes, riots, civil commotions, and political or terrorist acts by individuals. The policy excludes coverage for acts of terrorism, sabotage, vandalism, confiscation, nationalization, and extortion demands. The policy denies coverage for malicious acts, sabotage, vandalism, confiscation, nationalization, seizure, and hijacking. The policy excludes coverage for malicious acts, sabotage, vandalism, confiscation, nationalization, seizure, and hijacking of aircraft or spare parts due to outstanding legal debts, taxes, fines, or unlawful acts committed with the knowledge of airline officials. It also excludes hijacking or any unlawful seizure of the aircraft or crew, as well as the discharge of weapons or explosives on the aircraft. The FAA bases premiums on the risk assumed by the program to the extent practical. The FAA bases premiums on the risk assumed by the program to the extent practical, with limits on premiums not exceeding twice the premium paid by air carriers for third party policies as of June 19, 2002. The program's coverage premiums have mostly been affected by this cap, and the administration of the program requires a small number of people. The FAA Premium War Risk Insurance Program, as of June 19, 2002, has been affected by a cap on premiums paid for coverage. The program is administered by a small number of people, with four civilian full-time equivalent positions associated with the aviation war risk revolving fund. Since the 9/11 attacks, the fund has paid over $10 million for losses related to claims from specific incidents identified as \"war risk occurrences.\" Since 2001, the FAA Premium War Risk Insurance Program has paid over $10 million for losses from three specific incidents identified as \"war risk occurrences.\" These incidents include an attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in 2009 and the seizure of a SkyWest aircraft by a fugitive in 2012, resulting in damages and the individual's death. Total claims paid to date amount to $205,600. In 2012, a SkyWest aircraft was seized by a fugitive airline employee who was wanted for a homicide in Colorado. He crashed the plane into the terminal building and parked cars before taking his own life, resulting in a total loss of the aircraft and damage to airport facilities and vehicles. Claims paid so far amount to $9.6 million. The Secretary of Transportation proposed a legislative reform for the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, seeking to authorize it permanently with reduced scope. This would include continuing war risk coverage for airline losses involving NBCR weapons. The Secretary of Transportation proposed a legislative reform for the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, seeking to authorize it permanently with a reduced overall scope. This includes providing war risk coverage for airline losses involving NBCR weapons and full aviation war risk coverage for 90 days in case of a widespread cancellation of coverage by the private insurance market. Additionally, non-premium war risk insurance will continue for carriers operating under Department of Defense contracts in support of national defense. The current proposal aims to provide non-premium war risk insurance for carriers operating under Department of Defense contracts in support of national defense. Previous proposals have included changes to allow collaboration with commercial insurers for aviation war risk coverage. The FAA proposed a shared-risk model with commercial insurers for aviation war risk coverage. Commercial insurers would take on 20% of the market annually from FY2015 to FY2018, reducing FAA's share to 20% by FY2018. Previous budget proposals included a $150 million deductible for hull and liability exposures. The FY2013 and FY2012 budgets proposed a $150 million deductible for hull and liability exposures under the aviation war risk insurance program. Airlines for America President Nicholas E. Calio argued that ending the program would harm the U.S. airline industry's economic viability. A4A President Nicholas E. Calio criticized the FY2014 budget for ending the War Risk Insurance program, stating it would harm the U.S. airline industry's economic viability. A4A recommended maintaining the program and extending it for three years. No specific statement was issued regarding the March 2014 proposal by the Secretary of Transportation. A4A criticized the FY2014 budget for ending the War Risk Insurance program, recommending its extension for three years. The Secretary of Transportation's March 2014 proposal argued against extending the program due to budgetary concerns. Two approaches to reducing budgetary costs for government insurance programs are increasing funds or reducing expenses. The current Administration proposal aims to reduce budgetary costs for government insurance programs by increasing funds or reducing expenses. This can be achieved by raising premiums, seeking higher returns on funds, or reducing assumed risks to lower eventual payouts. Premiums collected by FAA totaled $165 million in FY2013. The current Administration proposal aims to reduce budgetary costs for government insurance programs by increasing funds or reducing expenses. This can be achieved by raising premiums, seeking higher returns on funds, or reducing assumed risks to lower eventual payouts. Premiums collected by FAA totaled $165 million in FY2013. Raising the statutory cap could potentially increase premiums and eliminate implicit subsidies caused by rates being below actuarial rates. The increase would depend on the gap between current premiums and actuarial premiums dictated by transferred risk. The proposal aims to reduce budgetary costs for government insurance programs by increasing funds or reducing expenses. Raising the statutory cap could potentially increase premiums and eliminate implicit subsidies caused by rates being below actuarial rates. Premiums received by insurers are typically invested in U.S. Treasury securities. The Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, currently over $2 billion, is invested in U.S. Treasury securities, with returns near historical lows. Private insurers invest in a variety of instruments, some of which historically yield more than Treasury securities. Total net investment income and realized gains for private insurers exceed government funds. Private insurers invest in a wide range of instruments, yielding higher returns than U.S. Treasury securities. In 2013, private property/casualty insurers earned $67.6 billion on $1.48 trillion in investments. If the Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund had similar returns, it would have earned $91 million instead of $26 million. However, private insurers' investments are riskier than Treasury securities and may not cover the full amount of potential losses. Private insurers' investments are riskier than Treasury securities, with mechanisms such as deductibles, co-insurance, and exclusions to share the risk. This risk-sharing discourages behavior that may increase the likelihood of a loss, known as \"moral hazard.\" Since 2002, the government has offered coverage with no deductibles or co-insurance. The government has offered coverage with no deductibles or co-insurance since 2002, covering losses up to maximum limits. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program also covers losses like vandalism or labor disturbances. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, established in 2002, provides coverage for losses such as vandalism, labor disturbances, and other intentional acts. Budgetary savings could be significant by shifting more risk to airlines through shared risk agreements with private insurers. Reinsurance is commonly used to spread risk among insurers for large risks. Private insurers often share risks among multiple insurers for very large risks. Reinsurance is commonly used to spread risk, with each insurer covering a portion of possible loss. Contracts can be tailored to achieve desired risk sharing, typically involving a certain percentage or level of loss. Loss sharing is not the only reason for financial risk sharing among insurers. Private insurers enter into reinsurance or other loss-sharing arrangements to share financial risk due to future loss. This allows parties to leverage their expertise in different facets of insurance operations more effectively. For example, one insurer may excel in judging risks and underwriting policies but lack sufficient financial capital. Private insurers enter into reinsurance or other loss-sharing arrangements to share financial risk due to future loss. This allows parties to leverage their expertise in different facets of insurance operations more effectively. For example, one insurer may excel in judging risks and underwriting policies but lack sufficient financial capital. Loss-sharing arrangements, such as those under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, can benefit insurers with different strengths by combining expertise and capital. Loss-sharing arrangements, like those in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, allow insurers to benefit by sharing financial risk. Under TRIA, the government covers 85% of losses once they reach 20% of an insurer's premiums. The program was intended to expire quickly, reducing the government's share of future losses. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) program was initially intended to expire quickly, reducing the government's share of future losses. However, it has been reauthorized with a more gradual decrease in the government's share of losses. Improved international guidance on risk decisions for flights in conflict zones could stabilize private market war risk insurance premiums and coverage terms following incidents like the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 in 2014. Insurance underwriters are considering withdrawing coverage for flights in certain conflict zones, requiring more details regarding flight routes. This follows increased interest in disseminating threat information for civilian flight operations in high-risk regions after the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 in 2014. Insurance providers are reviewing coverage for aircraft in conflict zones, considering withdrawal for flights in certain areas in the Middle East and Africa due to concerns about inconsistent risk assessment by airlines. Airlines often fly over conflict zones to save time and fuel, a practice questioned after the Malaysia Airlines crash in 2014. In August 2014, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) formed a task force to assess conflict zone risks for civilian aircraft. Airlines fly over conflict zones to save costs unless restricted, a practice questioned after the Malaysia Airlines crash. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) formed a task force in August 2014 to assess conflict zone risks for civilian aircraft. Countries responsible for air traffic services over conflict zones are supposed to identify risks, but not all countries share this information or take necessary precautions due to potential impacts on travel and tourism. Countries may not always share conflict risk information with civil aviation or take necessary precautions. Restrictions on flights could impact travel and tourism. Disparate views on risk and precautions exist among regulators, airlines, and insurers. FAA issued restrictions on flights to and from Israel during an armed conflict in July 2014. In July 2014, FAA issued restrictions on flights to and from Israel during an armed conflict after a rocket exploded near Ben Gurion Airport. Israeli authorities asked international airlines to resume flights, highlighting differing views on risk and precautions among regulators, airlines, and insurers. The FAA's restrictions on flights to Israel in 2014 prompted Israeli authorities to request international airlines to resume flights, showing differing views on risk and precautions. This highlights the challenges governments face in disseminating warnings that may impact travel and tourism during times of unrest or conflict. Improved processes for assessing conflict zone hazards to civil aviation could address concerns over war risk insurance premiums and coverage. Improved processes for assessing conflict zone hazards to civil aviation, issuing warnings, and restricting flights could address concerns over private market war risk insurance premiums and coverage by potentially reducing uncertainties and ambiguities in assessing risk. EU Regulation 785/2004 requires all air carriers and aircraft operators to be insured for aviation-specific liability, including acts of war, terrorism, hijacking, and sabotage. Principle of Insurance Article 4 mandates insurance for air carriers and aircraft operators for aviation-specific liability, including passenger, baggage, cargo, and third-party coverage. Minimum insurance coverage of 250,000 SDRs ($378,523) per passenger is required, higher than the Montreal Convention's minimum. Non-commercial aircraft operations with a MTOM of 2,700 kg have lower insurance requirements. For non-commercial aircraft operations with a MTOM of 2,700 kg, insurance is required at a lower minimum of 100,000 SDRs ($151,409) per passenger for passenger liability. Baggage liability requires a minimum coverage of 1,131 SDRs ($1,712) per passenger in commercial operations, while cargo liability needs 19 SDRs ($29) per kilogram in commercial operations. Third-party liability insurance requirements are based on the MTOM of the operated aircraft. For cargo liability in commercial operations, the minimum coverage required is 19 SDRs ($29) per kilogram. Third-party liability insurance requirements depend on the MTOM of the aircraft, ranging from 750,000 SDRs ($1,135,568) to 700 million SDRs (nearly $1.06 billion) per accident. Sanctions for regulation infringement aim to be effective, proportional, and dissuasive, including the withdrawal of operating licenses from EU air carriers. The minimum coverage for cargo liability in commercial operations is 19 SDRs ($29) per kilogram, with third-party liability insurance requirements ranging from 750,000 SDRs ($1,135,568) to 700 million SDRs (nearly $1.06 billion) per accident based on the MTOM of the aircraft. Sanctions for regulation infringement aim to be effective, proportional, and dissuasive, including potential withdrawal of operating licenses from EU air carriers and refusal of landing rights for non-EU carriers. The federal government provides insurance programs, identified in a 2005 report by the Government Accountability Office, which offer coverage to entities beyond the federal government. The federal government provides insurance programs to entities beyond the federal government, including the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program. After the 9/11 attacks, insurers excluded terrorism coverage, leading to the creation of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program in 2002. After the 9/11 attacks, insurers excluded terrorism coverage due to market conditions. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) was created in 2002 to provide federal coverage for losses from terrorist attacks temporarily. Initially authorized for three years, the program aimed to bridge the gap until the private sector could offer terrorism coverage. However, as the expiration date approached, the insurance industry expressed reluctance and inability to cover terrorism risk. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) was initially authorized for three years after 9/11 to provide federal coverage for losses from terrorist attacks. Despite expectations for the private sector to offer terrorism coverage, the insurance industry expressed reluctance and incapacity. The program was reauthorized multiple times, with the insurance industry supporting its extension. Differences exist between TRIA and the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program despite their common genesis. The insurance industry supports extending the TRIA program, which provides government reinsurance for private insurers offering terrorism coverage. Unlike the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, TRIA does not directly cover businesses at risk of terrorism losses but reimburses private insurers for losses under certain conditions. TRIA program requires insurers to offer terrorism coverage and reimburses them for losses. There are no upfront premiums, but a post-event recoupment fee may apply. Losses covered by TRIA are paid from the government's general fund. War Risk Insurance Fund is funded by the government's general fund, with post-event recoupment fees on commercial insurance policies. TRIA coverage is limited compared to federal aviation war risk insurance, operating through private insurers with similar limits and deductibles. Each insurer must meet a substantial general deductible for TRIA coverage. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) coverage is more limited than federal aviation war risk insurance, as it operates through private insurers with similar limits and deductibles. Before federal funds can be accessed under TRIA, a minimum of $100 million in insured losses due to a terrorist act must occur. The acts that can be certified to count towards this threshold are narrower than those triggering federal aviation war risk insurance. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) requires a minimum of $100 million in insured losses from a terrorist act to be certified. Private insurers offer coverage under the same terms as other causes of loss, but may charge a separate premium. State laws may limit terrorism premiums."
