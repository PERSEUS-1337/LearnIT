Policymakers are reevaluating the causes of poverty and the effectiveness of policy responses. Discussions on poverty and public policy prompt questions about the demographics of poverty in the United States. The rising poverty rate has prompted policymakers to reexamine the causes of poverty and the effectiveness of policy responses. This report provides a snapshot of the diverse demographics of poverty in the United States in 2015, highlighting the role of work in the lives of those who are poor. In 2015, a report highlighted the diverse demographics of poverty in the United States, emphasizing the importance of work in the lives of those who are poor. The report also focused on the different stages of life and living circumstances of individuals and families in poverty. The report focuses on the demographics of poverty in the United States, particularly on individuals aged 65 and older with prior workforce experience. It also considers living arrangements and family well-being as factors influencing economic status. Other factors affecting individuals' attachment to the labor market are noted but not discussed in detail in this report. This snapshot examines the composition of people in poverty, looking at what groups make up the poverty population rather than poverty rates among different groups. Non-Hispanic whites may have low poverty rates but represent a large share of the poverty population due to their population size, while smaller groups like American Indians may have higher poverty rates. Non-Hispanic whites have low poverty rates but make up a large share of the poverty population due to their size. Conversely, smaller groups like American Indians have higher poverty rates but represent a smaller share of the poverty population. Both perspectives are relevant to public policy. The CRS Report R44644, Poverty in the United States in 2015: In Brief, examines poverty rates for different demographic groups using the official measure of poverty by the U.S. Census Bureau, which is family-based. A person's poverty status is determined by their money income and the income of family members they live with and share resources with. The poverty measure is family-based, where an individual's income is compared to a dollar threshold based on their family composition. For example, in 2015, the poverty threshold for a working-age single person was $12,331. The poverty measure compares an individual's money income to a dollar threshold based on family composition. For example, in 2015, the poverty threshold for a single person was $12,331. If income is below the threshold, the person or family is considered poor. The official poverty measure has been in use for 50 years but has limitations, such as only looking at pre-tax income. The official poverty measure has been in use for about 50 years, comparing income to a dollar threshold based on family composition. It only considers pre-tax money income and does not account for government taxes, non-cash benefits, or assets. The measure is uniform across the country and does not factor in regional differences in living costs. The official poverty measure does not consider regional living cost differences or modern resource-sharing arrangements like those of cohabiting couples. The Census Bureau now provides a supplemental poverty measure that includes taxes, transfers, housing costs by area, and an expanded family definition. In 2015, an estimated 43.1 million people had income below the poverty threshold. In 2015, an estimated 43.1 million people had pre-tax income below the poverty threshold, accounting for 13.5% of the noninstitutionalized population. There is a focus on the very poor, known as \"deep poverty.\" In 2015, an estimated 19.4 million people, close to half of all those in poverty, were living in deep poverty, defined as having income below 50% of the poverty threshold. This population included individuals of all ages, genders, and racial/ethnic groups. In 2015, close to half of all people in poverty (45.1%) were living in deep poverty. The population of people in poverty included individuals of all ages, both sexes, and various racial and ethnic groups. Children under 18 made up one-third (14.5 million) of all people in poverty, over-represented compared to the overall population. In 2015, children accounted for one-third of all people in poverty, with 14.5 million children living in poverty. Working-age individuals (18-64) made up the largest share of the poor population, while those aged 65 and older represented a smaller proportion. Figure 4 illustrates the racial and ethnic composition of people in poverty compared to the total population. In 2015, children made up one-third of the poverty population, with 14.5 million children living in poverty. Working-age individuals (18-64) were the largest group in poverty, while those aged 65 and older were a smaller proportion. Non-Hispanic whites were the largest racial/ethnic group in both the total population and the poverty population, while Hispanics were the second largest group in the total population but made up 28.1% of those in poverty. In the poverty population, non-Hispanic whites were the largest group (41.2%), followed by Hispanics (28.1%) and non-Hispanic African-Americans (22.0%). Most minority groups were over-represented in poverty compared to the overall population. Most minority groups, including Hispanics, non-Hispanic African-Americans, American Indians, and persons of two or more races, were over-represented in the poverty population. Children were more racially and ethnically diverse than adults, with minorities being over-represented in the poverty population. Children, especially Hispanic children, are more racially and ethnically diverse than adults. Minorities are over-represented in the poverty population for all age groups. Women slightly outnumber men in the overall population, but represent a larger share in the population in poverty. In 2015, white children made up 51.4% of the overall child population. Women accounted for 51% of the total population, but represented 55.9% of the population in poverty. This over-representation is due to women heading more single-parent households, which are more likely to be poor. Men earn more than women on average, even with full-time year-round employment. Poverty has different policy implications for children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Men's earnings are higher than women's on average, even with full-time year-round employment. Poverty raises different policy considerations for children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Children are dependents of their parents or caretakers, while working-age adults are expected to support themselves and their children. Aged adults may retire from work. The family income and poverty status of children generally apply to their parents or other adult caretakers. Working-age adults are expected to work and support themselves and their children. Aged adults may retire from work and draw income from public or private benefits. The report separately explores poverty among children, working-age adults, and aged adults, highlighting the central role of work as the primary means of economic support. The central role of work as the primary means of economic support for individuals and families is highlighted, with a focus on children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Poverty among children in America is emphasized, despite making up a smaller portion of the total population. Living arrangements and the ability to share resources are also explored in relation to economic well-being. Children in America are disproportionately poor, with a poverty rate of 19.7% in 2015. They rely on their parents or adult caretakers for support, mainly from their earnings. In 2015, children in America, especially those who are poor, rely on their parents or adult caretakers for support, mainly from their earnings. More than 90% of children in the total population live in families with at least one adult earner, and 50.3% live in families with two or more adult earners. Among children in the total population, over 90% lived in families with at least one adult earner, with 50.3% in families with two or more earners. For children in poor families, two-thirds had one or more earners, with 57.5% having one earner and 10.5% having two or more earners. 32.1% lived in families with no income from earnings, influenced by the type of family structure. In 2015, children in poor families were mostly from female-headed households, while married couple families still made up a significant portion. The number of potential adult earners in a child's family depends on the family type. In 2015, children in poor families were mostly from female-headed households, while married couple families still accounted for a significant portion of children in poverty. Married-couple families, despite having a low poverty rate, had a large population size, resulting in a substantial number of poor children living in this family type. Married-couple families were underrepresented among children in poverty compared to the total population. Married-couple families, despite being underrepresented among children in poverty, still had a significant number of poor children. Larger families, which require more income to meet needs, are more likely to be poor due to earnings not being determined by family size. Poverty thresholds are higher for larger families compared to small families. Despite most children living in families with earnings determined by the labor market, larger families are more likely to be poor. In 2015, 27% of poor children were in families with four or more children, higher than the overall population percentage of 14.2%. In 2015, 27% of poor children were in families with four or more children, higher than the overall population percentage of 14.2%. Working-age adults (18-64 years old) represented the majority of people in poverty in America, with a poverty rate of 12.4%. In 2015, the majority of people in poverty were working-age adults (18-64 years old) with a poverty rate of 12.4%. Among working-age adults who were poor, the majority did not have earnings from work, with only 38.8% working either full- or part-time, full- or part-year. Among working-age adults who were poor, 61.3% did not have earnings from work. 38.8% were working in some capacity, with 10.4% working full-time all year. Reasons for not working included illness, caregiving, schooling, retirement, and job availability. Among non-working poor adults, reasons included illness, caregiving, schooling, retirement, and job availability. Educational attainment is linked to workforce success, with higher credentials leading to higher earnings and more stable employment. Educational attainment is crucial for success in the workforce, as higher credentials result in higher earnings and more stable employment. In 2015, the largest group of poor working-age adults had a high school diploma but no post-secondary credential, while those without a high school diploma accounted for a significant portion as well. The largest group of poor working-age adults in 2015 were those without a post-secondary credential, followed by those lacking a high school diploma. Even among adults aged 25 to 64, those with only a high school diploma still made up the largest share of the poor population. Among working-age adults, those with only a high school diploma are the largest group of poor individuals. Family living arrangements are more common in the overall population compared to the poor, with 41% of all working-age adults who do not live in families being poor in 2015. Among working-age adults, family living arrangements are more common in the overall population (77.9%) than among the poor (58.8%). In 2015, 41% of all working-age adults in poverty lived outside of a family, including those living alone (18.1%), with cohabiting partners (11.7%), or other unrelated adults/roommates (11.4%). Poverty status for individuals living with others is determined based on each individual's income. In 2015, aged adults accounted for 14.9% of the total population but only 9.7% of the population in poverty, with a poverty rate of 8.8%. Aged adults may retire from the workforce. In 2015, aged adults had a poverty rate of 8.8% and accounted for 14.9% of the total population but only 9.7% of the population in poverty. Income from work plays a significant role in the economic well-being of aged adults. Work, including past work, earnings of family members, and income from pensions, plays a crucial role in determining the economic well-being of aged adults. Social Security income, earned through past work, is received by 62.4% of aged persons who are poor in 2015. In 2015, Social Security was received by 62.4% of aged persons in poverty, compared to 86.0% in the total population. Aged persons also receive income from pensions and other benefits earned during their working careers, but far fewer in poverty receive these benefits. Retirement, disability, or survivor pensions were received by 48.5% of all aged persons, but only 7.7% of those in poverty. In 2015, families of aged persons in poverty received significantly fewer benefits compared to the overall aged population. Only 7.7% of poor aged persons received retirement, disability, or survivor pensions, while 48.5% of all aged persons received them. Similarly, only 11.0% of poor aged persons received earnings from work, compared to 40.7% of all aged persons. Overall, 97.2% of aged adults in the total population lived in families with income derived from work. In 2015, almost three in four aged persons living in poverty had income derived from work, with 71.7% in families with work-derived income. Figure 14 illustrates aged adults in poverty by living arrangement, highlighting the importance of resource-sharing. In 2015, half of aged adults in poverty lived alone, a significantly higher rate than the overall aged population. Aged adults in poverty were less likely to be living in families compared to the overall aged population. This report provides basic information about the 43 million Americans living below the poverty line in 2015. The report presents basic information about the 43 million Americans living below the poverty line in 2015, showing that they are a diverse group including children, working-age adults, and aged adults. Certain groups are over-represented among those in poverty, such as women. Certain groups, including women, minorities, children, and individuals living alone or outside of families, are over-represented among those living in poverty. Income from work plays a central role in determining poverty status, with children relying on their parents' or family members' work, working-age adults on their own work, and aged adults often retired from the workforce. In 2015, a significant number of children and aged adults living in poverty had some form of work-based income, despite the complexity of circumstances leading to poverty. In 2015, a majority of children and aged adults in poverty had some form of work-based income, highlighting the complexity of circumstances leading to poverty and the need for further exploration in federal policy interventions."
