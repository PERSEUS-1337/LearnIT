    "content": "The \"Homebuyer Tax Credit Improvement Act of 2009\" enhances the administration of the first-time homebuyer tax credit. The \"Homebuyer Tax Credit Improvement Act of 2009\" now includes an age limitation for claiming the tax credit on the purchase of a residence. Taxpayers must be at least 18 years old at the time of purchase, or if married, either the taxpayer or their spouse must meet the age requirement. The age requirement for claiming the homebuyer tax credit is clarified for married taxpayers, where either the taxpayer or their spouse must meet the age requirement. Amendments are made to the tax code to reflect this change. Amendments to the tax code include documentation requirements for the homebuyer tax credit, specifying that taxpayers must attach a settlement statement to their tax return. Additionally, restrictions are placed on married individuals acquiring a residence from the family of their spouse. Amendments to the tax code include restrictions on married individuals acquiring a residence from the family of their spouse and treating certain errors related to the first-time homebuyer tax credit as mathematical or clerical errors. Amendments to the tax code include adding a new subparagraph (O) for claiming the credit under section 36, with conditions related to age requirements and information provided to the Secretary by the taxpayer. The taxpayer may not qualify for the credit under section 36 if they do not meet the age requirement, provide inconsistent information on their tax return, or fail to attach the required form. The amendments made by this section apply to purchases after the enactment date, with documentation requirements for returns ending after the same date. Amendments for mathematical and clerical errors apply to returns as well. The amendments made by subsection (b) apply to returns for taxable years ending after the enactment of this Act, while the amendments made by subsection (d) apply to returns for taxable years ending on or after April 9, 2008. Certain tax return preparers are required to file returns electronically. Certain tax return preparers must file individual income tax returns on magnetic media if they are specified tax return preparers for the calendar year. Certain tax return preparers must file individual income tax returns on magnetic media if they are specified tax return preparers for the calendar year and reasonably expect to file more than 100 individual income tax returns. Certain tax return preparers are required to file individual income tax returns on magnetic media if they reasonably expect to file 100 or fewer individual income tax returns during the calendar year. Amendments to the tax code specify this requirement. Amendments to the tax code specify that the Secretary may not allow certain tax return preparers to file individual income tax returns on magnetic media, except as provided in paragraph (3). These amendments apply to returns filed after December 31, 2010."
