The Congress finds that the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a major threat to national security since the end of the Cold War and breakup of the Soviet Union. The United Nations also recognizes the danger of weapons of mass destruction. The United Nations Security Council declared in 1992 that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a threat to international peace and security. The establishment of the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq set an important precedent in preventing proliferation. Several nations, aside from the 5 declared nuclear weapon states, are either in possession of or pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities, leading to regional nuclear arms races. Regional nuclear arms races are a significant concern as several nations, aside from the 5 declared nuclear weapon states, are pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities. Deteriorating conditions at Russian nuclear weapons sites have raised concerns about the potential for nuclear materials or weapons to fall into the wrong hands, increasing the threat of nuclear proliferation. Russia's nuclear materials tracking and weapons accountability issues have heightened the risk of nuclear proliferation. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the 1990s. Iraq had a secret nuclear weapons program that went undetected by the IAEA. Iraq had a clandestine nuclear weapons program assisted by dual-use exports from western countries, including the United States. North Korea and the United States signed an agreement in October 1994 to exchange nuclear technology. North Korea signed an agreement to exchange its nuclear reactors and reprocessing equipment for modern light water reactor technology, which is less suited for making bombs. Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa had nuclear weapons programs but have renounced them due to reduced tensions. Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa had nuclear weapons programs but have renounced them and accepted IAEA safeguards and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The United States' security interests align with the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. The United States supports various nuclear weapons free zones, including the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty, to prevent regional conflicts and arms races. The IAEA is a valuable tool for countering proliferation. The United States signed the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty in 1996 to prevent regional conflicts and arms races. The IAEA has strengthened its safeguard system through the Strengthened Safeguards System program, but faces challenges due to institutional and financial constraints. The US supports immobilizing some plutonium for energy and mixing some with low-grade materials. The effectiveness of safeguarding nuclear materials may be hindered by institutional and financial constraints. The US supports immobilizing plutonium for energy and mixing it with low-enriched uranium for use in commercial reactors. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty aims to prevent further nuclear proliferation. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty aims to prevent further nuclear proliferation by extending indefinitely and strengthening the international nonproliferation regime. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 reaffirms the US commitment to support the treaty and enhance the effectiveness of the IAEA. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 reaffirmed the US commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and aimed to establish more effective controls over the transfer of nuclear equipment, materials, and technology. The goal is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons capability, roll back proliferation, and prevent the use of nuclear weapons worldwide. The United States aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, reverse proliferation, and prevent their use globally through a comprehensive nonproliferation policy. The United States aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and prevent their use globally through a comprehensive nonproliferation policy outlined in SEC. 3. The United States aims to end nuclear proliferation by pursuing objectives such as placing fissile materials under international controls, ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and halting the production of new nuclear warheads through agreements with Russia. The United States aims to end nuclear proliferation by pursuing objectives such as signing treaties with North Korea, India, and Pakistan, reaching agreements with Russia to halt new warhead production, negotiating to reduce nuclear arsenals with Russia, and enforcing multilateral agreements to reduce nuclear arsenals significantly. The United States aims to reduce nuclear arsenals through multilateral agreements, including halting fissile material production by 2008. Nonproliferation Treaty member states aim to permanently halt weapons-usable fissile material production by January 1, 2008, place existing stockpiles under international controls, and ensure all nuclear facilities for peaceful purposes are under IAEA safeguards to strengthen verification. Strengthen IAEA safeguards to verify compliance with nonproliferation commitments and support necessary reforms. Enhance nuclear export controls, impose sanctions on proliferators, and increase transparency on approved export licenses. The United States and other nuclear supplier nations impose sanctions on individuals, companies, and countries contributing to nuclear proliferation. They also provide increased public information on approved nuclear export licenses and ratify the IAEA's Strengthened Safeguards System program. Additionally, efforts are made to reduce incentives for countries to acquire nuclear weapons by reducing regional tensions, strengthening security agreements, and urging the UN Security Council to enforce nonproliferation agreements. The curr_chunk discusses the need to reduce regional tensions, strengthen security agreements, and increase the role of the UN Security Council in enforcing international nuclear nonproliferation agreements. It also suggests adopting a \"no first use\" policy with other nuclear weapon states and providing immediate assistance to any country under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty if nuclear weapons are used against them. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of assisting countries under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty if nuclear weapons are used against them, signing bilateral agreements with Russia to dismantle tactical nuclear weapons, ratifying nuclear-free zone treaties, and monitoring North Korea's activities. The curr_chunk highlights the need to ratify nuclear-free zone treaties, monitor North Korea's nuclear activities, and begin negotiations on START III with Russia. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY. The President must report to Congress every February on actions taken to implement policy objectives, including those of the Russian Federation and other countries, and obstacles encountered. The President must report to Congress annually on actions taken by various countries and institutions to achieve policy objectives, as well as obstacles encountered. Reports should be unclassified, with a classified appendix if needed. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"fissile materials\" refer to highly enriched uranium and plutonium, \"highly enriched uranium\" is uranium enriched to 20% or more in U-235, \"IAEA\" stands for the International Atomic Energy Agency, \"IAEA safeguards\" are safeguards in an agreement with the IAEA, and \"no first use\" policy means not being the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict. Article III(A)(5) of the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency authorizes the policy of \"no first use\" of nuclear weapons, defining a commitment not to be the first to use them in a conflict. The terms \"non-nuclear weapon state\" and \"nuclear weapon state\" are also defined in relation to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of terms related to nuclear weapons treaties, including the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the START I and START II treaties. The curr_chunk defines the START I, START II, and START III treaties related to strategic offensive arms reductions between the United States and Russia."
