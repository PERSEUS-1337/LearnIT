This work introduces a novel global meshing strategy for image geolocation inferencing, addressing data limitations in training models. This work introduces a novel global meshing strategy for image geolocation inferencing, overcoming data limitations in training models and incorporating additional information to improve performance. Delaunay triangles are shown to be effective for geolocation in low volume scenarios compared to state-of-the-art models using quad trees and more training data. The novel global meshing strategy using Delaunay triangles improves geolocation accuracy in low volume scenarios compared to quad trees and more training data. Additional information like time of posting and user albuming can further enhance accuracy by up to 11% for country-level and 3% for city-level localities. Advancements in deep learning have expanded the capabilities of machine learning beyond image classification. Recent methods allow for deeper analysis of contextual information in images, enabling researchers to ask more complex questions like determining the geographic origin of a picture. This task is challenging due to various factors. Estimating the geographic origin of ground-level images is challenging due to uneven distribution of geo-tagged image data and potential conflicting information. The work focuses on content-based image geolocation, dealing with challenges like conflicting data and ambiguous geographic terms. The work presented focuses on content-based image geolocation, aiming to identify the geographic origin of ground-level images in the era of increasing image and mixed-media data. This task is crucial as images may lack geolocation information, making it challenging to infer the geographic context behind them. The paper discusses the challenges of geolocating images, especially when they lack geolocation information. Various approaches have been considered for this task, with the current approach building on recent research. The paper discusses geolocation of images without location information, building on recent research like BID19 for global geoinferencing. Methods include instance-level scene retrieval and similarity-based geolabel assignment from geotagged imagery. The common approach involves instance-level scene retrieval for geolocation of imagery, querying geotagged imagery to assign a geolabel based on image similarity. Prior work includes data sampling strategies for large-scale classification, such as weighted sampling of minority classes during deep learning model training. Data sampling strategies for large-scale classification problems in social media applications involve biased class selection during deep learning model training. Researchers have considered sampling methods that ensure individual users are only seen once per training epoch, without respect to user identity. Researchers have concerns about biased class selection in social media applications, particularly regarding sampling methods that ensure individual users are only seen once per training epoch. The study explores geolocation models based on image content, time information, and user-album inputs. The study explores geolocation models based on image content, time information, and user-album inputs using data from YFCC100M BID17. Training and validation were performed on a subset of geolabeled imagery. The study used a subset of geolabeled imagery from YFCC100M BID17 for training and validation. The data included user-id and posted-time metadata for each image. The study utilized geolabeled imagery from YFCC100M with user-id and posted-time metadata. The global-scale geolocation model involves classifying images based on a grid system, similar to PlaNet's approach. The global-scale geolocation model involves classifying images based on a grid system, similar to PlaNet's approach. Images are trained using an image classifier, and the distribution of image longitude varies by the time of day they are posted. The prior distribution for image longitude differs based on the time of day an image is posted. The classification structure uses a Delaunay triangle-based meshing architecture to assign geo-label probabilities to input imagery. The Delaunay triangle-based meshing architecture assigns geo-label probabilities to input imagery, different from PlaNet's quad-tree approach. The triangular mesh captures Earth's geometric features more adaptively, especially water/land interfaces. The triangular mesh approach is more adaptive to Earth's geometric features, capturing water/land interfaces without needing additional refinement like quad-tree meshes. However, it lacks refinement level information compared to quad-tree structures, making it necessary to adaptively refine cells based on certain criteria. The triangular mesh approach allows for more simplistic control of granularity by adaptively refining cells based on certain criteria. The mesh is initialized with a 31 x 31 structured grid with equal surface area in each triangle. Parameters for mesh initialization were not explored in this study. The mesh for the coarse and fine meshes can be adjusted by modifying the refinement level. Table 1 shows the parameters used for the three meshes studied in this work, covering a range of mesh structures. The fine mesh replicates the parameters used by PlaNet. The table displays meshing parameters for three meshes studied, covering a range of structures. The fine P mesh differs in methodology and dataset. Classification models in the paper use coarse and fine mesh structures, with red triangles indicating training criteria met in certain regions. The paper discusses the classification models developed using coarse and fine mesh structures, with red triangles indicating training criteria met in specific regions. The fine mesh better represents geographic regions, such as the water/land interface of Spain and Portugal, compared to the coarser mesh. The fine and fine P meshes, generated with all available imagery, show better representation of geographic regions compared to the coarser mesh. The Inception v4 CNN architecture is used to develop the mesh-based classification geolocation model (Model M1) in this work, utilizing a softmax classification similar to the PlaNet approach. Cells are labeled differently from the PlaNet model. The geolocation model (Model M1) in this work differs from PlaNet BID19's Inception v3 architecture. Cells are labeled based on the cell centroid in latitudelongitude, with significant improvements expected for coarse meshes. The geolocation for each cell is specified as the lat/lon centroid of the image population. The geolocation model computes the lat/lon centroid of the image population for each cell. Significant improvements are expected for coarse meshes, with higher errors in beach images due to cell centroids being off coastlines. Models are evaluated by calculating the distance between predicted and ground-truth GPS coordinates using great-circle distance formula. The geolocation model evaluates predicted cell centroids by comparing them to ground-truth GPS coordinates using a great-circle distance formula. Error thresholds of 1 km, 25 km, 200 km, 750 km, and 2500 km are used to represent different localities. The geolocation model uses error thresholds of 1 km, 25 km, 200 km, 750 km, and 2500 km to represent different localities. YFCC100M images have associated metadata including user id and posting time, which is utilized in model M2. The geolocation model uses error thresholds to represent different localities. YFCC100M images have metadata including user id and posting time, utilized in model M2. Let Z ik be the one-hot encoding of the i th image for the k th class. Output N Softmax 1 is strong evidence for P (Z ik = 1|t i ) = P (Z ik = 1), suggesting time dependence after conditioning on image content. The geolocation model (M2) assumes time dependence after conditioning on image content. Variables related to time are added to the output of the geolocation model (M1) to create a new input for M2. The model filters the fit probabilities of each image and uses Bidirectional LSTMs to geolocate multiple images from a single user by leveraging information from other images posted by the user. The geolocation model M3 simultaneously geolocates images from a single user using Bidirectional LSTMs to capitalize on correlations in the user's images. Unlike PlaNet, which organizes images by topic or location, M3 organizes all images sequentially in time. The research question is whether the success observed in PlaNet extends to this less informative organization of images. In M3, images by a single user are organized sequentially in time with no specific further organization. All user images are grouped into albums of size 24, padded with zeros if needed. During training, a user is limited to a random album per epoch. Album averaging, as considered by Weyand et al. (2016), assigns mesh cells to images in an album based on highest average probability, increasing accuracy. In album averaging, images are assigned mesh cells based on highest average probability, increasing accuracy by borrowing information across related images. User images are also organized based on maximum average probability, assuming they are from the same mesh grid cells. However, there is no optimization for unbiased class frequencies. The study considered using LSTM on a time-ordered sequence of images but found that adding time to the model was sufficient. The output of M1 is filtered to show only the top 10 mesh cell probabilities and re-normalized. Training of M2 and M3 was done on the validation data of M1. The study focused on using LSTM on a time-ordered sequence of images but concluded that adding time to the model was enough. The output of M1 is filtered to display the top 10 mesh cell probabilities and re-normalized. Training of M2 and M3 was conducted on the validation data of M1. Meshing parameters were analyzed to understand the sensitivity to mesh adaptation, revealing a trade-off between fine-grain and coarse-grain geolocation. The study analyzed meshing parameters for M3 (Time-Albums) and found a trade-off between fine-grain and coarse-grain geolocation. Results showed improved large granularity geolocation with coarse mesh and better performance at finer-granularities with fine mesh. Comparing classifying on training data centroid versus cell centroid for class labels, a significant improvement was seen for the coarse mesh. The BID20 model, used with indoor-outdoor labels, improved geolocation accuracy by 4-8% for region/country localities. The model was not re-trained on outdoor imagery but filtered it during inference, showing a modest boost in smaller-scale regions. The M1 classification model, not re-trained on outdoor imagery, shows a 4-8% improvement in accuracy for region/country localities. Results are tabulated for all meshes using Im2GPS testing data, demonstrating generality in the approach. The M1 classification model, not re-trained on outdoor imagery, shows a 4-8% improvement in accuracy for region/country localities. The performance of the M1 classification model is comparable to BID19 with less training data and classification regions. Time usage improves geolocation accuracy slightly, with 24.20% of images geolocated within 200 km when using time. The use of time improves geolocation accuracy for large regions with a slight gain in accuracy. There is a persistent advantage in accuracy when using time across all error calculations, with statistically significant results. The error of the coarse mesh is different when using time compared to not using time. The error of the coarse mesh is significantly different when using time (M2) compared to not using time (M1). A Wilcoxon-Signed-Test shows a highly significant difference in favor of using time-inputs, with a difference of 381. The difference \u03bc2 \u2212 \u03bc1 = 381 is highly significant (p-value < 10 \u221216) in favor of using time-inputs. The distribution of errors is mean shifted, with the median of coarse mesh e1 at 1627 km and e2 at 1262 km. Time input models have lower-bias class probabilities and cross-entropy was optimized in training for both models. The median of coarse mesh e1 is 1627 km and e2 is 1262 km. Time input models have lower-bias class probabilities and cross-entropy was optimized in training for both models. KL-Divergence is calculated to minimize class biases in the classification model and time-inputs models. The KL-divergence of the model output class frequencies compared to the true class frequencies in validation are in TAB5. \"User-Averaging\" is used for better accuracy in predicting images, but it can bias cell count frequency. Improved accuracy may not guarantee similar class frequency distribution to the truth when using the average probability vector to predict a user's image. When predicting individual images with models M1 or M2, there is a bias in cell count frequency. Using the average probability vector to predict a user's image may result in higher bias and reduced accuracy. Albums provide a better approach to borrowing information across users, with LSTMs on user albums showing the lowest class bias. Different models were compared for accuracy at various spatial resolutions. The study compared different models for accuracy at various spatial resolutions. LSTMs on user albums showed the lowest class bias, with a bias-reducing cross-entropy optimization. Time inputs were concatenated with M1 output for album creation, containing 24 images. The best possible accuracy was noted for Coarse Mesh and Fine Mesh if every image was given the correct class. The study compared different models for accuracy at various spatial resolutions, noting the best possible accuracy for Coarse Mesh and Fine Mesh. Conditioning on latent variables can improve geolocation models, and using time of day in the models was observed to increase accuracy and lower bias. Time of day makes statistically significant improvements to geolocation models. Using time information in models improves accuracy and reduces bias. It also shows statistically significant enhancements in geolocation. Accounting for indoor/outdoor scenes in images explains variations in validation accuracy, with outdoor-only results outperforming all images. Future work could involve incorporating the probability of an image being outdoor into the model. Increasing the granularity of a grid reduces accuracy at the country and regional level, while improving accuracy at street and city level. Street level geoinferencing is not practical with a coarse mesh. Increasing the granularity of a grid reduces accuracy at the country and regional level, while improving accuracy at street and city level. Street level geoinferencing is not practical with a coarse mesh. A fine mesh is expected to perform better for geolocation at larger resolutions than 25 km, but there is no explicit way to prove it. However, a coarse mesh is shown to be superior for 200 km resolutions. The study compared the performance of coarse and fine meshes for geolocation at different resolutions. A coarse mesh was found to be superior for 200 km resolutions. Using a Delunary triangle-based mesh allowed for accurate model training with fewer examples. Training and validation sets were created for image data, with further sub-division for time-based models. The study created training and validation sets for image data, with a further sub-division for time-based models. Softmax classification performed poorly with a large number of output classes. A training procedure was developed to address challenges with large meshes, but its effectiveness is not conclusively demonstrated. During initial experiments with large meshes, a training procedure was developed to address challenges. The approach involved training a pre-trained model on ImageNet with Adagrad, increasing training examples each epoch, and oversampling minority classes to ensure equal representation of all classes. The training procedure involved using Adagrad BID3, increasing training examples by 6% each epoch, oversampling minority classes for equal representation, reducing class bias after each training cycle, and using SGD with a decreasing learning rate without class biasing. The final model was trained with SGD, using a linearly decreasing learning rate reduced at 4% with each epoch, without class biasing and with the full dataset per epoch. The initial value of the learning rate varied for each model (between 0.004 and 0.02). The values of those hyperparameters were empirically determined. The layers of M2 are described in TAB0. M2 is trained using He initializations, initial iterations of Adaboost, followed by ADAM at learning rates of 0.005 and 0.001. Early stopping is used to detect a sustained decrease in validation. The M2 model is trained using He initializations, Adaboost, and ADAM with learning rates of 0.005 and 0.001. Early stopping is used to detect a sustained decrease in validation accuracy. The generality of the M1 classification model is demonstrated by performing a query-by-example on the 2K random Im2GPS dataset. The Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood is not present in the training data or the 2K random dataset. Each image is assigned a categorical indicator variable. A latent class distribution is assumed constant between training, testing, and application. The last layer output from the trained networks is a fit logit for each class in the mesh grid. The last layer output from trained networks is a fit logit for each class in the mesh grid. An estimate of the unknown distribution is calculated using a softmax model. When comparing models, accuracy is preferred but unbiased models are also considered. The KL-divergence between distributions q and p should be low if training is successful. Entropy of distributions p and q is also taken into account for completeness."
