The Legislature aims to support foster care agencies by providing information on admissions requirements and financial aid to California's higher education institutions. Additionally, they urge the University of California and California State University to consider using admissions-by-exemption to help homeless and foster youth transition into four-year public colleges. Each campus of the California Community Colleges is requested to prioritize housing for current and former homeless youth and foster youth in student housing facilities, especially during school breaks or on a year-round basis. Colleges with student housing facilities open year-round are asked to prioritize current and former homeless and foster youth for residence at no extra cost during breaks. Each campus of the California Community Colleges is requested to develop a plan to ensure that homeless and foster youth can access housing resources as needed during academic terms and breaks, regardless of student housing facilities. A \"homeless youth\" under 25 years old, verified as homeless within 24 months before applying to a California Community College campus, qualifies for assistance. Verification can be done by a homeless services provider. A homeless youth under 25, verified within 24 months before applying to a California Community College, qualifies for assistance. Verification can be done by a homeless services provider, director of a federal TRIO program, or a financial aid administrator. Former homeless youth retain their status for six years from admission. Each campus of the California State University must prioritize current and former homeless youth and foster youth for student housing, especially for year-round occupancy. Housing facilities must prioritize current and former homeless youth and foster youth for year-round residence, offering it at no extra cost during breaks.

Each University of California campus with student housing facilities must prioritize current and former homeless and foster youth for housing. Priority is given to these individuals for year-round residence in eligible housing facilities.

They should provide housing to these individuals at no extra cost during academic breaks and give priority for residence in housing facilities open for the most days in the calendar year. The University of California campus is asked to create a plan for homeless and foster youth to access housing resources during academic breaks, regardless of student housing availability. A homeless youth, defined as a student under 25 verified as homeless within the past 24 months, can access housing resources at University of California campuses. The section outlines eligibility criteria for individuals who can access housing resources at University of California campuses, including homeless services providers, TRIO program directors, and financial aid administrators. Former homeless youth retain their status for six years from admission, and the University of California is subject to this section if the Regents make it applicable."
