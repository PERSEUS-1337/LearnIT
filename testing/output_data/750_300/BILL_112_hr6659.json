    "content": "The \"Urban Recovery and Growth Act\" is cited as the short title. It extends the Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds for certain cities under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Urban Recovery and Growth Act\" extends the Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds by treating economic development extension bonds as qualified bonds issued before January 1, 2011. Interest on these bonds is includible in gross income, with a substitution of '45 percent' for '35 percent' in the application of subsection (b). The term 'economic development extension bond' refers to a specified bond issued within a 1-year period with excess project proceeds used for qualified purposes. The term 'specified bond' refers to any obligation (other than a private activity bond) where the interest would be excludable from gross income under section 103. The issuer must designate the bond for qualified purposes and maintain a reasonably required reserve. The term 'specified bond' includes any obligation (other than a private activity bond) where the interest would be excludable from gross income under section 103. Applicable rules similar to section 54AA(d)(2) apply, and section 148 does not apply to issues where the excess is used for a qualified purpose. Section 148 does not apply if the excess described in paragraph (1)(A) is used for a qualified purpose as defined in paragraph (3)(B), which includes qualified economic development purposes and refinancing of indebtedness. The term 'specified city' refers to a principal city in a metropolitan statistical area with an average unemployment rate of at least 150% of the national average rate. This definition is applied to certain cities for economic recovery purposes and includes refinancing of existing city debt. The specified city is the principal city in a metropolitan statistical area with high unemployment and population loss between 2000 and 2010. There is a limitation on the amount of bonds that can be designated for economic recovery purposes. The maximum aggregate face amount of bonds designated for economic recovery in a specified city is limited based on the bond limitation allocated by the Secretary. The Secretary allocates bond limitation to specified cities based on their population proportion to $1,000,000,000. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for part III of subchapter Y of chapter 1 of the Code. Extension of recovery zone economic development bonds for certain cities, with amendments applying to obligations issued after the enactment of this Act."
