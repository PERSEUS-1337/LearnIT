The paper introduces a framework for meta-learning approximate probabilistic inference for prediction (ML-PIP) to address the lack of general purpose methods for flexible, data-efficient learning in few-shot learning applications. In this paper, a framework called ML-PIP is developed for meta-learning approximate probabilistic inference for prediction. It extends existing interpretations of meta-learning to cover various methods like gradient-based meta-learning, metric-based meta-learning, amortized MAP inference, and conditional probability modeling. The ML-PIP framework extends meta-learning to include gradient-based, metric-based, amortized MAP inference, and conditional probability modeling methods. It leverages shared statistical structure between tasks, shares information on learning and inference, and enables fast learning for a wide range of tasks. The VERSA method enhances meta-learning by substituting optimization procedures with forward passes through inference networks, resulting in faster test-time performance and eliminating the need for second derivatives during training. It employs a flexible amortization network for few-shot learning datasets. VERSATM enhances meta-learning by using forward passes through inference networks to amortize the cost of inference, leading to faster test-time performance. It employs a flexible amortization network for few-shot learning datasets, outputting a distribution over task-specific parameters in a single pass. The network can handle arbitrary numbers of shots and classes for classification at both train and test time. In evaluations, VERSA achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and performs well in settings where test conditions differ from training, including challenging one-shot view reconstruction tasks. In Section 5, VERSA is evaluated on standard benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results. The framework includes a multi-task probabilistic model and a method for meta-learning probabilistic inference. The model prioritizes discriminative models for predictive performance and leverages shared statistical structure between tasks. The choice of model is guided by two principles: maximizing predictive performance with discriminative models and leveraging shared statistical structure through multi-task learning. A standard multi-task directed graphical model with shared and task-specific parameters is used. The goal is to meta-learn fast and accurate. The joint probability of inputs and outputs for tasks, along with task-specific parameters, is denoted by X (t) and Y (t) for task t. The focus is on meta-learning fast and accurate approximations to the posterior predictive distribution for unseen tasks. The framework for meta-learning approximate inference involves using point estimates for shared parameters and distributional estimates for task-specific parameters. The framework for meta-learning approximate inference involves using point estimates for shared parameters and distributional estimates for task-specific parameters. The probabilistic solution to few-shot learning comprises forming the posterior distribution over task-specific parameters and computing the posterior predictive quickly at test time. The framework for meta-learning approximate inference involves forming the posterior distribution over task-specific parameters and computing the posterior predictive quickly at test time by approximating the distribution with an amortized distribution. The framework approximates the posterior predictive distribution by an amortized distribution q \u03c6 (\u1ef9|D), learned through a feed-forward inference network with parameters \u03c6. This enables quick computation of the predictive distribution over test output \u1ef9 (t) given training dataset D (t) and test input x. Additional approximation steps like Monte Carlo sampling may be needed. The approximate posterior predictive distribution is constructed by amortizing the posterior q \u03c6 (\u03c8|D) using a factorized Gaussian distribution. The training method involves meta-learning for the approximate posterior predictive distribution, enabling fast predictions at test time. Additional approximation steps like Monte Carlo sampling may be necessary. The training method involves meta-learning the approximate posterior predictive distribution, aiming to minimize the KL-divergence between true and approximate distributions. The goal is to find parameters that best approximate the posterior predictive distribution in an average KL sense. The training method aims to minimize the expected KL divergence over tasks by finding parameters that approximate the posterior predictive distribution. Meta-learning supports accurate prediction through approximate inference. The training process involves selecting a task, sampling training data, and forming the distribution. The training method involves selecting a task at random, sampling training data, forming the posterior predictive distribution, and computing the log-density. This process is repeated many times to provide an unbiased estimate of the objective for optimization. The procedure scores the approximate inference by simulating approximate Bayesian held-out log-likelihood evaluation. The training procedure involves forming the posterior predictive distribution and computing the log-density to provide an unbiased estimate for optimization. The objective function focuses on the posterior predictive distribution and minimizes KL(p(\u1ef9|D) q \u03c6 (\u1ef9|D)). The training differs from standard variational inference by directly optimizing the posterior predictive distribution. The training procedure involves optimizing the posterior predictive distribution by minimizing KL(p(\u1ef9|D) q \u03c6 (\u1ef9|D)). The objective function focuses on maximizing predictive performance through end-to-end stochastic training. The training procedure aims to optimize parameters \u03b8 for maximizing predictive performance. An end-to-end stochastic training objective involves feature extraction, instance pooling, regression onto weights, and data distribution sampling tasks. Episodic train/test splits are used at meta-train time, with the integral over \u03c8 approximated using Monte Carlo samples. The local reparametrization trick enables optimization without requiring an explicit prior distribution specification. The approach for Meta-Learning Probabilistic Inference for Prediction (ML-PIP) uses episodic train/test splits at meta-train time and approximates the integral over \u03c8 using Monte Carlo samples. The learning objective does not require an explicit prior distribution specification, learning it implicitly through q \u03c6 (\u03c8|D, \u03b8). This formulation unifies existing approaches and a synthetic data investigation is provided in Section 5.1. The ML-PIP framework unifies existing approaches and supports versatile learning for rapid and flexible inference at test time. The ML-PIP framework enables rapid and flexible inference at test time by supporting various tasks without the need for retraining. It uses deep neural networks for rapid inference but maintains flexibility by allowing for variable input sizes and invariant ordering. Inference is limited to a specific task, discussing design choices for flexibility. Amortization network processes sets of variable size with permutation-invariant operations. VERSA for Few-Shot Image Classification inspired by early work and recent extensions in deep learning. For few-shot image classification, a probabilistic model inspired by early and recent work is used. A shared feature extractor feeds into task-specific linear classifiers. Amortization requires modeling the distribution over weight matrices and biases. Amortization in few-shot image classification involves specifying the approximate posterior to model weight matrices and biases independently for each class, avoiding the need to predefine the number of few-shot classes. This approach simplifies metalearning and reduces the complexity of directly outputting large matrices. Amortization in few-shot image classification involves specifying weight vectors independently for each class, reducing the number of learned parameters by operating directly on extracted features. This approach simplifies metalearning and avoids the need to predefine the number of few-shot classes. The amortization network reduces the number of learned parameters by operating on extracted features for few-shot image classification. It involves specifying weight vectors independently for each class and constructing a classification matrix through feed-forward passes. The classification matrix \u03c8 DISPLAYFORM4 is constructed by performing C feed-forward passes through the inference network q \u03c6 (\u03c8|D, \u03b8). The context independent approximation addresses limitations of naive amortization, supported by theoretical and empirical justification. The context independent approximation in Density Ratio Estimation addresses limitations of naive amortization by reducing the number of parameters needed for inference, allowing for meta-training with different numbers of classes per task, and accommodating varying numbers of classes at test-time. This approach is demonstrated empirically to be effective in Few-Shot Image Reconstruction tasks. VERSATILE Few-Shot Image Reconstruction task involves inferring object appearance from various angles using a generative model similar to GAN or VAE. The model is trained with a small set of observed views to output images with specified orientations. The generative model for the Few-Shot Image Reconstruction task involves using a latent vector as input to produce images at specified orientations. The generator network's parameters are considered global, while the latent inputs are task-specific. A Gaussian likelihood in pixel space is used for image generation. The generator network's parameters are global, while the latent inputs are task-specific. A Gaussian likelihood in pixel space is used for image generation, with a sigmoid activation to ensure output means between zero and one. An amortization network processes image representations and view orientations before instance-pooling to produce a distribution over task-specific parameters. The amortization network processes image representations and view orientations before instance-pooling to produce a distribution over vectors \u03c8 (t). This process unifies various meta-learning approaches and is illustrated in FIG5. ML-PIP unifies various meta-learning approaches, including gradient and metric-based variants, amortized MAP inference, and conditional modeling. It relies on point estimates for task-specific parameters. Comparisons are made with previous approaches like VERSA and gradient-based meta-learning, where task-specific parameters are neural network parameters estimated through gradient ascent. ML-PIP unifies meta-learning approaches using point estimates for task-specific parameters. Semi-amortized inference involves gradient ascent of training loss with shared parameters for initialization and learning rate. Eq. (6) relates to Model-agnostic meta-learning, providing a perspective as semi-amortized ML-PIP. This complements the justification of one-step gradient parameter update in MAML through MAP inference and prior p(\u03c8|\u03b8). VERSATILE (VERSA) is a distributional approach that eliminates the need for back-propagation in gradient-based methods like Model-agnostic meta-learning. It uses predictive KL to train the update choice, which naturally recovers test-train splits. Multiple gradient steps can be input into an RNN to compute \u03c8*, recovering BID44.

It uses predictive KL to train the update choice and enables the treatment of both local and global parameters, simplifying inference. Metric-Based Few-Shot Learning involves task-specific and shared parameters in a neural network. Metric-Based Few-Shot Learning focuses on task-specific and shared parameters in a neural network, using amortized point estimates for the top layer softmax weights and biases. The approach involves predictive distributions and prototypical networks, with VERSA offering a distributional alternative with flexible amortization functions. The BID48 prototypical networks use a Euclidean distance function for embedding space, while VERSA utilizes a distributional approach with flexible amortization functions. BID43 proposed predicting weights of classes from activations for online learning and transfer tasks, demonstrating the use of hyper-networks for amortized learning. The text discusses the use of hyper-networks for amortized learning in the context of transferring from high-shot to low-shot classification tasks. VERSA, a more general approach, supports full multi-task learning by sharing information between tasks. Amortization networks are used for conditional models trained via maximum likelihood. The text discusses training and supporting full multi-task learning by sharing information between tasks using conditional models trained via maximum likelihood. The amortization network computes \u03c8 * (D, \u03b8) and can be viewed as part of the model specification. The ML-PIP training procedure for \u03c6 and \u03b8 is equivalent to training a conditional model via maximum likelihood estimation, establishing a connection to neural processes. Comparing to Variational Inference, amortized VI is used for \u03c8 in multi-task scenarios. The procedure for training \u03c6 and \u03b8 involves a conditional model trained via maximum likelihood estimation, connecting to neural processes. Comparing to Variational Inference, amortized VI is used for \u03c8 in multi-task scenarios, optimizing free-energy w.r.t. \u03c6 and \u03b8. This approach differs from ML-PIP by not using meta train/test splits and including KL for regularization. VERSA shows significant improvement over standard VI in few-shot classification. In Section 5, VERSA improves few-shot classification over standard VI and hybrid VI/meta-learning methods. It is evaluated on various few-shot learning tasks, demonstrating high accuracy across different shot and way variations. In Section 5, VERSA enhances few-shot classification compared to standard VI and hybrid VI/meta-learning methods. It shows high accuracy across different shot and way variations. Additionally, VERSA's performance on a one-shot view reconstruction task with ShapeNet objects is examined in Section 5.3. An experiment is conducted to investigate the approximate inference during training by generating data from a Gaussian distribution with varying means across tasks. In an experiment, data is generated from a Gaussian distribution with varying means across tasks. T = 250 tasks are created with N \u2208 {5, 10} train observations and M = 15 test observations. An inference network q \u03c6 (\u03c8|D) is introduced for amortizing inference. The learnable parameters \u03c6 are trained with an objective function using mini-batches of tasks. Posterior inference is then performed on a separate set of tasks generated from the same process. The model is trained with Adam BID25 using mini-batches of tasks from the generated dataset. Posterior q \u03c6 (\u03c8|D) is inferred with learned amortization parameters. The true posterior over \u03c8 is Gaussian and may be computed analytically. Approximate posterior distributions for unseen test sets are shown. The inference procedure accurately recovers posterior distributions over \u03c8. VERSA is evaluated on standard few-shot classification tasks. VERS follows the implementation in Sections 2 and 3, and the approximate inference scheme in Eq. (5). It is evaluated on standard few-shot classification tasks using Omniglot and miniImageNet datasets. The inference procedure accurately recovers posterior distributions over \u03c8 for unseen test sets. VERS follows the implementation in Sections 2 and 3, and uses an approximate inference scheme. Experimental protocols from previous studies are followed for Omniglot and miniImagenet datasets. Training is done episodically with k c examples per class. Using equivalent architectures, training for miniImagenet is done episodically with k c examples per class.

VERSA achieves a new state-of-the-art results on 5-way -5-shot classification on the miniImageNet benchmark and 20-way -1 shot Omniglot benchmark using a convolution-based network architecture and an end-to-end training procedure. VERS achieves new state-of-the-art results on miniImageNet benchmark for 5-way -5-shot and 20-way -1 shot tasks. VERSA also excels on 5-way -5-shot Omniglot benchmark, adapting only the top-level classifier weights. Performance compared to standard and amortized VI methods. In comparing the performance of VERSA to standard and amortized VI methods, VERSA significantly outperforms amortized VI due to VI's tendency to under-fit, especially with small data points. Non-amortized VI improves performance but is slower in forming the posterior. Using non-amortized VI improves performance substantially, but does not reach the level of VERSA. Forming the posterior is significantly slower as it requires many forward/backward passes through the network. This is similar to MAML, though MAML reduces the number of required iterations by finding good global initializations. VERSA allows varying the number of classes and shots between training and testing. VERSATILITY: VERSA allows for varying the number of classes and shots between training and testing, demonstrating flexibility and robustness. It retains high accuracy even when tested with different conditions, such as handling 100-way conditions with 94% accuracy after being trained for 20-way, 5-shot conditions. VERSATILITY: VERSA shows flexibility and robustness by handling varying test-time conditions with high accuracy. It outperforms MAML in speed, taking only 53.5 seconds compared to 302.9 seconds for 1000 test tasks. For experiments, ShapeNetCore v2 BID5 database is used with 12 object categories, totaling 37,108 objects. Objects are split for training, validation, and testing. Each object has 36 views evaluated by VERSA. The dataset consists of 37,108 objects split into training, validation, and testing sets. Each object has 36 views of size 32 \u00d7 32 pixels evaluated by VERSA. VERSA is compared to a conditional variational autoencoder (C-VAE) using episodic training. FIG10 displays views of unseen objects generated from the test set. The VERSA and C-VAE models were trained on all 12 object classes using a single view for training and the remaining views for evaluation. VERSA generated images with more detail and sharper visuals compared to C-VAE, accurately capturing object orientation. Despite occlusion in the single shot, VERSA was able to impute missing information effectively. VERSATM produces images with more detail and sharper visuals compared to C-VAE. Despite occlusion in the single shot, VERSA can accurately impute missing information. Quantitative comparison results show VERSA's superiority over C-VAE, with improved performance as the number of shots increases. Table 2 shows the view reconstruction test results comparing VERSA and C-VAE. VERSA demonstrates superiority with lower mean squared error (MSE) and higher structural similarity index (SSIM) as the number of shots increases.

The new inference framework in Section 2 is based on Bayesian decision theory, combining information from training data and a loss function for making predictions. The new inference framework in Section 2 is based on Bayesian decision theory (BDT), which provides a recipe for making predictions for an unknown test variable by combining information from training data and a loss function. BDT separates test and training data, making it a natural lens for recent episodic training approaches. The text discusses a derivation of a stochastic variational objective for meta-learning probabilistic inference based on Bayesian decision theory (BDT). It extends BDT to return a full predictive distribution over the unknown test variable instead of a point prediction. The text discusses extending Bayesian decision theory to return a full predictive distribution over the unknown test variable, quantifying the quality of the distribution through a loss function. The optimal predictive distribution is found by optimizing the expected loss within a distributional family, using amortized variational training to make quick predictions at test time. The text discusses optimizing the expected distributional loss within a distributional family to find the optimal predictive distribution. Amortized variational training is used to make quick predictions at test time by learning parameters that minimize average expected loss over tasks. The approximate predictive distribution can directly perform predictions based on any training dataset. The optimal variational parameters are found by minimizing the expected distributional loss across tasks. The predictive distribution can make predictions based on any training dataset by minimizing expected distributional loss. This approach does not require computing the true predictive distribution and emphasizes the meta-learning aspect of the procedure. The procedure involves training data and test data, recovering episodic minibatch training without computing the true predictive distribution. It emphasizes meta-learning and employs log-loss for optimization. The optimal q \u03c6 is the closest to the true predictive distribution in a KL sense. The procedure involves training data and test data, recovering episodic minibatch training without computing the true predictive distribution. It emphasizes meta-learning and employs log-loss for optimization. The optimal q \u03c6 is the closest to the true predictive distribution in a KL sense. In this case, DISPLAYFORM3 where KL[p(y) q(y)] is the KL-divergence, and H [p(y)] is the entropy of p. Eq. (A.4) has the elegant property that the optimal q \u03c6 is the closest member of Q (in a KL sense) to the true predictive p(\u1ef9|D), which is unsurprising as the log-loss is a proper scoring rule BID20. This is reminiscent of the sleep phase in the wake-sleep algorithm BID19. Exploration of alternative proper scoring rules BID7 and more task-specific losses BID31) is left for future work. Specification of the approximate predictive distribution. Next, we consider the form of q \u03c6. Motivated by the optimal predictive distribution, we replace the true posterior by an approximation: DISPLAYFORM4 In this section we lay out both theoretical and. In this section, theoretical and empirical justifications are provided for the context-independent approximation detailed in Section 3. The approximation is justified through density ratio estimation, denoting the conditional density of each class as p(x|y = c) and assuming equal a priori class probability. Density ratio theory shows that the optimal softmax classifier can be expressed using Bayes' theorem. Through density ratio estimation, the optimal softmax classifier can be expressed in terms of conditional densities for each class. The classifier constructs estimators independently for each class, similar to training a naive Bayes classifier. This optimal form is mirrored in VERSA using a specific formula. The optimal softmax classifier constructs estimators independently for each class, similar to training a naive Bayes classifier. VERSA mirrors this using a specific formula where weights are context-independent. An experiment is detailed to evaluate this assumption without imposing it on the amortization network. The experiment aims to test if weights can be context-independent in a 5-way classification task by performing free-form variational inference on randomly generated tasks without imposing the assumption on the amortization network. In a 5-way classification task on the MNIST dataset, weights for each task are inferred using a Gaussian variational distribution. The model achieves 99% accuracy on test examples after training episodically on fifty randomly sampled tasks. After training episodically on fifty randomly sampled tasks for a 5-way classification experiment on the MNIST dataset, the model achieves 99% accuracy on test examples. The optimized weights cluster according to class in a 2-dimensional space, with some overlap between classes and occasional outliers. The optimized weights cluster according to class in a 2-dimensional space, with some overlap between classes and occasional outliers. For tasks containing both class '1' and '2', class '2' weights are located away from their cluster, suggesting that class-weights are typically independent of the task. The model assigns class weights independently of the task, but may 'move' weights to different regions if lacking capacity. A VI-based objective is derived for the probabilistic model, with \"amortized\" VI using a fixed-sized neural network parameterization. Non-amortized VI involves optimizing local parameters independently for each new task. The derivation of the objective function remains unchanged. The objective function for the probabilistic model is derived using variational inference (VI), with \"amortized\" VI utilizing a fixed-sized neural network parameterization. In contrast, \"non-amortized\" VI optimizes local parameters independently for each new task. The derivation of the objective function remains consistent between these approaches. In this section, comprehensive details on few-shot classification experiments are provided. The Omniglot BID32 dataset consists of 1623 handwritten characters from 50 alphabets, each with 20 instances. The objective function in Eq. (C.2) differs from Eq. (4) in two key ways: it lacks a KL term for q \u03c6 (\u03c8|D (t) , \u03b8) and does not distinguish between training and test data within a task. The few-shot classification experiments on the Omniglot BID32 dataset involve 1623 handwritten characters from 50 alphabets, each with 20 instances. The images are resized to 28 \u00d7 28 pixels and augmented with rotations of 90 degrees.
