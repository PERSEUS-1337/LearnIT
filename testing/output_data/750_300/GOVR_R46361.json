    "content": "This report provides an overview of the FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 116-93) and summarizes the budgetary and strategic context within which it was debated. It also covers the act's treatment of major components of the Trump Administration's budget request, including selected weapons acquisition programs and other provisions. The Trump Administration requested $750.0 billion in discretionary budget authority for FY2020. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act summarized the Trump Administration's budget request of $750.0 billion for national defense activities, with $718.3 billion allocated for the Department of Defense. $689.5 billion of the DOD budget fell within the scope of the annual defense appropriations bill. The FY2020 defense bill includes $1.1 billion for certain intelligence community expenses, but does not cover military construction, family housing, or TRICARE for Life program funding. The FY2020 defense bill does not include funding for military construction, family housing, or the TRICARE for Life program. The Defense Appropriations Act provides $687.8 billion for DOD, which is $2.86 billion less than President Trump requested for FY 2020. The FY2020 Defense Appropriations Act provides $687.8 billion for DOD, $2.86 billion less than President Trump requested. DOD has organized its budget requests post-9/11 to designate funding for activities related to the aftermath of the attacks or distinct from regular costs for U.S. armed forces. Non-base budget funds have been designated for Overseas Contingency Operations since 2009. Since 2009, non-base budget funds for DOD have been designated for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). The Budget Control Act of 2011 set annual caps on defense spending, but OCO funds are exempt from these caps. This designation has gained significance, with OCO or emergency requirement funds being exempt from spending caps. The President and Congress designate non-base budget funds for DOD as OCO or for emergency requirements, exempt from spending caps. In FY2020, defense spending cap was $576.2 billion, with an additional $97.9 billion designated as OCO funding to avoid exceeding the cap. Armed Services and Appropriations Committees treated \"OCO for base\" funds accordingly. In FY2020, $97.9 billion was designated as OCO funding to avoid exceeding the defense spending cap. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised the cap to $666.5 billion. Separate versions of the FY2020 defense appropriations bill were reported by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The defense spending cap for FY2020 was set at $666.5 billion. The House and Senate each reported separate versions of the defense appropriations bill. A compromise version was agreed upon by House and Senate negotiators and incorporated into another bill, H.R. 1158, which was passed by both chambers. In 2019, the Senate did not act on the defense bill. A compromise version was agreed upon by House and Senate negotiators and included in H.R. 1158, which was passed by both chambers. The President's FY2020 budget request for DOD reflects a strategic shift based on the 2018 National Defense Strategy, emphasizing increased investment to counter threats from China and Russia. The President's FY2020 budget request for DOD reflects a strategic shift based on the 2018 National Defense Strategy, emphasizing increased investment to counter threats from China and Russia, marking a change from past national security policies focused on strategic competition with the Soviet Union. The U.S. national security policy shifted from focusing on containing communism during the Cold War to dealing with regional aggressors and countering terrorism post-9/11. The U.S. national security policy shifted post-9/11 to focus on countering terrorism and regional aggressors like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. Military superiority over adversaries allowed for counter-terrorism operations in permissive environments. The 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea highlighted the need to recalibrate relations with China and Russia. The 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea and China's militarization of islands in the South China Sea raised concerns about aggressive regimes in Moscow and Beijing, emphasizing the importance of national security in the U.S. agenda. China's militarization of islands in the South China Sea underscores the U.S. national security agenda's focus on competing with great powers and addressing ongoing threats like fragile states, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation. Adversaries may be collaborating to achieve shared objectives. The challenges that emerged at the end of the Cold War, such as fragile states, genocide, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation, continue to pose serious threats to U.S. interests. Adversaries are collaborating to achieve common goals and using social and economic tools to advance their agendas. States are also working with non-state proxies, blurring the lines between conventional and irregular conflict. Managing these complex security issues is a significant challenge. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy focus on great power competition with China and Russia, blurring lines between civilian and military activities. Managing these complex security issues is challenging in the current environment. The January 2018 National Defense Strategy shifts U.S. national security focus to great power competition with China and Russia, emphasizing the need to enhance the competitive advantage of U.S. forces. It also highlights the erosion of this advantage in recent years and the necessity for U.S. forces to adapt to new military objectives. The National Defense Strategy acknowledges the erosion of U.S. military advantage against Chinese and Russian threats. U.S. forces now face vigorous contestation in approaching military objectives. The strategy identifies China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and global terrorist groups as significant threats to U.S. interests. The NDS emphasizes the importance of retaining the U.S. strategic competitive edge. The National Defense Strategy identifies China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, and global terrorist groups as significant threats to U.S. interests. The strategy prioritizes maintaining a strategic competitive edge against China and Russia over countering violent extremist organizations, known as the \"2+3\" strategy. The \"2+3\" strategy aims to counter two primary challenges (China and Russia) and three additional challenges (North Korea, Iran, and terrorist groups). Federal spending has increased significantly over the past four decades, with mandatory spending on entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid growing the fastest. Congressional budgeting has been influenced by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which aimed to control federal spending. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to control federal spending by establishing annual limits to reduce discretionary federal spending through FY2021 by $1.0 trillion, with sequestration as enforcement. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set annual limits to reduce discretionary federal spending by $1.0 trillion through FY2021. Sequestration enforces automatic cancellation of previous appropriations to meet the spending caps. Defense-related spending is subject to the caps, except for emergency or OCO funding. Congress has passed legislation to raise the spending caps. The national defense budget function, designated as budget function 050, is subject to annual spending caps set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. However, Congress and the president can designate emergency or Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding that is exempt from these caps. Despite efforts to raise the spending caps, the national defense spending cap for FY2020 remained at $576 billion, $71 billion lower than the revised cap for FY2019. To avoid a significant reduction in defense spending, the Administration's FY2020 base budget request adhered to the binding defense cap, while also including $165 billion designated as OCO. The Administration's FY2020 base budget request adhered to the defense cap, with $165 billion designated as OCO funding. The House and Senate Committees considered all funding for base budget purposes. P.L. 116-93 funds a modest increase in active-duty military personnel. P.L. 116-93 funds the Administration's proposal for a modest increase in active-duty military personnel, including a reduction of 7,500 in the end-strength of the Army and the Selected Reserve. The reduction was based on the Army's failure to meet higher end-strength goals in FY2018. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) funds a 3.1% increase in military basic pay starting January 1, 2020. It also appropriates $61.7 million for DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) and $35.0 million for the Special Victims' Counsel (SVC) program. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) includes funding for a 3.1% increase in military basic pay starting January 1, 2020. It also appropriates $61.7 million for DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) and $35.0 million for the Special Victims' Counsel (SVC) program. Additionally, the act provides $3.0 million for a pilot program for treating military personnel with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder related to sexual trauma, authorized by Section 702 of the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act. Furthermore, P.L. 116-93 adds $110 million to the $1.1 billion requested for DOD's childcare program. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) includes funding for a 3.1% increase in military basic pay starting January 1, 2020. It also appropriates $61.7 million for DOD's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) and $35.0 million for the Special Victims' Counsel (SVC) program. Additionally, the act provides $3.0 million for a pilot program for treating military personnel with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder related to sexual trauma, authorized by Section 702 of the FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act. P.L. 116-93 added $110 million to the $1.1 billion requested for DOD's childcare program, the largest employer-sponsored childcare program in the United States. The FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-93) includes provisions for military pay increase, funding for DOD's childcare program, and support for modernization of nuclear and long-range strike weapons. The act requires a detailed report on DOD's childcare system and prioritized list of construction requirements. The Trump Administration's budget prioritizes the modernization of the nuclear triad. The Trump Administration's FY2020 budget request prioritizes the modernization of nuclear and long-range strike weapons, specifically focusing on the nuclear triad: ballistic missile-launching submarines, long-range bombers, and land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). P.L. 116-93 supports the development of hypersonic long-range missiles with conventional warheads for accurate strikes on distant targets. The Administration is developing hypersonic long-range missiles that can travel at speeds five times the speed of sound and strike distant targets with conventional warheads. This effort is a response to reports of China and Russia also developing similar weapons, leading the Department of Defense to prioritize hypersonic weapons in its FY2019 budget request. The Department of Defense (DOD) has prioritized hypersonic weapons development in response to China and Russia's advancements in this technology. Funding has been secured from Congress to accelerate the U.S. hypersonic program, with additional support for defenses against hypersonic missiles in the enacted FY2020 defense appropriations bill. These weapons are challenging to detect and intercept due to their low altitude and high speed. The enacted FY2020 defense appropriations bill included funding for hypersonic weapons development, with additional support for defenses against hypersonic missiles. The bill also allocated $100 million to establish a Joint Hypersonics Transition Office to coordinate R&D programs. House and Senate negotiators expressed concerns about potential duplication of efforts in hypersonic weapons development. The FY2020 defense bill funded hypersonic weapons development and allocated $100 million for a Joint Hypersonics Transition Office to coordinate R&D programs. House and Senate negotiators expressed concerns about duplication of efforts in hypersonic weapons development. P.L. 116-93 supported strengthening defenses against ballistic missile attacks, reflecting recommendations from the Administration's Missile Defense Review. The missile defense budget request for FY2020 aimed to defend against ICBMs and shorter-range missiles targeting U.S. territory or allied countries. Changes in funding allocation were made in response to the cancellation of the Replacement Kill Vehicle development effort in August 2019. The FY2020 missile defense budget aims to defend U.S. territory against ICBMs. The bill reallocates funds from the cancelled RKV program to develop an improved interceptor missile, provide additional GBI missiles and support equipment, and fund R&D to enhance GBI reliability. Total funding provided is $515.0 million under P.L. 116-93. The FY2020 budget allocates $515.0 million for developing an improved interceptor missile to replace the GBI. Additionally, $285 million is provided for more GBI missiles and support equipment, and $180 million for R&D to enhance GBI reliability. Congress also approved $40.0 million for the operation of the newly created Space Force. Congress approved $40.0 million for the operation of the newly created Space Force, which was less than the requested $72.4 million. The Explanatory Statement criticized DOD for insufficient justification for the budget request and directed the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a monthly spending plan for FY2020 Space Force funding. The act also supported the Army's plan to upgrade its ground-combat vehicles. The act directed the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a monthly spending plan for FY2020 Space Force O&M funding and supported the Army's plan to upgrade its ground-combat vehicles. One notable change was the provision of 30% more funding than requested to enhance the firepower of the Stryker troop-carrier by replacing its .50 caliber machine gun with a 30 mm cannon. The Army plans to upgrade its ground-combat vehicles by replacing the .50 caliber machine gun with a 30 mm cannon, reallocating funds from older programs to support the development of new systems. This decision reflects a mixed message regarding congressional support for the Army's strategy. The Army plans to truncate older upgrade programs for existing systems to free up funds for new system development. This includes halting planned upgrades to legacy systems like Bradley fighting vehicles and CH-47 Chinook helicopters. The enacted bill provides one-third less funding than requested for Bradley upgrades, with $223.0 million cut labeled as \"excess to need.\" The enacted appropriations bill provides significantly less funding than requested for Bradley upgrades, with $223.0 million cut as \"excess to need.\" However, the bill allocates nearly triple the amount requested for Chinook upgrades, appropriating $46.2 million instead of $18.2 million. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees had challenged the Army's plan to truncate older upgrade programs for new system development. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees challenged the Army's plan to forego upgrades to the existing CH-47 fleet. The enacted appropriations bill provided $205.6 million for the Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle program out of the $378.4 million requested. The Army's Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle program received $205.6 million out of the $378.4 million requested. The program faced criticism for being too ambitious, leading to its cancellation and restart with new design parameters under P.L. 116-93. This law generally supports the budget request for major aviation programs across all armed forces. The Army's Optionally-Manned Fighting Vehicle program faced criticism for being too ambitious, leading to its cancellation and restart with new design parameters under P.L. 116-93. Congress supports the budget request for major aviation programs, but there may be future disagreements over the planned upgrade of the CH-47 Chinook helicopter. This program is one of several the Army wants to curtail to fund its modernization strategy announced in late 2019. The Army plans to curtail the procurement of improved \"Block II\" CH-47s to free up funds for its modernization strategy. The FY2020 request for the program was reduced from $46.4 million to $18.2 million, but the enacted defense bill provided $46.2 million for the program. The FY2020 defense bill allocated $46.2 million for the program, which was reduced from the Army's planned procurement of $18.2 million. The bill also provided $985.5 million for eight F-15s to address the gap in Air Force fighter strength due to delays in the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter fielding. Some funds were shifted to the Air Force's Research and Development account for testing purposes. The FY2020 defense bill allocated funds for the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter program and shifted funds for two aircraft and design efforts to the Air Force's Research and Development account. The bill also supported elements of the Navy's shipbuilding budget request to increase the fleet size to 355 ships. The FY2020 defense bill allocated funds for the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter program and supported the Navy's shipbuilding budget request to increase the fleet size to 355 ships. P.L. 116-93 also includes funds for unmanned surface and subsurface ships to expand the force, but denied $3.2 billion for one Virginia-class submarine. The FY2020 defense bill allocated funds for the F-35A Joint Strike Fighter program and supported the Navy's shipbuilding budget request to increase the fleet size to 355 ships. It also included funds for unmanned surface and subsurface ships to expand the force. However, it denied $3.2 billion for one Virginia-class submarine, reallocating $1.4 billion to the other two submarines to incorporate the Virginia Payload Module for additional missile storage and launch capabilities. The FY2020 defense bill allocated $1.2 billion for specialized ships and a landing craft to support Marine Corps amphibious landings, including the Virginia Payload Module for additional missile storage and launch capabilities.
