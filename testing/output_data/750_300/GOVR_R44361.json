    "content": "The Obama Administration pursued the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement negotiations as part of its Asia-Pacific strategy. The agreement was concluded in late 2015 and signed in February 2016. The TPP aims to liberalize trade and investment among its 12 members, with implications for U.S. relations in the region. Congress played an active role in the negotiations through oversight and consultations. The TPP aims to establish rules governing trade and investment among its 12 members, with implications for U.S. relations in the region. Congress had an active role in the negotiations, and implementing legislation would be required for the agreement to take effect in the United States. The potential impacts of the TPP are expected to be debated during the second session of the 114th Congress. The TPP could take effect in the United States, with potential impacts being debated in Congress. Proponents, like U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman, emphasize the agreement's strategic significance beyond just economic benefits. Arguments about the TPP's strategic importance revolve around using it as a tool to exert influence in the region and beyond, encompassing both economic and broader political and security aspects. Arguments about the TPP's strategic importance revolve around using it as a tool to exert influence in the region and beyond, encompassing economic, political, and security aspects. Through the TPP, the United States aims to strengthen alliances, maintain leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, enhance national security, liberalize trade, drive economic growth, and establish a strong trade architecture. The TPP aims to strengthen alliances, maintain U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, enhance national security, liberalize trade, drive economic growth, and establish trade rules consistent with U.S. interests. China's economic rise and trade initiatives are important factors in the region. China's economic rise and trade initiatives in the region are seen as attempts to minimize U.S. presence and power, impacting the strategic aspects of the TPP negotiations. China's investment initiatives in the region are viewed as an attempt to create a regional order that reduces U.S. influence. The TPP is seen as a way to maintain U.S. leadership in Asia and establish trade norms with China in mind. Some argue that framing the TPP as a counter to Chinese initiatives could be counterproductive and create negative perceptions of U.S. intentions. Some argue that framing the TPP as a counter to Chinese initiatives could create negative perceptions of U.S. intentions in the region. U.S. and Chinese goals for trade liberalization may be mutually reinforcing rather than competing, creating a tension in balancing policy priorities. Trade agreements involve economic and political elements, leading to challenges for policymakers supporting the TPP on some grounds but not others. The TPP involves domestic and foreign policy with economic and political elements, creating tension for policymakers balancing various priorities. Opponents argue that focusing on strategic aspects distracts from the agreement's potential impact on the U.S. economy. Supporters emphasize strategic implications, which are challenging to quantify despite their significance. The report examines strategic arguments presented by the Administration, TPP proponents, and opponents, focusing on the Asia-Pacific region and implications for Asia. It highlights the challenges in quantifying the broader strategic implications of the TPP despite their potential significance. The report focuses on the Asia-Pacific region and implications for Asia, highlighting strategic issues for Congress to consider regarding the TPP agreement. It discusses the historical context of U.S. trade agreements and institutions like FTAs, emphasizing political solidarity over economic value in past agreements. The United States signed its first FTA with Israel in 1985, with political solidarity weighing more heavily than economic value. FTAs with Bahrain, Morocco, and Oman in the 2000s were seen as based on security and foreign policy objectives, particularly in combating terrorism. The first U.S. FTA in Asia with Singapore in 2004 aimed at liberalizing trade and strengthening security partnerships. Obama Administration officials and TPP proponents argue that U.S. trade initiatives in Asia, like the TPP, have significant geostrategic importance. The TPP, signed in 2004 with Singapore, a key U.S. security partner, is seen as crucial for U.S. trade policy in Asia. The Obama Administration emphasizes the geostrategic importance of initiatives like the TPP in shaping the global economic order to reflect U.S. interests and values. The TPP is crucial for U.S. trade policy in Asia and is seen as a test of U.S. credibility as a regional leader. The Obama Administration's signature economic initiative in the Asia-Pacific region, the TPP aims to set new rules of the road and promote inclusive development. Failure to approve the agreement could weaken the U.S. rebalancing strategy and portray the United States as divided on its priorities. The TPP is the Administration's key economic initiative in the Asia-Pacific region. Failure to approve the agreement could weaken the U.S. rebalancing strategy and show division on its priorities. Administration officials argue that the agreement signals active integration into Asia's economic and diplomatic structures. The TPP is seen as a key economic initiative in the Asia-Pacific region, with U.S. officials arguing that it signifies active integration into the region's economic and diplomatic structures. The economic benefits of the agreement are highlighted, along with the strategic significance of deepening links across the Pacific. In May 2015, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong emphasized the strategic importance of the TPP, stating that its completion would strengthen ties across the Pacific. Proponents believe that the TPP is crucial for developing regional institutions and promoting cooperation. The TPP is seen as vital for developing regional institutions and promoting cooperation, with a focus on strengthening international rules and norms for trade and growth. The Administration argues that the TPP is essential for advancing global prosperity and aligns with broader diplomatic and security interests. The TPP is crucial for promoting global prosperity and strengthening international rules for trade and growth. Proponents argue that the agreement will reinforce U.S. alliances and partnerships in East Asia, with Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter emphasizing its importance by comparing it to another aircraft carrier. However, specific ways in which TPP would enhance U.S. security are not clearly outlined by supporters. Some proponents argue that the TPP will strengthen U.S. alliances in East Asia, but critics believe that security partnerships depend more on countries' assessment of their interests rather than trade agreements. For example, the impact of the South Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement on security relationships is unclear. The impact of trade agreements on security partnerships in East Asia is debated, with some arguing that alliances depend more on countries' security interests rather than trade deals. The effectiveness of the South Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement in altering fundamental interests in the region is questioned. The strength of alliances like the U.S.-South Korea alliance is likely determined by factors such as perceived threats from China or North Korea, rather than the presence of trade agreements. The short-term strength of the U.S.-South Korea alliance is likely determined by their perception of threats from China or North Korea, rather than the presence of the KORUS FTA. The future of the U.S.-Japan alliance is driven by Japan's own strategic calculations, with the TPP potentially impacting countries with less close relationships with the U.S. Successful TPP negotiations could support reform-oriented efforts in countries like Vietnam. In Vietnam, successful TPP negotiations could lead to deeper market-oriented institutional changes and closer ties with the United States. Approval of the agreement would signal a welcoming of more normal relations with the country. Some Vietnamese leaders support TPP approval as a sign of closer ties with the United States. Failure to approve could impact Vietnam's perception of the U.S. as a reliable partner. TPP proponents believe it will help promote a global order reflecting U.S. interests and values. The TPP agreement is seen as a way to promote a global order reflecting US interests and values, including a rules-based trading system. The link between TPP's trade rules and security relationships is less clear, but it may alter countries' strategic interests. Implementing the TPP could strengthen the United States' Pacific presence and signal to other countries the region's importance to U.S. policymakers. Implementing the TPP could signal the importance of the Pacific Rim to U.S. policymakers, impacting the region's perception of U.S. leadership and commitment. The U.S. faces challenges in asserting leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, with concerns about credibility and China's growing influence. Failure to implement the TPP could lead to an influence vacuum filled by China, impacting relationships with key allies like Japan. The rejection of the TPP agreement by Congress could lead to a loss of trust and cooperation in relationships, impacting U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific region and global trade efforts. The rejection of the TPP agreement by Congress could lead to a loss of trust and cooperation in relationships, impacting U.S. influence in the Asia-Pacific region and global trade efforts. The TPP may have implications for U.S. influence on regional and global trade and investment, with proponents arguing that the rules established will promote economic growth and advance U.S. interests. The TPP aims to promote economic reforms among current members, create incentives for other Asia-Pacific nations to join, address trade barriers through new rules, and update existing trade rules. The U.S. goal in the TPP is to update the rules-based trading system. The U.S. aims to update trade rules through multilateral negotiations at the WTO or FTAs, focusing on expanding economic engagement and liberalizing barriers. The United States led trade liberalization negotiations under GATT, establishing international trade rules that evolved into the WTO. The current WTO Doha Round has stalled due to member differences, while global commerce has adapted to technological advances. The WTO Doha Development Agenda (Doha Round) has stalled due to member differences since 2001. Global commerce has evolved with technology, leading to gaps in current trade rules. Some countries, like the United States, are pursuing new trade agreements like the TPP to address digital trade and state-owned enterprises. The TPP is a trade agreement pursued by countries like the United States to create a significant bloc of nations with broad disciplines. The 12 TPP economies account for 37% of global GDP and offer market access to new countries willing to adhere to its provisions. The TPP's economic significance could grow as members negotiate an agreement open to new countries. It could provide incentives for domestic reform and promote U.S. goals like worker rights and environmental protection. The TPP could promote U.S. goals such as worker rights and environmental protection, while also drawing interest from other countries to avoid competitive disadvantages. Japan's involvement in TPP negotiations is seen as a response to the U.S. FTA with South Korea. The TPP's rules could drive further trade liberalization in the region, but some experts note that it does not include key Asian economies like China and India. The influence of TPP's trade rules may depend on future membership expansion. If ratified and implemented, the TPP may not establish comprehensive trade and investment rules in the Asia-Pacific. Some experts suggest that the impact of TPP's rules could rely on future membership expansion, with countries like Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand showing interest in joining. Taiwan has also expressed interest, but domestic opposition in many Asian nations and current TPP members remains a challenge. The TPP agreement may expand its influence, with Taiwan and other countries expressing interest in membership. Some Asian nations and current TPP parties face domestic opposition to joining. Analysts suggest that countries like South Korea and Colombia are likely to seek entry in the near future. Proponents argue that mega-regionals like TPP and T-TIP could have significant economic implications. Taiwan and other countries are interested in joining the TPP, with South Korea and Colombia likely to seek entry soon. Proponents believe mega-regionals like TPP and T-TIP could impact global trade negotiations, while critics fear they may hinder multilateral efforts. Existing WTO commitments and new trade barriers could form the basis for future negotiations, potentially on a plurilateral basis. Critics argue that bilateral and regional trade talks may divert resources from multilateral initiatives, potentially undermining the WTO's legitimacy and role in trade liberalization. Mega-regionals could complicate the trading system with overlapping rules. The WTO's legitimacy and role in trade liberalization could be undermined by bilateral and regional trade talks, potentially leading to overlapping rules and complicating the trading system. TPP negotiations are just one of many ongoing trade negotiations in the Asia-Pacific region, with differing structures and aims. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a significant trade negotiation in the Asia-Pacific region, involving 10 ASEAN members and six other nations in a collective Free Trade Agreement (FTA). The United States is not part of RCEP negotiations and has not shown interest in joining. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) involves 10 ASEAN members and six other nations in a collective FTA. The United States is not part of RCEP negotiations and has not shown interest in joining. RCEP's final provisions are still being determined, but a comparison with ASEAN trade agreements and the finalized TPP indicates potential differences. ASEAN trade agreements have been less comprehensive in trade liberalization than the proposed TPP, with fewer intellectual property rights, investment, and labor and environmental provisions. The RCEP is seen as less comprehensive in trade liberalization compared to the TPP, with fewer provisions on intellectual property rights, investment, labor, and the environment. Some believe RCEP could challenge U.S. trade rules set by the TPP, while others see both agreements as complementary for regional economic growth. Seven countries are part of both RCEP and the TPP. The RCEP presents an alternative to U.S. efforts through the TPP, with some believing both agreements can be complementary for economic growth. Seven countries are in both RCEP and the TPP, aiming for compatibility and synergy. The impact of these regional undertakings on existing trade architecture remains uncertain, depending on their timing. The TPP is at a more advanced stage than RCEP, with negotiations concluded. A delay in TPP ratification could alter the sequencing of the two agreements. All 12 TPP countries and 11 RCEP countries are also members of APEC, a forum for dialogue on open and free trade within the region. The 11 RCEP countries, along with the 12 TPP countries, are members of APEC, a forum for dialogue on open and free trade within the region. APEC members have discussed the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) since 2006, which both China and the United States support. China's role in the TPP and broader U.S. policy in Asia has been significant due to its status as the world's second-largest economy and largest trading nation. In 2014, APEC leaders recognized TPP and RCEP as pathways to FTAAP. China's inclusion in TPP may impact the US and Asia-Pacific region. Some argue China aims to reduce US influence in the region. President Obama and TPP proponents argue that completing the proposed TPP is strategically important due to China's growing international influence. Analysts suggest that China is trying to minimize US presence and power in the region, creating a different vision of economic development. The TPP is seen as a necessary means of countering China's efforts. The proposed TPP is seen as a way for the United States to shape regional economic development in line with its interests, countering China's influence. President Obama emphasized the importance of the TPP in influencing China's economic and diplomatic decisions. The TPP is important for influencing China's economic and diplomatic decisions in favor of U.S. interests. President Obama highlighted the need for enforceable labor and environmental standards, IP protections, and market access to encourage China to align with international norms. If the TPP is completed, it could prompt China to align with international norms by reducing tariffs and granting access to foreign firms. This could also provide political cover for reformers in China to push for deeper economic reforms. However, some argue that portraying China as an outlier in regional economic development may overstate its influence on trade and investment rules. Some argue that portraying China as an outlier in regional economic development may overstate its influence on trade and investment rules in Asia. They stress that China's economic initiatives could benefit the region's infrastructure and investment needs, potentially leading countries to favor the United States. China is proceeding with economic initiatives in Asia that could benefit the region's infrastructure and investment needs. Other Asian nations have their own trade policies and are unlikely to adopt policies they see as not in their interest. China's leaders are striving to continue the transformation. China's leaders are focused on regional development, emphasizing the importance of a strong economy, defense, and global role. They are implementing policies to strengthen the economy and increase China's global economic influence, including plans for a land-based Silk Road. The Chinese government is pursuing policies to strengthen its economy and increase global economic influence through initiatives like the \"One Belt, One Road\" project, which aims to create new trade linkages. This includes the establishment of new financial institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund to provide capital for infrastructure development. China is aiming to boost economic development and integration in Asia through initiatives like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund. They are also working to increase the use of the renminbi overseas to support Chinese assistance programs and enhance their global economic standing. China aims to simplify transactions for Chinese financial institutions, reduce commercial risk for companies in international trade, and enhance global economic stature through initiatives like the RCEP. Chinese leaders also seek to reform multilateral institutions to reflect current geopolitical situations. China aims to reform existing multilateral institutions like the United Nations, IMF, and World Bank to reflect current geopolitical situations. The establishment of the AIIB is part of China's efforts to offer an alternative model for multilateral development banks. It is unclear if the AIIB will be distinct from or in line with existing international institutions. China's efforts to reshape economic institutions like the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and create new ones, such as the AIIB, are part of its broader strategy to reduce U.S. influence. In the diplomatic and security spheres, China is also attempting to refashion groups like the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) to counter the U.S. China is reshaping the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) to create a new Asian security system to counter the U.S. alliance network. China's reclamation activities in the South China Sea are seen as a way to challenge U.S. naval power in the region. China's stance on the TPP has evolved as more countries joined the negotiations. China's views on the TPP have changed over time, initially seen as a U.S.-dominated process aimed at isolating China. However, U.S. officials have stated that the TPP is not meant to contain or disadvantage China, and they hope China will eventually join the agreement. China's criticisms of the U.S. role in the TPP process have softened, with Chinese officials expressing a desire for China to be included in the agreement. China's criticisms of the U.S. role in the TPP process have softened, with Chinese officials expressing a desire for China to be included in the agreement. China's Vice Finance Minister and Premier have both indicated openness to negotiations on the TPP, stating that various FTA arrangements can foster a just and free international trade order. U.S. officials have welcomed China to join the TPP, although Chinese officials have raised concerns about implementing some of the agreement's standards and provisions. President Obama mentioned in June 2015 that China has shown interest in joining the TPP, despite concerns about implementing certain standards. The U.S. aims to integrate China more deeply into liberalizing trade and establishing new rules not covered by the WTO. The United States aims to integrate China more fully into liberalizing trade and establishing new trade rules, including through a potential bilateral investment treaty. This could subject China to higher-standard rules and discourage attempts to weaken existing trade rules. The United States is negotiating a bilateral investment treaty with China to boost investment flows and potential participation in TPP. Congress approved legislation in 2015 to renew Trade Promotion Authority for trade negotiations. Congress approved legislation in 2015 to renew U.S. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for trade negotiations, including the expedited consideration of implementing legislation for U.S. trade agreements. As Congress evaluates the TPP agreement, key issues to consider include its role in promoting international rules and norms in the Asia-Pacific region. TPP proponents argue that the agreement is part of a broader foreign policy strategy to promote respect for international rules and norms in the Asia-Pacific region. Approval could further U.S. diplomatic and security goals beyond trade, reinforcing U.S. leadership in the region and encouraging economic and political reform. The TPP proponents argue that accepting the rules and disciplines of the agreement will reinforce U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, encourage economic and political reform, and promote a U.S.-supportive foreign policy outlook among nations. Congress should carefully consider these strategic arguments and weigh the potential implications of the TPP. The TPP proponents argue that accepting the rules and disciplines of the agreement will reinforce U.S. leadership in the Asia-Pacific region and promote a U.S.-supportive foreign policy outlook among nations. Congress may weigh trade-offs among the agreement's potential implications, including its strategic benefits and economic impact. The potential strategic benefits of the TPP agreement depend on driving economic growth and prosperity. Some argue that the TPP's impact hinges on membership expansion, while others see it as a way for the US to pursue trade policy goals in the region. The proposed TPP, established by like-minded countries, offers the United States the best opportunity to pursue trade policy goals currently unattainable in the WTO. The agreement's strategic value depends on attracting a broader group of nations to join, striking a balance between trade liberalization and U.S. economic interests. Implications of Failed Ratification: Congress needs to consider the impact of not ratifying the TPP on U.S. leadership in the region. Delays or rejection could set back goals and lead to other countries forming their own trade agreements. The failure to ratify the TPP could impact U.S. leadership in the region, potentially leading to other countries forming their own trade agreements. This could affect foreign governments' views on U.S. credibility and influence in the Asia-Pacific region. The TPP's 12 participating countries do not include some strategically important countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Observers suggest the U.S. should expand economic engagement beyond TPP membership to avoid neglecting other countries. Congress should consider if current economic initiatives in Asia are enough to enhance U.S. influence in the region. Congress may need to assess if current U.S. economic initiatives in Asia are adequate for expanding influence in the region or if additional initiatives targeting specific nations or multilateral groups are necessary. There is also a consideration of whether the TPP should include countries outside the region and how \"mega-regional\" negotiations could impact the multilateral trading system. Analysts have mixed views on how \"mega-regional\" negotiations like the TPP may affect the multilateral trading system. Some see it as an opportunity for the US to establish new trade rules, while others fear it may undermine the WTO and harm countries not involved in the talks. Congress should consider if the TPP will promote global trade liberalization or lead to more fragmentation in the global trading system. The TPP may undermine the WTO and impact countries not part of the negotiations. Congress should assess if the TPP will support global trade liberalization or lead to further fragmentation in the trading system. Consideration should be given to seeking new global trade initiatives to ensure the TPP either boosts global momentum or addresses concerns of shifting trade discussions away from the WTO."
