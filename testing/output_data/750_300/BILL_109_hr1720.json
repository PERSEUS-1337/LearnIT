    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Raw Sewage Overflow Community Right-to-Know Act\" and includes findings related to the issue. Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States each year due to inadequately treated sewage, leading to various illnesses such as gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and respiratory diseases. Millions of Americans become sick as a result. Between 1.8 to 3.5 million Americans get sick annually from swimming in contaminated waters, leading to various illnesses such as gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and respiratory diseases. The economic losses due to swimming-related illnesses are estimated at $28 billion annually in the United States. Many sewer systems do not routinely monitor to detect contamination. Public health authorities are not routinely notified of sewer overflows that threaten public health, leading to economic losses of $2 billion annually in the United States. Better monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sewer overflows could prevent millions of Americans from getting sick each year. The curr_chunk is a section header \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" and the prev_chunk discusses the lack of notification of sewer overflows, leading to economic losses and public health risks. The term 'sanitary sewer overflow' is defined as an overflow, spill, release, or diversion of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups into buildings caused by blockages. The term 'sanitary sewer overflow' excludes combined sewer system overflows and private building lateral blockages causing wastewater backups. It includes overflows reaching waters of the United States, those that do not, and backups caused by blockages in a sanitary sewer. SEC. 4. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SEWER OVERFLOWS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include requirements for publicly owned treatment works to implement a system that alerts them to sanitary sewer overflows within a year of enactment. Publicly owned treatment works must have a system in place to detect sanitary sewer overflows promptly and notify the public within 24 hours to protect human health. Publicly owned treatment works must notify the public within 24 hours of any sanitary sewer overflow that may endanger human health. They must also inform public health authorities and other affected entities promptly. Additionally, they need to provide a report to the Administrator or the State within 24 hours. Publicly owned treatment works must report sanitary sewer overflows to the Administrator or State within 24 hours, providing a written report within 5 days detailing the overflow's magnitude, duration, and suspected cause. The owner or operator must report all sanitary sewer overflows to waters of the United States, providing a written report describing the overflow's magnitude, suspected cause, steps taken to reduce recurrence, and mitigate impact. The owner or operator must report all sanitary sewer overflows to waters of the United States, including details of mitigation steps taken and the total number of overflows in a calendar year. The owner or operator must report all sanitary sewer overflows to waters of the United States, including details of mitigation steps taken and the total number of overflows in a calendar year. States must also report the total number of overflows, details of each incident, cleanup responses, and actions to prevent future overflows to the EPA. The owner or operator must report all sanitary sewer overflows to waters of the United States, including details of mitigation steps taken and the total number of overflows in a calendar year. States must report to the EPA annually on the details of reported sanitary sewer overflows that occurred in the state. SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE.\n\nAmends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and notifying the public of sanitary sewer overflows.\n\nSEC. 6.
