    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993\". The United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993 addresses issues caused by unfair provisions in the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. Canadian grain exports, particularly durum wheat, spring wheat, and barley, have flooded the US market, leading to depressed prices, financial losses for American farmers, and challenges in implementing domestic support programs. The United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993 aims to address the negative impact of Canadian grain exports on American farmers, causing financial losses and difficulties in implementing domestic support programs. The Act was approved by Congress subject to pursuing consultations with Canada regarding pricing issues. The Trade Agreement is subject to pursuing consultations with Canada regarding the price setting policy of the Canadian Wheat Board for goods exported to the United States. It aims to establish a method to determine the price at which the CWB sells agricultural goods to the United States and its acquisition price. The Trade Agreement involves consultations with Canada on the Canadian Wheat Board's price setting policy for goods exported to the United States. It includes determining the CWB's selling price and acquisition price for agricultural goods. The implementing legislation requires immediate consultation with Canada to exclude agricultural goods shipped from Canada via east coast ports for consumption in the United States from transport rates under Canada's Western Grain Transportation Act. The United States has failed to make progress on consultations regarding the transportation of Canadian agricultural goods via east coast ports for consumption in the US. This failure led to a flawed binational panel decision that undermines the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement. The consultations in subsection (b) resulted in a flawed binational panel decision that undermines Article 701(3) of the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which prohibits selling agricultural goods below acquisition price for export. SEC. 101. PRICE TRANSPARENCY. The President must negotiate with Canada to determine the Canadian Wheat Board's selling price to the US. If negotiations fail within 120 days, action will be taken. If negotiations with Canada fail within 120 days, Canada will be considered in violation of the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. All imports of Canadian grain to the US will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. SEC. 102. RAIL TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDY. The President will negotiate with Canada regarding the exclusion of Canadian agricultural goods from transport rates. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain benefiting from the rates will be suspended. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain benefiting from transport rates will be suspended until successful negotiations to terminate the benefits are completed. SEC. 103. ACQUISITION PRICE OF GRAIN. The President will negotiate with Canada to define \"acquisition price\" in the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement to include transportation subsidies, payments to producers by the Canadian Wheat Board, and other incurred payments or subsidies. The US will negotiate with Canada to define \"acquisition price\" in the Free-Trade Agreement, including transportation subsidies, payments to producers by the Canadian Wheat Board, and other incurred payments or subsidies. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. SEC. 104. Federal agencies must provide technical assistance to petitioners in countervailing duty cases regarding Canadian subsidies for wheat and barley exports to the US. TITLE II--AGRICULTURAL TRADE PROGRAMS: SEC. 201. Export Enhancement Program to promote grain exports. The Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to promote grain exports by allowing US producers to compete effectively with Canadian producers, considering transportation subsidies. The Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to promote US grain exports by enabling competition with Canadian producers, taking into account transportation subsidies and pricing strategies of the Canadian Wheat Board in foreign markets. The Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to counteract transportation subsidies and pricing strategies of the Canadian Wheat Board in foreign markets by requiring the Canadian government to exclude agricultural goods from transport rates. The Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to counteract transportation subsidies and pricing strategies of the Canadian Wheat Board in foreign markets by requiring the Canadian government to exclude agricultural goods from transport rates until an agreement is reached. The Canadian Wheat Board must ensure the sale of wheat at a price no less than the full acquisition cost until an agreement is reached with the Government of Canada. SEC. 202. AGRICULTURAL EXPORT PROGRAM PROTECTION. Amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 by adding a new subtitle for Agricultural Export Program Protection. The term 'agricultural trade program' refers to various export promotion and international food aid programs administered by the Commodity Credit Corporation, including those under the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978. The Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 includes the export enhancement program but excludes the market promotion program. It also references the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 and section 416 of the Agricultural Act of 1949.

Regulations will be prescribed to carry out this section, including rules for quarterly reports. SEC. 1583 and SEC. 1584 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 impose compliance provisions and suspension or debarment for the use of foreign agricultural commodities in certain agricultural trade programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation must offer a hearing before suspending or debarring a person from participating in an agricultural trade program for misusing foreign agricultural commodities. The Corporation has the authority to waive suspension or debarment if the person proves compliance with program terms. The Commodity Credit Corporation may waive suspension or debarment for misuse of foreign agricultural commodities in an agricultural trade program if the use was unintentional and the quantity used was less than 1 percent of the total. The Commodity Credit Corporation can waive suspension or debarment for misuse of foreign agricultural commodities in an agricultural trade program if the use was unintentional and the quantity used was less than 1 percent of the total.

This section and the amendment made by it will become effective 120 days after the enactment of the Act. The Commodity Credit Corporation can waive suspension or debarment for misuse of foreign agricultural commodities in an agricultural trade program if unintentional and quantity used was less than 1 percent of the total.
