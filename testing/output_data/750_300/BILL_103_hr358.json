    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Commission to Support Law Enforcement Act\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress recognizes the risks law enforcement officers face daily, the increase in violent crime and drug use, and the lack of adequate support from the Federal Government. The Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice of 1965 highlighted various issues affecting law enforcement, including drug-related crime, violence, racial conflict, and decreased funding. A review twenty-five years later would help evaluate current problems in law enforcement, including drug-related crime, violence, racial conflict, and decreased funding. A comprehensive study of law enforcement issues, including the role of the Federal Government in supporting officers, working conditions, and responsibility for crime control, would assist in redefining relationships between the Federal Government, the public, and law enforcement officials.
