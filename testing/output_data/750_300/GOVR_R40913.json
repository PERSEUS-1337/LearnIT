    "content": "The United States has historically had abundant natural resources, meeting energy needs domestically. However, industrialization and population growth led to increased reliance on foreign energy sources in the 20th century. Concerns over price volatility and supply fluctuations prompted federal efforts to enhance energy independence and reduce domestic consumption. Federal efforts to increase U.S. energy independence and reduce domestic consumption have led to the establishment of programs focused on energy efficiency, conservation of resources, and research for renewable energy sources. These programs have been reauthorized and redesigned periodically over almost 40 years to meet changing economic conditions and national interests. Several federal programs focused on energy efficiency, conservation, and research for renewable energy sources have been reauthorized and redesigned over the past 40 years. These programs apply broadly to various sectors and have been designed to meet current and future challenges. Congress has enacted major energy laws since 2005 to address these issues. Since 2005, Congress has enacted major energy laws to address energy efficiency and renewable energy research and programs, with the Department of Energy operating the most incentive programs. Since 2005, Congress has enacted laws (P.L. 111-5) to support energy efficiency and renewable energy RDD&D programs. The Department of Energy leads in operating these programs, with other departments like Treasury, Agriculture, Interior, Labor, HUD, VA, and SBA also offering incentives. The report outlines federal programs providing incentives for energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy RDD&D, administered by agencies like DOI, DOL, HUD, VA, and SBA. Program descriptions are compiled from statutes, the U.S. Code, and budget documents, with references to agency websites. The report outlines federal programs providing incentives for energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy RDD&D, administered by agencies like DOI, DOL, HUD, VA, and SBA. Program descriptions are compiled from statutes, the U.S. Code, and budget documents, with references to agency websites. Incentives are summarized and indexed in the appendixes, with budgetary figures compiled from executive agency budget justifications and congressional committee reports. Additional program descriptions and funding information were sourced from various databases and websites. For more information on agriculture-related grant programs, refer to CRS Report R43416, Energy Provisions in the 2014 Farm Bill. The report provides information on federal programs for energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy RDD&D. Budget figures were compiled from executive agency justifications and congressional reports. For more details on agriculture-related grant programs, refer to CRS Report R43416. Additionally, information on alternative fuels and vehicle technology incentives can be found in CRS Report R42566. Tax credits for biofuels and vehicles are also covered in detail. The curr_chunk discusses federal renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives, including tax credits for biofuels and vehicles. It also includes appendices with an index of programs and information on expired incentive programs. Appendix A provides a summary of federal renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives, while Appendix B categorizes programs by applicant eligibility and technology type. Appendix C lists expired federal energy efficiency and renewable energy incentive programs. The curr_chunk lists various federal renewable energy and energy efficiency programs, including grants, rebate programs, tax credits, and competitive grants for worker training."
