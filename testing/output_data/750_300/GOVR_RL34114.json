This power can be used to coerce compliance, punish the individual, or remove the obstruction. Congress has three formal methods to combat noncompliance with a congressional subpoena: inherent contempt power allows Congress to detain and imprison a contemnor until compliance, encouraging adherence to congressional directives. Inherent contempt allows Congress to detain a contemnor until compliance with a subpoena, encouraging adherence to congressional directives. Criminal contempt permits the executive branch to prosecute noncompliant individuals, serving as punishment without necessarily promoting future compliance. Contempt serves as punishment for noncompliance with a congressional subpoena, but does not necessarily encourage subsequent acquiescence. Once convicted, the contemnor is not excused from criminal liability if he later chooses to comply with the subpoena. Congress may rely on the judicial branch to enforce a congressional subpoena by seeking a civil judgment from a federal court declaring the individual's legal obligation to comply. Failure to comply may result in being held in contempt of court. The report examines Congress's contempt power and procedures for enforcing subpoenas, including inherent contempt, criminal contempt, and civil enforcement. It discusses the challenges Congress faces in enforcing contempt actions against executive branch officials. The report explores Congress's contempt power and procedures for enforcing subpoenas, including inherent contempt, criminal contempt, and civil enforcement. It also discusses the challenges Congress encounters when enforcing contempt actions against executive branch officials. The power of Congress to punish for contempt is closely tied to its investigative authority, which is broadly defined. While not explicitly stated in the Constitution or specific statutes, the Supreme Court has recognized Congress's essential power to conduct oversight and investigations. The Supreme Court has firmly established that congressional oversight and investigative powers are essential to the legislative function, implied from the general vesting of legislative powers in Congress. This authority was established in Supreme Court rulings from the 1920s Teapot Dome scandal, with the power of inquiry described as an essential auxiliary to the legislative function. The Supreme Court has affirmed that congressional oversight and investigative powers are crucial for the legislative function. In Daugherty case, the Court emphasized the importance of the power of inquiry to gather necessary information for effective legislation. The Supreme Court has affirmed that congressional oversight and investigative powers are crucial for the legislative function. The power of inquiry is necessary to gather accurate and complete information for effective legislation, and some means of compulsion are essential to obtain needed information. This power has been regarded as inherent in the power to legislate since the framing and adoption of the Constitution. The power of inquiry, with enforcing process, is seen as necessary for effective legislative function. Constitutional provisions commit this attribute to the two houses to ensure the function is carried out effectively. In Sinclair v. United States, a witness at congressional hearings refused to provide answers and was prosecuted for contempt of Congress. In Sinclair v. United States, a witness at congressional hearings was prosecuted for contempt of Congress after refusing to answer questions due to a pending lawsuit between the government and Mammoth Oil Company. The Supreme Court upheld the witness's conviction, rejecting the argument that the lawsuits justified withholding information. The Court upheld the witness's conviction for contempt of Congress, rejecting the argument that pending lawsuits justified withholding information. Congress has the authority to require pertinent disclosures in aid of its own constitutional power. Congress's investigative authority is broad and not limited by pending lawsuits. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld Congress's power to require disclosures to aid its constitutional authority, stating that it is as far-reaching as its power to enact and appropriate. The Supreme Court has reiterated Congress's broad investigative authority, stating that it is as far-reaching as its power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution. Congress's power to conduct investigations is broad and inherent in the legislative process. It includes inquiries into the administration of existing laws and potential statutes, with a focus on waste, fraud, abuse, and maladministration within government departments. The Supreme Court emphasized that Congress's investigative power is at its peak when addressing corruption, inefficiency, or waste in federal agencies. The Supreme Court recognizes Congress's broad power to investigate corruption, inefficiency, or waste within government departments. This investigative power allows Congress to expose and address issues of maladministration and inefficiencies in federal agencies. The Supreme Court acknowledges Congress's authority to investigate corruption and inefficiency in the Executive Branch, affirming the inherent contempt power to ensure effective legislative oversight. The inherent contempt power allows individuals to be brought before Congress, tried, and potentially imprisoned for non-compliance, either punitively or coercively. The House has the power to impose a specified period of punishment for non-compliance, following traditional methods like the case of Anderson v. Dunn in 1818 where a non-Member was arrested for bribery accusations. In 1818, a non-Member, Anderson, was accused of bribery by a Member of the House of Representatives. The House ordered his arrest, granted him counsel and defense witnesses, and found him guilty of contempt. The House granted Anderson counsel, defense witnesses, and a copy of the accusatory letter. After calling witnesses and questioning them, the House found Anderson guilty of contempt and directed the Speaker to reprimand him and discharge him from custody. This established a pattern of attachment by the Sergeant-at-Arms, provision for charges, identification of the accuser, compulsory process, counsel, a hearing, determination of guilt, and imposition of penalty. Prompt judicial review seems available for witnesses cited for contempt under the inherent process. The House established a pattern of attachment by the Sergeant-at-Arms, provision for charges, identification of the accuser, compulsory process, counsel, a hearing, determination of guilt, and imposition of penalty. Prompt judicial review appears available for witnesses cited for contempt under the inherent process. The House or Senate must act within its jurisdiction and ensure that contempt proceedings comply with minimum due process standards. While not all procedural rights of a criminal defendant are required, notice and an opportunity to be heard must be granted. Some requirements imposed by the courts for statutory criminal contempt may also be mandated by the due process clause for inherent contempt proceedings. Inherent contempt precedents often involve incarceration of the contemnor, but arguments can be made for alternatives. Inherent contempt proceedings may require pertinency of questions asked to the committee and could potentially mandate monetary fines instead of incarceration. This could avoid habeas corpus proceedings as the contemnor would not be jailed. Congress could argue for the imposition of fines based on its inherent authority, similar to courts imposing fines for contemptuous behavior. Drawing on the inherent authority of courts to impose fines for contemptuous behavior, Congress could potentially argue for fines instead of incarceration in inherent contempt proceedings, as seen in the dicta from the 1821 Supreme Court decision in Anderson. The Court emphasized the principle of self-preservation and the need for the least possible power adequate to the end proposed. The deliberative assemblies of the Union may exercise punishing power for self-preservation, with imprisonment being the least possible power adequate to the end proposed. Other forms of punishment are considered mere commutation for confinement, as suggested in Kilbourn v. Thompson. In Kilbourn v. Thompson, the Court implied that Congress can compel testimony similar to a court of justice in certain cases where it has the authority to investigate. The power of punishment in deliberative assemblies may include imprisonment for self-preservation, with other forms of punishment seen as mere alternatives to confinement. The power of punishment in deliberative assemblies may include imprisonment for self-preservation, with other forms of punishment seen as mere alternatives to confinement. While the language of cases suggests the possibility of levying a fine for contempt of Congress, there is no precedent for Congress imposing a fine in contempt proceedings. Inherent contempt does not require cooperation from the executive or judicial branches. Inherent contempt proceedings do not require cooperation from the executive or judicial branches. The House or Senate can conduct summary proceedings and cite the offender for contempt, without the need for precedent of imposing a fine. The contemnor can seek limited judicial review through a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, but there are limitations to the inherent contempt process. Inherent contempt proceedings allow the House or Senate to cite offenders for contempt without fines. Limited judicial review is possible through a habeas corpus petition, but there are restrictions on the process. Imprisonment for non-compliance with a subpoena is temporary and seen as outdated and inefficient for a modern Congress. Inherent contempt proceedings in Congress are considered outdated and inefficient due to their cumbersome and time-consuming nature. The process has not been used since 1935, and it may be more effective if initial fact-finding is done by a special committee before a final decision is made by the full House or Senate. Between 1795 and 1857, 14 inherent contempt actions were initiated by the House and Senate, with 8 considered successful in holding the contemnor accountable. Proceedings were conducted before a special committee, with the final decision made by the full body. Between 1795 and 1857, 14 inherent contempt actions were initiated by the House and Senate, with 8 considered successful in holding the contemnor accountable. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted to address the perceived inefficiencies of the inherent contempt proceedings. In 1857, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted as an alternative to the inherent contempt process, allowing for judicial trial by a United States Attorney. This change was prompted by perceived inefficiencies in the previous inherent contempt actions. The legislation enacted in 1857 provided a criminal contempt procedure as an alternative to the inherent contempt process, allowing for judicial trial by a United States Attorney. Most contempt proceedings continued to be handled at the bar of the house, rather than through criminal contempt, due to concerns about obtaining desired information from witnesses after criminal proceedings had begun. These provisions are now codified as 2 U.S.C. Sections 192 and 194. The legislation enacted in 1857 provided a criminal contempt procedure as an alternative to the inherent contempt process, allowing for judicial trial by a United States Attorney. Under 2 U.S.C. Section 192, a person who fails to testify or produce documents after being summoned by a house or committee is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to one year. Section 194 establishes the procedure for handling a recalcitrant witness. Under 2 U.S.C. Section 194, a recalcitrant witness who refuses to respond to questions may be referred to the courts for criminal prosecution. The procedure involves committee approval, reading the committee report on the floor, and House approval of a resolution authorizing prosecution by the U.S. Attorney. The criminal contempt statute under 2 U.S.C. Section 194 involves steps such as committee approval, reading the report on the floor, House approval for prosecution, and certification by the Speaker to the U.S. Attorney. It is used to punish uncooperative witnesses and deter similar behavior. The criminal contempt statute is punitive and used to punish uncooperative witnesses. Once a witness is voted in contempt, they lack an incentive to cooperate with the committee. The courts have rejected arguments that defendants can purge themselves, but in some cases, the House has certified. Once a witness is voted in contempt, they lack an incentive to cooperate with the committee. The House has certified to the U.S. Attorney that further proceedings were not necessary in some cases. It is the \"duty\" of the U.S. Attorney to bring the matter before the grand jury for its action. The U.S. Attorney's duty to present contempt cases to grand juries is uncertain, with conflicting guidance from relevant case law. In some instances, witnesses charged with contempt have been granted habeas corpus petitions. In Ex parte Frankfeld, the District Court for the District of Columbia granted habeas corpus petitions for two witnesses charged with violating 2 U.S.C. Section 192 by the House Committee on Un-American Activities. The witnesses were released due to procedural errors in their arrest based on a committee staff member's affidavit. The court also mentioned that Congress required committees to report obdurate witnesses to the House. The court observed that Congress mandated committees to report uncooperative witnesses to the House or Senate, who would then certify the facts to the district attorney. This process was deemed mandatory with no room for discretion. The court mandated committees to report uncooperative witnesses to the district attorney, with no room for discretion. The district attorney is required to submit the facts to the grand jury. In cases involving contempt procedures, the duty of the U.S. Attorney is to bring the matter before the grand jury, as seen in United States v. United States House of Representatives. However, in Wilson v. United States, the Speaker's certification of contempt citations to the U.S. Attorney during adjournments is discretionary, not mandatory. The District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the Speaker's duty to certify contempt citations to the U.S. Attorney during adjournments is discretionary, not mandatory, based on legislative history and congressional practice. Congress's view is that when in session, a committee's contempt resolution requires approval by the parent body before referral to the U.S. Attorney. When Congress is not in session, the Speaker or President of the Senate reviews the contempt citation instead of the full House or Senate. In session, a committee's contempt resolution must be approved by the parent body before being referred to the U.S. Attorney. When Congress is not in session, the Speaker or President of the Senate reviews the contempt citation instead of the full House or Senate. The review of a committee's contempt citation is considered discretionary, as seen in the Wilson case where convictions were reversed due to the Speaker certifying the citations without exercising discretion. This raises the argument that the U.S. Attorney's duty may also be discretionary. The Speaker's duty in certifying contempt citations was found to be discretionary, leading to the argument that the U.S. Attorney's function may also be discretionary. U.S. Attorneys typically have broad prosecutorial discretion, even when statutes use mandatory language. If inherent or criminal contempt is not an option, Congress can seek judicial enforcement of a subpoena. Congress can appeal to the judicial branch to enforce a subpoena through civil enforcement by filing a suit in federal court. If the court orders compliance and it is not followed, contempt of court may result. This is different from contempt of Congress, and the Senate also has statutory authority in this matter. The House can pursue civil enforcement through a court order if a congressional subpoena is not complied with, potentially leading to contempt of court. Unlike the Senate, there is no specific provision for the House, but it has used authorizing resolutions in the past. In 1978, Congress enacted a civil enforcement procedure applicable only to the Senate. In 1978, Congress enacted a civil enforcement procedure applicable only to the Senate, giving the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia jurisdiction over enforcing Senate subpoenas or orders. The Senate Legal Counsel can bring a civil action to enforce compliance with subpoenas or orders issued by the Senate or its committees. The Senate Legal Counsel can bring a civil action to enforce compliance with subpoenas or orders issued by the Senate or its committees, either by directly ordering compliance or seeking a declaration of validity before court intervention. The Senate has the discretion to choose the enforcement process. The Senate Legal Counsel can bring a civil action to enforce compliance with subpoenas or orders issued by the Senate or its committees. The Senate has the discretion to choose a two-step enforcement process, giving the party a chance to comply before court intervention. The court will review the subpoena's validity, with limited jurisdiction when solely enforcing a congressional subpoena. The court's jurisdiction is limited to enforcing congressional subpoenas, with the ability to order compliance but not to enjoin the congressional proceeding. If an individual still refuses to comply, they may face contempt of court proceedings. The court can order compliance with a congressional subpoena, but cannot stop the congressional proceeding. If an individual still refuses to comply, they may face contempt of court proceedings. Civil enforcement has limitations, especially when it comes to subpoenas issued to federal government officers or employees. The House of Representatives cannot use the Senate's civil enforcement statute. The House of Representatives may authorize a committee to seek civil enforcement action to compel compliance with a subpoena, as seen in the 2008 case involving former White House Counsel Harriet Miers. The jurisdiction of courts to hear such cases does not apply to federal government officers or employees. The 2008 dispute over Harriet Miers' refusal to testify in a House Judiciary Committee investigation marked the first attempt by Congress to enforce a subpoena in federal court. The federal district court decision in Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers established that the statutory basis is sufficient for jurisdiction in such civil actions. The current statutory basis is sufficient to establish jurisdiction for a civil action if the congressional committee representative is authorized by a house of Congress. In 2012, the House authorized a committee to enforce a subpoena in federal court, holding Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for not fully complying with subpoenas. In 2012, the House authorized a civil lawsuit to enforce subpoenas issued to an executive branch official, including Attorney General Eric Holder. The lawsuit sought compliance with the subpoenas and was filed in August 2012. The court rejected the Department of Justice's arguments in September 2013. The lawsuit filed in 2012 seeks compliance with committee subpoenas from the Attorney General. The court rejected the DOJ's arguments in September 2013 and ordered the DOJ to provide a list of withheld documents. The court addressed federal court jurisdiction, standing, causes of action, and separation-of-powers concerns. Motions for summary judgment were denied, and the DOJ was ordered to provide a list of withheld documents. The court has not yet decided on the executive privilege question. Authorization from the full House is required for civil enforcement of subpoenas. Authorization from the full House is required for civil enforcement of subpoenas, with the likelihood that the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will entertain claims if an authorizing resolution by the House can be obtained. Authorization from the full House is required for civil enforcement of subpoenas, with the likelihood that the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will entertain claims if an authorizing resolution by the House can be obtained. The DOJ acknowledges that properly authorized procedures for seeking civil enforcement provide the preferred method of enforcing a subpoena against an executive official, but the executive branch maintains that Congress cannot invoke its authority under statutory or constitutional law. The executive branch maintains that Congress cannot invoke its authority under statutory or constitutional law to enforce a subpoena against an executive official. The Attorney General has directed U.S. Attorneys to refrain from pursuing criminal contempt prosecution in such cases. The executive branch asserts executive privilege in response to congressional subpoenas, directing U.S. Attorneys to refrain from pursuing criminal contempt prosecution. This view is supported by DOJ opinions from the 1980s and actions taken in contempt proceedings against various officials. The House approved contempt citations against several officials, including EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch Burford and Attorney General Eric Holder, but the DOJ declined to prosecute for criminal contempt. This highlights the challenge of enforcing subpoenas when executive privilege is invoked. The House has faced challenges enforcing subpoenas when executive privilege is invoked, leading to reliance on civil enforcement through federal courts. The 2014 case involving IRS official Lois Lerner showed the broadening position of the executive branch on criminal contempt against an executive official. The House held Ms. Lerner in contempt for refusing to testify about the IRS targeting conservative groups. Despite invoking the Fifth Amendment, the committee rejected her assertion, citing her opening statement as a waiver. The DOJ has not taken action on the contempt citation. The House held Ms. Lerner in contempt for refusing to testify about the IRS targeting conservative groups. Despite invoking the Fifth Amendment, the committee rejected her assertion, citing her opening statement as a waiver. The DOJ has not taken action on the contempt citation, unlike past cases involving executive privilege. The executive branch official refused to comply with a subpoena citing executive privilege, while Ms. Lerner's refusal was based on her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The DOJ did not pursue a criminal contempt charge in this case. The DOJ's exercise of prosecutorial discretion in not pursuing a criminal contempt charge against executive branch officials extends beyond cases involving executive privilege. Lessons from past disputes suggest that Congress faces obstacles in enforcing subpoenas against officials through the criminal contempt statute. Congress faces obstacles in enforcing subpoenas against executive branch officials through the criminal contempt statute. Efforts to punish noncompliance with a subpoena will likely be ineffective, especially when the President is involved in directing or endorsing the official's actions. The Department of Justice has a history of not pursuing criminal contempt charges in such cases. When the President directs or endorses an official's noncompliance with a subpoena, the DOJ typically does not pursue criminal contempt charges. Prosecutorial discretion is often cited as the reason for not forwarding the contempt citation to a grand jury. However, if the official's actions were not endorsed by the President, such as ignoring a congressional subpoena for personal reasons, criminal contempt may be pursued. In cases where an executive branch official defies a congressional subpoena for personal reasons, the criminal contempt provision can still be used to hold them accountable, even if the President does not endorse their actions. However, the executive branch may choose not to prosecute the official to avoid setting a precedent for Congress's authority to punish executive branch officers through criminal contempt. The executive branch may choose not to prosecute an official for defying a congressional subpoena to avoid setting a precedent for Congress's authority to punish executive branch officers through criminal contempt. Congress may struggle to enforce its own subpoenas through civil action against an executive official due to the time required for a final ruling. Enforcing congressional subpoenas through civil action may prove inadequate due to lengthy legal processes, as seen in the Miers case where a favorable decision was received but could not be enforced before the end of the Congress. Litigation to enforce a subpoena would likely involve a prolonged appeals process, as shown by the 19-month Miers litigation that was ultimately dismissed without a decision on the merits. The Miers litigation, which never reached a decision on the merits by the D.C. Circuit, was dismissed after approximately 19 months, despite gaining access to withheld information. The change in administrations and passage of time may have weakened Congress's ability to effectively utilize the obtained information for oversight. In many situations, Congress may not rely on the executive branch to enforce subpoenas against executive branch officials. Civil enforcement through the judicial branch may not always lead to a quick resolution. Congress can still enforce subpoenas through inherent contempt."
