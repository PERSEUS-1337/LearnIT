Congress acknowledges the importance of scientific research and technology development in ensuring America's aeronautical defenses. A strong research base is crucial for maintaining air, space, and information superiority. To maintain air, space, and information superiority, a strong research and development base is crucial. The vision of Air Force founder General Henry H. Arnold emphasizes building the Air Force around science, which remains important today. Investment in Air Force research and development has benefited American industry, particularly the aerospace sector. Investment in Air Force research and development has greatly benefited the American economy, especially the aerospace industry, remaining crucial even after 50 years. The text chunk discusses the importance of science and technology functions within the Department of the Air Force, highlighting its significance for national security and technological advancement. The sense of Congress is that a minimum of 2.5% of Air Force funds should be allocated to science and technology, with separate management and funding from acquisition. Additionally, at least 15% of science and technology funds should be invested in new technology areas. To increase long-term investments, at least 15% of Air Force science and technology funds should be allocated to new technology areas, including critical information technology programs, for the next 5 years. Additionally, the Air Force should increase the number of officers and civilian employees with doctorate degrees in technical fields to meet future technological challenges. To enhance Air Force science and technology, there should be an increase in the number of officers and civilian employees with doctorate degrees in technical fields. Additionally, there should be a focus on expanding the variety of technical degrees at the master's level. To prevent stagnation, 5% of science and technology programs should be eliminated annually. To prevent stagnation, a concentrated effort should be made to eliminate 5% of science and technology programs each year, with funds from discontinued programs used for new ones. SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS RELATING TO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE. Amendments are made to separate the research and development function from the equipping function of the Secretary of the Air Force. This includes adding a new paragraph for research and development and amending sections related to the research and development function of the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force. Amendments are made to establish a new subparagraph for Research and Development under the Secretary of the Air Force. Additionally, an Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Science and Technology is created with increased positions. Amendments are made to increase the number of Assistant Secretaries of the Air Force from four to five, with one specifically designated as the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Science and Technology. This individual will oversee the science and technology functions of the Department of the Air Force. The Secretary of the Air Force will supervise science and technology functions, while a Deputy Chief of Staff for Science and Technology will be established. Amendments increase the number of Assistant Secretaries of the Air Force to five, with one dedicated to overseeing science and technology functions. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary of the Air Force must contract the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to study the Air Force's technology base. The study will recommend minimum requirements to maintain a technology base for superiority in air and space weapons systems and information technology, addressing the effects on national defense and civilian aerospace industries. The Secretary of the Air Force must contract the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to study the Air Force's technology base, recommending minimum requirements for air and space weapons systems and information technology. The study will address the effects on national defense and civilian aerospace industries, recommend appropriate staff levels with baccalaureate, masters, and doctorate degrees, and provide the optimal ratio of civilian and military staff with such degrees to ensure the Air Force's science and technology functions remain vital. A report must be submitted within 120 days of completing the study.
