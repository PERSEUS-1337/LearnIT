    "content": "The \"Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 2003\" establishes a grant program for gifted and talented students under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. This program authorizes activities to support gifted and talented students. Congress finds that gifted and talented students demonstrate high performance in various academic fields and require specialized services not typically offered by schools to fully develop their capabilities. These students come from diverse backgrounds, including those with disabilities or non-English speaking backgrounds, who have historically been underrepresented. Elementary and secondary school teachers have students with diverse backgrounds, including disabilities and non-English speaking students, who are historically underrepresented in gifted education programs. Gifted elementary students have already mastered a significant portion of the school year's material before it begins. Elementary and secondary school teachers receive training to meet the needs of students with disabilities, limited English proficiency, and diverse backgrounds, but often lack training for gifted and talented students. Gifted education programs are essential for high-ability students, especially those from inner cities, rural communities, or low-income families, who rely on public schools for services. Teachers often lack training to meet the needs of gifted and talented students from diverse backgrounds. Gifted education programs in public schools are crucial for providing equal opportunities to high-ability students from various backgrounds. Parents and families play a vital role in partnering with schools to support the educational and social-emotional needs of gifted children. They require access to information, research, and resources to help develop appropriate services for these students. Gifted and talented students require access to information, research, and support for their educational, social, and emotional needs. There is no Federal requirement to identify or serve the approximately 3,000,000 gifted students in the nation. While some States allocate resources for gifted education, others do not, leading to disparities in services. To address the disparities in services for gifted and talented students, it is crucial for more students to achieve higher levels of education. This will help meet the future economic and national security needs of the United States. To ensure future economic and national security needs, more students must achieve higher levels of education. Highly capable students should be prepared for innovative and creative work to secure the nation's position globally. The performance of twelfth-grade advanced students in the US on TIMSS was among the lowest worldwide in physics and mathematics content areas. The United States performed poorly in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), ranking among the lowest in physics and advanced mathematics. In 1990, very little funding was allocated for challenging programs for gifted students in elementary and secondary education.
