    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Electricity and Environmental Technology Research and Development Act.\" Congress finds that reliable, affordable, increasingly clean electricity is crucial for the growing US economy. The use of electrotechnologies, environmental concerns, competitive electricity markets, and rising energy prices highlight the importance of clean electricity. Coal, currently generating over half of US electricity, is the most abundant fossil energy resource in the country. Coal is the most abundant fossil energy resource in the United States, accounting for over half of all electricity generated. It comprises more than 85 percent of all fossil resources and can supply the country for 250 years at current usage rates. Investments in emissions control technology have reduced pollutants from coal-based electricity generating facilities over the past 30 years. Investments in emissions control technology over the past 30 years have reduced pollutants from coal-based electricity generating facilities by 21 percent. Continuous improvement in efficiency and environmental performance would allow continued use of coal and preserve less abundant energy resources for other uses. New technologies for converting coal into electricity are being developed. Investments in emissions control technology have reduced pollutants from coal-based electricity generating facilities by 21 percent. New technologies for converting coal into electricity can eliminate health-threatening emissions and improve efficiency by up to 50 percent. However, there is a significant risk in the initial commercial deployment of these technologies in a competitive electricity market. Continued environmental improvement in coal-based generation is essential through research and development. Investments in emissions control technology have reduced pollutants from coal-based electricity generating facilities by 21 percent. New technologies for converting coal into electricity can eliminate health-threatening emissions and improve efficiency by up to 50 percent. However, there is a significant risk in the initial commercial deployment of these technologies in a competitive electricity market. Continued environmental improvement in coal-based generation through research, development, and demonstration towards near-zero emissions is important and desirable. The Act defines \"cost and performance goals\" as those established under section 4 and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary will assess cost and performance goals for technologies enabling coal use for electricity, chemical feedstocks, and transportation fuel in 2007, 2015, and 2020. Consultation with various industry representatives is required. The Secretary will consult with various industry representatives, including the United States coal industry, State coal development agencies, electric utility industry, transportation industries, equipment manufacturers using advanced coal technologies, worker organizations, organizations promoting coal use and environmental protection, and other appropriate Federal and State agencies. Timing for assessments of technologies enabling coal use for electricity, chemical feedstocks, and transportation fuel is specified for 2007, 2015, and 2020. The Secretary will issue draft cost and performance goals for public comment within 120 days of the Act's enactment and submit the final goals to Congress within 180 days. Other appropriate Federal and State agencies will be involved in promoting advanced coal technologies. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary, in cooperation with other agencies, must provide Congress with a report every 2 years identifying technologies and assessing costs for achieving specific goals. The report must assess costs and time needed for technology development to achieve cost and performance goals, and make recommendations for technology development programs in cooperation with industry. The Department of Energy will develop and demonstrate technologies with industry to achieve cost and performance goals. Recommendations for additional authorities needed will be made. The Secretary will consider expert advice from representatives of relevant entities. The Secretary of Energy will conduct a research and development program on coal-based technologies to achieve cost and performance goals under various Acts. Authorization of appropriations of $100,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2012 for sections 4, 5, and 6. This funding is in addition to existing authorizations and does not cap Department of Energy fossil energy research. Additionally, the Clean Coal Power Commercial Applications Initiative is established. The Secretary will establish a clean coal power commercial applications initiative to demonstrate advanced coal-based technologies for power plants, including coproduction plants. These technologies must significantly improve efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness beyond current standards. New technologies may also be included in the initiative. The Secretary will establish a clean coal power commercial applications initiative to demonstrate advanced coal-based technologies for power plants, including coproduction plants. The initiative aims to improve efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness well beyond current standards. The plan will include program elements, management structure, technical milestones, and may incorporate new technologies not previously envisioned for commercial applications. The plan for the clean coal power commercial applications initiative will outline program elements, management structure, technical milestones, and demonstration activities for advanced coal-based technologies at facilities serving coal-based electric generation units. This includes achieving design efficiency improvements for units with at least 50 megawatts nameplate rating. The plan aims to improve design efficiency and environmental performance of coal-based electric generation units with at least 50 megawatts nameplate rating. This includes achieving a 3 percent efficiency improvement and enhancing sulfur dioxide control. The plan aims to improve design efficiency and environmental performance of coal-based electric generation units with at least 50 megawatts nameplate rating by implementing significant improvements in environmental control technologies for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury, as well as recycling coal combustion or gasification wastes. The Act requires the recycling or reusing of coal combustion wastes and capturing carbon dioxide at a lower cost than current technologies. SEC. 9. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. The Secretary must solicit proposals for projects at new or existing facilities to achieve specified performance levels within 180 days of transmitting the plan to Congress. Proposals may include projects demonstrating a 3 percentage point efficiency improvement compared to the unit's efficiency at the time of the Act's enactment. The solicitation of proposals for projects must demonstrate an overall design efficiency improvement of at least 3 percentage points without increasing emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, mercury, or carbon monoxide. Emissions must be reduced to specified levels for sulfur dioxide. The reduction of emissions must meet specified levels for sulfur dioxide, with different percentages based on the potential combustion concentration of coal. The reduction of emissions for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide must meet specified levels based on the potential combustion concentration of coal. The emission levels for nitrogen oxide are set at 0.1 pound per million British thermal units for boilers other than cyclone-fired ones, and at 15 percent of uncontrolled emissions for cyclone-fired boilers. For particulate matter, the emission level is 0.02 pound per million British thermal units. The emission levels for nitrogen oxide are set at 0.1 pound per million British thermal units for boilers other than cyclone-fired ones, and at 15 percent of uncontrolled emissions for cyclone-fired boilers. For particulate matter, the emission level is 0.02 pound per million British thermal units. Additionally, emission levels for pollutants specified in the Clean Air Act may be lower than the specified levels for advanced coal-based technology. Financial assistance will be provided by the Secretary for projects involving the construction, installation, or retrofitting of advanced coal-based technology with lower emission levels than specified, or for the production of coal combustion byproducts with increased economic value without increasing emissions of specified pollutants.
