The Borrower's Protection Act of 2007, also known as the Truth in Lending Act, defines key terms related to home mortgage loans, mortgage brokers, and mortgage originators. The Borrower's Protection Act of 2007, also known as the Truth in Lending Act, defines key terms related to home mortgage loans, mortgage brokers, and mortgage originators. A mortgage originator includes any creditor or person, like a mortgage broker, who accepts home mortgage loan applications, solicits loans for borrowers, or negotiates loan terms for compensation. The Borrower's Protection Act of 2007, also known as the Truth in Lending Act, defines key terms related to home mortgage loans, mortgage brokers, and mortgage originators. A mortgage originator includes any creditor or person who is involved directly or indirectly in the acceptance of home mortgage loan applications, solicitation of loans, negotiation of loan terms, or sales of existing loans to lenders. A qualifying bond is a bond equal to at least 1 percent of the total value of all homes. The term 'qualifying bond' refers to a bond worth at least 1 percent of the total value of all homes appraised by a real property appraiser in the previous year, benefiting homeowners with claims against the appraiser. The bond benefits homeowners with claims against the appraiser and originating creditors who acted in good faith. Assignees or trustees can benefit if the originating creditor qualifies. A 'rate spread mortgage transaction' is defined. The term 'rate spread mortgage transaction' is defined as a home mortgage loan with an annual percentage rate of interest that equals or exceeds the rate requiring reporting under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Assignees or trustees can benefit if the originating creditor qualifies. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act defines a rate spread mortgage transaction as a loan with a high annual percentage rate. Mortgage brokers have a fiduciary relationship with consumers and must adhere to all fiduciary requirements under State or Federal law. Mortgage originators must also act fairly in addition to following existing laws. Each mortgage originator must act with reasonable skill, care, and diligence, as well as in good faith and with fair dealing in any transaction. Additionally, they are required to assess the borrower's ability to repay before originating a home mortgage loan. Each mortgage originator must act in good faith and with fair dealing in any transaction. Before facilitating a home mortgage loan, they must verify the borrower's ability to repay the loan, including principal, interest, real estate taxes, and homeowners insurance fees. The ability to pay for a home mortgage loan is determined based on the maximum possible monthly payment that could be due from the borrower during the first 7 years of the loan term, calculated using the maximum interest rate allowable under the loan.

Mortgage originators must verify the borrower's ability to pay based on documentation of income and financial resources. The mortgage originator determines the borrower's ability to pay based on documentation of income, financial resources, debt-to-income ratio, and residual income. The borrower's ability to pay is determined based on documentation of income, financial resources, debt-to-income ratio, and residual income. A statement of income and financial resources without additional documentation is not sufficient for assessment. Rate spread mortgages require an escrow account. Rate spread mortgages necessitate an escrow account for monthly payments covering taxes, insurance premiums, and flood insurance if applicable. The mortgage originator may require escrow payments for taxes, insurance, and flood insurance. Exceptions apply if the obligor is already making escrow payments for another loan on the same property. Lender and broker liability is also addressed. In connection with a home mortgage loan, a mortgage originator may not steer, counsel, or direct a consumer to rates, charges, principal amount, or prepayment. Lender liability for acts, omissions, and representations made by the mortgage broker in connection with a rate spread mortgage loan is also addressed. In connection with a home mortgage loan, a mortgage originator is prohibited from steering consumers to unfavorable rates, charges, or terms. This includes considering property characteristics and consumer qualifications. A mortgage originator must consider the property characteristics and consumer qualifications when offering or facilitating a home loan. If unable to provide a favorable loan, they must assist the consumer in obtaining one from another creditor. A mortgage originator must originate or facilitate a home mortgage loan with skill and diligence. If unable to offer a favorable loan, they must disclose to the consumer that other creditors may provide such a loan. In connection with a home mortgage loan, a mortgage originator must disclose if they do not offer a loan advantageous to the consumer and explain why their products and services are not suitable. Prohibited conduct includes mischaracterizing the consumer's credit history. In connection with a home mortgage loan, a mortgage originator is prohibited from mischaracterizing the credit history or appraised value of the property securing the loan. They must not suggest, offer, or recommend a home mortgage that is not reasonably advantageous for the consumer. A mortgage originator is prohibited from mischaracterizing the credit history or appraised value of the property securing the loan, and must not discourage consumers from seeking a home mortgage loan elsewhere. They can provide general information about home mortgage loans but cannot offer ones that are not reasonably advantageous. Rule of construction allows mortgage originators to provide consumers with unbiased information about home mortgage loans, underwriting standards, and credit history. Good faith and fair dealing in the appraisal process prohibit mortgage originators from entering into loans if they suspect appraisal value misrepresentation. No mortgage originator can approve a home mortgage loan if they suspect the property's appraisal was not conducted accurately or in good faith. This includes situations where the appraiser did not act fairly towards the consumer or failed to follow required standards. The appraisal may be deemed inaccurate or unreasonable if it was not conducted in accordance with State and Federal standards, if the appraiser had a direct or indirect interest in the property or transaction, if compensation was received without a qualifying bond, or if the appraisal order includes the requested loan. The mortgage originator is prohibited from influencing an appraiser to target a specific value for a home mortgage loan. The mortgage originator is prohibited from influencing an appraiser to target a specific value for a home mortgage loan, including seeking to influence or encourage a targeted value or selecting an appraiser based on an expectation of a targeted value. It is not a defense to enforcement that another person was used in the appraisal process. The mortgage originator must provide a copy of the home appraisal report to the applicant, regardless of the loan outcome. It is not a valid defense to claim that another person was involved in the appraisal process. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to include provisions for mortgage originators, requiring them to fulfill specific duties."
