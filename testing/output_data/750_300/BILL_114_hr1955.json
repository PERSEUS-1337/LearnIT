    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Great Lakes Nutrient Removal Assistance Act\" and includes findings related to nutrient removal in the Great Lakes. Congress finds that ineffective wastewater treatment is a common source of water pollution, with nutrient pollution, especially phosphorus loading, being a significant issue in the Great Lakes System. Limiting phosphorus loads is crucial to controlling algal growth, and a coordinated strategy to change nutrient discharge is urgently needed. Nutrient removal technology is a reliable and cost-effective method for reducing harmful nutrients from point sources. A wide strategy to change nutrient discharge is urgent in the Great Lakes System. Nutrient removal technology is a reliable, cost-effective method for reducing harmful nutrients from point sources. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program is established under Section 3. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program is established under Section 118 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to provide grants for installing nutrient removal technologies in Great Lakes States and municipalities to reduce total nutrients in discharged wastewater. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program provides grants for installing nutrient removal technologies in Great Lakes States and municipalities to reduce total nutrients in discharged wastewater, with priority given to facilities where the technologies would have the greatest impact. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program prioritizes eligible facilities for installing nutrient removal technologies based on producing the greatest nutrient load reductions, resulting in the greatest environmental benefits to the Great Lakes System, and helping meet objectives related to nutrients outlined in Annex 4 of the Great Lakes Water Quality. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program prioritizes eligible facilities for installing nutrient removal technologies to achieve nutrient load reductions and meet objectives outlined in Annex 4 of the Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012. Great Lakes States or municipalities can apply for grants through the Administrator. The Administrator may approve grant applications for installing nutrient removal technologies at eligible facilities, providing up to 55 percent of the installation cost. The Administrator may approve grant applications for installing nutrient removal technologies at eligible municipal wastewater treatment facilities. The term 'eligible facility' refers to a facility that meets certain criteria. The term 'eligible facility' refers to a municipal wastewater treatment facility with a design capacity to treat at least 500,000 gallons of wastewater per day, located within the Great Lakes System in any of the Great Lakes States. The eligible facility must treat a minimum of 500,000 gallons of wastewater per day and be situated within the Great Lakes System in any of the Great Lakes States. $100,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2020 for this subsection, with funds remaining available until expended. $100,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2020 for this subsection, with funds remaining available until expended. The Administrator may use up to 4 percent for administrative costs."
