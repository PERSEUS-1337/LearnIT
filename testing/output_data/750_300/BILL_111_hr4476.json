    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2010\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, privately owned but government-sponsored enterprises, were central to the 2008 financial crisis, leading to a severe economic decline and the loss of millions of jobs. In September 2008, the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve Board, and FHFA were involved in addressing the crisis. In September 2008, the government placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship to control their daily operations and established a $200 billion facility to support their losses. In September 2008, the Administration established a $200 billion facility to purchase senior preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to support their losses. In February 2009, the Obama Administration increased the stock purchase commitment to $400 billion. On Christmas Eve 2009, the Administration removed limits on Federal funds to cover losses, expanding the commitment that has already cost over $110 billion in taxpayer funds. The US government has spent over $110 billion in taxpayer funds to purchase senior preferred stock in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, resulting in taxpayers owning at least 80% of the two enterprises. The Administration is using the GSEs as instruments of Federal housing policy, reducing the likelihood of them being returned to private ownership. The Congressional Budget Office has determined that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are now effectively government entities. The GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are considered government entities and are expected to be a long-term burden on taxpayers due to market conditions and political mandates. Despite these challenges, compensation packages were approved by the Treasury Department and FHFA at the end of 2009. At the end of 2009, the Treasury Department and FHFA approved $6,000,000 compensation packages for the CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including $2,000,000 in incentive pay each, which is significantly higher than the annual compensation of the President and Cabinet Secretary. The Treasury Department and FHFA approved multi-million dollar compensation packages for top executives of the GSEs, payable in cash instead of stock options. FHFA also determined that no executive officer of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac would receive cash bonuses or long-term incentive awards for 2008. FHFA determined no cash bonuses or long-term incentives for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives in 2008, as part of the government's assistance plan. The GSEs are committed to operating safely and soundly under FHFA's five-year Strategic Plan. The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 allows the Director of FHFA to withhold or place executive officer compensation in escrow for review of reasonableness and comparability. SEC. 3. REASONABLE COMPENSATION. The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency will suspend 2010 compensation packages for executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, replacing them with a system based on federal government pay rates. The Federal Housing Finance Agency will suspend 2010 compensation packages for executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, replacing them with a system based on federal government pay rates. Additionally, there is a provision for clawback of 2009 compensation for executive officers of these enterprises. The Federal Housing Finance Agency will suspend 2010 compensation packages for executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, replacing them with a system based on federal government pay rates. Executive officers are required to return any excess compensation earned in 2009 to the Secretary of the Treasury to reduce the national debt. The Secretary of the Treasury will transfer excess compensation returned by executive officers to a special account to reduce the national debt."
