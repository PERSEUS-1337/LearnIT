    "content": "The environmental impacts of human activity, including pollution, habitat destruction, and greenhouse gas emissions, have raised concerns. Buildings, such as residential, commercial, and government structures, are a significant part of the nation's infrastructure and are under increasing scrutiny for their environmental impacts. Buildings, including residential, commercial, government, schools, and hospitals, are a key component of the nation's infrastructure. Their construction, operation, and demolition have significant environmental impacts, consuming resources like electricity, water, and construction materials while producing waste streams. Buildings in the U.S. consume vast resources annually for electricity, water, and construction materials, leading to high environmental and financial costs. They account for 40% of energy consumption, produce 40% of greenhouse gas emissions, and cost consumers over $430 billion in energy bills each year. Buildings in the United States account for about 40% of energy consumption, produce 40% of greenhouse gas emissions, and cost consumers over $430 billion annually in energy bills. The location and surroundings of a building also impact its ecological and human health effects, such as stormwater management and transportation energy requirements. The proximity of a building to public transportation affects energy consumption and environmental impacts. Lack of accessibility may lead to car commuting, contributing to traffic congestion and pollution. Indoor air quality significantly impacts occupant health and productivity, with buildings often having higher pollutant levels than outdoors, leading to \"sick building syndrome.\" Green building addresses indoor air quality issues in buildings, aiming to reduce pollutants that can lead to \"sick building syndrome.\" It is a sustainable approach to designing, constructing, and operating buildings that has gained popularity since the 1990s. Green building has become a respected approach to designing, constructing, and operating buildings since the 1990s. It involves various stakeholders such as construction firms, building owners, certification organizations, lawmakers, and government agencies. This report discusses green building concepts, federal policies, and associated issues. This report discusses the concept of green building, federal policies, and associated issues, including definitions, environmental impacts, tools for compliance, implementation challenges, statutory authorities, and federal agency programs related to green building. The modern practice of green building emerged in the 1990s with the formation of organizations like the Committee on the Environment and the U.S. Green Building Council. The most prominent federal green building project in that decade was the \"Greening of the\" project. The concept of green building emerged in the 1990s with the founding of organizations like the Committee on the Environment and the U.S. Green Building Council. It encompasses environmentally conscious design principles and strategies to reduce harmful impacts of the built environment. There is no single consensus definition, with efforts existing along a design and performance continuum. Green building aims to reduce harmful impacts of the built environment through a set of practices and strategies. The definition varies, with some efforts barely distinguishable from standard practices, while others aim for greatly reduced environmental impacts. Some use the term as a marketing tool, known as \"greenwashing,\" while others strive for zero-impact buildings. Green building efforts range from standard practices to ambitious goals like zero-impact and minus-impact buildings. It involves an integrated approach to design, construction, and operations that significantly reduces environmental footprints compared to traditional practices. Green building is an integrated approach to design, construction, and operations that reduces the environmental footprint of buildings compared to standard practices. It is characterized by being greener than average and involves integration across multiple factors, not just limited to energy consumption. The green building approach involves integration across multiple factors and is not limited to just energy consumption. It can be applied to any class of building and aims to improve environmental performance through various techniques and strategies. Green building techniques aim to improve environmental performance through innovative technologies and design features that influence occupant behavior. Decisions on these techniques are made during the design phase and can impact a building's environmental footprint throughout its lifecycle. Green building is commonly applied to new construction but is also increasingly seen in renovation and retrofit projects. Green building techniques focus on improving environmental performance through innovative technologies and design features that influence occupant behavior. The term is often used interchangeably with sustainable building, which aims to maintain small environmental footprints to support future human activity. Green building is typically applied to new construction but is also seen in renovation and retrofit projects. Sustainable building, also known as green building, aims to maintain small environmental footprints to support future human activity and ecosystem functioning. High-performance building, on the other hand, includes factors like security in addition to environmental aspects. Federal statutory definitions emphasize integrating energy efficiency, durability, life-cycle performance, and occupant productivity. High-performance buildings integrate energy efficiency, durability, life-cycle performance, and occupant productivity, as well as other factors such as security. Federal statutory definitions emphasize optimizing all major high-performance attributes on a life cycle basis, including energy conservation, environment, safety, accessibility, cost-benefit, sustainability, functionality, and operational considerations. Additional objectives like aesthetics and historical preservation may also be considered in the design of high-performance buildings. High-performance buildings prioritize energy efficiency, durability, life-cycle performance, occupant productivity, security, and other factors like aesthetics and historical preservation. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established a detailed definition for high-performance green buildings, focusing on elements such as energy and water efficiency. Green building focuses on elements such as energy, water, materials, waste, health, siting, transportation, ecology, and smart growth. The siting element has gained prominence in recent years. Serviceability, productivity, and functionality elements are not commonly explicitly included in descriptions. The focus on green building has expanded to include elements like energy, water, materials, waste, health, siting, transportation, ecology, and smart growth. Serviceability, productivity, and functionality are integral elements of building design, with high-performance buildings also emphasizing disaster and climate resilience objectives. These goals have gained importance following natural disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown. The focus on green building has expanded to include elements like energy, water, materials, waste, health, siting, transportation, ecology, and smart growth. High-performance buildings also emphasize disaster and climate resilience objectives, influenced by natural disasters like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown. Stakeholders prioritize different elements in green building projects based on needs, including a building's expected occupants and local factors like climate zone and flood risk. Reduced energy footprint is a key element of green building, achieved through energy efficiency, conservation, use of renewable energy sources like solar or geothermal power, energy storage technologies, and participation in smart-grid. Local factors such as climate zone and flood risk may influence design priorities. The importance of energy efficiency in green building is highlighted through the use of alternative energy sources like solar or geothermal power, energy storage technologies, and participation in smart-grid innovations. A 2010 study by the National Academies emphasized the potential energy savings from energy efficiency measures in buildings. The 2010 study by the National Academies emphasized the significant energy savings potential in buildings through energy efficiency measures. Federal law mandates energy use reductions in federal buildings, with a 22% decline in energy intensity from 2003 to 2015. Despite this, 2015 consumption exceeded the federal goal. The energy intensity of federal buildings decreased by over 22% from 2003 to 2015, but consumption in 2015 surpassed the federal goal. Energy is often mistakenly seen as the main focus in green building, but solely focusing on energy may not make a building truly green. Reducing water usage in buildings can lead to cost savings and better water resource management. Reducing water usage in buildings can provide cost savings and aid in water resource management, especially in arid areas. Measures like reduced-flow plumbing fixtures, wastewater recycling, and water-efficient landscaping can help achieve these reductions. Water management also involves handling rain, on-site water, and run-off to ensure sustainable practices. Water management in buildings involves reducing water usage through measures like reduced-flow plumbing fixtures, wastewater recycling, and water-efficient landscaping. Low-impact development techniques aim to control stormwater using natural and engineered infiltration and storage methods, such as porous materials, green roofs, and holding ponds. These practices, collectively known as green infrastructure, help mimic natural water handling processes before development. The methods for water management in buildings include reducing impervious surfaces through landscaping, using porous materials, green roofs, holding ponds, swales, and rain gardens. These techniques, known as green infrastructure, can help minimize environmental impact by choosing environmentally preferable materials with recycled content and renewable sources. The choice and use of materials in building construction can significantly impact the environment. Environmentally preferable or green-labelled products, with recycled content or made from renewable resources, can help reduce resource depletion, pollution, and energy consumption. These materials are also designed to minimize health risks from harmful compounds like formaldehyde and VOCs. However, there is ongoing debate about what qualifies as environmentally preferable, highlighting the need for a consistent vocabulary to describe sustainability attributes. The lack of consistent vocabulary and measurement methodologies in eco-labelling systems can make it challenging to determine environmentally preferable materials. Waste-reduction efforts in building construction can mitigate environmental impacts through source reduction, reuse, recycling, and waste-to-energy initiatives. To mitigate environmental impacts in building construction, waste-reduction efforts focus on source reduction, reuse, recycling, and waste-to-energy initiatives. This includes efficient material use, recycling or reusing waste products, landscaping for pollution reduction, and using high-efficiency boilers and furnaces to reduce atmospheric pollutants. Landscaping can reduce chemical pollutants and recycle waste like lawn clippings. High-efficiency boilers reduce atmospheric pollutants. Indoor air quality impacts occupant health due to pollutants like mold, radon, and VOCs. The health impacts of buildings are significant, with indoor air quality (IAQ) playing a crucial role. Factors such as ventilation, air filtration, and materials free of toxic substances are key in maintaining high IAQ. Overall indoor environmental quality (IEQ) includes factors like lighting, climate control, acoustics, and ergonomic design, all of which can impact occupant health. The indoor environmental quality (IEQ) encompasses factors like lighting, climate control, acoustics, and ergonomic design, in addition to IAQ. Site selection for buildings considers environmental footprint and ecological sensitivity to minimize adverse impacts. Hubs can enhance public transportation and reduce reliance on private cars. Site selection considers ecological sensitivity to minimize impacts on native species. Building orientation and proximity to vegetation affect heating and cooling needs. Climate-related risks like sea-level rise and extreme weather are crucial for coastal builders. Green building incorporates risk factors such as sea-level rise, flooding, and extreme weather events, which are of increasing concern to builders, especially in coastal areas. Productivity and utility are important aspects of green building, with studies showing that indoor environmental quality (IEQ) can impact worker comfort and productivity in offices. Green buildings have been linked to improved productivity among workers. Serviceability is an important aspect of green building design that is often overlooked. Studies suggest that indoor environmental quality (IEQ) can significantly affect worker comfort and productivity in offices. While green buildings have been associated with increased productivity, there are instances where trade-offs between serviceability and other elements, such as poor acoustic performance, have been observed. This highlights the need to consider serviceability as a key objective in high-performance green buildings. Resistance to hazards like earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, and fires can enhance a building's lifespan and functionality during service disruptions. Resilience strategies include sturdy construction, placing critical components above flood levels, and on-site power generation. Approaches to resilience in building design include resistant construction, locating critical components away from flood waters, on-site power generation, rainwater harvesting, and water recycling. Climate-resilient design focuses on preparing for severe weather events and climate change. Green building emphasizes integration. Green building, as defined in Executive Order 13693, focuses on assets designed to withstand severe weather events and climate change. Integration is a key feature, considering elements and stages to improve performance and minimize environmental impacts throughout the building's lifecycle. This approach leads to better assessment of a building's overall environmental impact and allows for balance among different factors. The focus on green building involves considering elements and stages to improve performance and minimize environmental impacts throughout the building's lifecycle. This approach allows for better assessment of overall environmental impact, balance among competing goals, and integration of different elements and stages. The use of information technology in building operations can enhance integration and performance. The appropriate use of information technology in building operations can enhance performance across various elements. For example, improving energy efficiency by sealing the building envelope can lead to increased pollutants and moisture issues. Balancing energy efficiency and health requires compromises or technologies like active ventilation with heat exchange. The concentration of pollutants in buildings can lead to mold growth and material deterioration. Balancing energy efficiency and health may require compromises or technologies like active ventilation with heat exchange. A green building approach forces an examination of how actions impact each element for overall optimization. In some cases, only a few factors can be addressed, while in others, prioritizing certain elements may be necessary due to cost or feasibility constraints. Overall optimization can be achieved by prioritizing certain elements in green building approaches. In some cases, only a few factors can be addressed due to constraints. Focusing on only one stage in a building's life cycle can lead to savings but also losses. For example, the environmental impacts of alternative building materials may not be fully understood. Use of concrete walls provides better insulation. In the absence of sufficient data on the environmental impacts of alternative building materials, a choice that seems environmentally sound may not be. Concrete walls provide better insulation than wood but have higher carbon dioxide emissions. Energy use during building operation is higher than construction, so choices must consider postoccupancy. Green building approaches assess impacts across all stages to reduce problems. A green building approach can reduce problems by assessing impacts across all stages of construction and postoccupancy. Elements like environmentally preferable products can affect occupant health and productivity. On-site renewable energy generation prepares buildings for power outages, while stormwater management provides ecological services. Buildings with on-site renewable energy generation can function during power outages, like after a natural disaster. On-site stormwater management facilitates ecological services. Systems and tools have been developed to assess green and sustainable buildings, falling into rating systems, certifications, standards, and codes. Determining a building's green or sustainable status is complex due to the interconnected elements involved. In the 1990s, professional organizations in the building sector developed rating and certification systems to standardize green building practices and raise public awareness. The term rating system is often used interchangeably with certification system, although they refer to somewhat different concepts. The building sector developed rating and certification systems like LEED to standardize green building practices and raise public awareness. Rating systems assign points based on green building criteria, leading to certification at different tiers indicating the level of criteria met. Rating and certification systems assign points to buildings based on green building criteria, resulting in an overall score and certification at different tiers. Certification validates that a building meets specified design or performance requirements and is most objective when conducted by an independent third party. Several organizations offer rating and certification for green buildings. The most prevalent certification system for green buildings in the United States is LEED, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) in 1998. LEED quickly became a benchmark for green building design, with the number of certifications increasing annually since 2000. LEED, established in 1998, is a widely recognized green building certification system. Over 37,300 commercial buildings worldwide have been LEED certified as of April 2017. USGBC offers certifications for various building categories including new construction, existing buildings, interiors, homes, schools, retail, healthcare, neighborhoods, and more. Operations and maintenance certification is also available for existing buildings. LEED certification covers various building types including new commercial construction, existing buildings, interiors, homes, schools, retail, healthcare, neighborhoods, and more. It also includes operations and maintenance certification for existing buildings with a five-year recertification cycle. LEED focuses on six green building elements and has credit categories for innovation and regional priority considerations. LEED certification covers different building types and focuses on six green building elements: sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, and indoor environmental quality. Buildings must meet mandatory requirements and earn a certain number of points to achieve certification levels: Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. The checklist approach, while criticized, allows for a simple assessment of compliance. The LEED rating system allows buildings to earn certification levels based on a total score, with options for Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. This checklist approach, criticized by some, simplifies compliance assessment and promotes integrated consideration of green building elements. Other certification systems in the US include BREEAM, a British system developed in 1990. The LEED v4 rating system was released in 2013. Another certification system in the US is BREEAM, a British system introduced in 1990. BREEAM In-Use, an online rating system for existing commercial buildings, has no prerequisites and offers ratings from Acceptable to Excellent. BREEAM In-Use is an online rating system for existing commercial building performance, with ratings ranging from Acceptable to Outstanding. It evaluates a building's performance across nine impact categories and requires annual certification renewal. Green Globes, developed in Canada, is based on BREEAM and has its own associated standard. Green Globes, developed in Canada by the Green Building Initiative, is a certification system for buildings based on BREEAM. It awards between one and four Globes based on points earned across six elements. Certification must be renewed annually. The Green Globes certification system, like BREEAM In-Use, awards points across six elements without mandatory provisions. The Living Building Challenge offers three certifications based on performance areas called \"Petals\". Living Building Certification, Petal Certification, and Zero Energy Building Certification are the certifications available. Criteria for certification fall into seven performance areas known as \"Petals\": place, water, energy, health and happiness, materials, equity, and beauty. Living Building Certification requires meeting requirements in all seven areas, Petal Certification requires compliance with at least three Petals including water, energy, or materials, and Zero Energy Certification requires generating all energy needs on site without combustion. Unlike new-building certification, which occurs upon completion of construction, these certifications have specific criteria to be met. Living Building Challenge certification requires meeting requirements in all seven performance areas known as \"Petals\", while Petal Certification requires compliance with at least three Petals including water, energy, or materials. Zero Energy Certification requires generating all energy needs on site without combustion. Certification under the Living Building Challenge also includes a 12-month assessment of actual building performance. Different green building ratings systems emphasize different aspects, and the choice may depend on local conditions and priorities. Different green building certification systems focus on various aspects and types of buildings. Some systems are geared towards new construction, while others are more for existing buildings. In addition to comprehensive green certification systems, there are also programs like Energy Star, Indoor airPLUS, WaterSense, and Zero Energy Ready Home that certify specific environmental performance areas. Several federal statutes and policies impose green building requirements on federal offices and agencies, with some agencies using third-party green building certification systems since the late 1990s. Certification programs include Energy Star, Indoor airPLUS, WaterSense, Zero Energy Ready Home, and Passive House/ PHIUS+. Buildings may be separately certified under multiple programs. The General Services Administration (GSA) recommends federal agencies use third-party green certification systems to meet green building requirements. Benefits include simplifying compliance, reducing the need for additional staff, and providing a recognizable label for sustainability efforts. Several agencies have found benefits in using third-party certification systems, including simplifying compliance with federal guidelines, reducing the need for additional staff, and providing a recognizable label for sustainability efforts. EISA required the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA and the Department of Defense, to identify a third-party certification system that encourages a comprehensive and environmentally-sound approach to certification of green buildings. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with GSA and the Department of Defense, is tasked with identifying a third-party certification system for green buildings. As of 2013, GSA recommended the use of either LEED or Green Globes for federal agencies. The Director of GSA's Office of Federal High-Performance Green Buildings, established by EISA, recommended federal agencies use LEED or Green Globes for new construction. The 2014 Department of Energy rule sets minimum criteria for certification systems eligible for federal use. The 2014 Department of Energy rule sets minimum criteria for green building certification systems eligible for federal use, with many states and local jurisdictions also requiring certification for government and commercial buildings. Some jurisdictions offer incentives for green building certifications. Green building rating and certification systems have influenced model building codes and standards, which may be mandatory. Comprehensive green building codes and standards address multiple elements, excluding energy efficiency. Building codes and standards, including green building codes, set minimum requirements for building design and construction. They cover various aspects such as health, safety, aesthetics, and resource use. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a baseline for energy efficiency in building codes, with state and local governments responsible for additional requirements. Green building codes go beyond federally mandated minimum requirements and are determined by state and local governments. Many jurisdictions adopt national model codes for regulating buildings. These codes specify additional environmental design and performance requirements. Green building codes, also known as \"beyond-code\" or \"above-code\" options, exceed minimum building code requirements and can be mandatory or voluntary measures for meeting green building objectives. They often incorporate technical standards for specific components or features. Model codes can choose to make green building standards mandatory or voluntary for meeting objectives. These codes often include technical standards created by recognized organizations. Buildings meeting a standard can be certified as having met its criteria. The Whole Building Design Guide defines a standard as \"a set of guidelines and criteria against which a product can be judged.\" Buildings meeting a standard may be certified as having met its criteria through various pathways such as prescriptive, performance, or outcome-based requirements. Green building standards are often described as code-intended, meaning they are written in mandatory, code-enforceable language. They can be adopted by jurisdictions as they are or with modifications. Standards and codes are developed through a consensus process involving multiple stakeholders. The International Code Council (ICC) and ASHRAE are the main developers of national green building model codes and standards in the United States. These codes and standards are written in mandatory, code-enforceable language and may be adopted by jurisdictions with or without modifications. ANSI accreditation ensures that the development process adheres to approved procedures, and third-party certification is required for ANSI standards. The International Code Council (ICC) and ASHRAE are the main developers of national green building model codes and standards in the United States. The ICC released the International Green Construction Code (IgCC) in 2012, which includes sustainability measures for the entire construction project and its site. The IgCC functions as an overlay code. The International Green Construction Code (IgCC) was released in 2012 by the ICC as the first model code to include sustainability measures for construction projects and sites. It functions as an overlay code that can be adopted alongside other ICC codes. Municipalities can choose from various compliance pathways and options to adjust requirements based on local factors. The most recent revision was in 2015. The IgCC, released in 2012, can be adopted as an overlay code with various compliance pathways. It covers most building types except low-rise residential buildings, which are referred to the ICC 700 National Green Building Standard (NGBS). The NGBS is structured as a rating system and can be adopted by ordinance. The NGBS, developed in partnership with ASHRAE and NAHB, is a green building standard that can be adopted by ordinance. ASHRAE, USGBC, and IES have jointly released Standard 189.1 for nonresidential and residential buildings over three stories, which functions as a code-intended standard. It covers site sustainability, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and water-use efficiency. Standard 189.1 is a code-intended standard for buildings over three stories, covering site sustainability, energy efficiency, renewable energy, water-use efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and building impacts. It has been integrated into Department of Defense properties and will be the technical content of the 2018 version of the IgCC, aligned with the LEED rating system. The ICC and ASHRAE partnership integrated Standard 189.1 into the 2018 version of the IgCC, aligning it with the LEED rating system. Various state, local, and tribal authorities have their own green building codes, while federal laws and policy instruments also have provisions related to green building. Several federal laws, executive orders, and policy instruments have provisions related to green building. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 requires agencies to procure products with recycled content. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 contained incentives and requirements for efficient use of energy and water. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT 1992) included incentives and requirements for energy and water efficiency in federal, commercial, and residential buildings. It also addressed state building energy codes, energy efficiency in federal buildings, mortgages for energy-efficient housing, development of energy-efficient technologies, and requirements for appliances and building materials.

The rise of green building since the 1990s has raised questions about its impacts, including market penetration, cost, building performance, measurement science, legislative goals, and implementation. The building industry in the U.S. is a significant part of the economy, with construction and renovation work exceeding $1 trillion in 2016. Green building has seen substantial growth in recent years, driven by various factors such as government requirements and investment opportunities. Key issues in green building include market penetration, cost, building performance, measurement science, legislative goals, and implementation. Green building in the U.S. has grown significantly, accounting for over 6% of GDP. The market share for green construction has increased from 2% in 2005 to 20% in 2013, outpacing general construction spending. Green construction spending in the United States has been growing faster than general construction spending, tripling from $39 billion in 2008 to $129 billion in 2014. Green building activities are projected to generate $303.4 billion in GDP between 2015 and 2018, with new institutional construction driving growth due to certification requirements. The percentage of certified-green floorspace is also increasing. The National Green Building Adoption Index has reported a rise in the percentage of office space certified by LEED or Energy Star from 5% in 2005 to 38% in 2016 for the 30 largest U.S. office markets. Residential and commercial building stock in the U.S. not constructed according to green building criteria remains significant. The percentage of office space certified by LEED or Energy Star in the 30 largest U.S. office markets increased from 5% in 2005 to 38% in 2016. However, a large portion of U.S. residential and commercial buildings were not built according to green building criteria, making rapid retrofitting or replacement challenging. Green building efforts can impact a building's financial performance through construction costs, operating expenses, rental rates, and property values. The costs of implementing green building measures influence design and construction decisions, but information on true costs is not always readily available. The costs of implementing green building measures can impact design and construction decisions, affecting initial construction costs, operating expenses, rental rates, and property values. However, obtaining information on true costs can be challenging, leading to distorted perceptions about the economic benefits of green building. Generalizing about the cost performance of the market segment as a whole is difficult due to the flexibility in designing individual green buildings, resulting in limited empirical evidence on the financial performance of green building investments. The flexibility in designing individual green buildings makes it difficult to generalize about the cost performance of the market segment as a whole. Empirical evidence on the financial performance of green building investments is limited. Higher initial costs are a common obstacle for green building, with features like high-efficiency appliances and high-performance windows contributing to these costs. Cost is a top obstacle for green building in the United States, with higher costs stemming from various sources such as high-efficiency appliances and design costs. However, evidence suggests that construction costs for green buildings are comparable to standard construction. The costs for constructing green buildings are not substantially higher than standard construction. A DOE review concluded that green building costs are comparable to conventional buildings. Integrated design may reduce initial costs, and operational cost savings can recoup any higher investment. Green buildings can save on utility resources and even sell renewable energy back. Green building advocates argue that operational cost savings will offset higher initial investment. Green buildings can save on utility resources and sell renewable energy back to the grid, leading to significant savings. The GSA saved over $340 million in energy and water costs from efficiency improvements. Studies show that green certification is linked to reduced utility expenses, although utility costs only make up 19% of a commercial building's operating costs. Several studies support the idea that green certification can lower utility expenses, but it's uncertain if it reduces overall operating costs. Green-labeled buildings can command higher prices in the real estate market. However, some factors may discourage investments in green building, such as homeowners frequently moving. Investments in green building can be deterred by factors like homeowners moving frequently, reducing the time for return on investment. The financial return for owners depends on the premium they can charge tenants, while tenants' return relies on their tenure length. The financial return on green building investments for owners depends on the premium they can charge tenants, while tenants' return relies on their tenure length. Constraints on capital availability may limit potential beneficiaries of green building renovations. Constraints on capital availability may limit potential beneficiaries of green building renovations, such as educational institutions, hospitals, and municipalities. Cost barriers may decrease as green building practices become more widespread, with financial incentives from states and municipalities making investments more financially attractive. Observers suggest considering costs beyond monetary expenditures. Green building investments may have higher initial costs, but financial incentives from states and municipalities can help offset these expenses. The \"triple bottom line\" concept considers social and environmental returns in addition to financial ones. Evaluating green building efforts involves distinguishing between design and performance, with a focus on rating systems like LEED. In assessing business performance, it is important to consider social and environmental returns along with financial ones. Green building efforts need to differentiate between design and performance, with a focus on factors that can impact a building's environmental performance post-certification. After receiving a green rating, various factors like maintenance, alterations, and changes in use can affect a building's performance. Certified green buildings may not always outperform conventional ones, as some have shown to be resource-intensive post-occupancy. Studies have shown that certified green buildings may not always perform significantly better than conventional buildings, with some examples being resource-intensive post-occupancy. Green building efforts have helped reduce energy-use intensity in U.S. homes built since 2000, but larger home sizes offset some of the energy savings. The energy performance of green buildings has been scrutinized, revealing a significant gap between predicted and actual energy use. Closing this performance gap is a key concern in the construction industry. The \"performance gap\" between predicted and measured energy use in buildings is a key concern in the construction industry. Rating systems like LEED now require postoccupancy performance assessment to address this issue. The LEED rating system addresses critiques by requiring building-level energy and water meters for post-certification monitoring. Other systems like BREEAM In-Use and Living Building Certification include performance parameters in their criteria. Building codes are also shifting towards outcome-based compliance for energy usage. Building codes are evolving to include performance outcomes, such as the 2015 IgCC's outcome-based compliance pathway for energy usage. Commissioning building systems ensures they are designed, installed, and operated as planned, improving environmental performance, especially for energy use in both new and existing buildings. Commissioning improves environmental performance, especially for energy use in new and existing buildings. Organizations can also develop an environmental management system (EMS) with international standards for certification, including commitments to improve environmental performance and prevent pollution. An organization must have an explicit environmental policy with commitments to conform to relevant requirements, improve environmental performance, and prevent pollution. Performance measurement in EMS can help meet these commitments. Networked building monitoring tools allow early fault detection and resource use analytics for effective response to changing patterns in real time. The use of networked building monitoring tools allows for early fault detection and resource use analytics, enabling building managers to respond effectively to changing patterns in real time. GSAlink, a building diagnostic tool developed by GSA, has identified over 33,000 instances of sub-optimal equipment performance within GSA holdings. Recent studies have shown a lack of consensus on defining green building criteria and measuring outcomes, making it challenging to compare results. Green buildings exhibit a wide range of energy performance, with some falling below design expectations. The selected studies primarily use LEED ratings for inclusion, limiting information on buildings constructed under other rating systems. The selected studies primarily use LEED ratings as criteria for inclusion. A study of over 100 LEED-certified buildings found they performed 24% better on average in energy use compared to other buildings, but some performed worse. Criticisms included sample bias and inappropriate baselines. A follow-up assessment using the same data found that primary energy savings from LEED certification were nonexistent for lower levels of certification and 13% better than average for Gold and Platinum-certified buildings. A GSA study of 22 green federal buildings, most of which had received LEED certification, showed that these buildings outperformed the national average in energy use, water use, operating costs, occupant satisfaction, and carbon emissions. A study of 22 green federal buildings, mostly LEED-certified, found they performed better than the national average in energy use, water use, operating costs, occupant satisfaction, and carbon emissions. However, some buildings did not meet federal energy consumption requirements, with most consuming more electricity than the national average. The study found that 9 out of 11 buildings did not meet federal energy consumption requirements, with most consuming more electricity than the national average. Arizona's LEED-certified new construction buildings also underperformed in energy use compared to simulations, indicating a disconnect between strategies employed and modeling results. These findings suggest that LEED certification may not consistently improve performance. The findings suggest a disconnect between strategies employed and modeling results in LEED-certified buildings, with insufficient evidence to conclude consistent energy consumption reductions. Limited sample sizes and proprietary performance data hinder comprehensive assessments, highlighting the need for greater access to building performance data. Performance data for green buildings is often proprietary, hindering comprehensive evaluations. Access to this data is crucial for assessing environmental targets and improving them. While some aspects like energy and water use are easily quantifiable, others may be more challenging to measure accurately. Methods for measuring the performance of green buildings are not well-developed for most elements. Some, like energy and water use, are easy to quantify through metering, while others may require qualitative evaluation. Disagreements may arise on which metrics are most relevant, such as energy use intensity (EUI). There may be disagreements on which metrics are most relevant for measuring energy usage in green buildings. The Green Building Advisory Committee has proposed new methodologies for measuring energy use intensity (EUI), including energy use per occupant and area-based EUI measuring energy used in commuter transportation. Different metrics can lead to varying perceptions of a building's energy use patterns. The Advisory Committee notes that different metrics for measuring energy usage in green buildings can lead to varying perceptions of energy use patterns. A study by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory warns that inaccurate building occupancy data could complicate efforts to calculate occupancy-adjusted EUI. Commonly accepted metrics like Energy Star scores may not be highly correlated with intended outcomes. Performance measurement is crucial for buildings with longer life expectancies. Accepted metrics, such as Energy Star scores, may not accurately measure outcomes. Regular performance measurement is crucial for maintaining environmental performance over a building's lifespan. EISA mandates federal agencies to measure building performance against energy use targets, especially for new construction. EISA mandates federal agencies to measure building performance against energy use targets, with more stringent requirements for new construction. Challenges exist in accurately determining baseline energy consumption levels, despite available resources and options for measurement. Measurement of energy use in green building can be challenging due to uncertainties and gaps in data availability. Consensus on measurement goals and metrics may be lacking, making effective application difficult. Developing appropriate measurement science is a top research need for progress in green building, with a focus on creating metrics and tools for measuring building sustainability. The National Science and Technology Council identified the need for appropriate measurement science in green building research. The National Institute of Standards and Technology prioritizes developing metrics and tools for measuring building sustainability. Agency progress towards federally mandated green building goals varies, with the Obama Administration releasing annual sustainability and energy scorecards for each agency. Scorecards track progress in Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emission Reductions, Scope 3 GHG Emission Reductions, and Reduction in Energy. The Obama Administration released annual sustainability and energy scorecards for agencies with sustainability reporting requirements. The scorecards tracked agency progress towards federal sustainability goals in various areas such as GHG emission reductions, energy intensity reduction, renewable energy use, water intensity reduction, fleet petroleum use reduction, and green buildings. The scorecards included numeric reports and color scores indicating progress status. The Obama Administration released annual sustainability and energy scorecards for agencies with sustainability reporting requirements, tracking progress towards federal sustainability goals in various areas. The scorecards included numeric reports and color scores indicating progress status, with green, yellow, or red indicating different levels of achievement. Federal progress towards three buildings-related goals is discussed, with agencies aiming to meet or make progress towards targets. See Table 2 for agency progress details. The Obama Administration released annual sustainability and energy scorecards for agencies with sustainability reporting requirements, tracking progress towards federal sustainability goals. Federal progress towards three buildings-related goals is discussed, with agencies aiming to meet or make progress towards targets. Some agencies have already surpassed the green building goal of 15% compliance by FY2025, while others are still working towards it. Several agencies have achieved compliance in fewer than 2% of buildings, with some receiving a red score in the green buildings category for FY2015. Several agencies have not met the Energy Intensity Goal set by EISA to reduce energy intensity by 30% from 2003 levels by 2015. Government-wide energy intensity only declined by 22% during this period. E.O. 13693 directs agencies to reduce energy intensity by 2.5% per year relative to 2015, with progress starting to be reported from FY2016. E.O. 13514 set a goal for a 26% reduction in potable water intensity between 2007 and 2020. E.O. 13693 directs agencies to reduce energy intensity by 2.5% per year starting from FY2016. The goal for potable water intensity reduction was changed in 2015 to a 36% reduction from 2007 levels by 2025. Many agencies have made progress towards this new goal. Some concerns have been raised about green building initiatives. Some agencies have achieved the earlier goal of reducing energy intensity by 2.5% per year, with progress towards a 36% reduction in potable water intensity by 2025. Concerns have been raised about green building initiatives, particularly regarding rating and certification systems' lack of performance metric caps and integrative design criteria. Some critics argue that sustainability claims in green building initiatives are relative due to the lack of caps on performance metrics like energy use. They suggest that design criteria should be more integrative and go beyond mere mitigation of environmental impacts to focus on maintenance or enhancement of ecosystem services. This approach would need to extend beyond individual buildings to include other components of the built environment. Some observers worry that builders new to green building may fail to appreciate the importance of taking a forward-thinking, integrative approach to green building design. They may see green building measures as add-ons rather than integral parts of a project. The scientific and technological knowledge base for green building is also limited. The limited scientific and technological knowledge base for green building poses challenges in identifying the most appropriate approaches. Substantial research is needed to improve the knowledge base in all elements of green building, compounded by differences in goals and perspectives among proponents. Identifying objective criteria and approaches is crucial. Improving the knowledge base for green building is crucial, but challenges arise due to differences in goals and perspectives among proponents. Identifying objective criteria, especially for elements like siting, can be difficult. Congress may face questions about the effectiveness of current federal green building programs and coordination methods among agencies. Congress may expect to face questions about the effectiveness of current federal green building programs, coordination methods among agencies, extending federal efforts to support green building adoption, prioritizing elements like siting, and facilitating growth of scientific knowledge in green building. Congress may consider giving more attention to elements of green building, such as siting, and taking actions to facilitate scientific and technical knowledge growth. This could be done through appropriations, new statutory requirements, and tax laws, as well as reviewing agency programs and policies. GAO reports have highlighted various federal efforts in green building, including 94 initiatives across 11 agencies in the nonfederal sector. GAO has released reports on federal efforts in green building, identifying 94 initiatives across 11 agencies. Few initiatives focus on integrative green building, with most concentrating on specific elements like energy or water. Agencies should coordinate to assess initiative performance. Congress should evaluate federal agencies' implementation of green building programs for efficiency and impact. The GAO identified 94 green building initiatives across 11 federal agencies, with a focus on specific elements like energy or water. Congress should evaluate agency coordination and the impact of these programs on green building practices nationwide. Some federal agencies support mortgages for energy efficiency, with lenders becoming Energy Star partners. Congress could consider stronger incentives for green building, funding rebate programs, and specific appropriations. Congress could consider providing stronger mortgage and tax incentives, broadening the scope to include elements of green building, funding rebate programs, and specific appropriations to speed up adoption of green building in areas with low market penetration. Regulatory actions may also be considered, but could be complicated by federalism issues and regional requirements. Identifying ways to enhance current green building efforts in federal agencies is another option for Congress to explore. Congress could consider enhancing current green building efforts in federal agencies, ensuring integration and harmonization across agencies. Energy efficiency is a key focus in green building initiatives. Among the elements of green building, energy efficiency is a key focus in federal agencies. Congress may need to ensure harmonization and balance in green building efforts across agencies to address concerns about fossil fuel imports, climate change, and energy use in buildings. Congress may need to examine the balance and effectiveness of federal green building efforts, considering whether incremental approaches are sufficient or if modifications are needed. This includes exploring the development of scientific and technological knowledge for green building through R&D funding from both federal and private sectors. The development of scientific and technological knowledge for green building is supported by R&D funding from federal and private sectors, but funding levels may be insufficient. Studies have shown that green building receives minimal funding compared to total federal nondefense R&D, and the construction sector invests less in R&D than the industry average. Despite its economic importance, the construction sector invests less in R&D than the industry average, with green building elements receiving varied funding levels. Congress may need to reconsider federal funding priorities and levels to enhance knowledge and integration for successful green building efforts. Congress may need to consider modifying federal funding levels and priorities to enhance knowledge and integration for successful green building efforts. Additionally, creating incentives for increasing private-sector R&D funding and ensuring sufficient training and education for a knowledgeable workforce in relevant areas of expertise may be beneficial for the construction, certification, and operation of green buildings."
