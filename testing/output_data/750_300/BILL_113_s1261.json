    "content": "The \"Energy Efficient Government Technology Act\" may be cited as the short title. It focuses on energy-efficient and energy-saving information and communications technologies. Section 543 of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act is amended to include a Federal Implementation Strategy for Energy-Efficient and Energy-Saving Information and Communications Technologies, requiring collaboration between Federal agencies and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Each Federal agency must collaborate with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to develop a flexible and cost-effective implementation strategy for energy-efficient information and communications technologies. Each Federal agency is required to develop a flexible, cost-effective implementation strategy for energy-efficient information and communications technologies, considering ICT and related infrastructure and practices. The Federal agencies must develop a strategy for energy-efficient information and communications technologies (ICT) and related infrastructure, including advanced metering, ICT services, data center efficiency, power management, and building information modeling. The Federal agencies must develop a strategy for energy-efficient ICT and related infrastructure, including power management, building information modeling, and secure telework tools to realize savings and rewards through increased efficiency. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, shall establish performance goals for evaluating Federal agencies' efforts in improving energy-efficient information use within 180 days of this subsection's enactment. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, will set performance goals to assess Federal agencies' progress in enhancing energy-efficient information and communications technology systems and practices, including specifications and benchmarks for data center operators to make informed energy decisions. The Director, in consultation with the Secretary, will establish specifications and benchmarks for Federal data center operators to improve energy efficiency and cost savings, including an overall target for increased energy efficiency and recommendations for best practices. The performance goals established under this paragraph shall focus on the Power Usage Effectiveness metric, overall asset utilization, and recommendations for achieving benchmarks, including the use of energy savings performance contracting and utility energy services contracting. The performance goals focus on measuring IT costs over 3 to 5 years, cost savings from energy-efficient solutions, and maximizing efficiency. The Director maintains a Governmentwide Data Center Task Force comprised of Federal data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers to focus on energy-efficient and energy-saving solutions, along with providing a complete picture of costs and savings. The Director oversees a Governmentwide Data Center Task Force consisting of Federal data center program managers, facilities managers, and sustainability officers. The task force is responsible for collaborating on achieving agency and Federal energy efficiency goals, as well as sharing best practices and strategic information. The Federal agencies collaborate to achieve energy efficiency goals and exchange best practices with the private sector. Each agency must report their efforts and results as required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The agency must report its efforts and results under this subsection in the annual report of the agency. The Director will also include a description of the agency's efforts in the annual report and scorecard required under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The Director must include in the annual report and scorecard a description of Federal agencies' efforts and results under this subsection. SEC. 3. ENERGY EFFICIENT DATA CENTERS. Section 453 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to designate an information technology industry organization to coordinate a program for energy-efficient government technology. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 designates an IT industry organization to coordinate an energy-efficient government technology program and conduct a study on server and data center energy efficiency. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 designates an IT industry organization to coordinate an energy-efficient government technology program and conduct a study on server and data center energy efficiency. By December 31, 2013, an update to the Report to Congress on Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency is required, including a comparison of estimates from 2007 to 2012 and an analysis of information and communications technologies impact. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates an update to the Report to Congress on Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency by December 31, 2013. This update includes a comparison of estimates from 2007 to 2012, an analysis of information and communications technologies impact, and collaboration with designated organizations. Additionally, the Secretary is required to establish a Data Center Energy Practitioner Program. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates an update to the Report to Congress on Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency by December 31, 2013. This update includes collaboration with designated organizations and the establishment of a Data Center Energy Practitioner Program for evaluating energy usage and efficiency opportunities in data centers. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires federal agencies to have their data centers evaluated every 4 years by certified energy practitioners. Additionally, a new Open Data Initiative is established for collaboration on data center energy efficiency. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates federal data center evaluations every 4 years by certified energy practitioners. A new Open Data Initiative is created for Federal data center energy usage data to promote innovation while safeguarding national security interests. The Secretary will establish an initiative for data center innovation, considering the Data Center Maturity Model. Collaboration will be done to harmonize global specifications and metrics for energy efficiency. An efficiency metric for ICT asset utilization will be developed. The Secretary will establish an initiative for data center innovation, collaborating to develop an efficiency metric for ICT asset utilization."
