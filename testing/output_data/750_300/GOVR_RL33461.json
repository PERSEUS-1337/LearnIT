The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request includes $120 million for the Department of Energy for Yucca Mountain and interim nuclear waste storage, along with an additional $47.7 million for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to resume the licensing process. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request includes $120 million for the Department of Energy for Yucca Mountain and interim nuclear waste storage. An additional $47.7 million was requested for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to resume the licensing process for Yucca Mountain. The House passed an appropriations bill with $100 million more than the Administration requested for Yucca Mountain, but the Senate version includes no Yucca Mountain funding. The House passed an appropriations bill (H.R. 5895) on June 8, 2018, with $100 million more than the Administration's request for Yucca Mountain. The Senate version passed on June 25, 2018, does not include funding for Yucca Mountain. Yucca Mountain is the only site considered by the Department of Energy for a national high-level radioactive waste repository under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. The Obama Administration halted funding for the project in 2010. The Obama Administration halted funding for the Yucca Mountain repository project in 2010 and moved to withdraw the license application submitted to the NRC in 2008. Despite Congress approving the funding halt, NWPA still designates Yucca Mountain as the sole repository candidate site. The Obama Administration then established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to develop a new nuclear waste policy, which issued its final report in 2012. The Obama Administration terminated the Yucca Mountain repository project and established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future to develop a new nuclear waste policy. The commission recommended creating a new organization to develop nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities through a consent-based process involving negotiations with various levels of government. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a \"consent based\" process for siting and regulating nuclear waste facilities, along with long-term research on waste disposal technologies. In response, the DOE issued a Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Nuclear Waste in 2013, calling for a new nuclear waste management entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. The DOE issued a Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Nuclear Waste in 2013, proposing a new nuclear waste management entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. The strategy included plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021, a larger-scale storage facility by 2025, and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. Public meetings were held in 2016, and a draft consent-based siting process was issued in January 2017. The DOE proposed a new nuclear waste management entity in 2013, with plans for a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021, a larger-scale storage facility by 2025, and a geologic disposal facility by 2048. The House approved a bill in 2018 to withdraw the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste disposal. The NRC staff completed the Safety Evaluation Report (SER) for the Yucca Mountain repository in response to a court order. The report concluded that the repository design would comply with safety and environmental standards. The NRC completed the Safety Evaluation Report (SER) for the Yucca Mountain repository in October 2014, determining that the design would meet safety and environmental standards. However, construction authorization was withheld until land and water rights requirements were met, and a supplemental environmental impact statement (EIS) was completed. The supplemental EIS was finished in May 2016, and NRC made the Yucca Mountain licensing documents publicly available. The NRC completed the supplemental EIS for the Yucca Mountain repository in May 2016. Then-NRC Chairman Stephen Burns testified that $330 million in additional appropriations would be needed to complete the licensing process, including adjudicatory hearings on up to 300 issues. The Trump Administration is requesting $47.7 million for NRC licensing activities in FY2019. The Trump Administration is requesting $47.7 million in FY2019 for NRC licensing activities for Yucca Mountain, plus $120 million for DOE to defend its license application for the repository and develop interim storage facilities. The Obama Administration issued a draft plan on December 16, 2016, for a separate underground repository for high-level radioactive waste and spent fuel generated by nuclear defense activities. The Trump Administration is requesting funding for NRC licensing activities for Yucca Mountain and DOE to defend its license application for the repository. A proposed defense-only repository for high-level radioactive waste from nuclear defense activities could be easier to site, license, and construct compared to a combined defense-civilian repository. DOE concluded in a 2014 report that defense waste constitutes a small portion of total high-level waste volumes and radioactivity. The Department of Energy (DOE) concluded in a 2014 report that defense waste makes up a small portion of total high-level waste volumes and radioactivity. A defense-only nuclear waste repository could potentially be sited and developed outside the Nuclear Waste Policy Act framework, but would still need to comply with NWPA requirements and be licensed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The DOE's draft plan estimated that disposal of defense waste could begin about 22 years after a consent-based siting process were started. However, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) raised concerns about the cost and schedule of the defense-only repository in a report issued in January 2017. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) criticized DOE's analysis of the defense-only repository in a report, highlighting major cost omissions and an overly optimistic schedule. Republican leaders criticized DOE's plan as a diversion from progress on Yucca Mountain. Legislation introduced would halt development of a defense-only repository until NRC decides on Yucca Mountain. Legislation introduced (H.R. 433) aims to block a defense-only repository until NRC decides on Yucca Mountain. Similar provisions are included in H.R. 3053. DOE is authorized to develop consent-based pilot interim storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel under H.R. 5895. The FY2019 appropriations bill (H.R. 5895) passed by the Senate on June 25, 2018, includes provisions for spent nuclear fuel storage. Priority for storage at pilot facilities would be given to fuel from closed nuclear plant sites. DOE would need consent from the governor, local jurisdictions, and affected Indian tribes to select a site. Reporting to Congress on compensation for host jurisdictions and recommendations for a mechanism would be required. The Senate's FY2019 appropriations bill includes provisions for spent nuclear fuel storage, requiring consent from the governor, local jurisdictions, and affected Indian tribes for site selection. DOE must report to Congress on compensation for host jurisdictions and recommendations for a mechanism to ensure timely transfer of waste to a permanent repository. The Senate's FY2019 appropriations bill includes provisions for consent-based pilot programs for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel. The House passed a nuclear waste bill (H.R. 3053) authorizing DOE to store fuel at interim storage facilities with consent from the governor and local government. The House passed a nuclear waste bill (H.R. 3053) authorizing DOE to store spent nuclear fuel at interim storage facilities with consent from the governor, local government, and affected Indian tribes. In the 114th Congress, bipartisan legislation (S. 854) was introduced to implement major BRC recommendations for nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. The Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2015 (S. 854) was introduced by Senator Lamar Alexander to establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration for finding nuclear waste storage and disposal sites with consent from state and local officials and Indian tribes. Holtec International filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. Holtec International plans to build a spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The facility will hold 10,000 canisters of spent fuel in below-grade concrete silos, developed in 20 phases over 20 years. Waste Control Specialists filed an NRC license application for the project. The waste management company Waste Control Specialists (WCS) filed an application for an NRC license to develop an interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. WCS later formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners and submitted a renewed application for the Texas facility. WCS filed an NRC license application for a spent fuel storage facility in Texas but later formed a joint venture with Orano USA. The proposed facility would be built near Andrews, TX, with local support. WCS requested a suspension of the license application citing high licensing costs. WCS proposed a spent fuel storage facility in Texas with DOE taking title to spent fuel and paying WCS for storage for up to 40 years. WCS argues that a privately developed facility would not be bound by NWPA restrictions. The House passed legislation (H.R. 3053) allowing DOE to contract with non-federal interim storage facilities for spent fuel, similar to bills introduced in previous Congresses. H.R. 474, introduced by Representative Issa in January 2017, is similar to bills introduced in the 114th Congress but not enacted. DOE would take title to spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors for private storage, using interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget requested new Yucca Mountain funding, not approved by Congress. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget requested new Yucca Mountain funding, not approved by Congress. For FY2019, the Administration is seeking funding for Yucca Mountain: DOE would receive $110 million to seek an NRC license for the repository, and NRC would receive $47.7 million to consider DOE's application. DOE would also receive $10 million to develop interim nuclear waste storage facilities, with a total of $120 million in nuclear waste funding for FY2019 coming from two appropriations accounts. DOE's application for Yucca Mountain funding includes $110 million for an NRC license and $10 million for interim storage facilities. The total funding for FY2019 is $120 million from two appropriations accounts. The funding is part of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, combined with other bills in H.R. 5895. The House passed the bill with $100 million more than requested for Yucca Mountain. The Water Development Appropriations bill, combined with other bills in H.R. 5895 for FY2019, passed the House with $100 million more than requested for Yucca Mountain. The Senate version of the bill, however, included no Yucca Mountain funding, continuing a pattern of funding uncertainty. In 2018, there was no Yucca Mountain funding approved, following a pattern of uncertainty in recent years. The Department of Energy stopped collecting nuclear waste fees in 2014 due to a court ruling, totaling about $750 million per year. The U.S. Court of Appeals had ordered the DOE to halt fee collection for waste disposal, citing program uncertainty. The NWPA authorized fees on nuclear power for waste disposal, totaling about $750 million per year. The court ruled that DOE's waste plans are too vague for accurate cost estimates, with an uncertainty range of nearly $7 trillion. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program. The court criticized DOE's vague waste plans, citing an uncertainty range of nearly $7 trillion for cost estimates. The Trump Administration aimed to restart the Yucca Mountain program and conduct a new cost assessment for determining the nuclear waste fee. NRC approved a final rule on continued storage of spent nuclear fuel in August 2014. The NRC approved a final rule in August 2014 for continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, replacing the earlier \"waste confidence\" rule. The court had struck down the waste confidence rule in 2012, citing concerns about safe disposal of nuclear waste. The court ruled that the NRC should have conducted an environmental review before issuing waste confidence findings in 2010. This led to a halt in licensing new nuclear facilities generating radioactive waste. After the court struck down the waste confidence rule, NRC halted licensing of new facilities generating radioactive waste. NRC approved the continued storage rule in August 2014, ending the suspension of final licensing decisions for new reactors and spent fuel storage facilities. A consolidated lawsuit against NRC's continued storage rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals in June 2016. NRC proposed a modification of its low-level waste disposal regulations in March 2015. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected a lawsuit by states and environmental groups to overturn NRC's continued storage rule on June 3, 2016. NRC proposed changes to its low-level waste disposal regulations in March 2015, with final revisions issued by the commission in September 2017. The NRC staff submitted final regulations for commission approval on September 15, 2016, but further revisions were issued on September 8, 2017. The regulations aim to establish time periods for technical analyses of low-level waste sites to protect the general population. Nuclear waste disposal remains a significant challenge for the industry. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act focuses on Yucca Mountain, NV, as a repository for highly radioactive waste, despite strong opposition from the State of Nevada due to safety concerns. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended in 1987, mandates DOE to designate Yucca Mountain, NV, as a deep underground repository for nuclear waste. Despite Nevada's opposition citing safety concerns like volcanic activity and earthquakes, DOE under the Bush Administration deemed Yucca Mountain suitable for licensing, submitting an application to the NRC in 2008. The DOE determined Yucca Mountain suitable for a repository under the Bush Administration, submitting a license application to the NRC in 2008. The Obama Administration later decided not to open the repository due to Nevada's opposition, despite requesting funding to continue the licensing process. The Obama Administration reversed the decision to continue licensing the Yucca Mountain repository, leading to a complete halt in funding and closure of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. The Yucca Mountain project was shut down at the end of FY2010. President Trump intends to restart the Yucca Mountain licensing process, requesting $120 million for Yucca Mountain and interim waste storage in his FY2019 budget submission to Congress on February 12, 2018. DOE would receive $110 million to seek an NRC license for the repository, and NRC would receive $47.7 million to consider DOE's proposal. President Trump's FY2019 budget submission to Congress on February 12, 2018, includes $110 million for DOE to seek an NRC license for the Yucca Mountain repository. Additionally, NRC would receive $47.7 million to consider DOE's application, and $10 million would be allocated for interim nuclear waste storage facilities. Under the Obama Administration, DOE had filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application on March 3, 2010, with strong support. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application on March 3, 2010, \"with prejudice,\" meaning it could not be resubmitted in the future. The motion received support from Nevada but faced opposition from states with defense-related and civilian radioactive waste. State utility regulators also intervened, arguing that dismissing the application would hinder the government's obligation to dispose of the nation's spent nuclear waste. State utility regulators filed a motion to intervene on March 15, 2010, opposing the dismissal of the Yucca Mountain application, citing the government's obligation to dispose of nuclear waste. The ASLB denied DOE's license withdrawal motion on June 29, 2010, stating that the NWPA prevents withdrawal until NRC determines the repository's acceptability. NRC commissioners upheld this decision on September 9, 2011, but further consideration was halted due to budget constraints. Lawsuits were filed to challenge the Yucca Mountain project. The NRC commissioners sustained the ASLB decision on the Yucca Mountain license application, but further consideration was stopped due to budget constraints. Lawsuits were filed to overturn the license withdrawal, and the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that NRC must continue work on the application as long as funding is available. NRC directed its staff to complete the application in response to the court's decision. The NRC was directed by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2013 to continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding is available. NRC issued the final two volumes of the Yucca Mountain safety evaluation report in January. The NRC issued the final two volumes of the Yucca Mountain safety evaluation report in January 2015, concluding that the repository design would comply with safety and environmental standards for 1 million years. NRC stated that construction should not be authorized until all land and water rights requirements were met and a supplement to the environmental impact statement was completed. The supplemental EIS was finished in May 2016, and the Yucca Mountain licensing documents were made publicly available. After halting the Yucca Mountain project in 2010, the Obama Administration established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future (BRC) to develop alternative waste disposal strategies. NRC Chairman Stephen Burns testified that $330 million in additional appropriations would be needed to complete the licensing process for Yucca Mountain. The Obama Administration established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future (BRC) after halting the Yucca Mountain project in 2010. The BRC recommended creating a new organization to develop nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities using a \"consent based\" process for site selection. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future recommended creating a new organization for developing nuclear waste repositories and storage facilities through a \"consent based\" process. In response, the DOE issued a strategy for managing and disposing of nuclear waste, calling for a new entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites. A pilot interim spent fuel storage facility was planned to open by 2021. The DOE strategy in January 2013 proposed a new nuclear waste management entity to develop consent-based storage and disposal sites, following the BRC recommendation. Plans included opening a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021 and a larger-scale storage facility by 2025. A geologic disposal facility was scheduled to open by 2048, with public input sought to address various issues. The DOE initiated a consent-based siting process for the Yucca Mountain repository after delays. Public comment was sought on the process, with key issues including fairness, site-selection models, participant roles, information requirements, and other concerns. A draft siting process with five phases was issued in January 2017. DOE issued a draft consent-based siting process in January 2017 with five phases: initiation and community outreach, preliminary site assessment, and detailed site assessment. Legislation would authorize a waste management agency to conduct the process and provide grants to interested communities. Phase 2 involves a preliminary site assessment taking 1-2 years for interim storage and 2-4 years for a permanent repository. Phase 3 includes a detailed site assessment lasting 2-4 years for interim storage and 5-10 years for a repository. Communities with suitable sites would then decide on hosting storage or disposal facilities in Phase 4, which involves negotiating a siting agreement approved by all required parties. Phase 4 involves negotiating a siting agreement for interim storage and repository, lasting 1-2 years and 2-5 years respectively. Phase 5 includes licensing, construction, operation, and closure, estimated to take up to 5 years for interim storage and 15 years for a repository. The Trump Administration's proposal to restart the Yucca Mountain project in FY2019 would provide funding for the program. The Trump Administration's proposal to restart the Yucca Mountain project in FY2019 includes funding for a Yucca Mountain program office, legal and technical support for the license application to NRC, and management of documents. $10 million is requested for interim storage planning and waste shipment preparations. The nuclear power industry supports NRC's licensing review of Yucca. The Administration's request for $10 million for interim storage includes planning for storage services, transportation, and waste shipments. The nuclear power industry supports NRC's licensing review of Yucca Mountain and alternative storage options. The industry policy statement suggests a target date for opening a repository site within 20 years of a consolidated storage site. Geologic disposal safety depends on rock characteristics. The safety of geologic disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste depends on rock formations. Worldwide consensus favors geologic isolation for long-term waste management. The best long-term option for dealing with high-level radioactive waste is geologic isolation, but specific sites face challenges like water intrusion and earthquake vulnerability that could release dangerous levels of radioactivity into the environment. The Department of Energy's proposed high-level waste sites have faced flaws like water intrusion and earthquake vulnerability, raising concerns about potential radioactive releases. President Obama's budgets included research on technologies to address these challenges. President Obama's budgets for FY2017 and previous years included research on technologies to reduce nuclear waste volume and toxicity. The Bush Administration proposed reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to recycle long-lived elements like plutonium, but this method is controversial due to cost concerns and potential weapons use. The Obama Administration focused on research to reduce nuclear waste volume and toxicity, while the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget reduced funding for nuclear spent fuel reprocessing. President Bush recommended the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste disposal in 2002. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget would reduce DOE funding for nuclear spent fuel reprocessing. President Bush recommended the Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste disposal in 2002, despite Nevada Governor Guinn's state veto. The Yucca Mountain site was approved by Congress and signed into law by President Bush in 2002 for nuclear waste disposal. Low-level waste from nuclear power plants, medical institutions, and research activities is currently disposed of in trenches in South Carolina, Texas, and Washington. The disposal of civilian low-level waste is currently done in large trenches in South Carolina, Texas, and Washington. The Washington facility only accepts waste from its region, while the South Carolina site is available to members of the Atlantic disposal compact. Class A low-level radioactive waste can be accepted by a Utah commercial disposal facility nationwide. Congressional authorization of regional compacts for low-level waste disposal was prompted by threats to close disposal facilities by states in 1985. The first new disposal site under the regional compact system opened in 2011 near Andrews, TX, allowing up to 30% of its capacity to be used by states outside the Texas Compact. NWPA Section 302 authorized DOE to enter into contracts for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and highly radioactive waste. The NWPA Section 302 authorized DOE to enter into contracts with U.S. generators of spent nuclear fuel and highly radioactive waste for disposal. The act required nuclear reactors to have a disposal contract with DOE, with a deadline of January 31, 1998. DOE missed the deadline, leading to lawsuits from nuclear utilities. The NWPA required nuclear reactors to have disposal contracts with DOE by January 31, 1998. DOE missed the deadline, leading to lawsuits from nuclear utilities for additional storage costs. DOE settled with PECO Energy Company in 2000, allowing them to keep up to $80 million in nuclear waste fee revenues over 10 years. Other utilities sued to block the settlement. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled on September 24, 2002, that nuclear waste fees can only be used for the DOE waste program, not as compensation for missing disposal deadlines. Subsequent compensation to utilities has come from the U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in September 2002 that nuclear waste fees cannot be used for compensation, leading to payments from the U.S. Treasury's Judgment Fund. By FY2017, $6.9 billion had been paid out to utilities for nuclear waste-related settlements and court judgments. By FY2017, $6.9 billion had been paid out to utilities for nuclear waste-related settlements and court judgments, with 39 lawsuits settled and 46 cases receiving final court judgments. Utilities submit annual reimbursement claims to DOE for delay-related nuclear waste storage costs, with disagreements going to arbitration. Utilities not settled with the Department of Justice seek compensation through the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Utilities that have not settled with the Department of Justice continue seeking compensation through the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for nuclear waste-related damages. DOE estimates potential liabilities for waste program delays at $34.1 billion, including $6.9 billion already paid in settlements and judgments. Awards by the Court of Claims cover only damages already incurred, requiring utilities to file claims for additional delay-related costs as they accrue. DOE estimates potential liabilities for waste program delays at $34.1 billion, including $6.9 billion already paid in settlements and judgments. Delays in the federal waste disposal program could lead to future environmental enforcement action over DOE's high-level waste and spent fuel. Some DOE-owned waste is currently stored in noncompliance with environmental laws, potentially subjecting DOE to fines and penalties if not removed according to compliance schedules. Some DOE-owned waste is stored in noncompliance with environmental laws, risking fines and penalties. DOE must charge a fee on nuclear power generation for waste disposal, but fee collections were suspended in 2014 after halting the Yucca Mountain project. The DOE halted the Yucca Mountain project, leading to lawsuits from the nuclear industry and state utility regulators to stop nuclear waste fee collections. The federal court agreed with the opponents, suspending fee collections in May 2014. Petitions to end the fees were filed by NARUC and NEI in 2010, arguing against collecting $750 million annually while the waste disposal program is on hold. The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) and state utility regulators filed lawsuits to stop the collection of $750 million in fees per year for nuclear waste disposal. DOE argued that the fees must continue for future disposal costs, but Energy Secretary Steven Chu determined in November 2010 that excess funds were not being collected. Energy Secretary Steven Chu determined in November 2010 that excess funds were not being collected for future nuclear waste disposal activities. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in June 2012 that Chu's decision to continue the nuclear waste fee unchanged was not valid and ordered a more thorough study within six months. The court criticized Chu's reliance on projected costs for the now terminated Yucca Mountain site. The court ordered Energy Secretary Steven Chu to conduct a more thorough study of nuclear waste fees within six months, criticizing his reliance on costs projected for the terminated Yucca Mountain site. DOE responded with a new fee adequacy assessment in January 2013, evaluating costs of various waste management scenarios. Some scenarios exceeded projected revenues by as much as $2 trillion. The Circuit Court ordered DOE to stop collecting nuclear waste fees after a review of the fee adequacy assessment showed varying results with costs exceeding revenues by up to $2 trillion. The Circuit Court ordered DOE to stop collecting nuclear waste fees due to vague waste plans and a $7 trillion uncertainty range in cost estimates. DOE ceased fee collection from nuclear power generators in May 2014. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program in its FY2019 budget request. The DOE stopped collecting nuclear waste fees from power generators in May 2014 due to vague waste plans and cost estimate uncertainties. The Trump Administration planned to restart the Yucca Mountain program in its FY2019 budget request, conducting a new fee adequacy assessment based on previous cost estimates. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application \"with prejudice\" in 2010, arguing for termination of the licensing process. The DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application \"with prejudice\" in 2010, stating that a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain was not feasible for nuclear waste disposal due to opposition from Nevada and a desire for a more publicly accepted solution. The Obama Administration's decision to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application was not based on scientific or technical findings but on the difficulty of overcoming opposition from Nevada and the desire for a waste solution with greater public acceptance. The ASLB denied DOE's withdrawal motion, stating that the NWPA prohibits withdrawal until NRC determines the repository's acceptability. The ASLB denied DOE's license withdrawal motion, ruling that NWPA prohibits withdrawal until NRC determines repository acceptability. DOE argued that the Secretary of Energy has authority to make disposal policy decisions. The DOE appealed the ASLB decision to the NRC commissioners, arguing that the Secretary of Energy has broad authority to make policy decisions regarding nuclear waste disposal. The NRC commissioners sustained the licensing board's denial of the license withdrawal on a tie vote in September 2011. After a year of deliberation, NRC commissioners upheld the licensing board's denial of a license withdrawal motion on a tie vote in September 2011. NRC stopped further consideration of the license application due to budget constraints. Plaintiffs, including Nye County, NV, petitioned the court to compel NRC to continue licensing proceedings. The Court of Appeals ruled in August 2013 that NRC must work on the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding permits. The Court of Appeals ruled in August 2013 that NRC must continue work on the Yucca Mountain license application as long as funding permits. NRC had $11.1 million in previously appropriated funds for this purpose and completed the Safety Evaluation Report in January 2015. Additional funding of about $330 million would be needed for NRC to finish the Yucca Mountain licensing review. The Trump Administration proposes to resume consideration of the NRC license for Yucca Mountain, with additional funding of about $330 million needed for NRC to complete the licensing review. DOE's estimated costs as the license applicant would total about $1.9 billion. DOE's FY2018 congressional budget request includes $110 million for a Yucca Mountain program office and legal and technical support for the license application. The Trump Administration proposes to resume consideration of the NRC license for Yucca Mountain, with additional funding of about $330 million needed for NRC to complete the licensing review. DOE's estimated costs as the license applicant would total about $1.9 billion. NRC is required to determine that waste from nuclear facilities can be safely disposed of before issuing licenses. The NRC issued a Waste Confidence Decision in 1984 stating nuclear waste could be safely stored for 30 years after plant closure. DOE's plan to meet the NWPA repository deadline of 1998 was delayed, leading to an update in 1990 predicting a repository by the early 21st century. After DOE's schedule for opening a nuclear waste repository began to slip, NRC updated the Waste Confidence Decision in 1990 to find that a repository would be available by the first quarter of the 21st century. The Yucca Mountain repository delay led to a 2010 waste confidence rule allowing waste to be stored at reactor sites for at least 60 years after shutdown, facing legal challenges. The 2010 waste confidence rule allowed waste to be stored at reactor sites for at least 60 years after shutdown. Lawsuits were filed to overturn the rule due to concerns about long-term waste storage environmental risks. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that NRC must conduct an environmental review of the Waste Confidence Decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in June 2012 that the NRC must conduct an environmental review of the Waste Confidence Decision under NEPA. Two major flaws were found in the NRC's rulemaking process regarding the availability of permanent storage and the safety of storing spent fuel on-site for sixty years after a plant's license expires. This led to the halt of final licensing for new facilities producing nuclear waste. The NRC failed to properly examine future dangers and consequences of storing spent fuel on-site for sixty years after a plant's license expires. Final licensing of new facilities producing nuclear waste was halted for over two years due to a court ruling. NRC approved a new rule in 2014 for continued storage of spent nuclear fuel, focusing on environmental effects rather than future waste disposal facility availability. The new continued storage rule, issued in response to a court ruling, focuses on environmental effects of storing nuclear waste for different time periods before a permanent repository is available. The rule is based on a generic environmental impact statement (GEIS) analyzing short-term and long-term storage options. The GEIS analyzed the environmental effects of three potential time periods of storage for nuclear waste: short-term (up to 60 years), long-term (up to 160 years), and indefinite. It assumed active management and oversight with spent fuel canisters replaced every 100 years. Environmental impact was deemed minimal in most categories. The environmental impact of storing nuclear waste for different time frames was deemed minimal. A lawsuit to overturn the NRC's storage rule was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The termination of work on the Yucca Mountain repository by the Obama Administration sparked congressional controversy, with the House supporting funding while the Senate and President Obama opposed it. President Trump proposed restarting the Yucca Mountain project. The Obama Administration's decision to halt work on the Yucca Mountain repository sparked congressional controversy. President Trump's proposal to restart the project has shifted the dynamics of the debate on nuclear waste, especially with the retirement of Senator Reid of Nevada, a strong opponent of Yucca Mountain. Despite this, the 115th Congress has not allocated new funding for the project, with the House approving funds for FY2018 while the Senate did not. The 115th Congress has not provided new funding for Yucca Mountain, with the House approving funds for FY2018 but the Senate did not. In FY2019, the House included $100 million above the Administration's funding request, while the Senate did not allocate any funds. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada raised concerns about Yucca Mountain funding during the confirmation hearing for former Texas Governor Rick Perry as Secretary of Energy. She emphasized Nevada's opposition to becoming a nuclear waste dumping ground for the nation. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada expressed concerns to Governor Perry about Yucca Mountain, emphasizing Nevada's opposition to being a nuclear waste dumping ground. She believes Governor Perry understands the issue's importance and can work together to prevent Yucca Mountain from being used. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 (H.R. 3053) passed the House on May 10, 2018, which would help in licensing the Yucca Mountain repository by withdrawing the site from public use. The Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 (H.R. 3053) passed the House on May 10, 2018, aiming to license the Yucca Mountain repository by withdrawing the site from public use. It would increase the repository's capacity limit to 110,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel and authorize storage at an interim facility owned by a nonfederal entity. The House-passed bill, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 (H.R. 3053), aims to increase the capacity limit of the Yucca Mountain repository to 110,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel. It includes changes such as the elimination of mandatory funding provisions and addresses criticism of the Nuclear Waste Fund being used for deficit reduction. The House-passed bill, H.R. 3053, aims to increase the capacity of the Yucca Mountain repository for spent nuclear fuel. It eliminates mandatory funding provisions and addresses criticism of the Nuclear Waste Fund being used for deficit reduction. The bill includes provisions for Monitored Retrievable Storage facilities for interim storage before disposal in a permanent repository. H.R. 3053 authorizes the Department of Energy to operate Monitored Retrievable Storage facilities for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel before disposal in a permanent repository. Ownership of the spent fuel would transfer to the Secretary of Energy upon acceptance at these facilities. Nonfederal entities could also develop MRS facilities under agreement with the DOE. The Department of Energy could store spent fuel at Monitored Retrievable Storage facilities developed by nonfederal entities under MRS agreements. Prior to entering an agreement, NRC license and state approval are required. The Department of Energy could store spent fuel at Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities with approval from the governor, local government, and affected Indian tribe. Priority for shipment to an MRS would be given to spent fuel from closed reactors. Funding for an MRS would come from the general fund. The Department of Energy could store spent fuel at Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities with approval from the governor, local government, and affected Indian tribe. Priority for shipment to an MRS would be given to spent fuel from closed reactors. Appropriations for an MRS would be authorized from the general fund rather than the Nuclear Waste Fund. Storage at the initial MRS facility would be contingent on NRC approval for the Yucca Mountain repository or an imminent decision by the Secretary of Energy. MRS construction would halt if the repository license were revoked. H.R. 3053 proposes to permanently withdraw 147,000 acres of federal land for the Yucca Mountain repository. Construction of Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) facilities would depend on the Yucca Mountain construction authorization and would cease if the repository license were revoked. The Yucca Mountain repository would be located on 147,000 acres of federal land, withdrawn from public land laws for the development of a permanent underground repository for nuclear waste. This withdrawal is necessary for the Department of Energy to obtain a repository license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Yucca Mountain repository is a proposed underground site for nuclear waste. The Department of Energy needs the site to be withdrawn from public land laws to obtain a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved, nuclear waste at the repository would not be subject to certain hazardous waste requirements. The NRC must make a final decision on construction within 30 months, allowing for infrastructure activities like site preparation. The Yucca Mountain repository would require a construction authorization within 30 months. Before construction, DOE could conduct infrastructure activities like site preparation. The limit for nuclear waste disposal would increase to 110,000 metric tons. DOE is prohibited from planning a separate repository until NRC decides on Yucca Mountain. The DOE is prohibited from planning a separate repository for defense-related high-level waste until NRC decides on the Yucca Mountain repository. The Secretary of Energy cannot resume collecting nuclear waste fees until NRC approves or disapproves the construction authorization for Yucca Mountain. Total collections of nuclear waste fees would be limited to 90% of each fiscal year's appropriations for the DOE nuclear waste management program. Unpaid fees may be required to be paid when deemed necessary by the Secretary. The total collections of nuclear waste fees would be limited to 90% of each fiscal year's appropriations for the DOE nuclear waste management program. Any uncollected fees could be required to be paid when deemed necessary by the Secretary. Fees collected after enactment would offset appropriations to the program, ensuring that annual appropriations would not exceed available fees. The existing balance of the Nuclear Waste Fund would remain available. The bill ensures that nuclear waste fees would not count against annual discretionary funding allocations for the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. The Nuclear Waste Fund balance would remain available for appropriation without offsets. The Secretary of Energy could enter into a benefits agreement with Nevada. The bill allows the Secretary of Energy to enter into benefits agreements with Nevada and local governments for payments related to nuclear waste storage at Yucca Mountain. Annual payments to Nevada would increase to $15 million before fuel receipt and $40 million thereafter, with an initial payment of $400 million upon the first receipt. The bill allows the Secretary of Energy to enter into benefits agreements with Nevada and local governments for payments related to nuclear waste storage at Yucca Mountain. Annual payments to Nevada would increase to $15 million before fuel receipt and $40 million thereafter, with an initial payment of $400 million upon the first spent fuel receipt. Additionally, DOE could reach benefits agreements with other affected local governments, subject to congressional appropriation from the Nuclear Waste Fund. The Director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) would be responsible for carrying out the functions of the Secretary of Energy established by NWPA and would report directly to the Secretary. The OCRWM Director, appointed for up to two five-year terms, would carry out Secretary of Energy functions under NWPA. Functions currently assigned to a DOE Assistant Secretary would transfer to OCRWM. Senator Heller and Representative Titus introduced companion versions of the bill. The Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act, introduced by Senator Heller and Representative Titus, would require consent from State and local governments before using funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund for a repository. This legislation promotes a consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste repositories. The Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act, introduced by Senator Heller and Representative Titus, requires consent from State and local governments before using funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund for a repository. This legislation promotes a consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste repositories, as recommended by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future. Representative Joe Wilson also introduced the Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act (H.R. 433) to forbid DOE from developing a repository for defense nuclear waste until NRC issues a final decision on the Yucca Mountain repository construction permit. Joe Wilson introduced the Sensible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act (H.R. 433) on January 11, 2017, which would prevent the DOE from developing a repository for defense nuclear waste until NRC makes a final decision on the Yucca Mountain repository. Additionally, there are proposals in Texas and New Mexico for private-sector interim storage facilities for commercial spent nuclear fuel, with a bill (H.R. 474) introduced by Representative Issa to authorize DOE to enter into contracts with these facilities. A bill (H.R. 474) introduced by Representative Issa on January 12, 2017, authorizes DOE to enter into contracts with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities. The Interim Consolidated Storage Act of 2017 is similar to previous legislation but not enacted, allowing DOE to take title to spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors delivered to private storage facilities. Annual interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund could be used by DOE to pay for private interim storage without further congressional appropriation. The DOE would take title to all spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors delivered to private storage facilities. Annual interest earned by the Nuclear Waste Fund could be used by DOE to pay for private interim storage without further congressional appropriation. Representative Lowey introduced the Removing Nuclear Waste from our Communities Act of 2017 (H.R. 4442) to authorize DOE to store spent fuel at privately owned consolidated storage facilities, prioritizing sites with no currently operating reactors and a population of at least 15 million within a 50-mile radius. Legislation introduced in 2017 (S. 1903 and H.R. 3970) aims to provide assistance to communities with stored spent fuel at closed reactor sites by offering $15 per kilogram of nuclear waste, reviving a tax credit for first-time homebuyers in affected areas, and making these communities eligible for the New Markets Tax Credit. The bills (S. 1903 and H.R. 3970) aim to assist communities with stranded nuclear waste by providing financial incentives, tax credits for homebuyers, and eligibility for the New Markets Tax Credit. Additionally, a task force would be established to streamline government assistance programs for these communities, and the DOE would explore alternative options for hosting nuclear waste and potential economic uses for closed reactor sites. The bill aims to make it easier for communities to apply for government assistance and requires the DOE to explore alternative options for hosting decommissioned nuclear waste. Concerns about spent fuel storage pools in nuclear power plants have led to proposed bills like the Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018. The Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018 (H.R. 4891) introduced in the 115th Congress by Representative Engel aims to move spent fuel from storage pools to dry storage casks. Nuclear power plants would need NRC-approved plans for this transfer within seven years. Emergency planning zones would expand, and NRC could use interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund. The Dry Cask Storage Act of 2018 (H.R. 4891) aims to move spent fuel from storage pools to dry storage casks. Emergency planning zones would expand, and NRC could use interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund for grants to nuclear power plants. In the 114th Congress, Senator Alexander introduced legislation to redirect the nuclear waste program, establishing an independent Nuclear Waste Administration for storage and disposal facilities with consent required from affected governments. The 114th Congress proposed legislation to establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) for nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities, requiring consent from affected state, local, and tribal governments. The bill aimed to open a pilot storage facility by 2021 for priority waste and a permanent repository by 2048. The proposed legislation aimed to establish an independent Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) for nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. A storage facility for nonpriority waste was to open by the end of 2025, and a permanent repository by 2048. NWA would have been authorized to offer financial compensation and incentives for hosting nuclear waste storage and disposal. After 10 years, NWA could not request proposals for nonpriority waste or select sites unless a candidate site for a repository had been chosen. Financial compensation and incentives could be offered for hosting nuclear waste facilities, with preference given to sites that include storage facilities along with a repository. Highly radioactive defense waste could be placed in defense-only storage and disposal facilities under S. 854, authorized by President Obama in 2015. President Obama authorized the DOE to pursue a defense-only repository in 2015. The Nuclear Waste Administration could use fees collected after the bill's enactment for S. 854. The disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the first repository under NWPA would be repealed. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S.854. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing on S. 1240 on July 30, 2013. Then-Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz supported the bill as a promising framework for addressing key issues. NARUC Electricity Committee Chairman David C. Boyd called the bill a step in the right direction but urged continued licensing action on the Yucca Mountain repository. Boyd noted that S. 1240 would not prevent enforcement of existing NWPA. The NARUC Electricity Committee Chairman and the Natural Resources Defense Council Senior Attorney expressed differing views on S. 1240, with concerns about licensing action on the Yucca Mountain repository and the opening of temporary waste storage facilities without progress on a permanent repository. S. 854 raises concerns about opening temporary waste storage facilities without progress on a permanent repository and states having inadequate authority to regulate repository safety. The bill requires actions on a permanent repository before siting a storage facility for nonpriority waste. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved initial funding for DOE to develop a pilot spent fuel interim storage facility. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a $10.0 million appropriation for DOE to develop a consent-based waste storage pilot facility in the FY2017 Energy and Water bill. Similar language was included in previous energy and water bills passed by the committee in FY2016, FY2014, and FY2013. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved funding for a consent-based waste storage pilot facility in the FY2017 Energy and Water bill. The debate over nuclear waste policy was influenced by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011 influenced the debate over nuclear waste policy. A bill introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer in 2015 would require the NRC to maintain safety and security requirements. The spent fuel from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident did not overheat. Senator Barbara Boxer introduced a bill in 2015 to ensure safety and security at closed reactors until all spent fuel is moved to dry storage. NRC's study in 2013 suggested that expedited transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage would provide limited safety benefits. The NRC's study in 2013 found that expedited transfer of spent fuel to dry cask storage would provide limited safety benefits and the expected implementation costs would not be justified. Radioactive waste varies in characteristics, with some types decaying quickly while others remain dangerous for thousands of years. Major types of radioactive waste include spent nuclear fuel. Spent nuclear fuel, the most radioactive type of civilian nuclear waste, contains hot but short-lived fission products. It is fuel rods withdrawn from a reactor after irradiation and can remain dangerous for thousands of years. High-level waste is the highly radioactive residue created by spent fuel reprocessing, containing most radioactive fission products and plutonium. High-level waste is dangerously radioactive for tens of thousands of years or more, containing radioactive fission products and requiring isolation for 10,000 years or more. Transuranic waste is relatively low-activity waste with long-lived elements heavier than uranium, requiring radiation shielding for handling. Transuranic waste, containing long-lived elements heavier than uranium, requires radiation shielding for handling. In the United States, it is mainly generated by nuclear weapons production processes. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, is the nation's only permanent repository for TRU waste, which resumed underground waste emplacement in 2017 after a radioactive release. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, NM, resumed underground waste emplacement in January 2017 after a radioactive release. Low-level waste, not classified as high-level or TRU waste, is being disposed of at the site. The NRC has established four classes of low-level waste based on radioactivity levels. Low-level waste includes waste such as uranium mill tailings and is classified into four classes by the NRC based on radioactivity levels. Disposal facilities have concentration limits set by the NRC. Uranium mill tailings are sand-like residues with low radioactivity but large volumes that can pose a hazard. Low-level waste disposal facilities cannot accept material exceeding NRC concentration limits, including uranium mill tailings, which are sand-like residues from uranium ore processing with low radioactivity but large volumes posing hazards like radon emissions and groundwater contamination. Mixed waste combines chemically hazardous waste with radioactive material, creating institutional challenges due to regulation by DOE, NRC, EPA, and states. When spent nuclear fuel is removed from a reactor, it is thermally hot and highly radioactive, in the form of fuel assemblies consisting of metal-clad fuel rods. The radioactive portion is regulated by DOE or NRC, while the nonradioactive elements are regulated by EPA and states under RCRA. After nuclear fission in the reactor, spent fuel rods contain highly radioactive fission products, including radioactive plutonium and gases. The fuel rods initially contain enriched uranium U-235, but most of it is split into radioactive fission products during fission. The nuclei in fuel rods have split into radioactive fission products, including plutonium. Spent fuel assemblies are stored in water pools near reactors to prevent overheating and protect workers. Older fuel is sealed in dry canisters and transferred to shielded storage facilities after cooling for 7-10 years. The NRC requires spent fuel to cool for 7-10 years before transferring it to dry storage. Spent fuel from U.S. commercial nuclear reactors is stored at various sites, including 59 operating nuclear plant sites, 15 shutdown plant sites, and the Idaho National Laboratory. On average, a large commercial nuclear reactor discharges 20-30 metric tons of spent fuel per year, totaling about 2,200 metric tons annually for the entire U.S. nuclear power industry over the past two decades. The U.S. nuclear power industry has accumulated around 80,000 metric tons of spent fuel by the end of 2017, with 30,000 metric tons stored in dry casks. This exceeds the 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain, not including 7,000 metric tons of DOE waste planned for disposal. The total amount of existing waste exceeds NWPA's 70,000-metric-ton limit for Yucca Mountain, even without counting 7,000 metric tons of DOE spent fuel and high-level waste planned for disposal. DOE estimates that the total amount of spent fuel from existing U.S. reactors that may require disposal ranges from 105,000 to 130,000 metric tons. New storage capacity is needed at nuclear plant sites or alternative disposal technology must be developed. DOE estimates 105,000 to 130,000 metric tons of spent fuel from existing U.S. reactors may need disposal. New storage capacity is required if waste cannot be accepted for an indefinite period. Utilities are expected to build dry storage facilities at reactor sites. Concerns about the vulnerability of stored spent fuel increased after the 9/11 attacks. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, raised concerns about the vulnerability of stored spent fuel at U.S. nuclear plant and DOE sites. Reports from NRC and the National Academy of Sciences highlighted the risk of overheating spent fuel causing a fire and releasing radioactivity. The NRC and NAS reports warned of the risk of overheating spent fuel leading to fires and releasing radioactivity. Recommendations included interspersing hotter and cooler fuel assemblies, installing spray systems, and transferring fuel to dry cask storage to reduce the likelihood of fires. The NAS study recommended safety measures for spent fuel pools, including interspersing hotter and cooler fuel assemblies, installing spray systems, and transferring fuel to dry cask storage. The nuclear industry argues that there is ample time to cool fuel before it catches fire. NRC's 2013 report found minor safety benefits in expedited transfers to dry casks. Fukushima lessons are being examined by an NRC task force for U.S. nuclear plant regulation. The NRC task force recommended safety measures for spent fuel pools after the Fukushima accident, including having assured sources of electrical power and water spray systems available. In 2012, NRC approved an order requiring U.S. reactors to install improved water-level monitoring equipment in their spent fuel pools. About 5.1 million cubic feet of low-level waste with 57,179 curies is stored in U.S. spent nuclear fuel storage facilities. In March 2012, U.S. reactors were mandated to install better water-level monitoring equipment in their spent fuel pools. In 2017, 5.1 million cubic feet of low-level waste with 57,179 curies of radioactivity was sent to disposal sites. The volume and radioactivity levels can vary yearly due to nuclear decommissioning projects and cleanup activities. The total volume reported for nuclear decommissioning projects and cleanup activities in 2016 was 1.7 million cubic feet. Low-level radioactive waste is categorized into Class A, B, and C for disposal, with Class A waste making up most of the volume. Class B and C waste contain the majority of the radioactivity, with most of the nation's Class B and C waste stored on-site since June 2008. The Obama Administration halted development of the Yucca Mountain repository for highly radioactive waste disposal after FY2010. The Trump Administration is proposing to revive the program in FY2019, requesting $110 million. The Yucca Mountain repository for highly radioactive waste disposal was halted after FY2010. The Trump Administration is proposing to revive the program in FY2019 with funding for Yucca Mountain and interim nuclear waste storage. The Obama Administration had issued an alternative waste management strategy in 2013. Under the Obama Administration, DOE proposed a new waste management strategy in 2013, calling for a pilot facility for spent fuel storage by 2021 and a new repository by 2048. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a system for selecting a geologic repository for nuclear waste disposal. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management to manage 70,000 metric tons of nuclear waste. The Nuclear Waste Fund was created to finance the program through a fee on commercial nuclear power. DOE was required to select three candidate sites for the first national high-level waste repository. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management to manage nuclear waste. DOE was required to select three candidate sites for the first national high-level waste repository. The act was modified in 1987 to designate Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the only candidate site for a permanent repository. The only candidate site for a permanent high-level waste repository is Yucca Mountain, Nevada. If this site cannot be licensed, the DOE must return to Congress for further instructions. Construction of a monitored retrievable storage facility is authorized to store spent fuel, but selection of a site is prohibited until a permanent repository is recommended and construction begins at Yucca Mountain. The law prohibits the selection of a Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) site until a permanent repository is recommended and construction begins at Yucca Mountain. The Obama Administration halted funding for Yucca Mountain and transferred waste management functions to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future developed a new waste management strategy. The Obama Administration terminated OCRWM in FY2010 and transferred functions to DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future concluded that the existing nuclear waste policy with Yucca Mountain has broken down and recommended a new strategy. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a new, consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, involving negotiations with affected states, tribes, and local governments to establish legally binding agreements on project parameters. Previous voluntary waste site efforts in the U.S. had failed. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, involving negotiations with states, tribes, and local governments to establish legally binding agreements on project parameters. Previous U.S. voluntary waste site efforts had failed, but the commission expressed confidence in the success of this new approach, citing the example of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a consent-based approach to siting nuclear waste facilities, involving negotiations with states, tribes, and local governments to establish legally binding agreements on project parameters. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico began receiving transuranic defense waste in 1999 with state and local government approval. A congressionally chartered federal corporation independent from Administration control was recommended for the new waste management program. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a federal corporation independent from Administration control for the new waste management program, with assured access to funds and congressional oversight. The corporation would be subject to regulation by NRC. The BRC also called for the development of a permanent underground nuclear waste repository and interim central storage facilities to remove waste from shutdown reactor sites. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended a federal corporation independent from Administration control for the new waste management program, with assured access to funds and congressional oversight. They also called for the development of a permanent underground nuclear waste repository and interim central storage facilities to remove waste from shutdown reactor sites. In response, the DOE issued its Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Waste in January 2013. The DOE issued its Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Waste in January 2013, proposing the opening of a pilot interim spent fuel storage facility by 2021 and a larger-scale interim storage facility by 2025 with a capacity of 20,000 metric tons or more. The strategy aimed to prevent the storage facility from becoming a de facto repository by linking it to the development of a permanent repository. The DOE's strategy proposed opening a pilot interim storage facility by 2021 and a larger facility by 2025 with a capacity of 20,000 metric tons. The strategy aimed to prevent the storage facility from becoming a de facto repository by linking it to the development of a permanent repository. However, current restrictions on the MRS are too rigid for it to be built. The DOE recommended not overly restricting the linkage between the storage facility and the permanent repository to allow progress against the waste management mission. The DOE strategy recommended opening a geologic disposal facility by 2048, 50 years after the planned date for the Yucca Mountain repository. A site for the repository is to be selected by 2016, with site studies, design, and licensing completed by 2042. The selection process for storage and disposal sites would be \"consent based,\" but few details were provided on its implementation. The DOE strategy recommended completing site studies, design, and licensing for a geologic disposal facility by 2042. The selection process for storage and disposal sites would be \"consent based,\" with few details provided on its implementation. The Obama Administration planned to consult with Congress and interest groups on defining and codifying consent for the waste program. The DOE issued a \"Draft Consent-Based Siting Process\" in January 2017, proposing a new nuclear waste management entity without specifying its nature. Senator Alexander introduced a bill in the 114th Congress (S. 854) to modify the waste program in line with the Obama Administration's strategy. Other proposals suggested privatizing waste management services. The DOE issued a report in October 2014 recommending testing a consent-based approach for siting a repository solely for defense and research waste, separate from civilian nuclear waste. This proposal would reverse the long-standing federal policy of a single repository for both types of waste. The DOE's 2014 report suggested developing a separate repository for defense and research waste, diverging from the long-standing policy of a single repository for both civilian and defense waste. The report also recommended considering deep boreholes for disposal of compact types of defense and research waste. The DOE's 2014 report recommended developing a separate repository for defense and research waste, suggesting deep boreholes for compact waste disposal. President Obama authorized planning for a defense-only underground repository in 2015, but faced criticism from the GAO in 2017. Bills have been introduced to delay the plan, and President Obama blocked the preferred rail route to Yucca Mountain in 2015. President Obama blocked DOE's preferred rail route to Yucca Mountain in 2015, establishing the Basin and Range National Monument. Waste Control Specialists applied for an NRC license to develop a storage facility in Texas, requesting a suspension until 2017. The waste management company Waste Control Specialists (WCS) applied for an NRC license to develop a consolidated interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel in Texas. WCS initially requested a suspension of the license application due to high estimated costs but later formed a joint venture with Orano USA called Waste Control Partners and submitted a renewed application in 2018. The proposed facility would be located at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX. The Waste Control Partners, a joint venture between Waste Control Specialists and Orano USA, submitted a renewed application in 2018 for a spent fuel storage facility in Texas. The proposed facility at a 14,000-acre site near Andrews, TX would consist of dry casks on concrete pads with a total capacity of 40,000 metric tons. The Department of Energy would take title to spent fuel from nuclear plant sites, ship it to the Texas facility, and pay for storage for up to 40 years with possible extensions. The Waste Control Partners proposed a spent fuel storage facility in Texas with a capacity of 40,000 metric tons. The Department of Energy would transport spent fuel to the site and pay for storage for up to 40 years. WCS argues that a privately developed facility would not be restricted by NWPA regulations. An NRC license application for a similar facility in New Mexico was filed in 2017. An NRC license application for a privately developed spent fuel storage facility in New Mexico was filed by Holtec International on March 30, 2017. The facility would be located near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant on land provided by the Eddy-Lea Energy Alliance. Local officials have long supported additional waste facilities at the site. The Eddy-Lea Energy Alliance (ELEA) in New Mexico has local support for developing waste facilities near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. Conditions for accepting high-level waste at the WIPP site were discussed by a New Mexico official in 2012, including assistance with cleaning up contaminated uranium sites. Governor Susana Martinez backed ELEA's efforts in a 2015 letter to Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, while the state's U.S. senators, Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich, also weighed in. The Eddy-Lea Energy Alliance (ELEA) in New Mexico has local support for developing waste facilities near the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. Governor Susana Martinez expressed support in a letter to Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, but state senators Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich oppose an interim storage facility without a plan for permanent disposal. Public support in the state may be affected by a 2014 radioactive release from WIPP. Other groups in Mississippi and Loving County, Texas have also shown interest in hosting nuclear waste sites. The release from WIPP led to the suspension of disposal operations and could impact public support for expanded waste activities in New Mexico. Interest in hosting nuclear waste sites has been shown by groups in Mississippi and Loving County, Texas. A bill (H.R. 474) introduced by Representative Issa authorizes DOE to enter contracts with privately owned spent fuel storage facilities. The Interim Consolidated Storage Act of 2017 (H.R. 474) introduced by Representative Issa allows DOE to take title to spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors for private storage. Annual interest from the Nuclear Waste Fund can be used by DOE to pay for private interim storage. The bill has 33 cosponsors, including 14 from Texas. provisions for a private-sector MRS facility are included in another bill (H.R. 3053) approved by the House Energy and Commerce. The DOE lacks funding for private interim storage, with 33 cosponsors for the bill, including 14 from Texas. A previous attempt to develop a private spent fuel storage facility was made after DOE missed the 1998 deadline. The Private Fuel Storage consortium missed the 1998 deadline for nuclear waste storage. They signed an agreement with the Skull Valley Band of the Goshute Indians in Utah in 1996. A license for storing spent fuel was issued in 2006, but the Department of the Interior rejected the project in 2006. The Department of the Interior rejected the PFS project in 2006 due to concerns about waste storage and transportation. The Skull Valley Band of Goshutes and PFS filed a federal lawsuit in 2007 to challenge the decisions. The Department of the Interior rejected the PFS project in 2006 due to concerns about waste storage and transportation. The Skull Valley Band of Goshutes and PFS filed a federal lawsuit in 2007 to challenge the decisions. A federal court judge ordered the Department of the Interior to reconsider its decisions on the PFS permits in 2010. PFS requested the termination of its license in 2012. The Obama Administration attempted to redirect the high-level nuclear waste program, but current law still focuses on Yucca Mountain for civilian waste. NWPA requires high-level waste repositories to be licensed by NRC. The Obama Administration tried to redirect the high-level nuclear waste program, but current law still focuses on Yucca Mountain for civilian waste. NWPA requires high-level waste repositories to be licensed by NRC and meet general siting guidelines prepared by DOE and approved by NRC. Transportation of waste to storage and disposal sites is regulated by NRC and DOT. DOE requested NRC to terminate its license in 2012. EPA was required to write new repository standards specifically for Yucca Mountain under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Under NWPA, repositories like Yucca Mountain must meet siting guidelines approved by NRC. Waste transportation is regulated by NRC and DOT, requiring NRC-certified casks and compliance with safety regulations. NRC's licensing requirements for Yucca Mountain include EPA standards and procedures for seeking a license. The NRC's licensing requirements for Yucca Mountain, under 10 C.F.R. 63, mandate compliance with EPA standards and establish procedures for obtaining a repository license. DOE must obtain construction authorization before being licensed to bring nuclear waste to the site. One requirement is a DOE repository performance confirmation program to ensure systems are functioning as intended. The NRC's regulatory requirements include a mandatory DOE repository performance confirmation program to ensure systems are functioning as intended at Yucca Mountain. Specific standards were needed due to concerns about meeting EPA standards, with limits on radiation dose consistent with NAS findings. The Yucca Mountain standards, based on a National Academy of Sciences study, focus on limiting radiation exposure to individuals near the repository rather than specific radioactive material releases. The study also found no scientific basis for predicting human behavior thousands of years into the future. The EPA proposed Yucca Mountain radiation protection standards in 1999, limiting annual radiation doses for the maximally exposed individual and from groundwater exposure for the first 10,000 years of repository operation. The standard aimed to reduce the risk of fatal cancer. The EPA proposed Yucca Mountain radiation protection standards in 1999, limiting annual radiation doses for the maximally exposed individual to 15 millirems and to 4 millirems from groundwater exposure for the first 10,000 years of repository operation. The standard aimed to reduce the risk of fatal cancer to seven chances in a million. The nuclear industry criticized the EPA proposal as overly strict, while environmental groups argued that the 10,000-year standard was too short considering projected radioactive releases peaking after about 400,000 years. EPA issued its final Yucca Mountain standards on June 6, 2001. The EPA issued final Yucca Mountain standards on June 6, 2001, including a 15 millirem overall exposure limit and a 4 millirem groundwater limit. Despite DOE's opposition, the site was deemed able to meet the standards. NRC revised its regulations on September 7, 2001, to align with the EPA standards. The DOE's site suitability evaluation found that Yucca Mountain could meet EPA standards. A court ruling in 2004 struck down the 10,000-year compliance period in the regulations, citing inconsistency with the NAS study. The court found that the 10,000-year compliance period in the Yucca Mountain regulations was inconsistent with the NAS study. In response, EPA proposed new standards in 2005, retaining dose limits for the first 10,000 years but allowing a higher annual dose for the period of 10,000 years through 1 million years. EPA proposed new standards in 2005 for Yucca Mountain, with a higher annual dose limit of 350 millirems for 10,000 years through 1 million years. Nevada officials criticized the leniency of the proposed standard. EPA amended the standards in 2008, reducing the annual dose limit to 100 millirems for the same period. The EPA issued a final rule in 2008 amending the Yucca Mountain standards, reducing the annual dose limit to 100 millirems for 10,000 through 1 million years. Compliance with the post-10,000-year standard will be based on the arithmetic mean of projected doses. The NRC revised its licensing regulations to align with the new EPA standards in 2009. The NRC revised its repository licensing regulations to align with new EPA standards in 2009, focusing on the arithmetic mean of projected doses. DOE estimated in 2008 that the maximum mean annual individual dose after 10,000 years would be 2 millirems, a significant reduction from previous estimates. The 2002 Final Environmental Impact Statement estimated peak doses after 400,000 years to be about 150 millirems, but recent changes in DOE's computer model have reduced this to 2 millirems. The DOE's Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel, including the Obama Administration's waste strategy. The DOE's Fuel Cycle Research and Development Program conducts research on technologies for managing spent nuclear fuel. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget proposal included funding for nuclear waste processing but eliminated funding for the Obama Administration's waste strategy. The FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated funds for generic nuclear waste R&D and integrated waste management activities. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request includes reduced funding for waste disposal R&D and zero funding for integrated waste management, unlike the FY2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act which allocated funds for nuclear waste R&D and integrated waste management activities. The focus of the Fuel Cycle R&D program is on technology for reprocessing spent fuel to convert long-lived radionuclides into faster-decaying fission products. The reprocessing of spent fuel aims to convert long-lived radionuclides into faster-decaying fission products using special nuclear reactors or particle accelerators. Nuclear utilities paid fees to the Nuclear Waste Fund for disposal costs until halted in 2014. The Waste Fund balance was $37.2 billion at the end of FY2017, with $7.41 billion disbursed before the Yucca Mountain project was halted in FY2010. The Waste Fund balance was $37.2 billion at the end of FY2017, with $7.41 billion disbursed before the Yucca Mountain project was halted in FY2010 by Congress. The Yucca Mountain program was estimated to cost $96.2 billion from 1983 to 2133. The Yucca Mountain program, estimated to cost $96.2 billion from 1983 to 2133, was released on August 5, 2008. States are authorized to select disposal sites for low-level radioactive waste under the 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. Most states have joined interstate compacts for low-level waste disposal. Commercial low-level waste disposal facilities could refuse waste from outside under the 1985 amendments. Under the 1985 amendments, commercial low-level waste disposal facilities could refuse waste from outside their regional interstate compacts after 1992. Two facilities in Barnwell, SC, and Hanford, WA, are now prohibiting waste from outside their compacts. Utah's site is available nationwide for Class A low-level waste, while Class B and C waste must generally be stored where generated. A new disposal facility for Class A, B, and C low-level waste near Andrews, TX, started in 2012 to alleviate storage issues. The facility can serve Texas and Vermont primarily but can also accept waste from other states, receiving its first shipment from Vermont in April 2012. Legislation allows facilities to refuse waste from outside their regional compacts. The disposal facility in Andrews, TX, started in 2012 to handle low-level waste from Texas and Vermont, with potential to accept waste from other states. Legislation was signed in 1998 for the Texas compact, which originally included Maine but was later rejected. Governor Rick Perry authorized the Texas Commission on waste disposal in 2003. In 1998, legislation was signed for the Texas compact for low-level waste disposal. A proposed site near Sierra Blanca, TX, was rejected in 1998, and Maine withdrew. Governor Rick Perry authorized the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to license disposal facilities in 2003. Waste Control Specialists LLC filed an application to build the Andrews County disposal facility in 2004, which was approved in 2011. The Andrews County disposal facility application was filed in 2004 by Waste Control Specialists LLC and approved in 2011. The Barnwell facility in SC accepts low-level waste from the Atlantic Compact, which includes South Carolina, Connecticut, and New Jersey. South Carolina can limit facility use to compact members. South Carolina joined the Southeast Compact in 2000, allowing them to limit waste disposal at the Barnwell facility to compact members. A state law phased out acceptance of noncompact waste by 2008. Previous attempts to open the facility to waste generators outside the Southeast were rejected by the Southeast Compact Commission. In May 1995, South Carolina twice rejected a proposal to open the Barnwell waste disposal site to generators outside the Southeast and to restrict access to North Carolina until they opened a new disposal facility. This led to South Carolina withdrawing from the Southeast Compact in 1995 and accepting waste from all states except North Carolina. North Carolina also withdrew from the compact in 1999. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that North Carolina was not subject to sanctions for its withdrawal. The only other facility for low-level waste disposal is in Hanford, WA. Carolina withdrew from the Southeast Compact in 1999, and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that there were no sanctions for the withdrawal. The Hanford site in WA is the only other facility for low-level waste disposal, controlled by the Northwest Compact. Licensing for commercial low-level waste facilities is done by the NRC or approved agreement states under the Atomic Energy Act. NRC regulations for low-level waste licenses must meet environmental and radiation protection standards. Licensing for commercial low-level waste facilities is regulated by the NRC or agreement states under the Atomic Energy Act. NRC regulations must adhere to environmental and radiation protection standards. Transportation of low-level waste is jointly regulated by NRC and the Department of Transportation. NRC proposed modifications to its disposal regulations in 2015 and further revisions were issued in 2017. The NRC made modifications to its low-level waste disposal regulations in 2015 and submitted a final version for approval in 2016. Further revisions were issued in 2017, including establishing time periods for technical analyses of waste sites for population protection. Compliance periods range from 1,000 to 10,000 years. The NRC's low-level waste disposal regulations require technical analyses for 1,000 to 10,000 years to protect the general population. Compliance may extend beyond 10,000 years in certain cases, with additional analysis needed to safeguard against inadvertent intruders at waste sites. The disposal of radioactive waste remains a significant issue in the nuclear power debate without a national waste management system. The NRC's low-level waste disposal regulations require technical analyses for long periods to protect the general population, with additional measures needed to safeguard against inadvertent intruders at waste sites. Disposal of radioactive waste is a key issue in the nuclear power debate, especially with the need for a national waste management system. Public concern about spent fuel storage safety has increased, particularly after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster in 2011. The federal government's current nuclear waste disposal policy focuses on the Yucca Mountain site. The federal government's nuclear waste disposal policy is currently focused on the Yucca Mountain site, but President Obama's actions to terminate the project have halted most activities in the DOE waste program. Congress is debating the project's future, with the NRC finding in October 2014 that the site would meet NRC standards after the repository was filled. The future of the DOE waste program at Yucca Mountain is uncertain due to Congress debating its future. The NRC's finding in 2014 that the site meets standards after sealing has been cited as evidence of its viability. The Trump Administration's proposal to restart licensing and Senator Reid's retirement may impact legislative action on nuclear waste in the 115th Congress. The Administration requested $120 million in FY2018 for Yucca Mountain licensing and spent fuel storage. The retirement of Senator Reid, a strong opponent of the Yucca Mountain project, may impact legislative action on nuclear waste in the 115th Congress. The Trump Administration requested $120 million in FY2018 for Yucca Mountain licensing and spent fuel storage to fulfill federal obligations, enhance national security, and reduce taxpayer burden. The funding was not approved for FY2018, but the request has been repeated for FY2019. Owners of existing reactors with waste-disposal contracts with DOE are likely to seek damages from the federal government. The Trump Administration has requested funding for Yucca Mountain in FY2019 to fulfill federal obligations, enhance national security, and reduce taxpayer burden. Owners of existing reactors may seek damages from the federal government due to disposal delays, with potential liabilities estimated at $34.1 billion. The Department of Energy (DOE) faces potential liabilities of up to $34.1 billion for waste program delays, including $6.9 billion already paid to utilities. The nuclear industry warns of future damages in the tens of billions if the federal disposal program fails. Lack of a disposal system could impact licensing of new nuclear plants and cause DOE to miss defense waste disposal deadlines. The Blue Ribbon Commission addressed problems caused by nuclear waste disposal delays in its final report, recommending options such as centralized interim storage, continued storage at existing sites, reprocessing technology, and development of alternative repository sites. They suggested establishing a congressionally chartered corporation for siting new waste storage. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended options for nuclear waste disposal, including centralized interim storage, reprocessing technology, and developing alternative repository sites. They suggested establishing a congressionally chartered corporation for siting new waste storage facilities. The \"consent based\" nuclear waste siting process has attracted serious interest. The Blue Ribbon Commission recommended options for nuclear waste disposal, including centralized interim storage and developing alternative repository sites. The \"consent based\" siting process has attracted serious interest from localities in New Mexico and Texas, but state cooperation is crucial for success. The NWPA amendments faced opposition from potential host states, highlighting the need for state cooperation in any renewed \"consent based\" siting effort for nuclear waste disposal. The Blue Ribbon Commission's recommendations include centralized interim storage and alternative repository sites.
