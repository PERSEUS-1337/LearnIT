    "content": "Few shot image classification involves learning a classifier from limited labeled data. Generating classification weights is common in meta-learning for few shot image classification. However, it is challenging to generate exact and universal weights for diverse query samples with very few training samples. To address this, Attentive Weights Generation for few shot learning via Information Maximization (AWGIM) is introduced. AWGIM generates different classification weights for each query sample by allowing them to attend to the entire support set. AWGIM introduces a novel approach to few shot learning by generating adaptive classification weights for different query samples. This is achieved by maximizing the mutual information between the generated weights and the query and support data. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through extensive experiments, showing that AWGIM can achieve state-of-the-art results in few shot learning. AWGIM introduces a novel approach to few shot learning by generating adaptive classification weights for different query samples. This method maximizes mutual information between the weights and query/support data, proving effective in experiments and achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. Few shot learning is proposed to enable deep models to learn from very few samples.

AWGIM maximizes mutual information between generated weights and query, support data in few shot learning. It eliminates inner update while maintaining state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. The induced computational overhead is minimal due to the nature of few shot problems. AWGIM is evaluated on two benchmark datasets and shows state-of-the-art performance. In few-shot learning, labeled training data is gaining attention. Existing methods use meta learning, categorized into gradient-based and metric-based approaches. Gradient-based methods learn optimal initialization for tasks, while metric-based methods learn similarity metrics between samples. In few-shot learning, methods involve optimizing activations of layers by gradients for the task. Metric-based approaches learn similarity metrics between query and support samples, considering spatial information and local descriptors for richer similarities.

Attention mechanisms have shown success in computer vision and natural language processing. In this work, attention mechanisms are used to model the interaction between queries and key-value pairs for classification tasks. Both self and cross attention are employed to encode task and query-task information, similar to Attentive Neural Processes. In this work, attention mechanisms are utilized for few-shot image classification by maximizing mutual information. The approach contrasts with regression tasks that focus on stochastic processes and variational objectives. Mutual information measures the decrease in uncertainty of one random variable when another is known, defined as the Kullback-Leibler divergence between joint distribution and product of variables. Mutual information measures uncertainty decrease in one random variable when another is known. It is defined as Kullback-Leibler divergence between joint distribution and product of marginal distributions. Mutual information is widely used in applications like Generative Adversarial Networks and self-supervised learning. The attentive path equips the query sample with task knowledge using an attention mechanism. The weight generator generates classification weights specific for x by taking concatenated representations as input. These weights can predict class labels for x and X, and are also used for reconstruction.

These weights can predict class labels for x and X, and are also used for reconstruction. The proposed model is described in Sec. 3.3, with an objective function that maximizes mutual information between certain variables.

Finn et al. (2017) describe a meta-learning approach where support and query sets are used to optimize the model during meta-training and evaluate performance during meta-testing on disjoint classes. The model aims to transfer knowledge across tasks and adapt quickly to novel tasks. The proposed meta-learning method evaluates on Q with labeled S. It focuses on transferring knowledge across tasks and quickly adapting to novel tasks. The approach generates classification weights using a feature extractor and the LEO method. The meta-learning method focuses on transferring knowledge across tasks and quickly adapting to novel tasks by using a feature extractor to output image feature embeddings. The Latent Embedding Optimization (LEO) method is used to generate classification weights for different tasks. The Latent Embedding Optimization (LEO) method generates classification weights for different tasks by decoding weights from a latent space z using a generating function l. This approach avoids updating high-dimensional weights in the inner loop by learning a lower-dimensional latent space. LEO generates classification weights by decoding from a latent space, avoiding high-dimensional weight updates. Unlike AWGIM, LEO does not require inner updates and generates fixed weights based on the support set within a task. In Section 3.4, LEO can be seen as a special case of AWGIM. The framework of the proposed method includes a feature extractor processing images in a sampled task, represented as d-dimensional vectors. Task context and individual query samples are encoded through contextual and attentive paths. The feature extractor processes images in a sampled task, represented as d-dimensional vectors. Two paths encode task context and query samples - contextual and attentive paths. The outputs are concatenated for classification weight generation, predicting labels and maximizing mutual information. The encoding process involves two paths - contextual and attentive, aiming to learn representations for the support set. The contextual path uses a multi-head self-attention network to generate richer information for task-related weights. The contextual path in the encoding process generates richer information for task-related weights, while the attentive path allows individual query examples to adapt to different query samples for optimal classification weights generation. The attentive path introduces adaptive classification weights by allowing individual query examples to attend to the task context, generating weights that are aware of the task context and adaptive to different query samples. A multi-head self-attention network is employed in the attentive path to encode global task information, different from the contextual path which focuses on generating classification weights. In the attentive path, a new multi-head self-attention network is used to encode global task information. This network differs from the contextual path as it focuses on providing value context for query samples to attend in cross attention. Sharing the same self-attention networks may limit the expressiveness of learned representations in both paths. The cross attention network is applied to each query sample and task-aware support set to produce X ap \u2208 R |Q|\u00d7d h using multi-head attention with h heads. In the attentive path, a multi-head self-attention network encodes global task information, focusing on providing value context for query samples in cross attention. Multi-head attention is used to learn comprehensive representations from different subspaces. The cross attention network is applied to each query sample and task-aware support set to produce X ap \u2208 R |Q|\u00d7d h. The attentive path uses multi-head self-attention to encode global task information and generate X ap. X cp and X ap are concatenated to form X cp\u2295ap, allowing each query sample to have specific classification weights based on task-context and individual adaptiveness. The classification weights for each query sample are generated based on task-context and individual adaptiveness. The weights follow a Gaussian distribution, sampled during meta-training, and represented as W \u2208 R |Q|\u00d7N K\u00d7d. The mean value of K classification weights is computed for each class to obtain W final \u2208 R |Q|\u00d7N \u00d7d. During meta-training, classification weights are sampled and represented as W \u2208 R |Q|\u00d7N K\u00d7d. The mean value of K weights is computed for each class to obtain W final \u2208 R |Q|\u00d7N \u00d7d. The prediction for query data is computed by XW finalT. Support data X is replicated for |Q| times and reshaped as X s \u2208 R |Q|\u00d7N K\u00d7d, allowing the prediction for support data to be computed as X s W finalT. Additionally, there are two decoders r1 and r2 that reconstruct X cp and X ap respectively using the generated weights W. During meta-training, classification weights are sampled and represented as W \u2208 R |Q|\u00d7N K\u00d7d. The prediction for support data can also be computed as X s W finalT. Two decoders r1 and r2 reconstruct X cp and X ap respectively using the generated weights W. The reason for using reconstruction as auxiliary tasks will be discussed in the following section. During meta-training, classification weights are sampled and represented as W. The analysis for one query sample shows that query-specific weights do not outperform a weight generator conditioned only on the support data. This suggests that the information from the attentive path is not well preserved during weight generation. The analysis reveals that query-specific weights do not outperform a weight generator conditioned on support data, indicating a lack of preservation of information from the attentive path during weight generation. To address this, the proposal is to maximize mutual information between generated weights and support/query data. The objective function aims to maximize mutual information between generated weights and support/query data using Variational Information Maximization. This involves approximating the true posterior distribution with p \u03b8 (x|w) and maximizing a lower bound as a proxy for the true mutual information. The objective function maximizes the log likelihood of labels for support and query data with respect to network parameters, approximating true posterior distributions using p \u03b8 (x|w) and p \u03b8 (x, y|w) to maximize mutual information. The new objective function maximizes the log likelihood of labels for support and query data by minimizing cross entropy between prediction and ground-truth. It assumes Gaussian distributions and uses r1 and r2 to approximate the means. The loss function involves reconstructing xcp and xap with L2 loss. The loss function for training the network involves maximizing the log likelihood of labels for support and query data by minimizing cross entropy. Hyper-parameters \u03bb1, \u03bb2, \u03bb3 are used to balance different terms, forcing the generated classification weights to carry information about the support data and query sample. In LEO, the inner update loss is computed as cross entropy on support data. The inner update loss in LEO is computed as cross entropy on support data, but weight generation does not involve specific query samples, making reconstruction impossible. LEO can be seen as a special case of the proposed method with only a contextual path and \u03bb2 = \u03bb3 = 0. The encoding process in the contextual path results in computational complexity O((N K) 2) due to self-attention. AWGIM avoids inner updates without compromising computational complexity. The total complexity is O((N K) 2 + |Q|(N K)), with negligible overhead due to few-shot learning nature and parallel implementation of cross attention. The value of |Q| depends on the setting and cross attention can be implemented parallelly via matrix multiplication, resulting in negligible computational overhead. AWGIM avoids inner updates without compromising performance, reducing training and inference time significantly. Empirical evaluation on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets shows the model's effectiveness compared to other methods. On miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets, commonly used in benchmarking, our model was compared with other methods. miniImageNet has 100 classes with 600 images each, while tieredImageNet has 608 classes and 779,165 images selected from 34 higher level nodes in ImageNet hierarchy. The datasets were split for meta-training, meta-validation, and meta-testing. tieredImageNet is a larger dataset with 608 classes and 779,165 images selected from 34 higher level nodes in ImageNet hierarchy. 351 classes from 20 high level nodes are used for meta-training, 97 from 6 nodes for meta-validation, and 160 from 8 nodes for meta-testing.

The weights are generated for each query sample in AWGIM and shuffled to study their adaptability. In AWGIM, weights are generated for query samples and shuffled to study their adaptability. Random shuffling between classes degrades accuracy in 5-way 1-shot experiments, while shuffling within classes has minimal impact. This suggests that with limited support data, weights for query samples within the same class are similar, but distinct for different classes. In this study, it was found that with limited support data, weights for query samples within the same class are very similar, but distinct for different classes. Larger support sets lead to more diverse and specific classification weights for each query sample in a 5-way 5-shot setting. This is due to the increased knowledge available to estimate optimal classification weights. More detailed analysis can be found in Appendix A.3.
