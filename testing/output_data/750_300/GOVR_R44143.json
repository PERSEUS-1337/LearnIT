    "content": "The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause prohibits states from denying equal protection of the laws. The Supreme Court has extended equal protection principles to apply to the federal government as well. Different levels of scrutiny are applied by courts when reviewing government actions that classify people. When courts review governmental action that classifies people, they apply different levels of scrutiny based on the classification. The more suspect the classification, the higher the scrutiny level. There are three levels of scrutiny: strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis review. Strict scrutiny is the most demanding form of judicial review. Strict scrutiny is the most demanding form of judicial review, applied to governmental classifications that are constitutionally suspect or interfere with fundamental rights. Courts consider historical discrimination, minority status with unchangeable characteristics, or inadequate political protection to determine suspect classifications. When applying strict scrutiny to governmental action, courts consider if the classification is historically discriminated against, a minority group with unchangeable characteristics, or inadequately protected by the political process. Suspect classifications include those based on race, national origin, and alienage. The government must prove that its actions are narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest under strict scrutiny. When governmental action is reviewed, courts apply strict scrutiny to determine if it is narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. The government must prove the constitutional validity of its action under strict scrutiny, showing that less discriminatory means are not available. Intermediate scrutiny, applied to \"quasi-suspect\" classifications like gender or illegitimacy, is less stringent than strict scrutiny but more rigorous than rational basis review. Intermediate scrutiny applies to \"quasi-suspect\" classifications like gender or illegitimacy, determining if the action is substantially related to an important government interest. The government bears the burden of proving constitutional validity under this scrutiny, which is less stringent than strict scrutiny but more rigorous than rational basis review. Rational basis review is the least searching form of judicial scrutiny, applying to classifications not subject to heightened levels of scrutiny. To survive, governmental action must be rationally related to a legitimate government interest. Courts consider the legitimacy of any possible governmental purpose behind the action, and it only needs to be a reasonable way of achieving a legitimate government purpose to pass rational basis review. Rational basis review is deferential to the government, as courts presume the constitutionality of governmental actions subject to this scrutiny. Parties challenging such actions bear the burden of proving their invalidity. The government and courts presume the constitutionality of governmental actions under rational basis review. Parties challenging actions must prove their invalidity. Due process guarantees in the U.S. Constitution are in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, applying to federal and state actions respectively. The Fifth Amendment prohibits the federal government from depriving a person of \"life, liberty, or property\" without due process of law, while the Fourteenth Amendment applies to state action. Due process ensures that the government cannot infringe on fundamental rights without following specific procedures, including substantive guarantees against undue governmental interference. Substantive due process protects fundamental rights by prohibiting undue government infringement, subjecting such actions to strict scrutiny. Fundamental rights are historically recognized and must be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. The Supreme Court has held that governmental action infringing upon fundamental rights is subject to strict scrutiny, requiring it to be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. The government must show a substantial and legitimate need for its action to further a compelling interest, ensuring it does not encumber fundamental rights more than necessary. Additionally, alternative actions that are less burdensome on rights should be considered if available. The Supreme Court requires governmental action infringing on fundamental rights to be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. The government must show a legitimate need for its action without encumbering fundamental rights more than necessary. The Court has recognized rights such as the right to have children, use contraception, and marry. In Obergefell, the Court considered whether states must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In Obergefell, the Supreme Court ruled that states must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages legally formed in other states, citing the Constitution's due process and equal protection principles. The Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that states must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages legally formed in other states, based on the Constitution's due process and equal protection principles. The decision was grounded in the fundamental right to marry, which the Court deemed constitutionally protected for both opposite-sex and same-sex couples. The Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that states must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages legally formed in other states. The Court acknowledged that its precedent assumed an opposite-sex relationship but identified reasons why the right to marry is fundamental for same-sex couples as well. These reasons include personal choice, support for a committed union, safeguarding children, and marriage's role in the nation's social order. The Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, citing reasons such as personal choice, committed union, safeguarding children, and marriage's role in the nation's social order. The Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, recognizing that rights are not solely based on historical practices but also on a modern understanding of constitutional imperatives. The Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges recognized the fundamental right of same-sex couples to marry, stating that rights come from a modern understanding of constitutional imperatives, not just ancient sources. The Court did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans, departing from previous approaches. The Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges recognized the fundamental right of same-sex couples to marry, departing from previous approaches that did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans. The states argued for bans based on waiting to see how the debate progresses and incentivizing procreating couples to stay together during child rearing. However, the Court did not address whether the bans were constitutional. The Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges recognized the fundamental right of same-sex couples to marry, departing from previous approaches that did not apply strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans. The Court held that both equal protection and due process guarantees protect the fundamental right to marry, and that states can no longer deny this right to same-sex couples. The Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges recognized the fundamental right of same-sex couples to marry, stating that states cannot deny this right. The Court did not specify the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation, leading to dissent among some Justices. Some dissenting Justices in Obergefell believed the majority overstepped by deciding on same-sex marriage instead of leaving it to the democratic process. They criticized the majority for establishing a new fundamental right and not following Supreme Court precedent. The dissenting Justices in Obergefell criticized the majority for establishing a new fundamental right without considering history and tradition, which they believe should guide the Court's decisions on constitutional protection of rights. The decision on state same-sex marriage bans raised questions about its broader impact on rights. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell regarding state same-sex marriage bans raised questions about its broader impact on the rights of gay individuals, the level of judicial scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation, implications for laws prohibiting plural marriages, the Court's approach to recognizing fundamental rights, and the level of judicial scrutiny for governmental action interfering with fundamental rights. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about its impact on the rights of gay individuals outside of the marriage context. The decision appears limited to the marriage context, with its holding resting on the fundamental right to marry. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell was limited to the marriage context, focusing on the fundamental right to marry. The Court did not address whether classifications based on sexual orientation warrant heightened scrutiny, potentially limiting broader implications for the rights of gay individuals. The Court's decision in Obergefell did not address whether classifications based on sexual orientation warrant heightened scrutiny, which could have broader implications for the rights of gay individuals. Prior to Obergefell, federal appeals courts were divided on the level of scrutiny for such classifications. The Ninth Circuit held that classifications based on sexual orientation may warrant heightened scrutiny, but did not specify if it was intermediate or strict. The U.S. Courts of Appeals have differing views on the scrutiny level for classifications based on sexual orientation. The Ninth and Second Circuits consider them quasi-suspect, subject to intermediate scrutiny, while the Sixth Circuit does not view them as suspect. The U.S. Courts of Appeals have differing views on the scrutiny level for classifications based on sexual orientation. The Sixth Circuit does not consider them suspect, subject only to rational basis review. The Court's decision in Obergefell, limited to the marriage context, does not resolve the circuit split on the level of scrutiny for sexual orientation classifications. Other lower courts will need to address this issue. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell is limited to the marriage context and does not resolve the circuit split on the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. This ambiguity leaves open the possibility for different circuit courts to apply either heightened scrutiny or rational basis review to laws based on sexual orientation. Some lower courts may apply heightened scrutiny to laws classifying based on sexual orientation, potentially leading to different outcomes for similar laws. This ambiguity stems from the Supreme Court's limited decision in Obergefell, leaving room for varying levels of scrutiny by different circuit courts. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about extending the right to marry to polygamy, with Chief Justice John Roberts suggesting it could lead to the legalization of plural marriages. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised concerns about extending the right to marry to polygamy, with Chief Justice John Roberts suggesting it could lead to the legalization of plural marriages. The majority's opinion in Obergefell aimed to limit its reach to same-sex marriage, preventing the extension of the fundamental right to marry to plural marriages. The Supreme Court's Obergefell decision extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, citing reasons like individual autonomy and family. Some commentators argue that this rationale may not apply to legalizing plural marriage. The Obergefell decision extended the right to marry to same-sex couples based on individual autonomy and family considerations. This departure from precedent in determining fundamental rights raises the possibility of future consideration of current societal views in addition to historical and traditional recognition. The Court's deviation from historical and traditional recognition in determining fundamental rights may lead to considering current societal views. This could expand the number of rights deemed fundamental for due process protections, especially regarding same-sex marriage bans. The Court did not specify the level of judicial review applied in these cases. The Court's decision on state same-sex marriage bans did not specify the level of judicial review applied, raising questions about the scrutiny of governmental actions infringing on fundamental rights. Increased scrutiny may impact the constitutionality of government actions interfering with fundamental rights."
