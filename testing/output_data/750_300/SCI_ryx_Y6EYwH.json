The proposed method addresses privacy concerns in survival function estimation in medical analytics by providing confidential intervals and test statistics without extra privacy budget. It also offers extensions for differentially private estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence function. Empirical evidence from nine clinical datasets shows the method's utility and strong privacy guarantees. An example is given where an adversary can reconstruct user-level data from published survival function estimates. The survival function estimates published using patient data can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, as an adversary can reconstruct user-level data from the published estimates. The survival function is used in various domains to model time to an event, considering that some subjects may not experience the event at the time of data collection. The survival function is used in different domains to model time to an event, such as duration of unemployment, machine part failure, disease recurrence, infection, and death. Healthcare information is highly sensitive and protected by law, with information leakage in this domain being a serious issue. This study focuses on estimating the survival function using Kaplan-Meier's method. The study focuses on estimating the survival function using Kaplan-Meier's method, which is widely used in clinical research and statistical agencies worldwide. Information leakage in the healthcare domain is a serious issue due to the sensitivity of healthcare information protected by law. Almost every clinical study and statistical agency worldwide uses Kaplan-Meier's method to report survival statistics. No existing model provides formal privacy guarantees for survival function estimation with this method, except for a limited approach by Nguy\u00ean & Hui (2017) for regression modeling of discrete time to event data. The related work by Nguy\u00ean & Hui (2017) focuses on regression modeling of discrete time to event data but is limited to multivariate regression models. Generative models like differentially private generative adversarial networks have been suggested for estimating survival functions, but they struggle with the datasets typically encountered in this context. Generative models like GANs can be trained to generate differentially private synthetic data for estimating survival functions. However, GANs do not generalize well to datasets with small sample sizes, constrained dimensionality, and a mix of categorical and continuous variables. A new method based on the KM method is proposed for estimating the survival function, ensuring differential privacy. The first differentially private method for estimating the survival function based on the KM method is proposed, ensuring differential privacy and extending to provide confidence intervals and test statistics without extra privacy cost. The method is further extended for estimating the competing risk cumulative incidence function using real-life clinical datasets. The method proposed provides differential privacy for estimating survival functions and competing risk cumulative incidence functions in clinical research. It offers good utility and strong privacy guarantees, demonstrated through real-life clinical datasets. The method is also available as an R package for easy accessibility.

It is available as an R package for easy accessibility. The survival function models time to event data, accounting for censored observations. The survival function estimates the probability of not experiencing an event before a certain time. Various methods, including parametric ones like exponential and Weibull distributions, can be used to estimate the survival function. The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a non-parametric method used to estimate the survival function in clinical literature. It does not assume how the probability of an event changes over time and is defined based on distinct failure times and the number of failures at those times. The Kaplan-Meier estimator in clinical literature focuses on survival models. It is defined based on distinct failure times and the number of failures at those times, resulting in a step function characteristic. Differential privacy provides a provable privacy notion for randomized algorithms. The Kaplan-Meier estimator in clinical literature is defined by distinct failure times and the number of failures, resulting in a step function characteristic. Differential privacy ensures privacy for randomized algorithms by preserving privacy with neighboring datasets. The concept of differential privacy ensures privacy for randomized algorithms by preserving privacy with neighboring datasets. Smaller values of \u03b4 provide stronger privacy guarantees, with \"pure-differential privacy\" achieved when \u03b4 = 0. Differential privacy has key properties, including postprocessing as outlined in Theorem 1. Theorem 1 states that differential privacy is immune to post-processing, meaning an adversary cannot increase privacy loss by acting on the output of a differentially private algorithm. This concept is central to the approach of ensuring privacy for randomized algorithms. The method introduced here focuses on estimating the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier's method while adhering to the principles of differential privacy. Our method for differentially private estimation of the survival function using Kaplan-Meier's method ensures differential privacy. It allows for estimating various statistics in a differentially private manner without extra privacy budget. Our method ensures differential privacy when estimating statistics like confidence intervals and comparison test statistics using Kaplan-Meier's method. We use a dataset with time points, number of subjects at risk, and number of progressions to achieve this. Our method ensures differential privacy in estimating statistics like confidence intervals and comparison test statistics using Kaplan-Meier's method by creating a dataset with time points, number of subjects at risk, and number of progressions. This involves creating a matrix M with event data and at-risk numbers for each time point, adding noise from a Laplace distribution to M, and performing calculations using M. The process is succinctly presented in Algorithm 1. Our method ensures differential privacy in estimating statistics like confidence intervals and comparison test statistics using Kaplan-Meier's method. Algorithm 1 creates a matrix M with event data and at-risk numbers for each time point, adding noise from a Laplace distribution to M. The simplicity of the procedure and minimal changes required make it accessible for implementation using any software package. The original estimation procedure was modified to achieve differential privacy without any computational overhead. This method can be easily implemented using existing software packages and extended for estimating other associated statistics with formal privacy guarantees. The method discussed can be extended for differentially private estimation of various statistics. The L 1 sensitivity of the method is established as two, ensuring privacy guarantees. Algorithm 1 is proven to be -differentially private. The L1 sensitivity of the method is established as two, ensuring privacy guarantees. Algorithm 1 is proven to be differentially private by adding Laplace noise. The estimated function is also differentially private by the post-processing theorem. The method ensures differential privacy by using (r j , d j) to calculate the survival function. The approach allows for easy extension to other essential statistics like confidence intervals and test statistics. The method ensures differential privacy by using (r j , d j) to calculate the survival function. Extensions include confidence intervals and test statistics for comparing survival function distributions. It is important to provide differentially private counterparts for both confidence intervals and test statistics. Confidence intervals for survival function estimates are calculated in a \"point-wise\" fashion, ensuring differential privacy. The calculations required for obtaining confidence intervals are proven to be differentially private. The calculations for obtaining confidence intervals for survival function estimates are proven to be differentially private, specifically focusing on Greenwood's linear-point-wise confidence intervals. The confidence intervals for survival function estimates are made differentially private using Greenwood's formula and Algorithm 1. This ensures privacy without needing access to sensitive data for calculation. The differentially private confidence intervals for survival function estimates are provided without additional privacy cost. Hypothesis testing using the Logrank test is also shown to be differentially private using Algorithm 6. The Logrank test is a commonly used statistical test in clinical trials. Using Algorithm 6, hypothesis testing with the Logrank test is shown to be differentially private. The test statistic (Z) is made differentially private by replacing sensitive information with private counterparts. The Logrank test is made differentially private by replacing sensitive information with private counterparts using Algorithm 1. This ensures that the test statistic Z and related confidence intervals are also differentially private. The Logrank test is made differentially private by Algorithm 1, ensuring that Z and confidence intervals are also private. Competing events, like death before progression to AIDS, can impact observations. Competing events, such as death before progression to AIDS, can impact observations. Competing events are common in clinical data and require specialized estimates like the competing risk cumulative incidence. Algorithm 1 extends differential privacy to competing risk scenarios. The competing risk cumulative incidence, similar to the Kaplan-Meier estimator but for competing events, can be made -differentially private using Algorithm 1. This method replaces quantities with their private counterparts, ensuring privacy while estimating cumulative incidence for competing events. The competing risk cumulative incidence, similar to the Kaplan-Meier estimator but for competing events, can be made differentially private using Algorithm 1. Replacing associated quantities with their private counterparts ensures privacy while estimating cumulative incidence for competing events. Further statistics such as confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, hazard function, and hazard ratios can also be made differentially private using this method. The differentially private version of the Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard can be obtained using Algorithm 1. This method can also be applied to tests, hazard function, hazard ratios, and other related quantities. An empirical evaluation was conducted on nine real-life clinical datasets with time to event information. The empirical evaluation of a method for producing differentially private estimates of the survival function is presented using nine real-life clinical datasets. Details of the datasets are provided in Table 1, with further information available in the Appendix. The approach is compared to the original \"non-private\" version to establish a comparison to the upper bound. Our method for producing differentially private estimates of the survival function is compared to the original non-private version to establish credibility and utility. The evaluation is conducted on nine real-life datasets, starting with the estimation of the private survival function and then evaluating extensions. The evaluation of our method for producing differentially private estimates of the survival function on nine real-life datasets shows high utility with little privacy loss. The privacy-preserving estimation closely matches the non-private version, with some deterioration as privacy budget increases. Our privacy-preserving estimation closely matches the original survival function with little utility loss, deteriorating as privacy budget increases. The method provides good utility while safeguarding privacy, showing that smaller datasets have worse performance compared to larger ones. Our method provides good utility while protecting privacy, with smaller datasets performing worse than larger ones. As dataset size decreases, the utility of differentially private estimation also decreases due to the need for larger noise to protect privacy. In moderate to medium-sized datasets, our estimation yields good results even in high privacy regimes. In small datasets, large noise is needed to protect privacy. Differentially private estimation works well for moderate to medium-sized datasets, even in high privacy regimes. Median survival time and confidence intervals are important estimates reported with survival functions. Our method shows high precision in estimating the median survival time. Our method shows high precision in estimating the median survival time, even in high privacy regimes. The confidence intervals for the survival function serve as the confidence intervals of the median survival, with some cases unable to estimate upper bounds due to high survival. Precision increases with larger dataset sizes, balancing individual-level privacy protection. Our precision increases with larger dataset sizes, balancing individual-level privacy protection. Differentially private estimation performs at par with the original \"non-noisy\" estimation, even in high privacy regimes. The test statistic (Z) follows the \u03c7 2 distribution with one degree of freedom, and none of the differentially private estimates change the statistical significance threshold. Results from using differentially private estimates show that they do not affect the statistical significance threshold. The proposed method also performs well in estimating competing risk cumulative incidence while maintaining individual privacy. Detailed results can be found in the Appendix. Our proposed method provides accurate estimation of risk cumulative incidence while preserving individual privacy.
