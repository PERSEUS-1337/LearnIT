Appropriations totaled $33.5 billion in P.L. 111-85, with additional funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. President Obama's proposed FY2011 budget for Energy and Water Development programs was $35.3 billion. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development approved a bill on July 15, 2010, to fund these programs. In FY2010, Energy and Water Development programs were funded at $33.5 billion in P.L. 111-85. President Obama proposed a budget of $35.3 billion for FY2011. The House Subcommittee approved funding at $34.7 billion, while the Senate approved $35.0 billion. A continuing resolution was passed on September 30. The full Appropriations Committee reported out S. 3635 (S.Rept. 111-228) on July 22 with a total of $35.0 billion. The bill did not come to the floor of either the House or the Senate. Later, funding was extended through various resolutions until March 18, 2011. On March 2, P.L. 112-4 amended P.L. 111-242, extending funding for Energy and Water Development programs through March 18, 2011, with reduced funding levels. H.R. 1 was introduced on February 14, 2011, to continue funding for FY2011 at FY2010 levels, with exceptions for reduced funding. The House passed H.R. 1 on February 19 with a funding level of $29.9 billion. In the Senate, S.Amdt. 149 was offered as a substitute for H.R. 1, with funding reductions totaling approximately $32.4 billion. The House passed H.R. 1 with $29.9 billion in Water Development funding. The Senate rejected both H.R. 1 and S.Amdt. 149, leading to the introduction of H.R. 1473, which was signed into law funding Energy and Water Development programs at approximately $32.2 billion. The Energy and Water Development bill, H.R. 1473, was signed into law on April 15 (P.L. 112-10), funding programs at approximately $32.2 billion. It includes funding for various projects under the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and others.

Funding sources from H.R. 1, S.Amdt. 149, and P.L. 112-10 are included in the overall title tables. The FY2011 budget request for the Army Corps of Engineers was $4.88 billion, below the appropriated level for FY2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $5.32 billion, slightly below the FY2010 appropriation. The House Appropriations Subcommittee provided $5.28 billion for the Corps. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development allocated $5.28 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers, which was slightly below the FY2010 appropriation. The Continuing Resolution provided $5.05 billion for the Corps, an increase of $152 million over the President's request but $411 million below the FY2010 enacted level. The Continuing Resolution allocated $5.05 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers, $152 million above the President's request but $411 million below the FY2010 enacted level. Federal funds for the Corps are not distributed based on a formula or competitive program, with 85% directed to specific projects identified in the budget request or added during congressional deliberations. The Army Corps of Engineers' civil works activities are funded through specific projects identified in the budget request or added during congressional deliberations. Funding debates often involve earmarks, with appropriations typically tied to projects authorized in a Water Resources Development Act. The backlog of authorized projects ranges from $11 billion to over $80 billion, depending on inclusion criteria. The backlog of authorized projects for the Army Corps of Engineers' civil works activities ranges from $11 billion to over $80 billion. This backlog raises policy questions about the disconnect between authorization and appropriations processes and how to prioritize among authorized activities. Annual appropriations for the Corps' Civil Works program have been regularly increased since Hurricane Katrina through supplemental appropriations and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Since Hurricane Katrina, the Army Corps of Engineers has received approximately $18.7 billion in supplemental appropriations for post-hurricane emergency repairs in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. For instance, in 2008, they received $5.76 billion for Louisiana hurricane protection, and in 2009, they were provided $797 million. The Army Corps of Engineers received significant funding for post-hurricane emergency repairs in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region. In 2008, they received $5.76 billion for Louisiana hurricane protection, and in 2009, they were provided $797 million for flood control and coastal emergencies, including barrier island and ecosystem restoration for the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Additionally, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated an extra $4.6 billion for construction funding. The Army Corps of Engineers received funding for post-hurricane repairs in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast. In 2009, they were provided $797 million for flood control and coastal emergencies, including ecosystem restoration for the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 allocated an additional $4.6 billion for construction funding. The FY2011 Obama Administration request included $1.69 billion for construction, with a reduction of $341 million from the previous year. The request limited new construction starts to two projects. The Obama Administration's FY2011 request for the Army Corps of Engineers included a reduction of $341 million from the previous year. The request limited new construction starts to two projects, following the previous administration's policy of generally opposing new starts to focus funds on completing ongoing activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $1.9 billion for the Construction account, utilizing unobligated balances from prior year appropriations for the Continuing Authorities Program. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $1.9 billion for the Construction account, using $120 million in unobligated balances for the Continuing Authorities Program. They included one new construction start from the Administration but no other new starts. The House subcommittee bill would have funded Construction at $1.851 billion, while the enacted bill provided $1.78 billion for construction. The House subcommittee bill funded Construction at $1.851 billion, slightly more than the Administration's request. The enacted bill also included a provision barring the Corps from new starts. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund is facing a deficit, with needed funding exceeding incoming collections. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund has been facing a deficit as outlays have exceeded collections, which are roughly $85 million per year. Current law designates federal responsibility for construction and major rehabilitation of inland waterways, with funding split equally between the IWTF and federal general revenue. IWTF funding comes from a fuel tax on commercial vessels and investment interest. Additional federal funding was provided in FY2009 and FY2010 to maintain IWTF solvency. The Inland Waterway Trust Fund faces a deficit due to outlays exceeding collections. Funding comes from a fuel tax on commercial vessels and investment interest. Additional federal funding was provided in FY2009 and FY2010 to maintain solvency. Previous proposals to increase revenues included a lock user fee, but the FY2011 Budget did not assume additional revenue from this proposal. The FY2011 Budget did not include revenue from a lock user fee proposal. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the user fee approach and agreed to limit IWTF spending to current fuel tax revenues. If a solution is not reached soon, the committee may be forced to take action. The Senate Appropriations Committee rejected the user fee approach in FY2011 but agreed to budget only current year fuel tax revenues. Concerns about funding for Corps activities in the Everglades and progress in restoration efforts are discussed. The FY2011 Obama Administration requested $180 million for the Corps' component of south Florida Everglades restoration work, the same as the FY2010 appropriation. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed reducing this amount to $155 million. The Corps' south Florida Everglades restoration work funding remains at $180 million, the same as FY2010. The Senate proposed a reduction to $155 million due to the Corps' inability to utilize the original FY2011 request. No across-the-board reductions have been proposed or enacted for savings and slippage since FY2006. Since FY2006, there have been no across-the-board reductions proposed or enacted for savings and slippage within individual accounts. The savings account is used to anticipate spending delays on projects due to various reasons. Congress stopped applying an S&S rate in FY2006. In FY2006, Congress stopped applying an S&S rate to decrease the need for reprogramming allocations among projects. The FY2011 Senate Appropriations Committee markup for the Corps included reductions for Investigations, Construction, Operations and Maintenance, and Mississippi Rivers & Tributaries. The FY2011 Senate Appropriations Committee markup for the Corps included reductions for Investigations, Construction, Operations and Maintenance, and Mississippi Rivers & Tributaries. The Obama Administration requested $43.0 million for the Central Utah Project (CUP) Completion Account in FY2011, $1 million more than FY2010. The FY2011 request for the Bureau of Reclamation totaled $1.064 billion, $22 million less than FY2010. The FY2011 request for the Bureau of Reclamation totaled $1.064 billion, $22 million less than FY2010. The request includes an \"offset\" of $49.9 million for the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund, resulting in a net discretionary authority of $1.015 billion. An additional $167 million is estimated to be available for FY2011, bringing the total budget to $1.182 billion. The total discretionary budget request for Title II funding was approximately $1.107 billion. The FY2011 budget request for the Bureau of Reclamation is $1.064 billion, with an additional $167 million available for a total of $1.182 billion. The total discretionary budget request for Title II funding is approximately $1.107 billion. The enacted bill appropriated $1.129 billion, while the Senate bill proposed $1.133 billion and the House subcommittee's bill proposed $1.108 billion. P.L. 112-10 ultimately appropriated $1.094 billion for these programs. The House subcommittee's bill allocated $1.108 billion for Reclamation's Water and Related Resources Account, which includes various programs and projects. The Obama Administration had requested $913.6 million for this account for FY2011. H.R. 1 proposed funding for the Water and Related Resources Account. The Administration requested $913.6 million for the Water and Related Resources Account for FY2011, a reduction of $37.6 million from FY2010. H.R. 1 proposed funding at $911.6 million, with amendments impacting dam removal and funding restrictions. The bill proposed funding reductions for the Water and Related Resources Account for FY2011, with amendments impacting dam removal and funding restrictions that were not included in the final enacted version. The Central Valley Project and California State Project operations are affected by funding restrictions in the bill. The Bureau of Reclamation, not the Army Corps of Engineers, built dams and water diversion structures in the West for irrigation purposes. Today, Reclamation manages numerous dams and diversion projects. Reclamation's mission is to develop water supplies for irrigation in the West, managing hundreds of dams and reservoirs in 17 states. They provide water to 10 million acres of farmland and 31 million people, making them the largest water supplier in the West and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. Their facilities also offer flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits. Reclamation is the largest wholesale water supplier in the 17 western states and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. Their facilities provide flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits, but operations are often controversial due to their impact on fish and wildlife species and conflicts among water users. The agency's budget consists mainly of individual project funding, and in FY2010, it was criticized for lacking leadership and being a \"caretaker agency.\" In FY2010, the House Committee on Appropriations criticized Reclamation for lacking leadership and becoming a \"caretaker agency.\" They emphasized the need for active leadership in managing western water resources, especially with challenges like balancing competing needs and increasing demand for water supply. The Central Valley Project (CVP) in California is highlighted as one of Reclamation's largest and most complex water projects, where water deliveries have had to be limited recently. Competing needs, increasing demand for water supply, and changing hydrology require active leadership in western water resource management. The Central Valley Project (CVP) in California, one of Reclamation's largest water projects, has faced water delivery limitations due to drought and environmental restrictions. Previous appropriations bills have included amendments to prevent Reclamation from implementing new Biological Opinions on project operations' impact on certain fish species. In FY2010 appropriations, amendments were made to prevent Reclamation from implementing new Biological Opinions on the impact of project operations on certain fish species, such as Delta Smelt and salmon in California. These species are protected under the federal Endangered Species Act. The 2004 Operations Criteria and Plan (OCAP) allowed increased pumping from the Delta, jeopardizing the existence of Delta Smelt and salmon in California, protected under the Endangered Species Act. Critically low numbers of Delta Smelt have resulted from various factors including invasive species, pollution, and water withdrawals. Critically low numbers of Delta Smelt have led to court-imposed limits on pumping, with other factors like invasive species and pollution also contributing to fishery declines. Low water deliveries exacerbate unemployment in water districts with junior rights, impacting an already struggling economy. The FY2010 enacted bill included an amendment allowing water transfers among certain CVP contractors without meeting specific conditions. The Administration requested $40.0 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account. The Administration requested $40.0 million for the California Bay-Delta Restoration Account (Bay-Delta, or CALFED) for FY2011, with funds targeted at water use efficiency, water quality, water storage, conveyance, and ecosystem restoration. Funding for conveyance declined, while funding for water use efficiency and science increased. Reclamation proposed an allocation of $72.1 million for various projects including water use efficiency, water quality, water storage, conveyance, and ecosystem restoration. Funding for CALFED subaccounts varied, with a decline in conveyance funding and an increase in water use efficiency and science funding. The enacted Continuing Resolution provided the same amount as the President's FY2011 budget request. Reclamation proposed an allocation of $72.1 million for the San Joaquin River Restoration Fund for FY2011, authorized by the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act. The Fund is to be used for fisheries restoration and water management provisions as part of a stipulated settlement agreement. The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-11) established the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act, creating a fund for fisheries restoration and water management. The fund is funded through a reallocation of $5.6 million annually from Central Valley Project Restoration Fund receipts and accelerated payments from Friant water users. Additional authorization is needed for allocations exceeding $88 million. Significant actions planned for FY2011 include releasing interim flows from Friant Dam and completing planning, environmental compliance, and design for initial channel and structural improvements. Construction of Friant Dam in the 1940s blocked salmon migration and dewatered stretches of the San Joaquin River, leading to the elimination of spring-run Chinook. The settlement aims to restore salmon migration in the San Joaquin River and mitigate water supply impacts to Friant Division contractors. The Senate Appropriations Committee added $8 million for river restoration, in addition to the $72 million already allocated. The Senate Appropriations Committee added $8 million for San Joaquin River restoration, in addition to the $72 million already allocated. The House-passed CR (H.R. 1) includes a provision to halt funding for the settlement agreement in FY2011. Reclamation has not commented on the potential impact of this provision. P.L. 112-10 did not specify funding levels for the settlement, but Reclamation proposed funding for the WaterSMART Program in FY2011. Reclamation proposed funding for the WaterSMART Program in FY2011, which focuses on water conservation, re-use, and planning in conjunction with the U.S. Geological Survey. The program includes WaterSMART Grants, Basin Studies, and Title XVI Projects, with a proposed increase of $27.4 million. The Reclamation portion of the WaterSMART proposal for FY2011 includes WaterSMART Grants, Basin Studies, and Title XVI Projects. Reclamation proposed $62 million for WaterSMART, with $27 million for Grants, $6 million for Studies, and $29 million for Projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee decreased funding to $20 million for Grants and $4 million for Studies. The Senate Appropriations Committee decreased funding for WaterSMART programs, allocating $20 million for Grants, $4 million for Basin Studies, and $7.7 million for Title XVI Projects. P.L. 112-10 did not specify funding levels for the WaterSMART program, which falls under the larger Water and Related Resources account. The Energy and Water Development bill has funded DOE programs since FY2005, supporting research on renewable energy and nuclear power. The Energy and Water Development bill has funded DOE programs since FY2005, supporting research on renewable energy, nuclear power, general science, environmental cleanup, and nuclear weapons programs.

The DOE requested $189.5 million for EDER programs but only received $144.7 million. Additionally, the DOE sought $50 million to create a new science and engineering education program, RE-ENERGYSE, to build a skilled clean energy workforce. The DOE requested $50 million for a new science and engineering education program, RE-ENERGYSE, to build a highly skilled U.S. clean energy workforce. The program aims to educate and train Americans for green jobs and increase U.S. competitiveness by developing leading edge programs at universities and community colleges. The DOE requested $50 million for the RE-ENERGYSE program to develop a skilled clean energy workforce through education and training. This includes funding for higher education programs to support scientists, engineers, and other professionals in the clean energy field, as well as technical training and outreach programs. The $50 million request for the RE-ENERGYSE program includes funding for post-doctoral opportunities, interdisciplinary masters programs in clean energy, technical training, education, and outreach subprograms for community colleges, K-12 education activities to support students and educators in addressing long-term environment and energy challenges. The DOE proposed a $115 million RE-ENERGYSE program in FY2010 to educate and inspire K-12 students and educators to pursue clean energy careers and adopt sustainable energy practices. Congress did not fund the program, despite recognizing its important goals. The DOE proposed a $115 million RE-ENERGYSE program in FY2010 to address climate change. Congress did not fund the program due to concerns about its scope and effectiveness. The Committee supports the desired end-results of the proposed $115 million RE-ENERGYSE program but recommends $7.5 million for a study to define education and workforce needs. The program lacks sufficient details and background research to ensure effectiveness and avoid duplication. The committee looks forward to further dialogue with the Department of Energy to better define the proposal's intentions. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended zero funding for the FY2010 RE-ENERGYSE proposal, with no funding provided in the conference report for FY2010 or FY2011. The Solar Program would have received a net funding increase of $55.4 million in the FY2011 request. The Solar Program in the FY2011 request would have received a net funding increase of $55.4 million, with the majority going to the Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) subprogram for a demonstration project. This project is expected to accelerate CSP deployment in the desert Southwest by two to three years, adding about 1,000 megawatts of new capacity. The DOE proposed a major CSP demonstration project to accelerate deployment in the desert Southwest by 2-3 years, adding 1,000 MW of new capacity. The PV R&D Program would receive a $23.5 million increase for the PV Manufacturing Initiative to reduce technology costs and promote commercialization.

The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $50.0 million for the CSP demonstration project, while the Wind Program would see a net increase of $42.5 million, with a focus on offshore wind development. The Wind Program would receive a net increase of $42.5 million, with a new activity focused on commercializing offshore wind development receiving $49.0 million. This funding would support a competitive solicitation for an offshore wind demonstration project to address various barriers and accelerate the deployment of over three gigawatts of planned offshore projects. This marks the first major wind demonstration project proposed by the DOE since the early 1980s. The Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing a major offshore wind demonstration project to accelerate the deployment of over three gigawatts of planned projects. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommends at least two offshore wind demonstration projects off the Atlantic Coast. The Geothermal Program would see an increase of $11.0 million, mainly for collaborative R&D activities addressing induced seismicity and water issues. The Geothermal Program would receive a $11.0 million increase, mainly for collaborative R&D activities addressing induced seismicity, water availability, and low-temperature geothermal systems. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended the same amount as the request and directed DOE to allocate at least $5.0 million to low-temperature systems. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for low-temperature geothermal systems, with a focus on fluids co-production from oil and gas operations and geo-pressured resources. The Vehicle Technologies Program would see a net increase of $13.9 million, with a significant portion allocated to the Battery/Energy Storage subprogram for improving lithium batteries in electric vehicles. The Building Technologies Program would also receive funding in line with the requested amount. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a funding increase for the Storage subprogram to improve lithium batteries for electric vehicles. The Energy Efficient Building Systems Design Hub would also receive a modest increase in funding. The omnibus climate/energy bills would authorize DOE to establish more hubs. In FY2010, DOE sought more funding for hubs, with the Building Design Hub receiving $16.0 million less than requested. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $8.7 million less for the Buildings Program. The Industrial Technologies Program would receive a net increase of $4.0 million, with a new Manufacturing Energy Systems subprogram being established. GAO was directed to assess the need for new program guidelines due to reported issues with the ENERGY STAR program.

The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) would see a $10.3 million increase to support DOE efforts in meeting energy goals. The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) would receive a $10.3 million increase to support DOE efforts in meeting energy goals established by EISA and Executive Orders. Funding would focus on energy assessments, commissioning projects, fugitive emissions capture, and pilot projects for alternative energy sources. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a similar funding amount. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended nearly the same funding as the request for DOE efforts in meeting energy goals. The Weatherization Program would have grown by $90.0 million, with most of the increase supporting the Administration's goal to increase the number of low-income households that are weatherized. DOE estimates an average weatherization cost of $6,500 per household. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a $90.0 million increase for the Weatherization Program to support low-income households. This would allow for the weatherization of an additional 13,200 households at an average cost of $6,500 per household. Additionally, $4.2 million would go towards completing the evaluation of the program. The State Energy Program would see a $25.0 million increase to expand current activities. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a $100.0 million decrease for the Weatherization Program, citing the sufficient funding from the Recovery Act. The Facilities Program would receive a net increase of $38.5 million, primarily for the completion of the Energy Systems Integration Facility at NREL. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended a $100.0 million decrease for the Weatherization Program, citing sufficient funding from the Recovery Act. Program Direction would increase by $60.0 million, with $54.8 million for salaries and benefits to process contracts and agreements. The Department of Energy expects the number of transactions to double from FY2009 through FY2011, leading to a need for increased funding for salaries and benefits. Program Support would receive a $42.3 million increase, with $21.0 million allocated to the Strategic Priorities and Impact Analysis subprogram. The FY2011 budget proposes a $42.3 million increase, with $21.0 million allocated to the Strategic Priorities and Impact Analysis (SPIA) subprogram.

The FY2011 increase for Program Support would expand support for the International subprogram, focusing on partnerships with developing countries like China, India, and Brazil for cooperative R&D on energy security, economic goals, and climate change. New initiatives would include global technology deployment and climate change mitigation activities, such as the China and India Clean Energy Research Centers and programs under the Major Economies Forum (MEF). The DOE plans to increase funding for EERE to support new activities in clean energy research centers and programs in countries like China, India, and Brazil. This expanded funding will also facilitate partnerships with organizations like APEC, ECPA, EDIN, and regional energy platforms in Africa. Additionally, there will be increased efforts in bilateral partnerships with countries such as China, India, Russia, Brazil, Canada, and Argentina. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended reduced funding for Program Management and congressionally directed projects under the EERE program. The Hydrogen/Fuel Cell Program would also face a significant budget cut. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended reduced funding for Program Management and congressionally directed projects under the EERE program. Specifically, the Hydrogen/Fuel Cell Program would have been cut by $37.0 million, or about 21%, and the Market Transformation subprogram would have been cut by $16.9 million. The Water Power Program would have been cut by $9.5 million, or about 19%. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended restoring DOE's proposed cut for the Water Power Program, which would put FY2011 funding at the FY2010 level. The Program, focusing on water power technologies, would have been cut by $9.5 million, or about 19%. It employs marine and hydrokinetic resources to generate electricity and addresses technology development and market acceleration. DOE states that FY2010 funds are sufficient to continue assessments and initiate new projects, with the FY2011 request expected to build upon activities from FY2010. The DOE's FY2010 funds are enough to continue resource and technology assessments and start new projects. The FY2011 request aims to build on FY2010 activities and support the development of cost-effective hydropower opportunities. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended additional funding, with a focus on conventional hydropower. Industrial Programs faced cuts that would terminate subprograms for certain industries. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended an additional $20.0 million, with $15.0 million designated for conventional hydropower. Cuts were proposed for subprograms in the steel, aluminum, and forest/paper industries, as well as a reduction in funding for the chemicals industry subprogram. The DOE is shifting towards greater support for cross-cutting technology efforts. The Industries of the Future (Specific) program received $14.0 million, $1.2 million less than FY2010 funding but $11.4 million more than the request. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $14.0 million for the Industries of the Future (Specific) program, which is $1.2 million less than FY2010 funding and $11.4 million more than the request. The FY2011 request would have provided $185.9 million to the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, with a net increase of $13.9 million (8.1%) above the FY2010 appropriation. Energy storage would see a $26.0 million increase, while other R&D subprograms would be trimmed, resulting in a net increase of $19.4 million for R&D. The Energy Storage subprogram would receive a $26.0 million increase, leading to a net $19.4 million rise in R&D funding. Energy storage is seen as a solution to electric power infrastructure challenges, such as supply congestion and renewable energy integration. The focus for FY2011 would be on lithium-based batteries for stationary applications, with research targeting new electrolytes, power systems, and materials. Research efforts on lithium-based batteries for stationary applications aim to reduce system costs. New analytical methods will identify locations for energy storage systems. Senate Committee recommended funding but cut total appropriation to $144.7 million. Obama Administration's FY2011 budget. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for air energy storage systems, adding $4.3 million for six projects. The Obama Administration's FY2011 budget for nuclear energy research and development was $824.1 million, with $732.1 million provided in P.L. 112-10. Additional funds were requested for safeguards and security at DOE's Idaho facility. The FY2011 budget for nuclear energy research and development was $824.1 million, with $732.1 million provided in P.L. 112-10. An additional $88.2 million was requested for safeguards and security at DOE's Idaho nuclear facilities.

The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in 1975 to provide an emergency source of crude oil in case of supply interruptions. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in Louisiana and Texas holds 727 million barrels of crude oil for emergencies. The Northeast Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR) stores 2 million barrels of home heating oil. The federal government stopped purchasing oil for the SPR in 1994, and since 2000, additions have been made with royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil. The federal government stores 2 million barrels of refined home heating oil in above-ground facilities in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. Since 1994, oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) has been acquired through royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil. Acquisition procedures include direct purchase, transfer of royalty oil, and receipt of premium barrels. Congress passed legislation in May 2008 related to the SPR. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) acquisition procedures include direct purchase, transfer of royalty oil, and receipt of premium barrels. In 2008, Congress passed legislation ordering the suspension of RIK fill unless crude oil prices dropped below $75/barrel. However, the decline in oil prices led to a resumption of fill, with the Bush Administration announcing plans to purchase nearly 10.7 million barrels for the SPR in 2009. The sharp decline in crude oil prices led to a resumption of fill of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The Bush Administration announced plans to purchase nearly 10.7 million barrels for the SPR in 2009, bringing the SPR to capacity. Additionally, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior announced a transitional phasing out of the RIK Program. The Secretary of the Department of the Interior announced the phasing out of the RIK Program, leading to the cancellation of upcoming natural gas sales. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 required the expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to 1 billion barrels, with a possible additional 160 million barrels capacity in Richton, MS. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandated expanding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to 1 billion barrels, with a potential 160 million barrels capacity in Richton, MS. However, the Administration proposed suspending spending on SPR expansion in FY2011, redirecting $71 million for non-expansion operations and maintenance. This decision was based on EIA projections of declining U.S. petroleum consumption and import dependence. The Administration proposed redirecting funds from SPR expansion to fund non-expansion operations and maintenance, citing EIA projections of declining U.S. petroleum consumption and import dependence. The FY2011 request for the SPR was reduced to $138.9 million from $243.8 million in FY2010. Congress approved $11.3 million for the NHOR in FY2010, with a similar proposal for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $209.9 million for the SPR. The Administration proposed redirecting funds from SPR expansion to fund non-expansion operations and maintenance due to declining U.S. petroleum consumption.

The DOE Office of Science conducts basic research in six program areas and is a major federal funder of research in the physical sciences. For FY2011, DOE requested $5.121 billion for the Office of Science, an increase of 4.4% from the previous year's appropriation. In the 111th Congress, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development recommended $4.900 billion for the Office of Science. In FY2011, DOE requested $5.121 billion for the Office of Science, with varying recommendations from different Congressional committees. The final appropriation under P.L. 112-10 was $4,857.7 billion, with no specified allocation by program. The Senate amendment S.Amdt. 149 to H.R. 1 proposed $4.733 billion for the Office of Science, but P.L. 112-10 allocated $4,857.7 billion with no specified program allocation. The President's Plan for Science and Innovation aims to double R&D funding for the Office of Science and two other agencies by FY2016. The requested funding for the Office of Science and its programs saw a 4.4% increase for FY2011, falling short of the annual rate needed for doubling in 10 years. The appropriation in P.L. 112-10 was lower than FY2010 levels, with basic energy sciences receiving a 12.1% increase in funding. Funding for Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) was set to increase by $40 million. The FY2011 budget for the basic energy sciences program increased to $1.835 billion, up 12.1% from the previous year. Funding for Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) was set to increase by $40 million. Additionally, new energy innovation hubs on materials for batteries and energy storage would receive $34 million, and the hub on fuels from sunlight would receive $24 million. The Administration proposed to initiate a total of eight energy innovation hubs in FY2010, but Congress funded only three. The aim of the hubs is to address basic science and technology hindering the nation's secure and sustainable energy future by assembling multidisciplinary teams of researchers focused on a single critical national need identified by the Department. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.739 billion for basic energy sciences.

ARPA-E, authorized by the America COMPETES Act, received its first funding in FY2009 for energy technology research projects. The Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy (ARPA-E) was authorized by the America COMPETES Act to support energy technology research projects. It received funding in FY2009 and announced its first contract awards in October 2009. The FY2011 budget request for ARPA-E was $300 million, with an appropriation of $179.6 million. President Obama's FY2011 budget called for the termination of DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. The FY2011 budget requested $300 million for ARPA-E, but only $179.6 million was appropriated. President Obama's budget aimed to terminate DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, responsible for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository project. The Obama Administration decided that developing the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository is not feasible, leading to no funding being requested for the project in FY2011. DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application in March. No funding is being requested for Yucca Mountain or OCRWM in FY2011, as per the DOE FY2011 budget justification. DOE filed a motion to withdraw the Yucca Mountain license application, which was rejected by an NRC licensing panel. The full NRC commission is now considering the withdrawal, opposed by states with defense-related waste. Alternatives to Yucca Mountain will be evaluated by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future. The NRC commission is considering the withdrawal of the Yucca Mountain license application, which is opposed by states with defense-related waste. Alternatives to Yucca Mountain will be evaluated by the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, established by the DOE with $5 million in funding from Congress. The Commission will study options for temporary storage, treatment, and permanent disposal of highly radioactive nuclear waste. The DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy will lead future waste management activities, conducting research on disposal technologies and options. A draft report on nuclear waste storage and disposal is due within 18 months, with a final report within two years. Substantial funding has been requested for research and support for the Blue Ribbon Commission. Substantial funding has been requested for research on nuclear waste disposal technologies and support for the Blue Ribbon Commission. DOE is required to begin taking waste from nuclear plant sites by January 31, 1998, with potential liability payments estimated at $11 billion. Utilities have won court cases upholding DOE's obligation to meet the deadline and compensate for damages. The Department of Energy (DOE) is obligated to meet the deadline for removing waste from reactor sites and compensate utilities for damages. Utilities have won court cases regarding this issue, with potential liability payments estimated at $11 billion. Congress established the DOE Innovative program for nuclear waste disposal. Congress established the DOE Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to provide loan guarantees for energy projects using new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Project subsidy costs must be paid upfront to cover potential government costs resulting from guaranteed loans. The DOE's loan guarantee program, established in 2005, supports energy projects with new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Project owners must pay upfront subsidy costs, ranging from 1% to 10% of the loan guarantee amount. The FY2009 omnibus funding measure allocated $47 billion for loan guarantees, with $18.5 billion for nuclear power and $18.5 billion for energy efficiency and renewables. The funding measure (P.L. 111-8) provided DOE with loan guarantee authority of $47 billion, with allocations for nuclear power, energy efficiency, renewables, coal, carbon capture, and uranium enrichment. President Obama's FY2011 budget requested an increase in the loan guarantee ceiling for nuclear power plants to $54.5 billion, as federal loan guarantees are crucial for financing new nuclear power plants. The DOE announced a preliminary nuclear loan guarantee of $8.33 billion for adding two reactors to the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia, in response to a request to increase the loan guarantee ceiling for nuclear power plants to $54.5 billion. The DOE announced a conditional guarantee agreement for $8.33 billion in financing for two reactors at the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia. Critics argue that the proposed increase to $54.5 billion in nuclear loan guarantees would divert resources from cleaner energy technologies. Nuclear critics oppose the tripling of nuclear loan guarantees, calling it a taxpayer bailout that diverts funds from cleaner energy technologies. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act created a loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects with a $6 billion appropriation, but $2 billion has been used. The Sec. 1705 loan guarantee program under ARRA had a $6 billion appropriation to cover subsidy costs, but $2 billion was transferred to the \"cash for clunkers\" program and $1.5 billion was rescinded. The remaining $2.5 billion should support loan guarantees totaling $25 billion. The Jobs and Medicaid Assistance Act allocated $2.5 billion for subsidy costs for loan guarantees, supporting a total of $25 billion. Additionally, President Obama requested $500 million for energy efficiency and renewable energy loan guarantees. The DOE estimates this appropriation could support $3 billion-$5 billion in guarantees. The DOE's budget justification estimates that $500 million in subsidy costs would support renewable energy and energy efficiency loan guarantees totaling $3 billion-$5 billion under the permanent Sec. 1703 program. P.L. 112-10 reduced the loan guarantee authority for non-nuclear technologies to $7.3 billion, bringing the total non-nuclear loan guarantee ceiling to about $9.3 billion. Nuclear loan guarantees remain at $18.5 billion, and uranium enrichment totals $4 billion. The Section 1703 non-nuclear loan guarantee ceiling has been reduced to $7.3 billion, bringing the total to about $9.3 billion when including the $2 billion in FY2007 authority. Nuclear loan guarantees remain at $18.5 billion, and uranium enrichment totals $4 billion. P.L. 112-10 provides $170 million with no expiration for subsidy costs for renewable energy and efficiency projects under the Section 1703 program, along with authority for up to $1.183 billion in loan guarantees for renewable energy and efficiency projects. The Section 1703 program received $170 million in subsidy costs for renewable energy and efficiency projects under P.L. 112-10, with additional loan guarantee authority of up to $1.183 billion. This funding is available to projects that applied under the expiring Section 1705 before February 24, 2011. The DOE program, established by P.L. 112-10, provides loans to automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers for plant investments to produce fuel-efficient vehicles. Congress appropriated $7.5 billion in FY2009 for up to $25 billion in direct loans. $10 million was requested in FY2011 for administrative expenses, mostly covered by P.L. 112-10. The DOE program, established by P.L. 112-10, provides loans to automobile manufacturers and parts suppliers for plant investments to produce fuel-efficient vehicles. Congress appropriated $7.5 billion in FY2009 for up to $25 billion in direct loans. $10 million was requested in FY2011 for administrative expenses, mostly covered by P.L. 112-10. Additionally, Congress established the Stockpile Stewardship Program in the FY1994 National Defense Authorization Act to preserve the core intellectual and technical competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, established in the FY1994 National Defense Authorization Act, aims to preserve the core intellectual and technical competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons, including design, integration, manufacturing, security, reliability, and certification. The program is operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) within the Department of Energy (DOE) to ensure the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. The Stockpile Stewardship Program, operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), ensures the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. NNSA manages two programs outside of the Weapons Activities account: Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation and Naval Reactors. P.L. 111-84 established a \"stockpile management\" program for effective stockpile management. The NNSA manages the Stockpile Stewardship Program to ensure the safety and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without underground testing. P.L. 111-84 established a \"stockpile management\" program to increase reliability, safety, and security of the stockpile and reduce the likelihood of nuclear testing. The stockpile management program aims to enhance the reliability, safety, and security of the nuclear weapons stockpile while reducing the need for nuclear testing. Changes to the stockpile must align with program objectives and maintain basic design parameters. Stewardship activities primarily occur at the nuclear weapons complex, which includes three laboratories. The stockpile management program supports the stockpile stewardship program at the nuclear weapons complex, which includes three laboratories and four production sites managed by NNSA. The FY2011 request document includes data from NNSA's Future Years Nuclear Security Program. The Nuclear Weapons Complex managed by NNSA includes eight sites, with contractors operating them. The FY2011 request document includes data from NNSA's Future Years Nuclear Security Program, projecting budgets and components for FY2012-FY2015. Despite Cold War reductions, Congress seeks further changes for the Complex, such as fewer personnel, lower costs, and increased security. Despite post-Cold War reductions, Congress has long desired changes to the Nuclear Weapons Complex managed by NNSA, including fewer personnel, lower costs, increased security, and a smaller footprint at each site. In response, NNSA submitted the \"Complex 2030\" plan to Congress in January 2007. The House Appropriations Committee in FY2008 expressed dissatisfaction with the plan and requested a comprehensive nuclear defense and nonproliferation strategy, a detailed description of a specific nuclear stockpile, and a long-term expenditure plan from FY2008 onwards. The FY2008 report expressed displeasure with the Complex 2030 plan, demanding a comprehensive nuclear defense strategy, specific nuclear stockpile details, and a long-term expenditure plan before further funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized the inadequate linkage between warheads, the Complex, and strategy. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized the Department's plan to rebuild and modernize the Complex without a long-term efficiency strategy. They rejected the premature deployment of the NNSA Complex 2030 consolidation effort and called for a comprehensive nuclear weapons strategy for the 21st century. The Congress agrees with the House and Senate reports for a comprehensive nuclear weapons strategy for the 21st century. NNSA announced Complex Transformation on December 18, 2007, with plans to reduce the weapons program footprint, close structures, reduce weapons workers, dismantle weapons faster, and build new facilities. The Complex Transformation plan includes transferring structures, reducing weapons workers, dismantling weapons faster, and building new facilities like the Uranium Processing Facility, Weapons Surveillance Facility, and Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Nuclear Facility. Details can be found in the Final Complex Transformation Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement from October 2008 and two Records of Decision from December 2008. The House Appropriations Committee supports these changes for FY2009 funding. The House Appropriations Committee reiterated its FY2008 views in its FY2009 report, insisting on completing a sequence before considering funding for new programs or the Reliable Replacement Warhead. This sequence includes replacing Cold War strategies with a modern nuclear deterrent strategy focused on current and future threats, without the need for nuclear testing. The committee recommended eliminating funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) and other programs in order to focus on a 21st Century nuclear deterrent strategy without the need for nuclear testing. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended eliminating funds for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) and other programs in its FY2009 report. The FY2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act provided no RRW funds, and the FY2010 and FY2011 budgets did not request RRW funds due to the cancellation of its development. The FY2011 budget request for Weapons Activities was $7,008.8 million, an increase from FY2010 appropriations of $6,384.4 million. The Department of Defense submitted its Nuclear Posture Review Report in April 2010, outlining plans for sustaining the nuclear arsenal. The President provided Congress with a classified report on U.S. nuclear forces in May 2010. The Department of Defense submitted its Nuclear Posture Review Report in April 2010, outlining plans for sustaining and modernizing the U.S. nuclear arsenal with an $80 billion investment over the next decade. The Department of Defense plans to invest $80 billion over the next decade to sustain and modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal, with projected costs for weapons stockpile and infrastructure outlined for each fiscal year. In the 112th Congress, there was a contentious debate over reducing the proposed increase in funding. In the 112th Congress, H.R. 1 proposed reducing the requested increase in funding for Weapons Activities by $312.4 million. This reduction was contentious as part of a compromise to gain Senate Republicans' support for the New START treaty. The Administration planned to increase funding over FY2010-FY2020 to modernize the nuclear weapons complex and maintain nuclear weapons. Weapons Activities funding was set to increase substantially from FY2010-FY2020 to modernize the nuclear weapons complex and maintain nuclear weapons. The President's FY2012 budget requested an increase to $7,629.7 million, in line with the New START resolution of ratification. The President's FY2012 budget requested an increase in Weapons Activities funding to $7,629.7 million to modernize the nuclear weapons complex and ensure the safety and reliability of the United States nuclear arsenal. The issue of funding for FY2011 was resolved in P.L. 112-10, which provided $6,946.4 million for Weapons Activities. This program involves direct work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, such as monitoring their condition and maintenance through repairs. The issue for FY2011 was resolved in P.L. 112-10, providing $6,946.4 million for Weapons Activities, including work on nuclear weapons in the stockpile, maintenance, R&D, and dismantlement. Specific items under DSW include Life Extension Programs (LEPs) for existing warheads. Life Extension Programs (LEPs) aim to extend the life of existing warheads through design, certification, manufacture, and replacement of components. An LEP for the B61 mods 7 and 11 bombs was completed in FY2009. An ongoing LEP for the W76 warhead for the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile is termed the W76-1. The FY2010 appropriation was $223.2 million, and the FY2011 request was $249.5 million, recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee. NNSA is required to submit reports upon completing a study of the B61 bomb LEP. The FY2011 request was $249.5 million, recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee. It required NNSA to submit reports upon completing a study of the B61 bomb LEP and mentioned an upcoming LEP for the W78 warhead. The Stockpile Systems program involves maintenance, component replacement, and assessment for all weapon types. The FY2010 appropriation was $357.8 million, with the FY2011 request at $649.4 million, mainly for the B61 bomb. The FY2011 request for weapon stockpile maintenance was $649.4 million, with significant increases for the B61 bomb, W78 warhead, and W87 warhead. B61 funds are allocated for system sustainment and phase 6.2/6.2A study. The FY2011 budget request for weapon stockpile maintenance was $649.4 million, with increases for the B61 bomb, W78 warhead, and W87 warhead. B61 funds are divided into system sustainment and phase 6.2/6.2A study, with the latter supporting a life extension study for nuclear and non-nuclear components, including enhanced safety features and compatibility with modern aircraft like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for Stockpile Systems, with a focus on surveillance activities to monitor the status of nuclear weapons. A robust surveillance program is necessary to maintain confidence in the performance of nuclear weapons without underground testing. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding for surveillance activities to monitor the status of nuclear weapons, emphasizing the need for a robust program to ensure confidence in their performance without underground testing. Concerns were raised about potential shortfalls in surveillance jeopardizing the safety and reliability assessments of nuclear weapons. The B61 bomb has multiple variants, including a controversial new variant, the B61-12, which aims to consolidate most variants into a single version.

The initiative aims to convert research reactors to use less enriched uranium and dispose of excess nuclear materials. The Office of Environmental Management was established in 1989 to oversee cleanup of former nuclear weapons production facilities. The Office of Environmental Management, established in 1989 by the Department of Energy, oversees the cleanup of former nuclear weapons production facilities and federal civilian nuclear energy research laboratories. This includes disposal of radioactive and hazardous wastes, managing surplus nuclear materials, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, and decontamination of excess buildings. The Office of Environmental Management oversees the cleanup of former nuclear weapons production facilities and federal civilian nuclear energy research laboratories across the United States. Cleanup actions are mostly complete at many facilities, but larger and more complex sites with high-level radioactive waste will require ongoing cleanup for years or even decades. DOE expects ongoing cleanup at larger, complex facilities with high-level radioactive waste for years or decades. As of FY2010, 18 facilities still need cleanup, with estimated costs between $192.8 billion and $247.2 billion. Additional funds may be required for operating, maintaining cleanup remedies, and monitoring contaminant levels. The DOE expects ongoing cleanup at larger, complex facilities with high-level radioactive waste for years or decades, with estimated costs ranging between $192.8 billion and $247.2 billion. Additional funds may be needed for operating, maintaining cleanup remedies, and monitoring contaminant levels to ensure effectiveness over time. Some facilities historically under the Office of Environmental Management have been transferred to other offices within DOE and to the Army. The Office of Environmental Management oversees cleanup of radioactive waste at facilities, with some responsibilities transferred to other offices and the Army Corps of Engineers. Congress directed the transfer of cleanup for smaller sites to the Corps under the FUSRAP program, funded within the Corps' civil works budget. Once cleanup is complete, the Corps takes over responsibility. The cleanup of contaminated facilities under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) is funded within the civil works budget of the Army Corps of Engineers. After the initial cleanup work is completed, the Corps is responsible for activities for the first two years before jurisdiction is transferred back to the Department of Energy. The DOE's Office of Legacy Management handles long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring activities at FUSRAP sites and facilities cleaned up under the Office of Environmental Management. The Department of Energy's Office of Legacy Management oversees long-term activities at FUSRAP sites and cleaned-up facilities. Funding for this office, along with the Office of Environmental Management, is provided through three appropriations accounts. The Defense Environmental Cleanup Account receives the majority of the funding, totaling $5.69 billion in P.L. 112-10. The Defense Environmental Cleanup Account, Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, and Cleanup receive funding for the Department of Energy's Office of Environmental Management. In FY2011, P.L. 112-10 allocated $5.69 billion, which is a decrease from the President's request and the previous year's appropriation. Table 14 details the enacted appropriations for each account. In FY2011, P.L. 112-10 allocated $5.69 billion for the Department of Energy's Office of Environmental Management, which is a $319 million decrease from the previous year's appropriation. The legislation also rescinded $22.7 million in unobligated balances from previous fiscal years for the three accounts funding the office. The $22.7 million rescission in unobligated balances includes funds from the Defense Environmental Cleanup, Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, and Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup accounts. Cleanup pace concerns exist at DOE's nuclear weapons production facilities like Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory. The Department of Energy's largest nuclear weapons production facilities, including Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory, have complex cleanup challenges due to decades of production. These facilities require significant funding from the Office of Environmental Management, representing over half of the total funding. Cleanup needs are expected to continue for many years. The Department of Energy's largest nuclear weapons production facilities, Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory, require significant funding for cleanup. Cleanup may not be complete at Hanford until 2062, Savannah River Site until 2040, and Idaho National Laboratory until 2044 due to the substantial volumes of high-level radioactive wastes stored at these sites. The Department of Energy's largest nuclear weapons production facilities, Hanford, Savannah River Site, and Idaho National Laboratory, require significant funding for cleanup. DOE estimates in 2009 show 54 million gallons of high-level wastes at Hanford, 33 million gallons at Savannah River Site, and nearly 1 million gallons at Idaho National Laboratory. Disposal of these wastes in a geologic repository is challenging due to technical difficulties and the lack of availability of a repository. Delays in cleanup may extend until 2062 at Hanford, 2040 at Savannah River Site, and 2044 at Idaho National Laboratory. The high-level wastes at Hanford present technical difficulties for disposal in a geologic repository. Delays in waste treatment facilities raise concerns about environmental risks from untreated wastes. Some tanks at Hanford have leaked wastes into groundwater discharging into the Columbia River, prompting routine water quality monitoring by the DOE. The Department of Energy (DOE) monitors water quality in the Columbia River due to leaks from tanks at Hanford. There is interest in funding for cleanup of uranium enrichment facilities in Paducah, KY; Portsmouth, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund to clean up uranium enrichment facilities in Paducah, KY; Portsmouth, OH; and Oak Ridge, TN. Congress authorized special assessments from nuclear utilities to finance the fund. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to clean up enrichment facilities. Congress authorized special assessments from nuclear utilities to finance the fund, with contributions from both the federal government and utilities based on enriched uranium production. The Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund was created to clean up enrichment facilities, with contributions from the federal government and nuclear utilities based on enriched uranium production. Congress has continued federal payments to the fund through annual appropriations since the authorization expired in 2007. The authorization for federal payment to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund expired in 2007. Congress has continued payments through annual appropriations without separate reauthorizing legislation. The fund balance may not cover future cleanup costs. $4.5 billion remained in the fund as of FY2010. The Office of Management and Budget reported that $4.5 billion remained in the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for appropriation by Congress as of the beginning of FY2010. However, this amount is insufficient to meet DOE's estimated range of $13.9 billion to $27.7 billion for cleanup needs. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments in his FY2011 budget request to increase resources for cleanup, with OMB estimating $200 million in assessments for FY2011 and a total of $2.2 billion over the 10-year period from FY2011 through FY2020. The President proposed reinstating nuclear utility assessments in his FY2011 budget request to increase resources for cleanup. OMB estimated $200 million in assessments for FY2011 and a total of $2.2 billion over the 10-year period from FY2011 through FY2020. The authority for the federal government to resume collection of the assessments is subject to the enactment of reauthorizing legislation by Congress, with bills introduced but not enacted in the 111th Congress. Two bills, H.R. 2471 and S. 1061, were introduced but not enacted to reauthorize nuclear utility assessments. The Senate Appropriations Committee questioned the need for reinstatement in the 111th Congress. The President requested $730.5 million from the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for cleanup in FY2011, assuming $200 million in offsetting receipts from nuclear utility assessments. In FY2011, P.L. 112-10 allocated $507.0 million from the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund for cleanup, which was $223.5 million less than the President's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $550.0 million but noted the lack of legislation to generate $200 million in offsetting receipts from nuclear utility assessments. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $550.0 million for the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, noting the lack of legislation to generate $200 million in offsetting receipts. P.L. 112-10 allocated $33.6 million for the fund in FY2011, significantly less than the President's request of $496.7 million. In FY2011, P.L. 112-10 allocated $33.6 million for the federal payment to the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund, much less than the President's request of $496.7 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a smaller federal payment to fulfill the remaining balance required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires DOE to pay for cleanup costs of federal uranium enrichment facilities even if the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund is depleted. Additional federal funds may be needed in the future to ensure completion of cleanup. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandates DOE to cover cleanup costs of federal uranium enrichment facilities, even if the Uranium Enrichment D&D Fund is depleted. Future funding may be necessary to ensure the completion of cleanup activities. Responsibility for long-term operation, maintenance, and monitoring is transferred to DOE's Office of Legacy Management after cleanup under DOE's Office of Environmental Management or the FUSRAP program. This office also handles pensions and post-retirement benefits for former contractor personnel. Funding for these activities is allocated within the Other Defense Activities Account. The Office of Legacy Management is responsible for handling pensions and post-retirement benefits for former contractor personnel at nuclear weapons production facilities. Funding for these activities is allocated within the Other Defense Activities Account, with potential increases in funding needs over time. Funding for the Office of Legacy Management in FY2011 is the same as requested by the President, slightly less than the previous year. Funding needs are expected to increase as nuclear weapons production facilities are cleaned up and transferred for long-term operation. DOE's Power Marketing Administrations sell power generated by dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army. Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) were established to sell power generated by dams operated by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers, with a focus on water resource conservation and management. Priority for PMA power is given to \"preference customers\" such as municipal utilities and cooperatives. The Power Marketing Administrations (PMAs) prioritize selling power to \"preference customers\" like municipal utilities and cooperatives at the lowest rates possible. They are responsible for covering expenses, repaying debt, and federal investments in generating facilities. The Obama Administration's FY2011 request for PMAs was $118.5 million, a 4% decrease from the FY2010 appropriation. The PMAs are responsible for covering expenses, repaying debt, and federal investments in generating facilities.

The NRC budget for FY2011 includes $1.052.3 billion, with $272.5 million allocated for new reactor activities to handle license applications for new nuclear power plants. Electric utilities and generating companies have applied for licenses for 30 reactors since 2007 due to volatile fossil fuel prices and incentives from the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and volatile fossil fuel prices led to electric utilities and generating companies applying for licenses for 30 reactors since 2007. The NRC's proposed FY2011 budget included funding for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which the Obama Administration wants to cancel. The NRC's FY2011 budget request included funding for licensing DOE's Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, covering costs for adjudicating the license withdrawal motion and activities related to an orderly closure of the project. The NRC's FY2011 budget request included funding for activities such as archiving material, knowledge capture, maintenance of electronic systems, reactor safety inspections, license renewals, security exercises, and increasing homeland security spending by $3.8 million. The NRC's FY2011 budget request includes increasing homeland security spending by $3.8 million, with a total budget of $26.1 million. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires 90% of NRC's budget to be offset by fees on licensees, excluding expenditures from the Nuclear Waste Fund and spending on general homeland security and DOE defense waste oversight. The NRC's budget for FY2011 would be offset by fees on licensees, excluding certain expenditures. The net appropriation would be $138.3 million, a decrease from FY2010. P.L. 112-10 provides for a net appropriation of $138.1 million, including the inspector general's office."
