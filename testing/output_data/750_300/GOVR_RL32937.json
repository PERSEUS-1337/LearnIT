    "content": "Legislation reauthorizing and revising the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant, including changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, has been approved by the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources in the 109th Congress. The CSE program, Part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act, was enacted in January 1975 and is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands operate CSE programs and are entitled to federal matching funds. Families automatically qualify for CSE services free of charge. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and funded by general revenues. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands operate CSE programs and are entitled to federal matching funds. Families receiving TANF benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage automatically qualify for CSE services free of charge. Other families must apply for CSE services and states can charge an application fee not exceeding $25. Child support collected on behalf of nonwelfare families goes to the family. Child support payments collected by CSE agencies increased significantly from $1 billion in FY1978 to $21.2 billion in FY2003. The number of children with established paternity also rose by 1,274%, from 111,000 to 1.525 million. However, the program only collects 18% of child support obligations it is responsible for. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program saw a significant increase in child support payments from $1 billion in FY1978 to $21.2 billion in FY2003. The number of children with established paternity also rose by 1,274%, from 111,000 to 1.525 million. However, the program only collects 18% of child support obligations it is responsible for, handling at least 50% of all child support cases. The CSE program handles 50% of child support cases and provides services like parent location, paternity establishment, support order establishment, modification, collection, distribution, and medical support enforcement. Collection methods include income withholding and intercept of tax refunds and unemployment. The CSE program handles child support cases and provides services such as support order establishment, collection methods like income withholding and intercept of tax refunds, and enforcement of medical support. Additionally, legislation has established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who fail to financially support their children, with penalties of up to two years in prison. States were also required to implement procedures to seize assets for child support arrearages. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 mandated states to implement expedited procedures to seize assets for child support arrearages, including intercepting payments and restricting licenses of noncustodial parents who owe support. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 authorized withholding licenses and seizing financial resources of noncustodial parents who owe child support. It also allowed for passport restrictions and required states to enact the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act. The Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act of 1998 authorized passport restrictions for debtor parents and required states to implement the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act. It also clarified jurisdiction in cases with multiple child support orders and provided federal reimbursement for CSE program costs. The CSE program refunds states for laboratory costs of establishing paternity and receives incentive payments from the federal government. The program has evolved into a multifaceted system with a statutory limit of $446 million for incentive payments in FY2005. The CSE program, established in 1998, has a cost-neutral incentive payment system with a statutory limit of $446 million for FY2005. It has evolved into a multifaceted program focusing on service delivery, promoting self-sufficiency, and parental responsibility. The program helps secure financial support for children from noncustodial parents and promotes self-sufficiency by providing necessary services. Child support payments are crucial for single-parent families, constituting 17% of family income on average and about 30% for poor families. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to enhance the CSE program to increase collections, promote economic independence for former welfare families, and provide a stable income source for all. Child support constitutes about 30% of family income for poor families. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to improve the CSE program to increase collections and provide a stable income source for single-parent families. The bills share objectives of simplifying CSE rules and enforcing \"family-first\" policies, but differ in their approaches and enforcement tools. Both S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to improve the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program by revising enforcement tools and adding new provisions. The Senate Finance Committee-reported bill has a larger list of CSE provisions compared to the House Subcommittee bill. For a detailed comparison of all CSE provisions in both bills, refer to Table 1 in the report's last section. The CSE provisions in S.667 and H.R. 240 involve assigning child support rights to the state for families receiving TANF benefits. Assigned child support collections are not given to families but retained by the state. The child support assignment under CSE provisions involves assigning child support rights to the state for families receiving TANF benefits. Assigned child support collections are kept by states and the federal government as reimbursement for welfare benefits. Nonwelfare families retain all child support collected on their behalf. The date of assignment entry is crucial, especially if it was before September 30, 1997. If child support rights are assigned to the state before September 30, 1997, all arrearages are permanently assigned. If the assignment is after October 1, 1997, only arrearages accumulated during assistance are permanently assigned, while pre-assistance arrearages are temporarily assigned and revert back to the family when they leave TANF. Under S. 667 as reported by the Senate Finance Committee, child support assignment would only cover support accrued during TANF benefits, not pre-existing arrearages. This means any arrearages before TANF receipt do not have to be assigned to the state. Under H.R. 240, child support assignment rules remain unchanged, determining the order in which child support collections are paid. This means any child support collected for pre-TANF arrearages would go to the family, not the state. The distribution rules determine the order in which child support collections are paid, with past-due child support being a priority. TANF families can have current support and assigned arrearages retained by the state up to the amount of TANF benefits received. The 1996 welfare law repealed the $50 limit on retained support. The 1996 welfare law allows states to retain child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families up to the amount of TANF benefits received. States have discretion over how much of the child support to pass through to the family and whether to treat it as income. Both bills would provide incentives to states to retain child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families. States have discretion over how much of the child support to pass through to the family and whether to treat it as income. As of August 2004, 18 states were continuing the $50 pass-through and disregard policy. As of August 2004, 18 states were continuing the $50 pass-through and disregard policy for child support payments. Both bills aim to incentivize states to prioritize directing more child support to TANF families, known as a \"family-first\" policy, instead of using it to reimburse welfare benefits. The bills differ in the amount of federal cost-sharing provided and assistance for states in covering the current cost of their child support enforcement pass-through. The bills aim to incentivize states to prioritize directing more child support to TANF families instead of using it to reimburse welfare benefits. S. 667 would allow states to pay up to $400 per month in child support collected on behalf of a TANF family. The federal government would share in the costs of pass-through and disregard policies used by states for child support collected on behalf of TANF families. States can pay up to $400 per month per family and not be required to pay the federal government. The state must disregard the child support collection in determining TANF benefits. The House bill, H.R. 240, aims to incentivize states to increase their child support pass-through and disregard policies for TANF families. States can pay more child support to families without having to share the increased payments with the federal government. The House bill, H.R. 240, incentivizes states to increase child support pass-through payments to TANF families without requiring the state to share the increased payments with the federal government. The federal government would only share in the cost if the state disregards the child support collection paid to the family. The federal government would share in the cost of an increase in child support pass-through payments to TANF families if the state disregards the child support collection paid to the family. Starting from October 1, 2000, states must distribute child support collections to former TANF families before being reimbursed. States must distribute child support collections to former TANF families following a \"family-first\" policy, prioritizing current child support, never-assigned arrearages, and pre-TANF arrearages. The goal of the 1996 welfare reform law was to favor families with CSE distribution provisions once they leave TANF. The 1996 welfare reform law prioritized CSE distribution to favor families once they leave TANF. Child support arrearages during TANF belong to the state and federal government, while support before and after TANF goes to the family. This aims to reduce dependence on public assistance. The Senate Finance Committee's S. 667 proposes giving states the option to distribute full child support amounts to former TANF families, simplifying the distribution process and eliminating special treatment of child support arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset program. S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to simplify the distribution process of child support payments, including arrearages collected through the federal income tax refund offset program. The federal government would share costs with states for paying child support arrearages to families, with H.R. 240 giving states the option to distribute full child support amounts to former TANF families. The House bill allows for the distribution of full child support amounts to former TANF families and shares costs with states for paying child support arrearages. Both bills include provisions for passport denial, collecting child support from Social Security benefits, and easing collection processes. Both bills aim to lower the threshold for denying passports to noncustodial parents with overdue child support, facilitate child support collection from Social Security and veterans' benefits, and allow states to use federal income tax refunds to collect past-due child support. Additionally, the HHS Secretary is authorized to compare noncustodial parents' information with insurers' records to aid in child support enforcement. The HHS Secretary is authorized to compare noncustodial parents' information with insurers' records to aid in child support enforcement, allowing states to collect child support payments more effectively. Additionally, assisting states can establish child support interstate cases based on requests for assistance from other states, enhancing the ability to pursue child support arrearages. The Senate Finance Committee's S. 667 includes provisions to enhance states' ability to collect child support payments, such as authorizing the HHS Secretary to seize financial assets of noncustodial parents, requiring medical support from parents, and notifying health care plan administrators in certain situations. The Senate Finance Committee's S. 667 includes provisions to enhance states' ability to collect child support payments, such as seizing financial assets of noncustodial parents, requiring medical support from parents, and notifying health care plan administrators in certain situations. Additionally, the bill requires states to review and adjust child support orders for TANF families every three years, mandates a report on locating custodial parents, and establishes minimum funding levels for technical assistance. H.R. 240 and S. 667 include provisions to enhance states' ability to collect child support payments, establish minimum funding levels for technical assistance, and designate Indian tribes as authorized persons for accessing information in the Federal Parent Locator Service. H.R. 240 proposes a $25 annual fee for individuals receiving CSE services but not on TANF, while S. 667 aims to increase funding for CSE access. The provision in H.R. 240 establishes a $25 annual fee for individuals receiving CSE services but not on TANF, while S. 667 includes provisions to increase funding for CSE access and visitation programs, require states to adopt a later version of UIFSA, and allow Texas to continue its CSE program without a federal waiver. The comparison of CSE provisions in S. 667 and H.R. 240 shows differences in child support payments, monitoring, and enforcement. Texas can continue its CSE program without a federal waiver under S. 667. Table 1 compares current child support provisions in S. 667 and H.R. 240."
