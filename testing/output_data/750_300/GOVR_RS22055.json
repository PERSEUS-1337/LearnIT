The act, enacted in 1975, includes due process provisions and attorneys' fees provisions added in 1986. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandates the education of children with disabilities, including providing a free appropriate public education (FAPE). Attorneys' fees provisions were added in 1986 by the Handicapped Children's Protection Act, with amendments in 1997 and 2004. The 2004 amendments allowed for the reduction of attorneys' fees under certain conditions. The attorney representing the parents did not provide timely and specific information to the LEA about the child and the dispute, excluding attorneys' fees for most IEP meetings. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization was closer to the Senate version, which kept the same framework with some changes regarding attorneys' fees. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization, closer to the Senate version, made changes to attorneys' fees, allowing them for the state or local educational agency against parents or their attorneys in certain situations. The new law maintained general provisions for filing complaints and appeals, with the addition that local educational agencies can also file complaints. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization made changes to attorneys' fees, allowing them for the state or local educational agency against parents or their attorneys in certain situations. The new law maintained general provisions for filing complaints and appeals, with the addition that local educational agencies can also file complaints regarding the identification, evaluation, educational placement, provision of a free appropriate public education, or placement in an alternative educational setting. Parents or LEAs have the right to an impartial due process hearing with a right to appeal, and reasonable attorneys' fees may be awarded as part of the costs to the parents of a child with a disability. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization allows for attorneys' fees to be awarded to parents or LEAs in certain situations, with the addition that fees can also be awarded against a parent's attorney if their actions are deemed frivolous or unreasonable. The 2004 IDEA reauthorization allows for attorneys' fees to be awarded to parents or LEAs in specific situations, including when a complaint is frivolous or when litigation becomes unreasonable. Additionally, fees can be awarded against a parent's attorney if their actions are improper, such as causing unnecessary delays or increasing litigation costs. Senator Grassley and Senator Gregg emphasized the need for the attorneys' fees amendment to prevent abuses of due process rights in IDEA cases and ensure taxpayer dollars are used for educating children, not enriching trial lawyers. Senator Gregg highlighted the importance of the attorneys' fee amendment to prevent abuses of due process rights in IDEA cases and ensure taxpayer dollars are used for educating children, not enriching trial lawyers. He referenced the concept that prevailing defendants should recover attorneys' fees when a plaintiff's actions are deemed frivolous, as established in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court in Christiansburg Garment Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission established that prevailing defendants can recover attorneys' fees if a plaintiff's actions are frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation to protect them from baseless litigation. Senator Gregg noted that prevailing defendants rarely meet this high standard and that courts consider the plaintiff's financial resources when awarding fees. The attorneys' fee provision allows prevailing defendants to recover fees if lawsuits are brought for an improper purpose, based on a high standard that defendants rarely meet. Courts consider the plaintiff's financial resources when awarding fees, applying an objective standard of reasonableness from Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Fees are based on prevailing community rates without any bonus. The attorneys' fee provision, based on Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, allows prevailing defendants to recover fees if lawsuits are brought for an improper purpose. Fees are determined by prevailing community rates without any bonus or multiplier. Specific prohibitions and reductions apply to attorneys' fees, and fees may not be awarded for services performed after a written settlement offer under certain circumstances. The attorneys' fee provision allows prevailing defendants to recover fees if lawsuits are brought for an improper purpose, based on Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Fees are determined by prevailing community rates without any bonus or multiplier. Attorneys' fees are not awarded for services performed after a written settlement offer under certain circumstances, such as when the offer is not accepted within ten days and the relief obtained is not more favorable than the offer. Additionally, attorneys' fees are not awarded for IEP team meetings unless convened due to an administrative proceeding, judicial action, or mediation. The 2004 reauthorization added a requirement for a \"resolution session\" prior to a due process hearing, involving parents, relevant IEP team members, and an LEA representative. Attorneys' fees are not allowable for the resolution session. P.L. 108-446 allows attorneys' fees to be awarded to a prevailing parent in certain circumstances. The 2004 reauthorization added a \"resolution session\" requirement before a due process hearing, involving parents, IEP team members, and an LEA representative with decision-making authority. Attorneys' fees are not allowed for the resolution session. P.L. 108-446 allows attorneys' fees for a prevailing parent under specific conditions, such as being substantially justified in rejecting a settlement offer. Fees may be reduced if the resolution is unreasonably prolonged or exceeds the prevailing hourly rate for similar services. Attorneys' fees for a prevailing parent may be reduced if the final resolution of the controversy is unreasonably protracted, exceeds the prevailing hourly rate, or if the legal services provided are excessive. The attorney must also provide appropriate information in the due process complaint. The school district must be provided with specific information in the due process complaint, including the child's details, description of the problem, and proposed resolution. Attorneys' fees under P.L. 108-446 may be reduced if the final resolution is unreasonably delayed or if there was a violation. Regulations for P.L. 108-446 were issued in August 2006. The final regulations for P.L. 108-446 were issued on August 14, 2006. Attorneys' fees may be reduced if the court finds that the SEA or LEA unreasonably delayed the resolution or violated the section. The Department of Education declined to provide further guidance on the interpretation of the statutory language. The Department of Education declined to address whether non-attorney advocates could receive fees for advising parents at due process hearings, stating that lay advocates are not entitled to compensation as attorneys. This decision aligns with the discretion given to courts in awarding reasonable attorneys' fees based on case-specific factual determinations. The Department of Education stated that lay advocates are not entitled to compensation as attorneys, citing a Supreme Court decision that explicit language authorizing recovery of experts' fees must be included in legislation. The Department declined to add a regulatory provision on this issue."
