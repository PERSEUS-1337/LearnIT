However, funding for this assistance has decreased from 20% of U.S. official development assistance in 1980 to around 5% in 2007. Critics argue that this decline has impacted the U.S.'s ability to provide such aid. President Obama made alleviating global hunger a top priority in his inaugural address in 2009, following the global food price crisis of 2007-2008. In 2009, President Obama prioritized alleviating global hunger, responding to the historic high levels of hunger due to the global food price crisis and economic recession. The Obama Administration pledged $3.5 billion over three years for the Feed the Future initiative, focusing on promoting agricultural development, increasing food production, and improving food security and nutrition. The Obama Administration prioritized alleviating global hunger in response to historic high levels of hunger. They pledged $3.5 billion over three years for the Feed the Future initiative, focusing on promoting agricultural development, increasing food production, and improving food security and nutrition, especially for vulnerable populations like women and children. Some believe this marks a critical moment in U.S. foreign assistance history, with a need for reform in American food aid and foreign assistance. Some argue for reform in American food aid and foreign assistance to address issues related to agriculture development and food security. A new U.S. global food security initiative should adopt innovative approaches for increased effectiveness and sustainability, including local buy-in and engagement from the private sector. The U.S. global food security initiative aims to involve local populations and the private sector for more effective humanitarian objectives. Congress plays a key role in funding and oversight of agricultural development programs. The U.S. global food security initiative involves funding and oversight by Congress through various U.S. agencies and international organizations. Legislation may be considered by the 112th Congress to authorize and fund aspects of the initiative. The 112th Congress may consider legislation to authorize and fund aspects of the U.S. global food security initiative, including support for agricultural development, international agriculture research, and food security safety net assistance. Legislation to revise the authorizing statute for U.S. foreign assistance was also introduced in the last Congress. The 112th Congress may consider legislation to authorize and fund aspects of the U.S. global food security initiative, including support for agricultural development, international agriculture research, and food security safety net assistance. A bill to broadly revise the authorizing statute for U.S. foreign assistance was introduced in the last Congress, but prospects for funding increases are uncertain due to the federal budget deficit. The report aims to provide context on global food insecurity, discuss the Obama Administration's Feed the Future initiative, and outline issues for Congress to consider regarding agricultural development and global food security. The global food insecurity crisis reached historic levels in 2009, with over 1 billion people undernourished. The proportion of hungry people increased due to food and economic crises in 2008 and 2009, as reported by the FAO. The 112th Congress may address agricultural development and global food security issues, including funding for the U.S. global food security initiative, Feed the Future. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 1 billion people were undernourished. The number of chronically hungry people is estimated to be 925 million in 2010, down from 1.023 billion in 2009. The global food insecurity crisis worsened in 2008 and 2009 due to economic crises. The number of undernourished people had been slowly increasing for the past decade. Before the 2007-2008 food price crisis and the current global recession, the number of undernourished people in the world had been increasing slowly but steadily for the past decade, according to FAO data. The number of chronically hungry people in the world declined in the 1980s and early 1990s, a decline that FAO attributes largely to increased investment in agriculture following the global food crisis of the early 1970s. However, between 1995-1997 and 2004-2006, as official development assistance (ODA) devoted to agriculture declined substantially, FAO claims that the number of hungry people increased in all regions except Latin America and the Caribbean. Gains in hunger reduction were later reversed in this region as well, FAO says. According to FAO and the U.N. Secretary General's Millennium Development Goals report, the number of hungry people increased in all regions except Latin America and the Caribbean between 1995-1997 and 2004-2006. The recent food and economic crises have reversed the declining trend in the proportion of undernourished people globally. The recent food and economic crises have reversed the declining trend in the proportion of undernourished people globally, with the proportion of hungry people rising in 2008. The U.N. Secretary General suggests that progress in meeting the Millennium Development Goals of reducing hunger, alleviating poverty, and improving health for the world's poor has slowed or even reversed. The majority of the world's undernourished population resides in developing countries, with Asia having an estimated 578 million people suffering from chronic undernourishment according to FAO's 2010 hunger report. The 2010 hunger report by FAO estimated that 578 million people suffer from chronic undernourishment in Asia and the Pacific, 239 million in sub-Saharan Africa, 53 million in Latin America and the Caribbean, 37 million in the Near East and North Africa, and 19 million in developed countries. The global hunger figure in 2010 marked a decline of 9.6% from 2009, with the reduction mostly seen in Asia where 80 million fewer people were going hungry compared to the previous year. The 2010 hunger report by FAO showed a decline in global hunger by 9.6% from 2009, with Asia seeing the most significant reduction. Sub-Saharan Africa had a smaller drop, with about 12 million fewer people going hungry. Despite improvements, sub-Saharan Africa still has the highest rates of food insecurity. Bangladesh, China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan are home to two-thirds of the world's undernourished population. The 2010 Global Health Index (GHI) shows improvements in reducing undernourishment worldwide, with significant progress in regions like Southeast Asia and Latin America. The highest regional GHI scores are in South Asia. Since 1990, Global Health Index (GHI) scores have decreased significantly in South Asia and the Near East/North Africa by 25% and 33% respectively. Southeast Asia and Latin America saw even greater progress with GHI scores decreasing by 40% or more. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest regional GHI scores, but South Asia has made more progress. The causes of hunger differ between the regions, with South Asia attributing it to low nutritional, educational, and social status of women. According to a Washington D.C.-based international agricultural policy research think tank, the causes of hunger in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are different. In South Asia, low nutritional, educational, and social status of women contribute to underweight children under five. In contrast, in sub-Saharan Africa, factors like low government effectiveness, conflict, political instability, and high rates of HIV and AIDS lead to high child mortality and food insecurity. Most countries with high GHI scores are in these regions, where progress in reducing hunger has been slower. According to IFPRI, countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have high child mortality and food insecurity due to various factors. Progress in reducing the Global Hunger Index (GHI) has been slower in these regions compared to Latin America. Only a few countries have managed to significantly reduce their GHI scores over the past few decades, with some even experiencing an increase in their scores. Among the countries, one-third showed modest progress in reducing their Global Hunger Index (GHI) scores by 25% to 49.9%, while another third decreased their scores by 0% to 24.9%. Nine countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, saw their GHI scores rise, with The Democratic Republic of Congo experiencing a significant increase of over 65%. Factors such as conflict, political instability, HIV/AIDS prevalence, and inequality have contributed to worsening food security in these countries. In Burundi, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, and Liberia, food security has been severely undermined. Swaziland faces challenges with HIV/AIDS and high inequality affecting food security. The Gambia saw an increase in undernourishment due to lower social protection spending. Zimbabwe's economic collapse led to more underweight children and child mortality. Some countries like Angola, Ethiopia, and Ghana made significant progress in improving their Global Hunger Index scores. Between 1990 and 2010, Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Vietnam showed significant improvements in their Global Hunger Index scores. Ghana was the only sub-Saharan African country among the top performers in improving their score. President Obama made global hunger a top priority, pledging $3.5 billion over three years at the G8 Summit in 2009. In 2009, President Obama pledged $3.5 billion over three years at the G8 Summit in Italy to address global hunger and promote agricultural development. The Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security was launched with a goal of mobilizing $20 billion to combat hunger and poverty. The G8 summit launched the Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security with a goal of mobilizing $20 billion to combat hunger and poverty. The initiative focuses on promoting sustainable production, productivity, and rural economic growth. The G8 summit launched the Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security with a goal of mobilizing $20 billion to combat hunger and poverty. The initiative focuses on promoting sustainable production, productivity, and rural economic growth, along with social protection mechanisms for the most vulnerable. Leaders pledged sustainable funding to enhance world production capacity. The G8 leaders pledged sustainable, flexible funding to enhance world production capacity and reverse the trend of decreasing official development assistance for agriculture. The initiative aims to support country and regional agricultural strategies through country-led coordination processes in line with the Accra Agenda for Action. The Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) aims to reform development aid by promoting country-led coordination of agricultural strategies and plans. Developing countries commit to taking control of their futures, while donors pledge to coordinate better and be more accountable. In sub-Saharan Africa, the G8 supports the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural initiative. In sub-Saharan Africa, the G8 supports the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) to target resources to country plans and priorities. CAADP, part of NEPAD and the AU, focuses on improving food security, nutrition, and increasing incomes of smallholder farmers. Established in 2003, the program aims to raise agricultural productivity. The CAADP program, part of NEPAD and the AU, aims to improve food security, nutrition, and increase incomes of smallholder farmers by raising agricultural productivity and increasing public investment in agriculture. It leverages the Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) of the U.N. High Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis. The Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) of the U.N. High Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis, established in 2008, focuses on immediate and long-term actions to address global food price challenges. Immediate needs include emergency food assistance, nutrition interventions, safety nets, boosting smallholder farmer food production, adjusting trade and tax policies, and managing the macroeconomic situation. The CFA proposed measures to address global food and nutrition security, including enhancing emergency food assistance, boosting smallholder farmer food production, adjusting trade and tax policies, and managing the macroeconomic situation. For longer-term food security, the CFA called for expanding social protection systems, sustaining smallholder farmer-led food availability growth, improving international food market accessibility, and developing an international biofuels consensus. The G20 Summit in September 2009 endorsed the L'Aquila food security initiative and called for additional actions. The G20 Summit in September 2009 endorsed the L'Aquila food security initiative and called for the establishment of a World Bank Food Security Trust Fund to finance investments in agricultural productivity and market access in low-income countries. Countries like Belgium, Finland, Norway, and Switzerland pledged to support the Global Partnership with an additional $2 billion, bringing the total commitment to $22 billion. At the G20 Summit, countries like Belgium, Finland, Norway, and Switzerland pledged an additional $2 billion to support the Global Partnership, bringing the total commitment to $22 billion. The United States also collaborated with private philanthropists and the private sector to coordinate food security efforts. In November 2009, a World Summit on Food Security in Rome was convened by FAO, where 60 heads of state and government endorsed the Global Partnership. At a World Summit on Food Security in Rome in November 2009, 60 heads of state and government endorsed the Global Partnership to address food security. FAO reported that agricultural output needs to increase by 70% to feed a population expected to surpass 9 billion by 2050. The summit renewed the commitment to reduce hunger by half by 2015. The U.S. State Department issued a Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative Consultation Document in 2009, outlining priorities to increase agricultural output by 70% to feed a population expected to surpass 9 billion by 2050. The initiative was officially launched in May 2010 as the \"Feed the Future\" Initiative. The Administration launched the \"Feed the Future\" (FtF) Initiative in May 2010, with a strategy guide and implementation documents developed through a consultative process involving various stakeholders. The initiative builds on five principles for sustainable global food security. The \"Feed the Future\" (FtF) Initiative, launched in May 2010, involves collaboration with the global community, focusing on sustainable food security principles. The initiative's key objectives are inclusive agriculture sector growth and improving nutritional status in specific countries, with cross-cutting priorities of gender, environment, and climate change. The \"Feed the Future\" (FtF) Initiative, launched in May 2010, focuses on inclusive agriculture sector growth and improving nutritional status in specific countries, with priorities of gender, environment, and climate change. FtF aims to improve agricultural productivity through technologies and inputs adapted to local conditions, expand markets for agricultural commodities, and develop policies and infrastructure to help smallholder farmers manage risk and adapt to changing environments. The \"Feed the Future\" (FtF) Initiative aims to improve agricultural productivity through technologies adapted to local conditions, expand markets for agricultural commodities, and develop policies and infrastructure to help smallholder farmers manage risk and adapt to changing environments. Progress will be measured by changes in agricultural production and income levels of men and women farmers in rural areas. Specific activities and investments will vary by country based on their priorities. The \"Feed the Future\" (FtF) Initiative aims to improve agricultural productivity and strengthen links between agriculture and nutrition outcomes. Activities and investments will vary by country based on priorities, with a focus on country-specific nutrition needs. Progress will be measured by changes in stunted prevalence. The \"Feed the Future\" (FtF) Initiative works closely with host governments and partners to implement a nutrition strategy based on country-specific needs. Progress will be measured through changes in stunted and wasted children, and underweight women. Regional programs, strategic partnerships with countries like Brazil, India, and China, and global research and innovation are also part of the FtF initiative. Traditional U.S. food aid funding or programs are not explicitly included in FtF. The \"Feed the Future\" (FtF) Initiative focuses on implementing a nutrition strategy based on country-specific needs, measuring progress through changes in stunted and wasted children, and underweight women. Strategic partnerships with countries like Brazil, India, and China, as well as global research and innovation, are key components of FtF. The initiative does not explicitly include traditional U.S. food aid funding or programs, but the United States remains committed to providing emergency and humanitarian food assistance. FtF is currently targeting 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean based on criteria such as chronic hunger and poverty prevalence. The FtF initiative focuses on 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean, selected based on criteria like chronic hunger and poverty prevalence. Investments will occur in two phases depending on country investment plans. The Feed the Future initiative targets 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean based on criteria like chronic hunger and poverty. Investments will occur in two phases depending on country investment plans. Phase 1 involves capacity-building and technical assistance for developing and implementing plans, while Phase 2 countries should have completed their plans. Phase 2 countries should have completed a comprehensive Country Investment Plan (CIP) that includes priority areas, clear costing, financial projections, defined targets, beneficiary analysis, gender assessment, technical feasibility, implementation plan, results framework, and monitoring system. Additionally, these countries must commit their own resources and establish a policy environment conducive to rapid agricultural development. Phase 2 countries must have completed a Country Investment Plan (CIP) with clear priorities, costing, targets, and a commitment of resources. The Administration's FY2011 budget includes $1.64 billion for Feed the Future activities. The Administration's FY2011 budget request includes $1.64 billion for Feed the Future (FtF) activities, which is about 3% of the total international affairs budget. The budget justification notes that $200 million for nutrition activities funded through the Global Health and Child Survival account are part of the food security effort. The FY2011 request for Feed the Future (FtF) is $1.64 billion, with $200 million for nutrition activities funded through the Global Health and Child Survival account. An additional $408 million is requested for a multilateral trust fund for global food security at the World Bank. The FY2011 request for Feed the Future (FtF) is $1.64 billion, with $408 million requested for a multilateral trust fund for global food security at the World Bank. This represents an increase of about 40% compared to the estimated FY2010 allocation. The FY2010 estimate does not include food and agriculture-related supplemental appropriations for Haiti, which focus on emergency food aid and agriculture-related debt cancellation, activities not included in the FtF framework. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for Feed the Future (FtF) is $1.64 billion, with an additional $4.2 billion requested for humanitarian and emergency assistance, including food aid, refugee assistance, and disaster assistance. These programs include activities related to food security and agricultural development. The FY2011 budget request includes $1.605 billion for Migration and Refugee Assistance, $861 million for International Disaster Assistance, and $45 million for Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance, with a focus on food security and agricultural development. There have been discussions about reforming U.S. foreign aid programs to better address national security challenges and development needs. Critics have pointed out inefficiencies and lack of alignment with national security interests in current aid programs. The need to reform U.S. foreign aid capabilities to address 21st-century national security challenges and development needs has been criticized for being ineffectual, inefficient, uncoordinated, and bureaucratic. The Obama Administration's attempt at addressing these issues includes the launch of the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) in 2009. The State Department launched the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) in 2009 to reform U.S. foreign aid policies. Led by the Secretary of State, the QDDR aimed to develop a comprehensive approach to development policy. Despite delays, Secretary Clinton released the findings in a strategy document titled \"Leading Through Civilian Power\" in 2010. The QDDR, co-chaired by the Administrator of USAID and the State Department's Director of Policy Planning, was officially released by Secretary Clinton on December 15, 2010. Titled \"Leading Through Civilian Power,\" the strategy document outlined goals for elevating American \"civilian power\" to better advance national interests and be a stronger partner to the military. It developed a statement of U.S. foreign policy and development objectives, recommended strategies to achieve them, and proposed tools, resources, and organizational reforms for implementation. The QDDR, released in December 2010, outlined goals for elevating American \"civilian power\" to better advance national interests and be a stronger partner to the U.S. military. It developed a statement of U.S. foreign policy and development objectives, recommended strategies to achieve them, and proposed tools, resources, and organizational reforms for implementation. Additionally, the Administration launched a Presidential Study Directive on Global Development Policy in August 2009 to review the specific roles and comparative advantage of U.S. government agencies involved in global development. The U.S. government initiated a review of global development policy to assess the roles and effectiveness of government agencies involved. Led by key officials, the review aims to enhance U.S. development policy and involve the National Security Council staff in the process. A draft document titled \"A New Way Forward on Global Development\" was released in May 2010. The National Security Council staff plays a key role in the PSD review, focusing on development, democracy, and regional issues. A draft document titled \"A New Way Forward on Global Development\" prioritizes economic growth and democratic governance, aiming to elevate development as a key pillar of U.S. foreign policy. This approach has been well-received in the development community. The Administration prioritizes economic growth and democratic governance in the PSD review, aiming to elevate development as a key pillar of U.S. foreign policy. The QDDR will contribute to the PSD by assessing how its results fit into broader interagency approaches. The completion of the PSD-7 process has been delayed, with uncertainty on whether final outputs will be publicly released. The PSD-7 process, originally planned for completion in 2010, has been significantly delayed. It is unclear if the final outputs will be made public. President Obama's new Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development emphasizes the importance of development in American power and national security, with Global Food Security being a key initiative. The President's Policy Directive emphasizes development, diplomacy, and defense to enhance national security. Global Food Security, along with Climate Change and Global Health, are key initiatives. The directive calls for coordination among agencies to implement the directive, starting with the FY2012 budget process. In November 2010, a new Bureau for Food Security (BFS) was established at USAID to lead food security efforts. The USAID Administrator announced the establishment of a new Bureau for Food Security (BFS) to drive food security efforts and lead a whole-of-government initiative. BFS will coordinate with various agencies, expand partnerships, and address issues related to agricultural development, global food security, and foreign aid reform. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, along with other partners, will expand partnerships with the private sector and NGOs to address issues related to agricultural development, global food security, food aid, and U.S. foreign aid reform. The 112th Congress is considering appropriations for agricultural development and food security within the Feed the Future Initiative, building on the President's pledge to provide $3.5 billion over three years to support the Global Agriculture and Food Security Partnership. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, in partnership with other organizations, is working on agricultural development and food security initiatives. Congress is currently reviewing appropriations for these programs, with the House proposing $1 billion for food security and agricultural development, which is 38% less than the Administration's request. The House bill proposed $52.81 billion for FY2011 State-Foreign Operations funding, $4 billion less than the Obama Administration request. The Senate bill approved $54.22 billion, $1.40 billion less than the House draft and $2.61 billion below the Administration's request, including $1.3 billion for food security and agriculture development programs. The Senate bill appropriated $54.22 billion for FY2011 State-Foreign Operations funding, which is $1.40 billion less than the House subcommittee draft and $2.61 billion below the Administration's request. Funding for the federal government has been enacted through continuing resolutions, with the most recent one continuing funding at FY2010 levels through March 4, 2011. The federal government has been funded through continuing resolutions, with the most recent one extending funding at FY2010 levels until March 4, 2011. There may be further debate on funding priorities related to food security and agricultural development due to the current fiscal situation and changes in congressional leadership. The Administration's FY2012 request is expected in mid-February. There is skepticism in the international community about the G8's $22 billion commitment to the Global Partnership being met. The Administration's FY2012 request is due in mid-February. Skepticism exists in the international community regarding the G8's $22 billion commitment to the Global Partnership being met. The total amount pledged to the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program Trust Fund was US$914 million, but only US$263 million has been received from donors. The G8 Summit in Gleneagles pledged $50 billion in development aid to sub-Saharan Africa by 2009, but is $15 billion short of meeting this commitment. The Obama Administration faced criticism for delays in appointing key positions at USAID, the primary U.S. federal agency for global development. Critics have raised concerns about the lack of strong leadership and key posts remaining unfilled. The Obama Administration faced criticism for delays in appointing key positions at USAID, allowing other federal agencies to take on development roles traditionally under USAID's jurisdiction. Critics question the divided development approach among different agencies. Some critics question the divided development approach among different federal agencies, suggesting that it undermines USAID's authority and resources. Concerns have been raised by senior government officials about the decline in staff and USAID's absence in significant foreign policy challenges. Several senior government officials, including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former USAID Administrator Peter McPherson, have raised concerns about the severe decline in staff capacity at USAID over the past few decades, particularly in the context of foreign policy challenges in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. Secretary Gates highlighted the imbalance between military and civilian elements in the national security apparatus, emphasizing the need to address capacity issues rather than lack of will. The United States' national security apparatus has responded unevenly and grown out of balance due to capacity issues, not lack of will. Key instruments of U.S. power abroad were reduced in the 1990s, leading to a decline in staff capacity at USAID. The State Department froze hiring of Foreign Service officers, and USAID's permanent staff dropped from 15,000 during the Vietnam War to less than 3,000 today. The State Department froze hiring of new Foreign Service officers, and USAID's permanent staff decreased from 15,000 during the Vietnam War to less than 3,000 today. Testimony at a hearing on foreign assistance reform noted significant staff reductions at USAID, with only two engineers, 16 agriculture experts, and 17 education experts in 2008. In 2008, USAID had 2,000 permanent foreign officers, which declined to about 1,000. Currently, USAID only has two engineers, 16 agriculture experts, and 17 education experts. Staff cuts have led to reduced on-the-ground effectiveness, the closing of overseas missions, and a shift towards contracting out foreign aid programs. This has resulted in less coherence, effectiveness, flexibility, and leverage with other private entities. Since 2008, USAID has experienced significant staff cuts, reducing its permanent foreign officers from 2,000 to about 1,000. This has led to a shift towards contracting out foreign aid programs, resulting in less coherence, effectiveness, flexibility, and leverage with other entities. The agency now struggles with country-level fragmentation in agricultural development assistance and managing numerous small projects due to staff shortages in key technical areas. Since the launch of the Feed the Future initiative, USAID has been actively working to address rebuilding its technical capacity by hiring nearly 40 additional agriculture foreign-service officers. In the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. government collaborated with land-grant universities to establish counterpart institutions in developing countries. In 1975, the Title XII \"Famine Prevention and Freedom from Hunger\" amendment was passed to address agricultural development. Since the 1990s, USAID's role in capacity building in developing countries and the United States has declined, with studies showing a significant decrease in post-graduate training support from 1989 to 2005. The role of capacity building at USAID has been declining, with a significant decrease in post-graduate training support from 1989 to 2005. This has weakened institutional capacity in developing countries, despite USAID acknowledging the importance of long-term institutional building for aid effectiveness. The decline in capacity building at USAID has led to weaker institutional capacity in developing countries. While USAID recognizes the importance of long-term institutional building for aid effectiveness, questions remain about the sufficiency of institutional capacity in both the United States and developing countries. The funding, scope, and duration of USAID training and capacity-building programs, especially in agriculture, have not been restored. Concerns exist about the institutional capacity in the United States and developing countries, particularly in Africa, to effectively implement agricultural programs. Sub-Saharan Africa lacks a strong scientific foundation for modern agriculture, with governments and donors hesitant to invest in science, technology, and training for increased agricultural productivity. Multiple U.S. agencies are involved in formulating solutions. The lack of a strong scientific foundation for modern agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa has led to reluctance from African governments and donors to invest in science, technology, and training for increased agricultural productivity. Various U.S. agencies, including USAID, the State Department, USDA, and others, are involved in formulating policy and implementing agricultural development and food security assistance. Coordination among these agencies is crucial for providing agricultural support. The need for interagency coordination in agricultural development and food security assistance has been widely discussed. The Chicago Council on Global Affairs recommended creating an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture within the Executive Office. The Chicago Council recommended creating an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture within the Executive Office of the President to improve coordination in foreign assistance, specifically in food aid and nutrition. They also suggested appointing a White House National Security Council deputy for global agriculture. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted coordination issues between USDA and USAID in providing food aid. The Chicago Council recommended establishing a White House National Security Council deputy for global agriculture to improve coordination in foreign assistance. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported on coordination issues between USDA and USAID in providing food aid. The Feed the Future initiative aims to take a \"whole-of-government\" approach, but some see challenges in interagency coordination. The new food security initiative presents challenges and opportunities for U.S. efforts to enhance interagency coordination. Some view fragmentation across government agencies as a constraint. USAID will lead the Feed the Future initiative, but coordination with other U.S. entities is unclear. Funding implications of a whole-of-government approach have not been clearly articulated. Bills in the 111th Congress aim to enhance the U.S. role in addressing global food security. The need for interagency coordination in addressing global hunger and potential funding implications of a whole-of-government approach have not been clearly articulated by the Administration. Bills introduced in the 111th Congress suggest various ways to enhance the U.S. role in addressing global hunger, emphasizing the importance of coordination among donors and aid agencies. It is uncertain if these issues will be a priority in the 112th Congress. In the late 1990s, donors and aid agencies began harmonizing their strategies to make international aid more effective. The United States coordinates with other donors like Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union to discuss and implement aid programs. The US also leads discussions within international bodies like the United Nations and the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD. The United States leads discussions and coordination with other donors like Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union in international bodies such as the United Nations and the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD. Global summits sponsored by the United Nations have also played a crucial role in establishing international development goals and creating new coordination mechanisms. In Rome in 2003, Paris in 2005, and Accra in 2008, global summits have played a key role in donor coordination, setting development goals, and creating new coordination mechanisms. Donors have agreed to increase aid predictability and flexibility, aligning with other donors to impact U.S. bilateral assistance, including USAID support for Comprehensive Africa. The United States aligns with other donors to impact U.S. bilateral assistance, including USAID support for the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) to boost agricultural productivity in Africa. The Administration's global food security initiative endorses principles from U.N.-sponsored multilateral forums like the Accra Agenda for Action on aid effectiveness. Some argue aid reform is progressing too slowly. The Administration's global food security initiative aligns with U.N.-sponsored forums like the Accra Agenda for Action on aid effectiveness. Some argue aid reform is slow, while others believe the U.S. should prioritize its own interests in foreign assistance. The Feed the Future Guide emphasizes \"country-led planning\" for specific activities. The Feed the Future Guide emphasizes the importance of country-led planning for foreign assistance activities, ensuring country ownership and sustainability. Some Members of Congress are concerned about donor control and oversight, while others worry about developing countries lacking capacity for strategic planning and accountability. Some concerns have been raised about donor control and oversight in aligning with donor-specific objectives, as well as the capacity of developing countries to carry out accountability and transparency measures required by donors. Civil society sectors fear that country-led planning may turn into a government-led strategy, potentially excluding focus country civil society organizations and private sector actors. Coordination with U.S. food aid or the provision of food aid is not adequately addressed in the Feed the Future Guide. Despite the emphasis on coordination, little mention is made of U.S. food aid or the need to coordinate FtF with the provision of food aid in the focus countries. Food for Peace Title II food aid is a significant component of U.S. food security assistance, with the Administration's FY2011 request including $1.69 billion for this program. Key questions include how U.S. commodity food aid will be coordinated with Feed the Future programs in the 20 focus countries. The FY2011 request includes $1.69 billion for Food for Peace Title II food aid. Key questions revolve around coordinating U.S. commodity food aid with Feed the Future activities in focus countries and how food aid can support FtF objectives. The FtF strategy emphasizes cross-cutting initiatives like gender, global health, environmental sustainability, and climate change, but lacks clarity on how these issues will be addressed. The Food for Peace Title II food aid request for FY2011 includes $1.69 billion. Questions remain on integrating food aid with Feed the Future activities, addressing cross-cutting initiatives like gender, global health, environmental sustainability, and climate change, and coordinating with other USG initiatives. The Administration has been working on components of the FtF results framework and key indicators to track progress. It is unclear which agency will be responsible for monitoring progress over time. The responsibility for monitoring progress towards the initiative's goals is still unclear, including which agency and specific individuals will be in charge. It is also uncertain when results will be seen, if the initiative will achieve MDG1 in the 20 countries, and how often Congress will receive updates."
