USAID was designated as the responsible agency for the funds. The State Department has designated USAID as the responsible agency for the obligation of funds appropriated for Agent Orange/dioxin-related activities in Vietnam. USAID has obligated 81% of the $127 million appropriated for environmental remediation projects and 63.5% of the $44.3 million for health- and disability-related services from FY2011 to FY2017. USAID has obligated a significant portion of funds for environmental remediation and health- and disability-related services from FY2007 to FY2017. The manner in which the funds have been obligated has been a concern for Congress, particularly regarding health and disability services. Since FY2007, USAID has allocated funds for environmental remediation and health- and disability-related services. Congress has raised concerns about the pace and types of programs funded for health and disability services, separate from environmental remediation activities. Since FY2007, USAID has allocated funds for health and disability services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas in Vietnam. Congress has designated funds specifically for these activities, separate from environmental remediation efforts. The Senate report and accompanying legislation allocated funds for environmental remediation of dioxin contamination in Vietnam, with a focus on health activities in nearby communities. It is uncertain if all funds have been used as directed. Funds for health and disability activities in Vietnam, particularly in areas affected by Agent Orange or dioxin contamination, may not have always been obligated according to locational guidance. Funds in FY2007-FY2009 were directed to programs in Danang, while funds in FY2010-FY2013 were largely allocated to Development Alternatives, Inc. for a disability support program without explicit mention of Agent Orange/dioxin. In FY2013, health and disability funds were mainly allocated to Development Alternatives, Inc. for a program to improve the lives of persons with disabilities. The program ended in January 2016, and USAID shifted to directly obligating funds for health and disability services in smaller amounts, increasing outreach to Vietnamese NGOs. Since FY2014, USAID has returned to directly funding health- and disability-related services in smaller amounts and has increased collaboration with Vietnamese nongovernmental organizations. Congressional appropriations have supported activities like the environmental remediation project at Danang Airport related to Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam since 2008. The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport, financed by congressional appropriations related to Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam, experienced delays, increased material for decontamination, and rising costs since its start in 2008. USAID aimed to finish by October 2013, but a 2014 audit projected completion by March 31, 2017, with decontamination finished in August 2017. The decontamination project at Danang Airport, initially planned for completion by October 2013, faced delays and increased costs. The estimated completion date was pushed to March 31, 2017, with decontamination finished in August 2017. The project's scope expanded from 61,700 cubic meters to 90,000 cubic meters, with additional lower-risk material. Costs escalated from $33.7 million to over $110 million due to these changes. Danang Airport was a crucial hub for the U.S. military's Operation Ranch Hand, with soil contamination levels reaching up to 365 parts per million. The decontamination project at Danang Airport faced delays and increased costs, with the project's scope expanding and costs escalating from $33.7 million to over $110 million. Soil concentrations at the airport exceeded international standards, with levels of \"TCDD toxic equivalents\" (TEQ) up to 365 parts per billion.

The U.S. government has provided over $60 million in assistance to disabled Vietnamese, regardless of the cause of the disability. Funds were specifically allocated for health services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated sites. State Department and USAID utilized these funds for grants to improve the quality of life for persons with disabilities in Danang. A USAID assessment in December 2010 highlighted the accomplishments of these programs within a three-year time frame. In 2012, USAID approved a three-year nationwide Persons with Disability Support Program (PDSP) to be jointly implemented with Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) and Vietnam Assistance for the Handicapped (VNAH) to build on previous accomplishments in assisting people with disabilities in Danang. The PDSP project, implemented by USAID, DAI, and VNAH, aimed to build on previous assistance to people with disabilities in Danang. The project focused on conducting a needs assessment in Bien Hoa and Phu Cat, with initial funding set at $9 million. The RFA for the PDSP project, proposed by the Recipient, focuses on regions with high disability burden and dioxin hot spots. Funding was set at $9 million, with grants awarded for health services, rehabilitation therapy, vocational training, and community awareness. USAID also supported VNAH in addressing disability policy and legal framework needs in Vietnam. The program was headquartered in Danang and initially operated in Bien Hoa and Phu Cat.

USAID provided assistance to VNAH for disability policy and legal framework needs. The program initially operated in provinces like Binh Dinh, Danang, and Dong Nai, and later extended to Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, and Thua Thien-Hue. These provinces were heavily sprayed with Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. The PDSP program, funded at $9 million, focused on regions with high disability burden and dioxin hot spots in Vietnam. USAID extended the program to the provinces of Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, and Thua Thien-Hue, which were heavily sprayed with Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. Nearly US$900,000 in grants were awarded to 14 local partners and organizations. USAID adopted a new approach to providing assistance to persons with disabilities in Vietnam to foster expanded opportunities for vulnerable populations. USAID adopted a new approach to assist persons with disabilities in Vietnam by providing direct assistance to improve health, independence, and participation in economic and social life. They aim to address key challenges for persons with disabilities and support changes in disability policies while financing therapies and training for Vietnamese practitioners and technicians. USAID will finance therapies and training for persons with disabilities in Vietnam, focusing on high prevalence and poverty areas. Target provinces include Binh Dinh, Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, Thai Binh, and Thua Thien-Hue. The provinces of Binh Dinh, Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, Thai Binh, and Thua Thien-Hue have been identified as heavily sprayed areas. USAID will directly administer a new approach in consultation with Vietnamese agencies. The environmental cleanup of Danang airport is completed, and efforts are underway to clean up the dioxin \"hot spot\" at Bien Hoa airbase, where the most Agent Orange spraying missions occurred during the war. The Bien Hoa airbase, heavily sprayed with Agent Orange during the war, is undergoing cleanup of a dioxin \"hot spot\" with high contamination levels. The Vietnamese government has taken mitigation measures, including excavating and containing 43,000 m3 of contaminated soil in a passive landfill. The Vietnamese government has conducted mitigation measures to contain dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa airbase, including a passive landfill for contaminated soil. However, other dioxin \"hot spots\" at the airbase have not been addressed, leading to soil spreading into nearby water bodies. The consulting firm, Hatfield Consultants, hired by Office 33, found contaminated soil spreading from \"hot spots\" into nearby water bodies, increasing the need for treatment. The UNDP has been working with Office 33 and MONRE for five years to map out dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa airbase, estimating 250,000 m3 of soil requiring decontamination at a cost of $250 million. USAID contracted CDM International Inc. in September 2013 for environmental work. In 2014, a joint investigation estimated that 250,000 m3 of soil at Bien Hoa airbase needed decontamination, costing at least $250 million. USAID hired CDM International Inc. in September 2013 to assess dioxin remediation options, partnering with Hatfield Consulting. The final environmental assessment report in May 2016 revealed 408,500 to 495,300 m3 of contaminated soils and sediments at the airbase. The final environmental assessment report in May 2016 found 408,500 to 495,300 m3 of contaminated soils and sediments at the airbase. Five treatment methods were considered, with costs ranging from $137 million to $794 million. The estimated costs could vary by 40% less to 75% more than the stated amounts. The estimated costs for environmental remediation at Bien Hoa Airbase range from $137 million to $794 million, with potential variations expanding the range to between $82 million and $1.4 billion. Over $3.7 million has been allocated for assessment, and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence has begun infrastructure construction for dioxin decontamination at the airport with a reported budget of $11.8 million. In September 2017, Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence started infrastructure construction for dioxin decontamination at Bien Hoa airport with a budget of $11.8 million. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum of intent on January 23, 2018, to begin the decontamination process. U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Daniel J. Kritenbrink expressed eagerness to deepen the partnership and work on this important initiative. The United States and Vietnam signed a memorandum of intent to work together on a remediation program for Bien Hoa airport. A $183 million nonrefundable aid agreement was signed for the decontamination project, projected to take 10 years at an estimated cost of $390 million. The Ministry of National Defence signed a $183 million aid agreement in May 2018 for the decontamination of Bien Hoa airport. The project is expected to take 10 years and involve decontaminating 500,000 cubic meters of soil. In September 2018, a memorandum of understanding was signed with Shimizu Corporation to build a decontamination factory capable of processing 40 tons of soil per hour. The Shimizu Corporation signed a memorandum of understanding to construct a decontamination factory at Bien Hoa airport, using a filtered sponge technique to decontaminate 40 tons of soil per hour. The new technique is expected to be more cost-effective than previous methods. U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited the airport and emphasized America's commitment to remediate past issues. During his visit to Bien Hoa airport on October 17, 2018, Secretary Mattis reaffirmed America's commitment to remediate past issues, specifically regarding Agent Orange contamination in Vietnam. Congressional interest in this matter focuses on providing assistance for environmental damage and health effects, as well as oversight of remediation efforts. The focus on Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam is on providing assistance for environmental damage and health effects, as well as oversight of remediation efforts. Both the Obama and Trump Administrations have shown support for projects addressing dioxin contamination in Vietnam. The State Department regularly requests funding for decontamination of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam. The Trump Administration supports environmental remediation projects for Agent Orange and dioxin in Vietnam. The State Department requests funding for decontamination of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam from Congress. Funds are used for health and disability services in areas affected by Agent Orange, regardless of the cause. Programs are conducted near known Agent Orange \"hot spots\" for persons with disabilities. The Obama Administration budget requests did not explicitly include funding for health and disability assistance programs in areas affected by Agent Orange or dioxin. However, funds were designated for disability programs and vulnerable groups in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 designates funds for health and disability services in areas contaminated with Agent Orange/dioxin, specifically for individuals with severe mobility impairment or cognitive disabilities. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 allocates at least $12,500,000 for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin contamination. This assistance is aimed at individuals with severe mobility or cognitive disabilities. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 allocates funds for health and disability programs for individuals affected by exposure to Agent Orange. Section 3 requires the Secretary of State to provide assistance for Vietnamese residents affected by health issues related to Agent Orange exposure between 1961 and 1975, or their descendants. Assistance includes medical services, vocational training, and equipment. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 provides assistance for individuals affected by exposure to Agent Orange. It requires the Secretary of State to assist Vietnamese residents or their descendants with health issues related to Agent Orange exposure. This includes medical services, vocational training, and equipment. Additionally, the Act mandates support for research on health issues related to Agent Orange and assistance to repair substandard homes in Vietnam for affected individuals and their families. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 mandates assistance for individuals affected by Agent Orange exposure. It requires the Secretary of State to support research on health issues related to Agent Orange and provide assistance to institutions in Vietnam for healthcare. Additionally, it calls for remediation of heavily sprayed areas in Vietnam. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 prioritizes heavily sprayed areas, military bases, and areas with harmful deposits of Agent Orange for assistance. It also requires quarterly reports from the Secretaries of State, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs on the implementation of the Act. Congress oversees the implementation of the Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 by requiring quarterly reports from the Secretaries of State, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs on the Act's provisions. Congressional oversight focuses on funding for environmental remediation and health services in Agent Orange-contaminated areas in Vietnam. Congress has focused on oversight of appropriated funds for environmental remediation at Danang airport, where costs have risen from $33.7 million in 2010 to $116 million. Members are concerned about slow fund obligation and changes in USAID's approach to administering funds. The estimated total cost of environmental remediation at Danang airport increased from $33.7 million in 2010 to $116 million. Congress is concerned about cost overruns and delays at Danang airport, which could impact funding for a similar project at Bien Hoa airport. Despite challenges, USAID has managed to keep the Danang airport cleanup project going and funding flowing. The Danang airport cleanup project faced rising costs and delays, but USAID successfully kept the project going. However, USAID has struggled to effectively utilize funds for health services in areas contaminated with Agent Orange/dioxin. Only 63.5% of funds allocated from FY2011 to FY2017 have been used, with a shifting approach in fund administration raising questions about the effectiveness of the health services funds. Some observers question the effectiveness of USAID's approach to utilizing health services funds, which has shifted back and forth between direct obligation and cooperative agreements. Congressional dissatisfaction with State Department and USAID management of funds is reflected in legislation language. In 2019, Congress passed legislation (P.L. 116-6) and H.R. 326 regarding health and disability assistance to Vietnam, possibly due to dissatisfaction with State Department and USAID management of funds. The legislation appropriates funds for environmental remediation and health services in Vietnam, with specific amounts detailed in accompanying reports or statements."
