    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prevention of Frivolous Ethanol Lawsuits Act of 2010\". It includes findings related to ethanol lawsuits. The Congress finds that ethanol is widely used in gasoline for vehicles and engines, and increasing the blending limit requires ensuring it won't harm emission control devices. Increasing the blending limit of ethanol in gasoline for vehicles and engines raises concerns about potential negative effects on engine performance and consumer complaints. The Federal Trade Commission is proposing labeling requirements for fuels with ethanol levels exceeding the current limit in gasoline to warn consumers of potential harm to conventional vehicles. Federal testing is ongoing to assess the impact on newer motor vehicles. The executive branch has statutory authority to increase the current blending limit of ethanol into gasoline, but there is insufficient data on the effects on older vehicles and nonroad engines. Federal testing is being conducted on newer motor vehicles to determine the impact of increasing the blending limit of ethanol into gasoline. The executive branch has the authority to increase the blending limit of ethanol in gasoline for older vehicles and nonroad engines. Congress should address any negative impacts on interstate commerce from this decision. Targeted liability protections are provided for claims related to damages caused by the inclusion of ethanol in certain fuel. Liability protections are granted to covered entities using renewable fuel with ethanol concentrations over 10%, for operating internal combustion engines, immune from suit and liability under Federal and State law. The term \"loss\" in this section includes death, injury, illness, disability, property damage, and business interruption. The immunity under paragraph (1) applies to any claim for loss related to physical, mental, emotional injury, illness, disability, property damage, or business interruption caused by the use of renewable fuel. The immunity under paragraph (1) applies to any claim for loss related to the use of renewable fuel containing ethanol in concentrations greater than 10 percent, for operating an internal combustion engine. The combustion engine's relationship with the design, development, testing, manufacture, distribution, marketing, and use of renewable fuel is subject to immunity from liability, except for cases of death or serious injury caused by willful actions. The exception to immunity from suit and liability for covered persons is for a Federal cause of action for death or serious physical injury caused by willful misconduct. This cause of action is not considered a violation of a statute of the United States.
