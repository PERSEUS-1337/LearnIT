    "content": "Several tax options have been proposed to finance health care reform, including restricting itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers and modifying the tax exclusion for employer-provided health care. The Senate Finance Committee provided a list of options for health-related tax provisions, such as increasing taxes on alcoholic beverages and imposing an excise tax on non-diet sweetened beverages. Several tax options have been proposed to finance health care reform, including limiting income deductions, revising tax provisions, increasing taxes on alcoholic beverages, and imposing an excise tax on non-diet sweetened beverages. The House Ways and Means Committee has suggested a surtax on high-income individuals, while the Senate Finance Committee proposed an excise tax on insurers for high-cost plans. The House and Senate proposed different tax options to finance health care reform. The House suggested a surtax on high-income individuals, while the Senate proposed an excise tax on insurers for high-cost plans. President Obama's compromise proposal, based on H.R. 3590, includes changes to revenue provisions such as delaying the tax on high-cost employer plans from 2013 to 2018. The President's compromise proposal, based on H.R. 3590, includes changes to revenue provisions such as delaying the tax on high-cost employer plans from 2013 to 2018 and raising the exemption threshold for this tax. Additionally, the plan broadens the proposed increase of the Medicare Hospital Insurance tax for high-income households by adding a tax on unearned income at a 3.8% rate. H.R. 3590 proposes increasing the Medicare Hospital Insurance tax for high-income households by adding a 3.8% tax on unearned income. The bill was passed by the House and Senate, signed by the President, and detailed revenue estimates are provided in the Appendix. The tax proposals vary in their impact on behavior and income distribution. The tax proposals in the House and Senate bills, along with reconciliation modifications, are detailed in the Appendix. These proposals differ in their effects on behavior and income distribution, with some changes being progressive, proportional, or regressive. For example, the limit on itemized deductions increases taxes for high-income taxpayers, making it a highly progressive change. The tax proposals in the House and Senate bills, along with reconciliation modifications, have varying effects on behavior and income distribution. For instance, the limit on itemized deductions increases taxes for high-income taxpayers, making it a highly progressive change. Excise taxes tend to be regressive and impact lower-income classes more heavily. The distributional analysis in this report focuses on the financing mechanism of health care reform proposals, noting that excise taxes are regressive and impact lower-income classes more. Despite regressive revenue sources, the overall proposal may redistribute in favor of lower-income individuals. The report also reviews revenue raisers proposed in House and Senate bills and by President Obama. The report reviews revenue raisers proposed in House and Senate bills and by President Obama, including an increased Medicare tax as the most significant revenue raiser in the final legislation. The final legislation includes various revenue raisers, with the increased Medicare tax being the most significant (48% of revenue over FY2010-FY2019). Other key revenue raisers are the fee on health insurance providers (14%), the \"Cadillac\" tax on employer health insurance premiums (7%), and the fee on branded drugs (6%). Additionally, there are provisions for cellulosic biofuel credits (5%) and fees on medical devices (5%). The largest revenue raisers over a 10-year period include the increased Medicare tax (48%), fee on health insurance providers (14%), \"Cadillac\" tax on employer health insurance premiums (7%), and fee on branded drugs (6%). Other provisions such as cellulosic biofuel credits (5%), fees on medical devices (5%), and tax compliance provision for reporting payments over $600 by firms (4%) account for about 90% of revenues. The shares change over time due to delays and expirations, with Medicare tax being 44% in 2019, followed by the Cadillac tax at 22%. In 2019, the Medicare tax is 44% of the total revenue, while the Cadillac tax is 22%. Health insurance fees and fees on medical devices account for 14% and 4% respectively. The drug fee is 3%, and the biofuel provision has expired. The House Ways and Means Committee announced revenue- and tax-related provisions to fund health care reform. The House Ways and Means Committee announced revenue- and tax-related provisions to fund health care reform, including a tax on high-income individuals. Legislation such as H.R. 3200 and H.R. 3962 were passed in 2009 with modifications and new proposals. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, H.R. 3962, passed in 2009, included provisions from H.R. 3200 with modifications. The main changes involved revising the surtax on high-income taxpayers and adding new revenue raisers to fund health care reform. The initial proposal in H.R. 3200 estimated $583.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014, with $543.9 billion generated from a surtax on individual taxpayers. The initial proposal in H.R. 3200 for funding health care reform included a surtax on individual taxpayers, generating $583.1 billion for FY2010-FY2014. The surtax rates ranged from 1% to 5.4% based on income levels, with potential adjustments in 2013 and the possibility of elimination. The House proposal included tax rates ranging from 1% to 5.4% based on income levels, with potential adjustments in 2013. The plan also aimed to raise $8 billion by adjusting the definition of medical expenses for health savings accounts. The House proposal included tax rates based on income levels and aimed to raise $8 billion by adjusting the definition of medical expenses for health savings accounts. The plan also included revenue raisers related to international taxation and tax evasion, estimated to raise $5 billion, $26.1 billion, $7.5 billion, and $3.6 billion over 10 years. The House proposal included various revenue raisers, such as adjusting tax rates based on income levels and expanding the definition of medical expenses for health savings accounts. Additionally, provisions related to international taxation, tax evasion, and tax shelters by corporations were included, estimated to raise significant amounts over a 10-year period. The House proposal in H.R. 3962 included a 5.4% surtax on incomes over $1 million for joint returns and half that for single taxpayers ($500,000), raising $460.5 billion over FY2010-FY2014. It also included revenue raisers related to international taxation and tax evasion, projected to raise significant funds. The provision in H.R. 3200 projected to raise $26 billion was included in other legislation, while the current repeal provision is estimated to raise $6.0 billion. The economic substance doctrine provision was modified to include penalties for underpayments, estimated to raise $5.7 billion, and the definition of medical expenses was adjusted to raise $5.0 billion. Additionally, H.R. 3962 imposes restrictions on health-related tax provisions, such as limiting health flexible spending arrangements to $2,500 and increasing penalties for nonqualified distributions from health savings accounts. H.R. 3962 imposes restrictions on health-related tax provisions, including limiting health flexible spending arrangements to $2,500, increasing penalties for nonqualified distributions from health savings accounts, disallowing deductions for subsidies related to Medicare Part D, imposing a 2.5% excise tax on the first taxable sale of medical devices, and requiring information reporting on payments to corporations. The plan includes a 2.5% excise tax on the first taxable sale of medical devices, information reporting on payments to corporations, extending health benefits for spouses and dependents, fees on insured and self-insured health plans, and excluding Indian Tribe health benefits from gross income. The Senate Finance Committee proposal includes health benefits for spouses and dependents, fees on insured and self-insured health plans, and excluding Indian Tribe health benefits from gross income. It also proposes a tax on the sale of medical devices and other provisions in a different form. The House bill proposal includes a surtax on high-income individuals, targeting the top 1.2% of taxpayers, with the highest surtax affecting only two-tenths of 1% of taxpayers, making it a highly progressive measure. The surtax proposal in H.R. 3962 targets the top 1.2% of taxpayers, with the highest surtax affecting only two-tenths of 1% of taxpayers, making it a highly progressive measure. Concerns have been raised about its impact on small businesses, but only about 4% of businesses would be affected initially. The surtax proposal in H.R. 3962 targets the top 1.2% of taxpayers, with only about 4% of businesses initially affected. Higher-income individuals would bear a larger share of the surtax due to their higher income levels. For example, those with income over $1 million represent 15.1% of adjusted gross income but only 0.2% of returns. Income is concentrated at higher levels, with returns over $1 million representing 15.1% of adjusted gross income but only 0.2% of returns. Business income is more concentrated in higher-income levels. Labor income makes up three-quarters of overall income, with the rest split between passive capital income, pensions, and business income. In higher-income levels, labor income accounts for about three-quarters of overall income, with passive capital income, pensions, and business income making up the rest. Individuals with incomes over $1 million contribute significantly to unincorporated business net income, while those with incomes over $500,000 also play a substantial role. This concentration is mainly seen in partnership and Subchapter S firms rather than proprietorships. Individuals with incomes over $500,000 account for 39% of total income, with partnerships and Subchapter S firms driving this concentration. Returns with income over $1 million contribute significantly to net income for these firms. Partnerships and returns with income over $1 million account for a significant portion of net income, with taxpayers at the top tax rate responsible for a majority of business flow-through income. Most partnership income comes from limited liability companies or limited partnerships, including passive income and income from tax shelters. According to IRS data, almost 85% of partnership income is in limited liability companies or limited partnerships, which may include passive income and income from tax shelters. These business income shares involve both active and passive income, with high-income taxpayers only accounting for 46% of active positive business income. The Tax Policy Center found that only 22.8% of returns affected by the surtax had business income, indicating that many of these businesses are not active. The Treasury study showed that high-income taxpayers represented 46% of active positive business income. The Tax Policy Center found that only 22.8% of returns affected by the surtax had business income exceeding half of total income, indicating that much of this income is passive investment income. This suggests that a significant portion of partnership income reflects activities that may not be of interest. The current rules allow firms to operate with limited liability without corporate tax, through corporate dividends and capital gains. Most partnership income comes from finance, real estate, oil and gas, and services like legal and medical professions. Finance and insurance make up 19% of total income, with 80% from securities and investment firms. The data suggests that small business income is concentrated in passive investments, stockbrokers, lawyers, doctors, and accountants, who may not be significant sources of job creation for lower and moderate income individuals. This implies that increased tax revenue is unlikely to come from these sources. Small business income is associated with passive investments, stockbrokers, lawyers, doctors, and accountants, who may not be important sources of job creation for lower and moderate income individuals. Small businesses create more jobs but also contribute to job loss, making it unclear if they are significant sources of new jobs. Small businesses are the greatest sources of job loss and create more net new jobs, but the evidence is unclear due to migration across size classifications. This sector offers more opportunities to women and minorities but pays less, is less stable, and has fewer benefits. While a stimulus may be needed in economic downturns, there is no need for a permanent policy to create jobs as the economy creates its own jobs. There is no need for a permanent policy to create jobs as the economy creates its own jobs over time. Excluding income from certain types of business operations could mitigate the impact on small businesses. Excluding flow through income from the top 1% would sacrifice around one-quarter of revenue. Excluding flow through income from certain professions like lawyers, doctors, or stockbrokers could impact revenue, especially from the top 1%. Passive income and income from various industries should not be excluded to minimize revenue loss. Other revenue-raising provisions have smaller effects. The initial bill proposed excluding spending on over-the-counter medications from flexible spending plans and health savings accounts. Other revenue-raising provisions have minor effects, such as limits on flexible spending accounts and conforming the definition of medical expenses for health savings accounts. The Senate proposal includes health-related tax expenditures, limits on flexible spending accounts, and conforming the definition of medical expenses for health savings accounts. Other significant provisions relate to corporation taxes and the tax gap, with a brief discussion on the excise tax on medical devices. The Senate Finance Committee proposal includes health-related tax expenditures, limits on flexible spending accounts, and conforming the definition of medical expenses for health savings accounts. The tax on medical devices is discussed, with the House and Senate bills containing different provisions. The House bill imposes a 2.5% tax on manufacturers and importers, while the Senate proposal includes a fixed fee and other fees. The Senate provision for the tax on medical devices is in the form of a fixed fee, different from the House bill which imposes a 2.5% tax on manufacturers and importers. The cost of the tax on ordinary devices will likely be passed on to consumers, while unique devices under patent may absorb some costs due to monopoly positions. The tax on medical devices could lead to higher insurance payments for consumers, with costs potentially absorbed by producers of unique patented devices. Industry concerns about discouraging investment in new devices have been raised, but the impact may be lessened by health insurance coverage. The interest allocation proposal would repeal a provision allowing worldwide interest allocation for the foreign tax credit, benefiting firms with more foreign taxes paid than allowable credits. The 2004 provision changed how U.S. source interest was allocated between foreign and domestic incomes, increasing allowable foreign tax credits for firms with more foreign taxes paid than allowable credits. The 2004 provision aimed to allocate more domestic interest to domestic source income, reduce interest allocated to foreign income, and increase the foreign tax credit limit. Another provision targeted reducing \"treaty-shopping\" by imposing withholding taxes on certain payments to foreigners. The proposed provision aims to eliminate the benefit of setting up a subsidiary in a treaty country to avoid withholding tax and codify the economic substance doctrine. This doctrine disallows tax benefits for arrangements lacking economic substance. The economic substance doctrine disallows tax benefits for transactions lacking economic substance, with proposals to introduce legislative standards to ensure both objective and subjective tests are met. Penalties may be imposed to reduce tax avoidance and ensure consistency across courts. H.R. 3962 proposes stricter tests for transactions to meet profit objectives and intentions, with penalties for non-compliance. Supporters believe this will reduce tax avoidance and ensure consistency in court rulings. Some tax attorneys are concerned that specific rules may provide a roadmap for structuring arrangements to pass the test. The bill also includes a provision for information reporting on payments to corporations, aiding in tax enforcement for self-employed individuals. The provision in H.R. 3962 requires information reporting on payments to corporations over $600 to aid in tax enforcement for self-employed individuals. This may increase compliance burden on businesses, especially smaller corporations where compliance is a concern. The provision in H.R. 3962 requires information reporting on payments to corporations over $600 to aid in tax enforcement for self-employed individuals, increasing compliance burden on businesses, especially smaller corporations. The change simplifies reporting requirements by excluding fuels with water, sediment, or ash content. The provision in H.R. 3962 modifies the cellulosic biofuels producer credit to exclude fuels with significant water, sediment, or ash content, like black liquor. Black liquor was previously eligible for the credit but is now excluded. The black liquor credit (Section 40(b)) and alcohol fuel mixture credit expired in 2009. The black liquor provision was seen as an unintended recipient of a blended fuel credit, used by the paper industry to qualify a by-product of production. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL34494, CRS Report R40468, and CRS Report RS22846. Under current law, firms must report payments to unincorporated businesses providing services over $600 per year on form 1099-MISC. If they can't get the vendor's taxpayer ID, they must withhold taxes to increase third party reporting and address unreported income. The reporting requirements for payments over $600 per year aim to increase third-party reporting to address unreported income, especially from small businesses. Compliance rates for other types of income are higher, but only a small fraction of firms comply with these requirements. It is unclear how many noncompliant firms exist. The reporting requirements aim to increase third-party reporting for payments over $600 per year to address unreported income, especially from small businesses. Compliance rates are low, with only a small fraction of firms filing this information return. The proposal includes expanding reporting of payments for services to corporations, driven by the growth of small firms in corporate status. The expansion of reporting requirements aims to increase third-party reporting for payments over $600 per year, especially from small businesses. Two potential reasons for this expansion are the significant growth of small firms in corporate status and the need to simplify compliance for firms. Additionally, the proposal includes expanding reporting to include goods as well as services, which would increase the amount of reporting without requiring firms to differentiate between the two. The proposal aims to expand reporting requirements to include goods as well as services, which would simplify compliance for firms and increase the share of firms expected to file these forms. This change is seen as a way to make enforcement of information reporting and compliance with income reporting by smaller businesses more successful. Businesses have criticized these provisions for potentially increasing costs. The proposal aims to simplify compliance for firms and increase the share of firms expected to file forms by expanding reporting requirements to include goods and services. Businesses have criticized these provisions for potentially increasing costs and administrative burden. Suggestions to scale back the proposal include raising the minimum dollar reporting requirement or only implementing certain aspects. The Senate Finance Committee reported S. 1796, America's Healthy Future Act of 2009, with the largest provision being a 40% excise tax on health coverage in excess of $8,000 for singles and $21,000 for families. There are options to scale back the proposal, such as raising the minimum dollar reporting requirement or only requiring additional information to be reported to the IRS. The America's Healthy Future Act of 2009, S. 1796, includes a provision for a 40% excise tax on health coverage exceeding $8,000 for singles and $21,000 for families. The Senate passed H.R. 3590, which modified this provision to tax coverage exceeding $8,500 for singles and $23,000 for families, raising $398.1 billion in total revenue. Additionally, H.R. 3590 introduced other provisions, such as an increase in the payroll tax for high-income earners. H.R. 3590 reduced the fee on medical devices and introduced provisions including an increase in the payroll tax for high-income earners, a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities, and a change in the treatment of Blue Cross. It also included a temporary fee on insured and self-insured plans, liberalized the adoption credit, and excluded assistance for certain health professionals in state student loan repayment programs. The plan included a temporary fee on insured and self-insured plans, liberalized the adoption credit, and excluded assistance for certain health professionals in state student loan repayment programs. It also had provisions to conform the definition of medical expenses for health savings accounts, limit health flexible spending arrangements in cafeteria plans, and require information reporting for corporations. The House bill includes provisions to align medical expense definitions for health savings accounts, limit health flexible spending arrangements, increase penalties for nonqualified distributions, and disallow deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies. Additionally, there is a proposal to raise the floor for itemized deductions for medical costs to 10% and limit deductions for officer remuneration. The proposal in the curr_chunk includes provisions related to Medicare Part D, raising the floor for itemized deductions for medical costs to 10%, limiting deductions for officer remuneration, and imposing fees on manufacturers and importers of medical devices and health insurance providers. The proposal in the curr_chunk includes a fee on manufacturers and importers of medical devices, health insurance providers, branded drugs, and indoor tanning facilities, as well as an additional 0.9% HI payroll tax on wages exceeding $200,000 for singles and $250,000. The proposal includes a fee on insured and self-insured health plans, an additional 0.9% HI payroll tax on wages over $200,000 for singles and $250,000 for joint returns, and other provisions with negligible or revenue losing costs. The curr_chunk discusses additional requirements for community benefits for non-profit hospitals, employer reporting on the value of health benefits, and revenue losing provisions such as a qualifying therapeutic discovery project credit, exclusion of funds for state student loan repayment programs, and changes to the adoption tax credit. The curr_chunk discusses provisions related to the adoption tax credit, including making it refundable, increasing qualifying expenses, and extending the credit through 2011. It also mentions the excise tax on health insurance coverage, fees on drugs, medical devices, and health insurance providers, as well as the excise tax on cosmetic procedures. The curr_chunk discusses a proposed tax on high-income taxpayers for certain types of plans, which would not be deductible. The tax rate is around 40%, similar to the top income tax rate if the 2001 tax cuts expire. This tax may lead to higher premiums or reduced benefits for recipients, potentially increasing the cost of medical care and reducing demand. The provision would increase premiums or reduce benefits for certain plans, leading to higher tax liability. It is estimated to generate $148.9 billion over 10 years, with thresholds adjusted annually. Plans in high-cost states would have higher thresholds initially. The provision would increase thresholds by CPI plus one percentage point, with higher limits for plans in high-cost states initially. Limits would also be higher for those over 55 and in risky professions, with exceptions for single and family plans at $9,850 and $26,000 respectively. The provision would set limits on health insurance coverage for mining, agriculture, forestry, and fishery sectors. Single plans would have a limit of $9,850 and family plans $26,000. A study showed that 90% of plans would not be affected, with examples of high coverage for directors of companies like Goldman Sachs. The limits are more generous than those for most Members of Congress. The excise tax approach aims to discourage rising health care costs by setting limits on health insurance coverage. For example, directors of companies like Goldman Sachs receive approximately $40,000 in coverage, which is more generous than most Members of Congress. If health care costs continue to rise faster than general price levels, more plans would be affected over time. The tax would be collected at the insurance-company level to pass on the cost. The excise tax approach aims to discourage rising health care costs by setting limits on health insurance coverage. The tax would be collected at the insurance-company level or health insurance plans' costs would be reduced, potentially affecting lower-income employees. The proposal raises fairness issues and questions about how firms that self-insure would be treated. The excise tax proposal aims to limit health insurance coverage costs by taxing benefits, potentially impacting lower-income employees. Questions remain about how self-insured firms would be affected and whether the tax would be deductible from the firm's income tax. H.R. 3590 would also increase the HI payroll tax for earnings over $200,000. H.R. 3590 proposes increasing the HI payroll tax by 0.9% for earnings over $200,000 for single individuals and $250,000 for joint returns, raising $86.8 billion in revenue. The tax would be collected by employers on compensation exceeding $200,000, with employees responsible for any discrepancies in withholding. This provision targets high-income taxpayers and aims to generate revenue. The provision in H.R. 3590 targets high-income taxpayers by increasing the HI payroll tax by 0.9% for earnings over $200,000 for single individuals and $250,000 for joint returns. Employers would collect the tax on compensation exceeding $200,000, with employees responsible for any discrepancies in withholding. This provision aims to raise revenue and is very progressive, although it does not apply to capital income. Other revenue raisers include fees on health insurance providers, branded drugs, and medical devices. The fees and excise taxes, including those on branded drugs and medical devices, are significant revenue raisers totaling $106.3 billion from FY2010 through FY2019. Fees on health insurance providers and medical devices increase over time, with health insurance providers facing fees of $2 billion in 2011, increasing to $10 billion thereafter, and medical devices facing fees of $2 billion per year until 2017, then $3 billion per year. Branded drug fees amount to $2.1 billion annually. The fees and excise taxes on branded drugs and medical devices are significant revenue raisers, totaling $106.3 billion from FY2010 through FY2019. The fees on health insurance providers increase over time, reaching $10 billion annually, while medical devices face fees of $2 billion per year until 2017, then $3 billion per year. Branded drug fees amount to $2.1 billion annually. Fixed nominal aggregate fees will become less important over time. The fees on insured and self-insured plans, totaling $2.6 billion, finance the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust fund and expire after September 31, 2019. These taxes could potentially increase prices and reduce producer profits. The fees and excise taxes on branded drugs and medical devices are significant revenue raisers, totaling $106.3 billion from FY2010 through FY2019. These taxes could increase prices, reduce profits of the producer, and be passed on to insurance companies and consumers. The fees aim to capture windfall profits from increased demand due to expanded health insurance coverage. The medical device fee and branded drug fee provisions aim to capture windfall profits from increased demand due to expanded health insurance coverage. The fees are fixed amounts with revenue collected based on sales shares. Certain devices under $100 are exempt from the medical device fee, and there is a sliding scale to reduce the impact on small producers. The first $5 million in total sales for the medical device fee apportionment is not counted. The medical device fee and branded drug fee have a sliding scale to reduce the impact on small producers. For medical devices, the first $5 million in sales is not counted, and for drugs, different percentages are applied based on sales ranges. Insurance premiums also have exclusions and inclusions based on specific thresholds. The medical device fee and branded drug fee have exclusions and inclusions based on specific thresholds. The fees are not deductible and are imposed as a fixed amount with apportionment, resulting in a tax at the margin without generating additional revenue. The medical device fee and branded drug fee are not deductible and imposed as a fixed amount with apportionment, creating a tax at the margin. H.R. 3590 also includes a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities, generating $2.7 billion over 10 years. H.R. 3590 imposes a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities, expected to raise $2.7 billion over 10 years. The bill also discussed but did not include a provision for taxing cosmetic producers. The tax is in the form of a standard excise tax, potentially absorbed by providers. The tax imposed on indoor tanning facilities is effectively deductible by providers. Charitable hospitals receive benefits such as tax exemptions and eligibility for tax-exempt bond financing based on their community benefit standard. Concerns exist about the level of charity care provided by nonprofit hospitals justifying their tax-exempt status. The Congressional Budget Office found that nonprofit hospitals provided slightly more charity care than for-profit hospitals. The benefits of federal tax exemptions for nonprofit hospitals were estimated to be around $6 billion in 2002. The Senate Finance Committee held hearings on charitable care and community benefits at nonprofit hospitals. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated federal tax exemptions for nonprofit hospitals at $6 billion in 2002. Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee held hearings on charitable care and community benefits at nonprofit hospitals. Senator Grassley raised concerns about nonprofit hospitals' charity care, community benefits, and asset conversion. In July 2007, Senator Grassley raised concerns about nonprofit hospitals, including charity care, community benefits, asset conversion, governance, and billing practices. An IRS report found that the median share of revenues spent on charity care was 3.9% for nonprofit hospitals. In July 2007, Grassley authorized a round-table to discuss the draft. An IRS report on nonprofit hospitals found that the median share of revenues spent on charity care was 3.9%, with almost half of hospitals spending 3% or less. The average nonprofit hospital spent 7.4% of revenues on charity care. Concerns were raised about the lack of specific standards for charity care qualification for exempt status. The proposal aims to establish specific standards for nonprofit hospitals to qualify for exempt status based on a community needs standard and a minimum level of charitable patient care. This could potentially increase charity care levels without significantly impacting revenues. Flexible spending accounts (FSAs) allow for tax reductions to fund certain benefits chosen by employees. The provision aims to increase charity care levels without major revenue impact by allowing reductions in taxable income through Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) under a cafeteria plan. Concerns include potential limits on contributions or their elimination to raise revenue. Options for raising revenue include limits to the amounts contributed or eliminating contributions to Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) under cafeteria plans. Concerns about these plans include the \"use it or lose it\" nature, with forfeited amounts at the end of the year. Both the House and Senate bills limit these arrangements to $2,500, with H.R. 3590 indexing amounts by the CPI after 2011. The cost of over-the-counter medication does not count for itemized purposes. The House and Senate bills limit Flexible Spending Account contributions to $2,500, indexed by CPI after 2011. Over-the-counter medication costs are not deductible for itemized purposes but are covered by health savings accounts. This aligns eligible spending for employer accounts with itemized deduction rules. The provision in both the House and Senate bills aligns eligible spending for employer accounts with itemized deduction rules, disallowing tax-excludible expenditures on over-the-counter medication like aspirin. Individuals can deduct medical expenses above 7.5% of adjusted gross income, costing $10.7 billion per year, benefiting those with high medical costs relative to income, especially those without insurance or facing uncovered costs like mental health and dental care. The medical expense deduction allows taxpayers to deduct medical expenses above 7.5% of adjusted gross income, costing $10.7 billion per year. It benefits individuals with high medical costs relative to income, particularly those without insurance or facing uncovered costs like mental health and dental care. This deduction is claimed by about 12 million taxpayers, or about 9% of tax returns, and tends to be more beneficial to middle-class taxpayers compared to other itemized deductions. The medical expense deduction is more beneficial to middle-class taxpayers compared to other itemized deductions. IRS statistics show that higher-income groups claim a smaller percentage of this deduction. Despite potential drawbacks like encouraging individuals to forego insurance, retaining the deduction is supported by its subsidy effect depending on the individual's tax rate. The Senate bill increases the medical expense deduction floor to 10%, with a special 7.5% floor for individuals aged 65 and older. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, along with other tax-exempt companies from 1986, are eligible for a 25% deduction of claims and expenses exceeding surplus. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, along with other tax-exempt companies from 1986, are eligible for a special deduction of 25% of claims and expenses exceeding surplus. This provision, which amounts to a revenue loss of about $1 billion annually, was introduced in 1986 to replace a general tax exemption. In 1986, Blue Cross and Blue Shield lost their tax exemptions due to their activities being deemed similar to commercial insurance. They now receive special benefits as a substitute, including a 25% deduction on claims and expenses exceeding surplus, resulting in a $1 billion annual revenue loss. The Obama Administration proposed disallowing these benefits for firms with premiums exceeding 85% of claims. The Obama Administration proposed disallowing tax benefits for firms with premiums exceeding 85% of claims, aiming to address the tax provision benefiting shareholders. The new compromise proposal modifies the revenue provisions of the bill, including delaying the effective date of the tax on high-cost health insurance plans from 2013 to 2018 and raising the exemption amount to $27,500. The new proposal delays the tax on high-cost health insurance plans from 2013 to 2018 and raises the exemption amount to $27,500 for families and $10,200 for individuals. To offset the revenue loss, the proposal broadens the Medicare HI tax for high-income taxpayers. Specifically, it increases the HI tax rate to 2.35% for married couples earning more than $250,000 and individuals earning more. The President's proposal broadens the Medicare HI tax for high-income taxpayers by imposing a 0.9% increase on the HI tax rate to 2.35% for certain earners. Additionally, a 2.9% assessment on unearned income would apply to those earning above specified thresholds. The proposal also includes revenue provisions from the House-passed H.R. 3962. The President's compromise proposal includes revenue provisions from the House-passed H.R. 3962, clarifying that certain liquid byproducts are not eligible for a biofuel tax credit and seeking to codify the economic substance doctrine. The reduction in the tax on high-cost insurance decreases revenue from $148.9 billion to $32 billion. The President's proposal includes codifying the economic substance doctrine and implementing a Medicare tax on high-income taxpayers' investment income. The revenue gain is increased from $86.8 billion to $210.2 billion. The House passed H.R. 3590 and H.R. 4872, with the President expected to sign the bill on March 23. Amounts paid by firms for employee health insurance are excluded from wages. The Senate bill, H.R. 3590, is expected to be signed by the President on March 23. The House also passed H.R. 4872, which is now being considered by the Senate. Health insurance benefits paid by firms for employees are excluded from taxes and can include group insurance, self-insurance, and cafeteria plans. Contributions can be made through health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts. Employees can choose health coverage as part of a cafeteria plan, with deductible contributions through health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts. These expenses can be excluded from taxable income, with options to cap the exclusion for employer-supplied health insurance. The Senate Finance Committee's revenue options in May 2009 included proposals for limits based on benchmark plans or income. The Finance Committee in May 2009 discussed revenue options, including proposals to limit the employer exclusion for health insurance. The Advisory Panel on Tax Reform suggested a cap based on average insurance costs. The employer exclusion is a significant tax benefit, costing $132.7 billion in 2008 according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. The committee is interested in health-related financing options. The employer exclusion for health insurance is a significant tax benefit, costing $132.7 billion in 2008 according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Additional tax revenue losses from the exclusion from the payroll tax amount to $93.5 billion. The Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center estimated these amounts to be $144.8 billion and $95.7 billion in 2010, growing at an average of about 8% per year. A cap on the employer exclusion would only recover part of this revenue. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that capping health benefits at the 75th percentile of employer health insurance costs in 2009 could generate significant revenue, reaching $14 billion in 2010, $25 billion in 2011, and continuing to rise. This amount represents about 10% of the total revenue lost from tax exemptions related to income and payroll taxes. The revenue from a cap would depend on whether it is indexed or not. The revenue from capping health benefits at the 75th percentile of employer health insurance costs in 2009 could reach $14 billion in 2010, $25 billion in 2011, and continue to increase. This amount represents about 10% of the total revenue lost from tax exemptions related to income and payroll taxes. The revenue generated from the cap depends on whether it is indexed and the type of inflation it is indexed for. If not indexed, it could raise $18.2 billion in 2010 and grow at an average rate of 32% to reach $226.5 billion in 2019. If indexed for general price inflation, it would raise $17.4 billion in 2010, grow at a rate of 29.2%, and raise $174.6 billion. A cap based on average health insurance costs in 2009 could raise $18.2 billion in 2010, growing at a rate of 32% to reach $226.5 billion in 2019. If indexed for general price inflation, it would raise $17.4 billion in 2010, growing at a rate of 29.2% to reach $174.6 billion in 2019. If indexed for health price inflation, it would raise $10.2 billion in 2010, growing at a rate of 9.8% to reach $23.6 billion in 2019. A cap at the 90th percentile could raise $4.9 billion in 2010, rising to $188.8 billion in 2019 if not indexed; $4.6 billion rising to $130.7 billion if indexed to general price inflation; and $2.4 billion in 2010, growing to $5.8 billion by 2019 if indexed. A cap at the 90th percentile could raise $4.9 billion in 2010, increasing to $188.8 billion in 2019 if not indexed; $4.6 billion rising to $130.7 billion if indexed to general price inflation; and $2.4 billion in 2010, growing to $5.8 billion by 2019 if indexed to health price inflation. Caps need to be indexed to health price inflation for a steady revenue stream. The employer exclusion is criticized for favoring high-income employees and incentivizing excessive purchases. The employer exclusion in health care has been criticized for favoring high-income employees and incentivizing excessive insurance purchases, leading to increased demand for health care and higher costs. Higher-income individuals benefit more from this exclusion due to their higher marginal tax rates. The tax advantages of employer health care insurance are greater for high-income individuals due to their higher marginal tax rates. The payroll-tax exclusion benefits are not as targeted towards higher-income families. Payroll taxes are flat rate taxes, with the Social Security portion subject to an income cap. The payroll-tax exclusion benefits are not as targeted towards higher-income families. Payroll taxes are flat rate taxes, with the Social Security portion subject to an income cap. The excluded income in the form of health insurance benefits is not likely to rise with an individual's income because group plans provide the same coverage for everyone in the group. This suggests that the tax benefit might not rise as a percentage of income, making the additional burden from repealing the tax benefit not necessarily progressive. The tax benefit from the payroll-tax exclusion is not necessarily progressive, as it is proportional to income across much of the population. The tax effects as a percentage of income are highest in the middle income brackets, suggesting a relatively constant tax change. The tax benefit from the payroll-tax exclusion is proportional to income across the middle income brackets, with smaller burdens on lower- and higher-income taxpayers. Repealing the exclusion may not directly correlate with the average size of health insurance benefits. The average tax increase from repealing the exclusion cannot be directly tied to the average size of the health insurance benefit package. The exclusion reduces adverse selection in the health care market by covering 62% of employer health insurance. The exclusion of $15,000 reduces adverse selection in the health care market by covering 62% of employer health insurance. Concerns exist that altering tax subsidies may reduce employer participation. A cap on the exclusion could address the issue of purchasing more insurance than necessary. A cap on the exclusion of employer-provided health insurance could address the problem of purchasing more insurance than necessary. However, determining includable income for tax purposes and assigning income to employees could lead to inequities and administrative burdens. Economic costs of health insurance vary by location and employee groups. To impose a cap on the exclusion of employer-provided health insurance, income must be assigned to employees reflecting the true economic costs. These costs vary by location, number of individuals covered, age, sex, health status, benefits generosity, and provider network. Employer plans involve implicit cost shifting, where the young may subsidize the old and small families may subsidize large ones, affecting premiums based on group characteristics. Employer-provided health insurance involves implicit cost shifting, with the young subsidizing the old and small families subsidizing large ones. Group characteristics affect premiums for insurance purchased by firms and claims for self-insured firms. Varying insurance benefits by health status goes against risk-sharing objectives, but variations by family coverage, age, and location are legitimate considerations. Age variations may not be included in most proposals. The variation in income by health status may not align with the risk-sharing goal of insurance. Factors like family size, age, and location are important to consider. While most proposals suggest variations by family coverage, age variations may not be common. Imputing income based on age could lead to higher costs for older individuals and shift the burden towards higher incomes. However, not varying income imputations by age could better reflect lifetime benefits. Imputing income based on age for health benefits may lead to higher costs for older individuals and shift the burden towards higher incomes. However, not varying income imputations by age could better reflect lifetime benefits but may discourage younger individuals with lower incomes from participation and create inequities across employees. Imputing income based on age for health benefits may lead to inequities across employees due to differences in average premiums for firms with older workers or other characteristics. Adjustments for these factors could add to administrative burden. The exclusion of benefits in income could be set under the same rules as COBRA benefits, with options for reformulation as a deduction, credit, or a combination of the two to equalize treatment across taxpayers of different incomes. The Senate Finance Committee options document suggests reformulating the exclusion of benefits as a deduction, credit, or a combination of the two to equalize treatment across taxpayers of different incomes. An alternative to complex benefit allocation for employees could be restricting deductions for employers, reducing or eliminating the deduction available for fringe benefits and wages. One option to equalize treatment across taxpayers of different incomes is to restrict deductions for employers, reducing or eliminating the deduction available for fringe benefits and wages. This approach could raise revenues and discourage excessively generous health insurance packages. The Senate Finance Committee's report listed various health-related income tax expenditures, including the second-largest tax expenditure of $40.6 billion from excluding Medicare benefits from income for tax purposes. Excluding medical benefits for military dependents and retirees, totaling $3.3 billion, was not included in the options due to administrative challenges. The JCT estimated the tax expenditure at $40.6 billion for excluding Medicare benefits from income for tax purposes. Excluding medical benefits for military dependents and retirees ($3.3 billion) was not considered due to administrative challenges. Health savings accounts allow tax-deductible contributions and tax exclusions for medical expenses, with a 10% additional tax on non-medical distributions. Health savings accounts (HSAs) offer tax advantages such as exclusions for contributions from employers and tax-free investment earnings. Contributions have a dollar cap, and distributions for non-medical purposes are subject to a 10% additional tax. HSAs cost about $0.5 billion per year in foregone taxes, with expected growth. They allow individuals to purchase insurance against catastrophic costs while reducing the incentive to overspend on healthcare. Health savings accounts (HSAs) allow individuals to purchase insurance against catastrophic costs while reducing the incentive to overspend on healthcare. The Finance Committee options paper discusses limiting contributions under high deductible health plans and increasing penalties for non-medical uses of HSAs. Distributions from an HSA would only be tax-exempt for medical costs if substantiated by the employer or a third party. The Finance Committee options paper proposes limiting contributions under high deductible health plans and increasing penalties for non-medical uses of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Distributions from an HSA would only be tax-exempt for medical costs if substantiated by the employer or a third party, and HSA contributions would be subject to a general employer cap. The scope of FICA tax exceptions for students, especially medical residents, has been a subject of uncertainty. The Senate Finance Committee proposal aims to clarify FICA tax exceptions for students, including medical residents, by codifying recent regulations and establishing a dollar limit for the exception. It also extends Medicare coverage and associated taxes to all state and local employees. The Senate Finance Committee proposal aims to clarify FICA tax exceptions for students and extend Medicare coverage to all state and local employees, increasing HI taxes and eventually leading to higher Medicare costs. The Senate Finance Committee proposal includes provisions to increase HI taxes, which would lead to higher Medicare costs. The proposal discusses increasing taxes on alcoholic beverages and sugared beverages, as well as potential increases in tobacco taxes. The tax was recently increased substantially to finance the state children's health insurance program. Alcoholic beverage taxes vary by type, with distilled spirits taxed at $13.50 per proof gallon, beer at $18 per barrel, and wine taxed by type. Alcohol taxes vary by type, with beer taxed at $18 per barrel and distilled spirits at $13.50 per proof gallon. Wine is taxed based on alcohol content, with ordinary table wine taxed at $1.07 per gallon for up to 14% alcohol. The last revision of alcohol taxes was in 1991, and their real value has decreased over time due to inflation. The alcohol taxes were last revised in 1991, with the rate on distilled spirits at $13.50 per gallon. If adjusted for inflation, it would be around $19.60 currently. Alcohol has health and societal costs, including implications in auto accidents. Studies show that the external costs of alcohol exceed current taxes, and consumption is somewhat responsive to price changes. Alcohol taxes, like tobacco taxes, are regressive and impose larger external costs than current taxes. Consumption is somewhat responsive to price changes. Distributional data on federal excise taxes is outdated, with the latest from a 1990 study. Expenditures on alcoholic beverages as a percentage of income by quintile are shown in Table 2. There is limited current distributional data on the effects of federal excise taxes, with the latest data from a 1990 study. The burden of alcohol taxes is expected to be more concentrated in lower income classes due to the purchase of more expensive alcohols by higher income classes. The regressivity of alcohol taxes is suggested by expenditure data, as higher income classes tend to buy more expensive alcohols. The unit tax nature of excise taxes makes them more regressive than sales taxes. The proposal aims to increase taxes on alcohol, making them more regressive than sales taxes. This change would affect individuals who consume alcohol socially and responsibly, leading to horizontal inequity. The tax on beer and wine would be raised to match that on distilled spirits, with the distilled spirits tax increasing to $16. The proposal aims to increase taxes on alcohol to make them more regressive, affecting socially responsible consumers. Taxes on beer and wine would match those on distilled spirits, with the distilled spirits tax increasing to $16. The proposal aims to increase taxes on alcohol, with projected revenue increases of $5.7 billion per year. Distilled spirits would see an 18.5% tax increase, wine a 225% increase, and beer a 148% increase. This would result in a total excise tax increase of $8.1 billion, offset by reductions in income tax revenues. The proposal aims to increase taxes on beer by 148% or $5 billion, resulting in a projected revenue increase of $5.7 billion per year. Price elasticity estimates suggest that beer consumption is not highly responsive to price, with a 10% increase leading to a 1.6% decrease in consumption. The elasticity estimates for alcohol consumption show that beer has an elasticity of 0.16, wine 0.58, and spirits 0.39. The total sales of alcohol are $187.6 billion, with beer at $99.3 billion, spirits at $61.1 billion, and wine at $27.2 billion. If prices increase by 5% for beer, 8.1% for wine, and 1.5% for spirits, consumption is projected to decrease by 0.8% for beer, 4.7% for wine, and 0.6% for spirits. The proposal includes a tax on non-diet sweetened beverages, with estimates suggesting it could raise about $1.5 billion. Elasticity estimates for alcohol consumption show decreases in beer, wine, and spirits consumption if prices rise by 5% for beer, 8.1% for wine, and 1.5% for spirits. Older estimates were slightly higher, indicating larger decreases in consumption. The proposal includes a tax on non-diet sweetened beverages, with estimates suggesting it could raise about $1.5 billion per year. The tax rates discussed were one cent per 12-ounce can or one cent per ounce, potentially raising about $17 billion annually. Concerns were raised about the regressive nature of the tax and the singling out of this particular food source for taxation. The tax on non-diet sweetened beverages is likely to be regressive and has raised concerns about singling out this particular food source for taxation. Individual taxpayers may choose to take standard deductions or itemize deductions, including certain taxes, home mortgage interest, charitable contributions, medical expenses, and casualty losses. The largest share of itemized deductions are for mortgage interest (36%) and taxes (35%), with income taxes making up almost 60% of the total. Charitable contributions account for about 15% of the total deductions. President Obama's tax proposals include changes to deductions. President Obama's tax proposals aim to cap the value of itemized deductions for the top two tax rates at 28%, which would generate around $25 billion in revenue by FY2012. Itemized deductions primarily benefit one-third of taxpayers, with mortgage interest and taxes being the largest deductions, followed by charitable contributions. When the 2001 tax cuts expire in 2010, tax rates will rise to 36% and 39.5%. This provision is expected to raise about $25 billion in revenues by FY2012, primarily affecting high-income taxpayers in the top 2% of incomes. Itemized deductions benefit one-third of taxpayers, with the value increasing with the marginal tax rate. The proposal aims to increase taxes on high-income taxpayers, particularly those with incomes over $250,000. The $200,000-to-$500,000 income class makes up 11.4% of itemized deductions, while the $500,000-and-over income class accounts for 14.6%. These taxpayers likely contribute around one-fifth of itemized deductions, with the $500,000-and-above class representing about 4%. The $500,000-and-above income class accounts for about 4% of mortgage interest deductions, 3% of property taxes deductions, and 32% of charitable contributions deductions. Concerns were raised about the impact on charitable contributions, with studies suggesting a modest 1% reduction in giving. The major issue surrounding the proposals is the potential effect on charitable contributions, with studies suggesting a modest 1% reduction in giving. This small effect is due to the limit on the tax benefit of the deduction and limited behavioral responses, affecting charitable objectives favored by higher-income individuals more than others. Charitable giving could be affected by proposals to limit tax deductions, with higher-income individuals favoring health, art, and education causes over religious or welfare organizations. Excluding deductions from the cap may sacrifice a quarter of expected revenue gain. Other suggestions include limiting all itemized deductions to 15%, projected to raise $141 billion in 2011. President Obama proposes additional base-broadening measures. Burman suggests limiting all itemized deductions to 15%, projected to raise $141 billion in 2011. President Obama proposes base-broadening provisions to increase compliance and raise revenue for health care reform. These tax provisions are expected to result in about $1 billion of revenue gain when fully implemented. The tax provisions aim to reduce the tax gap and increase compliance, resulting in about $1 billion in revenue gain when fully implemented. Another set of provisions includes revisions affecting financial institutions, tax accounting methods, and estate tax, raising around $5 billion to $6 billion per year. The largest revenue loss comes from restrictions on valuation discounts. The second set of provisions in the estate tax aims to limit valuation discounts, generating $5 billion to $6 billion annually. Key provisions include restrictions on valuation discounts for family-owned assets, modification of corporate-owned life insurance, and repeal of a certain inventory valuation method. The repeal of a certain inventory valuation method caused a rise in revenue to almost $2 billion, followed by a decline to $0.3 billion. Various income tax provisions could generate additional revenues, such as rate increases, widening rate brackets, and increasing tax rates on favored income items. One suggestion is to reduce the indexing of rate brackets to CPI minus 1% instead of CPI. Burman suggests reducing rate bracket indexing to CPI minus 1% instead of CPI to account for cost of living changes. This could raise $8 billion in 2010 and $50 billion in 2019, growing over time to help finance healthcare. Other proposals include increasing capital gains tax and taxing carried interest as ordinary income. Shea proposed increasing the capital gains tax, taxing carried interest as ordinary income, reforming international tax enforcement, and repealing LIFO inventories. Revenue estimates from the Treasury's \"Greenbook\" show that these measures could raise significant funds, with capital gains and dividends tax rate hikes raising $5 billion, carried interest tax generating $3 billion, and LIFO repeal bringing in $6 billion. The revenue from international reforms would vary depending on the changes made. The Treasury's \"Greenbook\" proposes raising tax rates on capital gains and dividends to raise $5 billion, taxing carried interest could generate $3 billion, and repealing LIFO inventories would bring in $6 billion. International tax reforms in the President's proposal could raise over $20 billion. Increasing payroll taxes, including raising rates or the earnings ceiling, could generate around $100 billion annually. Eliminating the Social Security earnings cap could raise $84 billion. One option for raising revenue is to implement a 10% value added tax (VAT) proposed by Burman, which could generate $600 billion. Another possibility is a carbon tax or utilizing auction revenue from cap and trade carbon emissions. One option for raising revenue is to implement a 10% value added tax (VAT) proposed by Burman, which could generate $600 billion. Another possibility is a carbon tax or utilizing auction revenue from cap and trade carbon emissions. However, implementing a new tax like VAT may not be worth the administration and compliance costs, and transitioning to a carbon tax or cap and trade system would also pose challenges. Implementing a carbon tax or cap and trade system for revenue generation may not be worth the administration and compliance costs. Transitioning to these systems would involve various challenges and important program issues that need to be settled. The taxes would also be regressive in nature. Table A-1 provides a comparative list of revenue provisions in H.R. 3962 and H.R. 3590, along with provisions enacted into law in P.L. 111-148 and P.L. 111-152."
