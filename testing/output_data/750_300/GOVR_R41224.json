    "content": "The changing structure of U.S. agriculture has raised concerns about reduced competition in various agricultural markets, including dairy. Key issues in the dairy industry include consolidation and industry concentration. The Administration announced workshops to address competition issues in agriculture, with a specific workshop on the dairy industry scheduled for June 25, 2010 in Madison, WI. The USDA and Department of Justice will hold public workshops on competition issues in agriculture, including the dairy industry. A workshop on the dairy industry is set for June 25, 2010, in Madison, WI. The report discusses financial stress for dairy farmers, historical development, farm and retail prices, and industry consolidation. The curr_chunk discusses the historical development of the dairy industry, movements in farm and retail prices for milk and dairy products, industry structure in terms of consolidation and concentration, economic effects of consolidation, U.S. antitrust law, and financial stress in the dairy industry in 2009. In 2009, the U.S. dairy industry faced financial stress due to lower milk prices, leading to government support of over $1 billion. Despite this assistance, the number of dairy farms decreased by 3% to 65,000 by the end of the year. In October 2009, the U.S. government provided $350 million in supplemental payments and purchased dairy products for domestic feeding programs. Despite this support, the number of dairy farms decreased by 3% to 65,000 by the end of 2009. Milk production declined, but foreign demand for dairy products increased, raising average farm milk prices to $15.10 per hundredweight in March 2010. Financial concerns persist for dairy farmers. The demand for dairy products increased, raising average farm milk prices to $15.10 per hundredweight in March 2010. Financial concerns remain for dairy farmers due to lost farm equity and high feed prices. Industry and Congress are exploring options to manage milk price fluctuations and income for dairy farmers. The dairy industry and Congress are considering options to address fluctuations in milk prices and income for farmers, as well as issues of consolidation and concentration in the industry. The U.S. dairy industry has evolved over the last 100 years to become a national market. The U.S. dairy industry has evolved over the last 100 years from local producing areas to a national market, with advancements in milk marketing and government intervention shaping its early history. The U.S. dairy industry evolved from local to national markets, with milk being sent to processors for urban areas. Producers formed cooperatives to bargain with milk handlers, leading to the Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 providing antitrust exemption for farmers. In the early 1900s, dairy farmers turned to cooperatives for collective bargaining with milk buyers, offsetting handler market power. The Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 granted limited antitrust exemption to farmer cooperatives. By 1925, handlers paid farmers based on milk use (fluid or manufactured products) through \"classified pricing.\" This system broke down during the Great Depression when demand plummeted. During the Great Depression, the classified pricing system for milk broke down due to a sharp drop in demand. Federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) were established to stabilize the market, equalize the power between dairy farmers and processors, and ensure consumers had access to milk at reasonable prices. Import quotas on dairy products were also enacted to protect producers from foreign competition. During World War II, demand for farm commodities, including milk, increased. In the late 1940s, the government supported milk prices through the Dairy Product Price Support Program. In 1985, the Dairy Export Incentives Program was added to national dairy policy. Advancements in milk marketing have transformed the U.S. dairy industry over the last century, with programs like the Dairy Product Price Support Program, Dairy Export Incentives Program, and Milk Income Loss Contract playing key roles. Milk was transported by truck and rail in the early 20th century. Advancements in milk marketing have dramatically changed the U.S. dairy industry over the last century. Raw milk was transported by truck and rail in the early 20th century to processing plants in various markets like New York, Boston, and Chicago. Home delivery of milk was common, emphasizing the local production and consumption of fluid milk. Advancements in milk marketing in the early 20th century led to the transition from home delivery to retail sales in stores, facilitated by improved transportation infrastructure. This shift transformed the fluid milk market from local to national in the latter half of the 20th century. The dairy industry transitioned from local to national markets in the latter half of the 20th century due to improved transportation infrastructure and advancements in milk marketing. Retail milk sales in stores became prevalent, with bulk milk now being transported long distances by tanker trucks to meet market demands. Dairy manufacturing plants ship products like cheese, yogurt, and flavored milk across the country to food distribution centers. The dairy industry has transitioned to national markets with products like cheese, yogurt, and flavored milk being shipped to food distribution centers. There has been a long-standing issue regarding the relationship between farm and retail prices, with concerns raised about the slow decline in retail food prices compared to falling farm prices in late 2008. This has led to questions about the economic stress on dairy farmers and the farm value share in recent decades. In recent decades, factors like increased productivity, demand for value-added products, and changes in food marketing have led to a decline in the farm share of the retail food dollar, causing concern among Congress about economic stress in the agricultural sector, especially for dairy farmers. The farm share of the retail food dollar for all farm products was 41% in 1950. The farm share of the retail food dollar for all farm products was 41% in 1950, but in 2006, the average farm-value share of all U.S. farm-origin food consumed was 18.5%. Marketing factors like labor, packaging, profit, transportation, and energy accounted for the remaining 81.5%. The farm share for milk and dairy products is approximately one-third of the retail dollar. The farm share of the retail price for milk and dairy products is around one-third of the total, influenced by various marketing factors. The trend for farm share remained relatively flat between 2000 and 2008, with slight increases seen in cheddar cheese. Between 2000 and 2008, the farm-share trend for milk and dairy products remained flat, with slight increases in cheddar cheese. In 2008 and early 2009, there was a decline in the farm-value share of retail product values, leading to a widening marketing margin. The farm price of milk fell by $0.33 per gallon, while the retail price only dropped by $0.28, resulting in a marketing margin increase to $2.35 per gallon. The USDA reported a $0.33 decrease in farm milk prices per gallon, leading to a $2.35 marketing margin compared to retail prices. In January 2009, the difference between retail and farm milk prices hit a record high of $2.43 per gallon. By December 2009, the margin had decreased to $1.69 per gallon, below the five-year average. Retailers lowered prices due to lower input costs, resulting in a sharp decline in the farm-retail price difference. In December, the farm-retail price difference for milk dropped to $1.69 per gallon, more than $0.25 below the recent five-year average margin. Retailers reduced prices due to lower input costs, leading to a sharp decline in the price difference. Retail price adjustments to farm price changes typically take months to occur. Price dynamics in food markets show that retail prices respond slowly to changes in farm prices, with adjustments upward happening quickly but decreases in farm prices taking longer to reflect in retail prices. This phenomenon, known as \"sticky\" retail food prices, is influenced by consumer behavior and store preferences. Retail prices respond slowly to changes in farm prices, with adjustments upward happening quickly but decreases in farm prices taking longer to reflect in retail prices. Consumer behavior, store preferences, and competition effects of supermarket services can limit retail price adjustments fully to downward farm price movements. This does not necessarily imply abnormal market power by the retailer. Recent economic research suggests that supermarket services can attract less price-sensitive consumers, leading to a disconnect between farm and retail prices. Retail stores offering additional services may charge more for products like milk. Consolidation in agriculture, including the dairy sector, has resulted in fewer but larger operations. Consolidation in agriculture, including the dairy sector, has led to fewer and larger operations along the production and marketing chain. Larger operations have lower costs, making them more competitive and able to increase market share. This trend results in fewer dairy farms needed to produce the same amount of milk. Consolidation in the dairy sector has led to fewer farms needed to produce the same amount of milk. Firm size is a limiting factor for growth once economies of scale have been maximized. Operations at the farm level and cooperative/processor level continue to decline to offset market power of large retailers. The dairy industry has seen increased concentration at both the cooperative/processor level and in terms of the number of firms controlling sales. This trend is driven by advancements in dairy farm technology, leading to a significant reduction in the number of dairy farms over time. Advancements in dairy farm technology and management have significantly reduced the number of dairy farms, with annual losses decreasing over the years. Despite the drop in dairy farm operations, total milk production has steadily increased due to higher productivity per cow. Domestic demand for milk and milk products has grown slowly, with rising consumption of dairy products like cheese offsetting the decline in dairy farms. The number of dairy farms and cows has decreased due to advancements in technology and management. However, total milk production has increased steadily. Domestic demand for milk and milk products has grown slowly, with cheese consumption offsetting the decline in fluid milk products. Exports of dairy products have reached record levels in recent years. Farm numbers have varied depending on size, with smaller farms experiencing declines while larger farms have increased, driven by lower production costs. In 2005-2009, dairy farms with fewer than 500 cows declined, while farms with 500-999 cows remained steady. Farms with 1,000+ cows increased by 20% due to lower production costs. Costs for larger farms were significantly lower than smaller operations. The industry structure is characterized by the volume of milk produced by farms of different sizes. In 2009, farms with 1,000+ cows accounted for 47% of U.S. milk output. In 2009, the largest portion of U.S. milk output (47%) was produced on farms with 1,000 head or more, while small farms (fewer than 100 head) accounted for only 16% of the total. Larger dairy farms enjoy \"scale economies\" from the use of large and highly automated milking parlors and feed delivery systems. Large dairy farms in the U.S. have increased their share of milk output, with farms of 1,000 head or more producing 47% of the total in 2009. These farms benefit from scale economies due to automation in milking parlors and feed delivery systems, reducing housing costs and improving labor efficiency. Farm sizes vary by region, with western states like California having larger farms with 850 cows on average, while Wisconsin has smaller farms with an average of 88 cows. The national average farm size is 133 cows. The structure of dairy farms varies by region in the U.S. Large farms in the western states, like California, have an average of 850 cows per farm, while Wisconsin has smaller farms with an average of 88 cows. Operating costs in western states have been affected by high feed costs, but overhead costs are relatively low due to the large number of animals. Affected by high feed costs in recent years, dairy farms in western states purchase much of their feed, leading to record levels of alfalfa and grain prices in 2008. However, overhead costs are relatively low as they can be spread over a large number of animals. In regions like Wisconsin where producers feed grain and hay produced on the farm, operating costs tend to be lower when feed prices rise. Farmer-owned dairy cooperatives often operate a complete milk distribution system, procuring raw milk from members for processing and distribution. Dairy cooperatives, owned by farmers, manage milk distribution and product manufacturing. The number of cooperatives has been declining since the 1940s as they merge for economic gains. The number of dairy cooperatives has been declining since the 1940s as they merge for economic gains. In 1940-1941, there were over 2,300 cooperatives, accounting for half of farm milk marketings. By 2007, the number had decreased to 155, but their share of farm milk marketings had increased to 83%. The number of dairy cooperatives has decreased over time, with 155 remaining in 2007, but their market share has increased to 83%. Consolidations and alliances have allowed cooperatives to serve large retail customers more efficiently. In 2008, the top four cooperatives marketed 79% of the milk in the US. Consolidation in the retail sector has led to consolidation within cooperatives. In 2008, the top four dairy cooperatives in the US, including Dairy Farmers of America, California Dairies, Land O'Lakes, and Northwest Dairy Association, accounted for 40% of milk production. The National Milk Producers Federation emphasizes the importance of the Capper-Volstead Act in antitrust law. The National Milk Producers Federation highlights the significance of the Capper-Volstead Act in allowing farmers to cooperate and maintain independence. Cooperatives have historically strengthened farmers' bargaining power with milk handlers and advocated for them in federal milk marketing order changes. Some producers argue that cooperatives may not always act in their best interests. The dairy processing industry includes processing milk for consumption and manufacturing dairy products like butter and cheese. Factors affecting processors and manufacturers include changes in demand, technological advancements, and shifts in the retail sector. Some producers believe cooperatives may not always act in their best interests. The dairy processing industry has been affected by changes in demand, technological advancements, and shifts in the retail sector. The number of dairy firms has decreased, with larger plant sizes to meet the demands of high-volume retailers and large restaurant chains. The number of dairy manufacturing plants in the United States has stabilized around 1,100 facilities. The number of dairy manufacturing plants in the United States has stabilized around 1,100 facilities, with the largest dairy processor/manufacturing companies operating 9 to 81 plants. Concentration trends in the industry show a four-firm concentration ratio of 35% for cheese processing and 43% for fluid milk processing in 2002. In 2002, the four-firm concentration ratio was 35% for cheese processing and 43% for fluid milk processing in the dairy manufacturing industry. Compared to other food processing sectors, dairy processing is not unusually concentrated nationally, but local or regional markets may have higher concentration levels. The level of industry concentration in dairy processing, including meatpacking and soybean processing, can vary in local or regional markets. The fluid milk industry saw an increase in concentration after a merger in 2001, but it remains below the average level for selected food manufacturing industries. Cheese manufacturing has a four-firm concentration ratio ranging between 34% and 52%. The retail sector for food products has undergone significant changes in recent years due to price competition from nontraditional food retailers, leading traditional supermarket chains to reassess pricing and product strategies. This has resulted in consolidation in the U.S. grocery industry. The retail sector for food products has seen changes due to competition from nontraditional retailers, leading traditional supermarkets to adjust pricing and product strategies. This has led to consolidation in the U.S. grocery industry, with the top four firms accounting for 36% of national sales by 2005. In the 1990s, the grocery industry saw consolidation with large retailers like Kroger Co., Albertson's, Ahold USA, and Safeway making acquisitions and mergers. National-level concentration ratios are important for food suppliers negotiating sales terms. Local-level concentration is typically higher, with four-firm shares ranging from 63% to 85% in specific market areas in 2003. The grocery industry experienced consolidation in the 1990s with major retailers like Kroger Co., Albertson's, Ahold USA, and Safeway making acquisitions. National-level concentration ratios are crucial for food suppliers. Local-level concentration in specific market areas averaged 74% in 2003, with four-firm shares ranging from 63% to 85%. Dairy industry observers note the impact of retail consolidation and concentration on consumer choices. Local-level concentration is important for consumers as it indicates fewer choices among food stores. Retail consolidation in the dairy industry has led to processors and manufacturers increasing in size and market share to meet retailer demands for lower costs. Concerns about concentration include reduced competition and market power. The concentration of food retailers may reduce competition and result in market power, disadvantaging producers or consumers. However, it can also lead to efficiency gains and cost savings passed on to consumers through lower prices, benefiting farmers. The Government Accountability Office found that economic literature does not provide a clear consensus on the effects of concentration in agricultural industries. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) concluded that concentration in the processing segment of the beef, pork, or dairy sectors, or the retail sector overall has not adversely affected agricultural commodity or retail food prices. Most studies found no evidence of market power, with efficiency effects outweighing market power effects. Experts generally agreed that concentration is not a significant concern. The GAO report found that concentration in dairy processing had little impact on commodity or food prices, with experts predicting potential future increases in concentration. The GAO report reviewed studies on dairy processing concentration, finding that efficiency gains outweigh market power effects. Market power of dairy processors can be balanced by dairy cooperatives. The GAO report reviewed studies on regional retail milk markets, indicating evidence of market power among dairy processors and retailers. Experts predict an increase in market concentration. The GAO report highlighted evidence of market power among retailers in various metropolitan markets. Experts predict an increase in market concentration, leading to fewer retail outlets and potential pressure on food processors to consolidate. This concentration may also impact price transparency. The concentration at the retail level can lead to further consolidation among food processors, as some retailers prefer dealing with larger suppliers. Concerns arise regarding how this concentration affects price transparency in dairy product markets, with fewer transactions leading to weakened market discovery of prices. The move towards a more integrated dairy market with custom contracts and fewer spot market transactions at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has resulted in reduced price discovery. This shift has led to fewer observable transactions, impacting market efficiency and transparency. The move towards a more integrated dairy market with custom contracts and fewer spot market transactions at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has resulted in reduced price discovery. The primary spot market for dairy products at the CME determines wholesale prices used to set monthly minimum prices by USDA for farm milk under federal orders. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is used to establish wholesale price contracts nationwide, with premiums and discounts based on quality and transportation. USDA sets monthly minimum prices for farm milk using wholesale dairy product prices from the CME. Some dairy producer groups criticize the CME for being thinly traded, lacking transparency, oversight, and creating a volatile market that harms producers. The GAO found that the CME spot cheese market is susceptible to manipulation due to a small number of trades and traders. However, industry participants believe any manipulation would be short-lived as large players monitor the market closely and would intervene if prices disconnect from supply and demand. Participants in the cheese and dairy industry closely monitor the market for signs of manipulation. They are prepared to trade if prices deviate from supply and demand conditions, potentially preventing manipulation. Some industry members aim to increase sales volume on the CME to reduce the risk of price manipulation. The CFTC and CME oversee spot market activities for any signs of manipulation, with some industry participants agreeing to pay penalties in December 2008. The CFTC and CME monitor spot market activities for price manipulation. In 2008, dairy industry participants paid penalties for attempting to manipulate milk futures prices. The CME introduced new futures contracts for skimmed milk powder to enhance dairy price transparency. The CME introduced new futures and options contracts for skimmed milk powder to improve dairy price transparency. Some are interested in expanding USDA's price reporting system for dairy products. In the 2008 farm bill, Congress authorized more frequent price reporting for dairy products, subject to appropriations. U.S. antitrust laws focus on competition in markets and prohibit unlawful mergers and business practices. The Sherman Act and the Clayton Act are the two basic antitrust laws in the United States, enforceable by either the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission. The Sherman Act and the Clayton Act are the two main antitrust laws in the United States, enforced by the DOJ or FTC. They prohibit activities that restrain trade and monopolization. The Sherman Act (U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-8) prohibits agreements among firms not to compete, while Section 2 prohibits monopolization. Violations are felonies with fines up to $1 million for individuals and $100 million for corporations. The Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 18) prohibits mergers that may lessen competition. The Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12 et seq.) prohibits mergers or acquisitions that may lessen competition, with fines up to $1 million for individuals and $100 million for corporations. The act also includes \"Merger Guidelines\" issued by DOJ and FTC to analyze mergers and acquisitions. Premerger notification is required under the act. The Clayton Act prohibits mergers that may lessen competition and includes Merger Guidelines issued by DOJ and FTC. These guidelines are being updated to reflect actual practices. Premerger notification allows antitrust agencies to examine potential mergers before they happen. Remedies for unapproved mergers include legal action to stop the merger or conditioning approval on modifications to address antitrust concerns. The DOJ/FTC may seek remedies for unapproved mergers such as legal action to stop the merger or conditioning approval on modifications to address antitrust concerns. Negotiating changes is preferred over going to court due to cost and risk. The Capper-Volstead Act provides limited antitrust exemption for farmer cooperatives. The Capper-Volstead Act grants limited antitrust exemption to farmer cooperatives for joint processing and marketing of agricultural products. This exemption aims to avoid costly and risky court battles, benefiting all parties involved. The Capper-Volstead Act allows agricultural producers to form associations to collectively process and market their products. In 2009, Dean Foods acquired two plants from Foremost Farms, leading to an antitrust lawsuit by the DOJ in 2010. The DOJ and several states filed a civil antitrust suit against Dean Foods in 2010 for violating the Clayton Act by acquiring Foremost Farms. The acquisition eliminated competition in the milk market for schools and grocery chains in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. This move was criticized for hurting school milk and fluid milk purchases. The DOJ and several states filed a civil antitrust suit against Dean Foods in 2010 for acquiring Foremost Farms, which eliminated competition in the milk market for schools and grocery chains in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The acquisition resulted in Foremost Farms losing customers to other processors, leading to aggressive pricing in local markets against Dean Foods. The lawsuit seeks to require Dean Foods to sell the dairy processing plants acquired from Foremost Farms. The lawsuit filed against Dean Foods seeks to force the company to sell the dairy processing plants acquired from Foremost Farms. Dean Foods now holds a 57% market share for processed milk in certain regions, and claims the acquisition complies with antitrust laws, benefiting dairy farmers and consumers through cost savings and increased competition. Dean Foods believes the acquisition complies with antitrust laws and benefits dairy farmers by providing a stable outlet for their milk. The deal has resulted in cost savings for consumers and increased competition in the region. The ongoing case highlights consolidation in the U.S. dairy industry, especially in markets with excess capacity like upper Wisconsin. A class action antitrust complaint was filed against major firms in the Northeast dairy market, including Dairy Farmers of America, Inc., Dairy Marketing Services, Dean Foods, and HP Hood. The lawsuit claims market reasons may make it difficult for smaller firms to compete indefinitely. The lawsuit alleges that major dairy firms, including Dairy Farmers of America, Dairy Marketing Services, Dean Foods, and HP Hood, conspired to control the supply of fluid milk in the Northeast, leading to lower prices for dairy farmers. The lawsuit alleges that Dairy Farmers of America and Dairy Marketing Services, along with Dean Foods and HP Hood, have exclusive supply agreements with dominant processors in the Northeast, leading to lower prices for dairy farmers in the region. The lawsuit alleges that Dean Foods and HP Hood, along with Dairy Farmers of America, have used their market power to the detriment of dairy farmers in the Northeast. DFA claims to have increased returns for farmers through cost-saving efficiencies. Litigation may take years to resolve. The cooperative focuses on increasing producer returns rather than suppressing farmer prices. Litigation involving Dean Foods, National Dairy Holdings, and DFA may take years to resolve. Determining the net effect of concentration on market power and efficiency gains is complex due to various influencing factors. The net effect of market power and efficiency gains in the dairy industry is influenced by various factors such as product differentiation, market entry ease, technology changes, and government policies. It is challenging to determine the impact of concentration on commodity prices due to these complexities."
