    "content": "The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the discovery of Al Qaeda cells in Europe spurred the EU to enhance cooperation in combating terrorism. The EU, a partnership of 28 member states, aims to promote peace and economic prosperity through European integration. Harmonizing policies in \"justice and home affairs\" is a key focus for further integration efforts. The EU aims to promote peace and economic prosperity through European integration. Efforts in the field of justice and home affairs focus on harmonizing policies to enhance internal security, protect fundamental rights, and facilitate free movement within the EU. This includes countering terrorism, police and judicial cooperation, migration and asylum issues, and border control policies for the Schengen area. The EU's Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) policies cover countering terrorism, cross-border crimes, police and judicial cooperation, migration, asylum issues, and border control for the Schengen area. Initially, member states were hesitant to forge common JHA policies due to concerns about national sovereignty and legal systems. However, the 2001 terrorist attacks prompted a shift in mindset among EU leaders and member states towards greater cooperation in the JHA area. The 2001 terrorist attacks prompted a shift in mindset among EU leaders and member states towards greater cooperation in the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) area. European law enforcement efforts post-attacks led to numerous arrests in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, with Germany and Spain identified as key bases for the attacks on the United States. European leaders recognized the need for greater cooperation in the Justice and Home Affairs area after the 2001 terrorist attacks. This led to numerous arrests in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, with Germany and Spain identified as key bases for the attacks on the United States. The EU's open borders and different legal systems allowed terrorists to move around easily and evade arrest and prosecution due to the lack of anti-terrorist legislation in most member states. The 2001 terrorist attacks exposed the lack of anti-terrorist legislation and legal definitions of terrorism in most EU member states. This allowed terrorists to evade apprehension by moving between countries with different laws and codes, making extradition requests lengthy and challenging. EU leaders acknowledged the need for a supportive role in countering terrorism's cross-border nature. After the 2001 attacks, EU leaders recognized the need to harmonize national laws against terrorism and facilitate extradition by establishing common definitions and lists of terrorist groups. The EU took steps to enhance counterterrorism capabilities by establishing common definitions of terrorism, a list of terrorist groups, an EU arrest warrant, tools to combat terrorist financing, and measures to improve border controls and aviation security. They also strengthened Europol and Eurojust to improve intelligence sharing and prosecutorial coordination. Subsequent incidents in Europe further emphasized the need for enhanced EU counterterrorism efforts. The EU bolstered Europol and Eurojust to improve intelligence sharing and prosecutorial coordination in cross-border crimes. The March 2004 bombings in Madrid prompted initiatives to enhance travel document security and impede terrorist travel, leading to the establishment of a Counterterrorism Coordinator to enhance intelligence sharing among EU member states. The Madrid attacks led to initiatives to improve travel document security and impede terrorist travel. The EU established a Counterterrorism Coordinator to enhance intelligence sharing among member states. The July 2005 London bombings raised concerns about \"homegrown\" Islamist extremism in Europe. The London attacks in July 2005 brought the issue of \"homegrown\" Islamist extremism to the forefront of European political debate. The EU adopted its first plan in December 2005 to combat radicalization and terrorist recruitment, focusing on disrupting terrorist networks, promoting mainstream opinions, and ensuring security and opportunity for all. The EU adopted a plan in 2005 to combat radicalization and terrorist recruitment, expanding its definition of terrorism in 2008 to include new criminal offenses. This decision aimed to facilitate the prosecution of individuals involved in terrorist activities. The EU expanded its definition of terrorism in 2008 to include new criminal offenses such as terrorist recruitment, providing training, and public provocation. This decision aimed to facilitate prosecution and counter terrorist propaganda, with the establishment of a Radicalisation Awareness Network in 2011 to connect key groups involved in countering radicalization and violent extremism. The EU established a Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) in 2011 to connect key groups involved in countering radicalization and violent extremism, aiming to enhance EU-wide cooperation against terrorism. However, forging common EU policies remains a work in progress due to national sovereignty concerns and differing views among member states and EU institutions on sensitive issues like data privacy and intelligence sharing. Despite efforts to combat terrorism and cross-border crimes, harmonizing EU policies in the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) field is challenging due to national sovereignty concerns and differing views among member states and EU institutions on issues like data privacy and intelligence sharing. National police and intelligence services are often hesitant to share information with each other or with EU bodies like Europol, complicating efforts to address threats like the Islamic State terrorist organization. EU policymakers are concerned about European citizens joining terrorist groups in the Middle East and North Africa, with up to 5,000 EU citizens estimated to have traveled to fight in Syria and Iraq since 2011. Police and intelligence services face challenges in sharing information with each other and EU bodies like Europol. EU authorities estimate that up to 5,000 EU citizens have traveled to fight in Syria, Iraq, or other conflict zones since 2011. Security services are concerned about the potential danger posed by trained militants returning to Europe and individuals inspired by Islamist extremist propaganda to commit \"lone wolf\" attacks at home. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have heightened these fears. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have raised concerns about individuals inspired by Islamist extremist propaganda to commit \"lone wolf\" attacks at home. These attacks have been linked to the Islamic State or other extremist groups abroad, such as the 2014 killing at the Jewish Museum in Brussels and the 2015 attacks in Paris targeting Charlie Hebdo. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have raised concerns about individuals inspired by Islamist extremist propaganda to commit \"lone wolf\" attacks at home. The attacks include the 2014 killing at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, the 2015 attacks in Paris targeting Charlie Hebdo, and the 2015 shootings in Copenhagen. The February 14-15, 2015, shootings in Copenhagen, Denmark, by a self-radicalized Danish-born citizen of Palestinian descent resulted in two deaths and five wounded police officers. The August 21, 2015, attempted attack on a train from Amsterdam to Paris was thwarted by passengers, including three Americans. The November 13, 2015, coordinated attacks in Paris left 130 dead and over 350 injured, with nine assailants killed. The November 13, 2015, coordinated attacks in Paris left 130 dead and over 350 injured. Authorities have confirmed the identities of seven assailants, who were French or Belgian citizens, with at least six having fought with the Islamic State in Syria-Iraq. European governments have used various tools to combat the foreign fighter threat, with the EU taking a leading role. Recent attacks have exposed weaknesses in European domestic security and border controls. The EU has played a leading role in combating the foreign fighter threat posed by the Islamic State in the Syria-Iraq region. Recent attacks in Europe have revealed weaknesses in domestic security and border controls, with difficulties in monitoring potential assailants and insufficient information sharing among EU countries' law enforcement and intelligence services. Some attackers have exploited the Schengen system and the chaos caused by the influx of migrants and refugees. Recent attacks in Europe have exposed flaws in domestic security and border controls, including inadequate monitoring of potential assailants and limited information sharing among EU countries' law enforcement and intelligence services. Perpetrators have exploited the Schengen system and the turmoil caused by the influx of migrants and refugees. Travel between European countries prior to attacks has been noted, with some individuals moving back and forth between Europe and Syria despite being on the radar of security services. Notably, some attackers entered Europe through Greece as part of the refugee flows. Two Paris attack perpetrators traveled between Europe and Syria despite being known to security services. They entered Europe through Greece with fake Syrian passports. Another suspect entered Belgium from France after the attacks. EU is taking measures to address the foreign fighter phenomenon. The EU is facing challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism and the foreign fighter threat due to issues related to sovereignty and balancing security with human rights. Despite some progress on EU initiatives, the task remains difficult. The EU faces challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism and the foreign fighter threat, balancing security with human rights. Progress has been made on initiatives such as enhancing information sharing among national authorities. EU officials are encouraging national authorities to share information on suspected foreign fighters and utilize common EU databases like the Schengen Information System and Europol's Focal Point Travellers database. Europol launched the European Counter Terrorism Centre in 2016 for information sharing and operational cooperation among member states in monitoring and investigating foreign terrorist fighters. Europol established the European Counter Terrorism Centre in 2016 to facilitate information sharing and cooperation among member states in monitoring and investigating foreign terrorist fighters, illegal firearms trafficking, and terrorist financing. The success of these initiatives relies heavily on receiving information from national authorities, with some experts noting that EU-wide information sharing related to terrorism still falls short. EU officials assert an increase in alerts entered into SIS and information contributed to Europol databases. However, EU-wide information sharing on terrorism is still lacking. The proposal for an EU-wide Passenger Name Record (PNR) system has been stalled in the European Parliament since 2013 due to data privacy concerns. Pressure to adopt the system grew after the 2015 Paris attacks. The 2011 proposal for an EU-wide Passenger Name Record (PNR) system was stalled in the European Parliament since 2013 due to data privacy concerns. Pressure to adopt the system increased significantly after the 2015 Paris attacks, with EU governments emphasizing the need for better information sharing on foreign fighters and tracking terrorist movements. Harmonization across the EU on PNR collection was deemed necessary. The EU PNR proposal aims to identify terrorist suspects by collecting PNR data from airlines for flights into and out of EU territory. Member states will also be allowed to collect PNR data from intra-EU flights and non-carrier economic operators. The proposal is expected to receive final approval in early 2016. The EU PNR proposal, expected to receive final approval in early 2016, will require airlines to provide PNR data for flights into and out of EU territory. Member states can also collect PNR data from intra-EU flights and non-carrier economic operators. Critics argue that the system infringes on data privacy rights, while others believe it does not go far enough in ensuring meaningful data sharing. Critics argue that the EU PNR system infringes on data privacy rights, while others believe it lacks a centralized EU PNR database. EU governments have two years to implement the agreement's provisions, including strengthening external border controls in response to the foreign fighter threat. In response to the foreign fighter threat, EU officials urged national authorities to utilize security tools like electronic checks at external borders under the Schengen Borders Code. Resistance to amending the code for more extensive checks on EU nationals stemmed from concerns about potential reimposition of internal border controls due to the surge of migrants and refugees into Europe. The European Commission proposed a \"targeted modification\" of the Schengen Borders Code to introduce mandatory checks of EU citizens against law enforcement databases at the external borders, in response to the surge of migrants and refugees into Europe and the attacks in Paris. The EU Commission proposed changes to the Schengen Borders Code for mandatory checks of EU citizens at external borders. They also suggested creating a new European Border and Coast Guard to enhance border security. The EU has been working on enhancing border security through joint operations and rapid interventions. Efforts to establish an \"EU border guard corps\" have faced challenges due to concerns about national sovereignty. The EU is also focused on preventing radicalization by monitoring and removing terrorist content online through the Internet Referral Unit and Internet Forum. The EU established an Internet Referral Unit (IRU) in July 2015 to monitor and remove terrorist content online. In December 2015, the EU launched an Internet Forum to collaborate with technology companies in countering terrorist propaganda. Additionally, the EU is urging member states to address societal factors contributing to radicalization and is revising its Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism. The EU is calling on member states to address societal factors in prisons that contribute to radicalization and is revising its Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to criminalize traveling for terrorist purposes and receiving terrorist training throughout the EU. Harmonizing criminal laws in the EU has faced challenges due to varying national policies and concerns about infringing on national legal systems. The EU is revising its Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to criminalize traveling for terrorist purposes and receiving terrorist training throughout the EU. Efforts to harmonize criminal laws in the EU have faced challenges due to varying national policies and concerns about infringing on national legal systems. EU officials argue that updating the common terrorism definition is necessary to comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178. EU officials are updating the common terrorism definition to address gaps in compliance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178. The European Commission proposed revisions in December 2015 to combat the foreign fighter threat, which will be reviewed by EU member states and the European Parliament. This is part of the EU's efforts to enhance law enforcement and intelligence cooperation in combating terrorism since September 11, 2001. The EU is updating the terrorism definition to combat the foreign fighter threat, with the proposal under review by EU member states and the European Parliament. This initiative aims to improve law enforcement and intelligence cooperation with the United States in the fight against terrorism since September 11, 2001. U.S.-EU cooperation has strengthened dialogue on law enforcement and homeland security issues. The EU is updating its terrorism definition to combat the foreign fighter threat, aiming to improve cooperation with the United States in fighting terrorism. U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism has led to a new dynamic in relations, fostering dialogue on law enforcement and homeland security issues. The Obama Administration has supported this partnership in counterterrorism, border controls, and transport security. The Obama Administration has supported U.S. cooperation with the EU in counterterrorism, border controls, and transport security. The EU is a key partner in the Global Counterterrorism Forum. The European Union is a key partner in U.S. counterterrorism efforts, including the Global Counterterrorism Forum. Cooperation has focused on combating the foreign fighter phenomenon. U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation has been addressing the foreign fighter phenomenon, with concerns about European and American Muslims joining Islamist groups in Syria and Iraq. There are worries about European foreign fighters due to visa-free travel arrangements between the U.S. and most EU countries. Attorney General Eric Holder emphasized the need for shared strategies to confront violent extremists from the U.S. and Europe in Syria. In early July 2014, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder highlighted the mutual interest in developing shared strategies with EU countries to address the influx of U.S. and European-born violent extremists in Syria. The White House mentioned close collaboration between U.S. officials and EU counterparts on various measures to enhance counter-radicalization, border security, and aviation security. In September 2014, the White House mentioned collaboration between U.S. and EU officials on measures to enhance counter-radicalization, border security, and aviation security to address the foreign fighter threat. EU countries supported U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178 and are providing support to the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State. To combat the foreign fighter phenomenon worldwide, EU member states are supporting the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State. Following the Paris attacks in January 2015, U.S. and European interior ministers met to discuss terrorist threats. European and EU officials also participated in a conference on countering violent extremism in Washington, DC in February 2015. U.S. officials are urging European governments and the EU to enhance intra-European information sharing due to the EU's open borders. Following the February 2015 conference on countering violent extremism in Washington, DC, U.S. officials have been encouraging European governments and the EU to enhance information sharing within Europe and utilize existing EU-wide databases. President Obama has called on the EU to implement an agreement requiring airlines to share passenger information to improve security measures. Following the 2015 attacks in Paris, President Obama urged the EU to establish an EU PNR system for sharing passenger information to prevent foreign terrorist fighters from entering undetected. Close law enforcement ties with European allies and existing U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements are seen as crucial in combating terrorism, despite some remaining challenges. The importance of close law enforcement ties with European allies and existing U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements, including tracking terrorist financing and sharing airline passenger data, is crucial in combating terrorism. Challenges remain in the U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship, such as data privacy concerns and complications in negotiations on information-sharing agreements. These issues have been exacerbated by unauthorized disclosures of U.S. NSA surveillance activities since June 2013. Other tensions have arisen from detainee policies. The U.S. and EU have had tensions over information-sharing agreements, detainee policies, terrorist designation lists, and border security. Legislation passed in 2015 to strengthen the U.S. Visa Waiver Program has also caused concerns in the EU. The U.S. legislation passed in December 2015 to strengthen the security of the U.S. Visa Waiver Program has raised concerns in the EU. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on police, judicial, and border control policy matters have increased since 2001, playing a crucial role in developing closer U.S.-EU ties. The U.S. Departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security, and the Treasury have been actively engaged in this process. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on police, judicial, and border control policy matters have increased substantially since 2001. The U.S. Departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security, and the Treasury have played a crucial role in developing closer U.S.-EU ties. Meetings at the ministerial level and working groups are held regularly to discuss cooperation against terrorism, terrorist financing, and border and transport security. The United States and the EU have established regular dialogues on terrorist financing, border and transport security, critical infrastructure protection, and preventing violent extremism. Europol has liaison officers in Washington, DC, and the United States has officers stationed at Europol. Europol and U.S. agencies have reciprocal liaison relationships, with Europol having two officers in Washington, DC, and the U.S. stationing 14 officers at Europol headquarters in The Hague. They collaborate on counterterrorism, counterfeiting, and cybercrime cases, leading to operational successes. Since 2006, 14 U.S. federal law enforcement officers have been stationed at Europol headquarters in The Hague, collaborating on approximately 500 cases a year. This partnership has led to operational successes in countering transnational crimes, including a 2014 operation against online \"dark net\" marketplaces. Additionally, a U.S. liaison at Eurojust headquarters facilitates cooperation on terrorism and cross-border criminal cases between European and U.S. prosecutors. Since 2006, a U.S. liaison has worked at Eurojust headquarters in The Hague to enhance cooperation between European and U.S. prosecutors on terrorism and cross-border criminal cases. U.S.-EU efforts against terrorism have resulted in agreements to improve police and judicial cooperation, including sharing strategic and personal information between U.S. law enforcement authorities and Europol. Negotiations between U.S. and EU authorities on sharing personal information proved challenging due to concerns about data protection standards. EU regulations prioritize privacy rights and limit law enforcement access to personal data. Negotiations between the U.S. and EU on data sharing faced challenges due to data protection concerns. In 2007, an agreement was signed to set common standards for classified information security. In 2010, new U.S.-EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance came into force. The U.S. and EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance, signed in 2003, aim to streamline the extradition process, enhance information-sharing, and improve prosecutorial cooperation to combat terrorism and transnational crimes like financial fraud and human trafficking. The U.S. and EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance, signed in 2003, aim to combat terrorism and transnational crimes by enhancing cooperation and streamlining the extradition process. Washington agreed to EU demands that suspects extradited from the EU will not face the death penalty, and the extradition accord modernizes existing bilateral agreements with individual EU members. The EU will not face the death penalty, as it is banned by EU law. U.S. officials have agreed to modernize extradition agreements with individual EU members, allowing for streamlined information exchange and setting rules for priority in extradition requests. The Mutual Legal Assistance treaty will grant U.S. authorities access to European financial information, expedite request processing, allow for evidence acquisition via video conferencing, and permit testimony. The MLA treaty between the United States and EU member states will provide U.S. authorities access to European bank account and financial information in criminal investigations, expedite request processing, allow evidence acquisition by video conferencing, and enable U.S. participation in joint EU investigations. Critics question the need for collaboration with EU-wide bodies due to existing bilateral relations between U.S. agencies and national police and intelligence services in EU member states. Europol is noted to lack enforcement capabilities. Critics doubt the utility of collaborating with EU-wide bodies like Europol, citing existing bilateral relations between U.S. agencies and national services in EU member states. Europol's effectiveness in assessing terrorist threats depends on national services sharing information. European officials criticize the U.S. for expecting intelligence without sharing its own. European opposition to the U.S. death penalty and reluctance to extradite their nationals may hinder cooperation. European officials criticize the U.S. for not sharing intelligence, hindering cooperation. However, most U.S. and European officials are committed to enhancing collaboration with EU law enforcement entities like Europol. In early 2015, new agreements were signed to improve cooperation against foreign fighters and illegal immigration. The United States and the EU have signed agreements to enhance cooperation with Europol against foreign fighters, illegal immigration, and terrorist financing. They work together in global forums to suppress terrorist financing and improve international financial investigative tools. The United States and the EU cooperate with organizations like the United Nations and the Financial Action Task Force to combat terrorist financing. They benefit from an agreement allowing access to financial data through SWIFT for the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, generating leads for investigations and preventing terrorist attacks in Europe. The U.S. Treasury Department's Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) has provided over 7,000 investigative leads for EU governments, aiding in the prevention and investigation of terrorist attacks in Europe. However, the program and the U.S.-EU agreement on sharing SWIFT data face ongoing controversy in Europe due to data privacy concerns. U.S. and EU officials have collaborated successfully since 2001 to address gaps in their lists of terrorist individuals and groups. U.S. and EU officials have worked together since 2001 to bridge gaps in their lists of terrorist individuals and groups, aiming to present a united front and curb terrorist financing. The EU maintains two lists focusing on Al Qaeda, Taliban, and post-9/11 U.N. Security Council sanctions. The EU maintains two lists of terrorist organizations and individuals, one focusing on Al Qaeda and Taliban affiliates, including groups like Jabhat al Nusra, Boko Haram, and ISIS. The second list, known as the \"common terrorist list\" or \"blacklist,\" includes non-Al Qaeda affiliated entities and has been controversial. The EU maintains two lists of terrorist organizations and individuals, one focusing on Al Qaeda and Taliban affiliates, including groups like Jabhat al Nusra, Boko Haram, and ISIS. The second list, known as the \"common terrorist list\" or \"blacklist,\" includes over 80 individuals or entities based in Europe and worldwide, with law enforcement measures varying based on whether they are considered \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. The EU maintains two lists of terrorist organizations and individuals, with law enforcement measures varying based on whether they are considered \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. For \"external\" persons and groups, all EU member states are legally obligated to freeze assets, restrict financial resources, and provide law enforcement assistance. For \"internal\" persons and groups, inclusion on the list triggers similar measures within EU jurisdiction. The EU's common terrorist list requires unanimous agreement among member states to add or remove individuals or entities. National governments typically apply their own sanctions to prevent financing for listed persons and groups. The EU's common terrorist list requires unanimous agreement among member states to add or remove individuals or entities. The United States and other countries have successfully lobbied the EU to add organizations like PKK, FARC, Hamas, and Hezbollah to the list. The EU and the United States have added various organizations like PKK, FARC, Hamas, and Hezbollah to their terrorist designation lists. However, there are occasional tensions in fully aligning the U.S. and EU lists, with the EU hesitating to include certain Hamas-related charities due to differing views among member states. The EU has hesitated to add suspected Hamas-related charities to its terrorist list, as some member states view them as separate entities engaged in political or social work. Charities like Interpal, designated as Hamas fronts by the US, have been cleared by European national authorities. Due to this scrutiny at the national level, it is unlikely that EU governments will blacklist them. EU member states have also been divided on whether Hezbollah should be added to the terrorist list. The EU has hesitated to blacklist suspected Hamas-related charities, as some member states see them as separate entities engaged in political or social work. There is division among EU member states on whether Hezbollah should be included on the terrorist list, with the US considering it a foreign terrorist organization. Some EU countries have supported adding Hezbollah to the EU's common list, while others have opposed it due to concerns about managing relations with Lebanon and Hezbollah's social services in Lebanon's poorest communities. In 2012-2013, there was a debate within the EU on adding Hezbollah to the common terrorist list, following events like the Burgas airport bombing and the conviction of a Hezbollah operative in Cyprus. Some EU member states hesitated due to Hezbollah's role in the Lebanese government and its social services in poor communities. In July 2013, the EU agreed to add Hezbollah's military wing to its common terrorist list due to events like the Burgas airport bombing and the conviction of a Hezbollah operative in Cyprus. In late July 2013, the EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, not the entire organization, in response to support for the Syrian government. This decision was seen as a compromise to avoid destabilizing Lebanon and maintain EU influence in the region. The EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list in 2013, aiming to avoid destabilizing Lebanon and maintain influence in the region. The decision was largely symbolic, sending a message of intolerance towards terrorist attacks within EU borders. The EU designated Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist organization in 2013, sending a symbolic message of intolerance towards terrorist activities. Analysts believed this decision would hinder Hezbollah's legitimacy and operations in Europe, prompting increased intelligence investigations. Critics argued that only listing the military wing was insufficient. EU governments are urged to enhance intelligence investigations into activities linked to Hezbollah's military wing to reduce its operations in Europe. Critics argue that only listing the military wing as a terrorist organization is insufficient, as it still allows Hezbollah to fundraise in Europe. The US has long pushed for the EU to include Hezbollah on its common terrorist list, especially after Bulgaria implicated Hezbollah in the Burgas bombing in 2013. The Obama Administration called on Europe to take proactive action to uncover Hezbollah's infrastructure and disrupt its financing schemes. The Obama Administration urged Europe to take action against Hezbollah following Bulgaria's implicating the group in the Burgas bombing. Members of Congress also called on the EU to add Hezbollah to its terrorist list, with resolutions passed in both the Senate and House. The Obama Administration and Congress urged the EU to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization and impose sanctions. The EU eventually added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, which was seen as a positive step. Data privacy remains a key issue in U.S.-EU cooperation on disrupting terrorist activity. The EU's decision to list Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist organization is welcomed by the US. Data privacy is a key issue in US-EU cooperation on counterterrorism, with the EU emphasizing the protection of personal data as a human right. Privacy regulations in the EU set rules for entities holding personal data and restrict data transfer to countries without adequate legal protections. Concerns have been raised by some EU officials about the US guaranteeing sufficient data protection for European citizens, especially in light of unauthorized disclosures by the NSA. Some Members of the European Parliament and civil liberty groups argue that U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements violate EU citizens' privacy rights. Unauthorized disclosures of NSA surveillance programs and allegations of U.S. collection activities in Europe have strained transatlantic trust and raised concerns about data protection safeguards. The NSA surveillance programs and U.S. collection activities in Europe have strained transatlantic trust and raised concerns about data protection safeguards, leading to worries about the future of U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements. The European Parliament has been vocal in opposing or demanding changes to accords such as SWIFT and the U.S.-EU Passenger Name Record agreement. The European Parliament requires approval for accords like SWIFT and the U.S.-EU Passenger Name Record agreement. In July 2013, they expressed concerns about U.S. surveillance programs and established a working group to investigate. Claude Moraes chaired the Parliament's working group. In March 2014, the European Parliament adopted the \"Moraes report,\" criticizing NSA's mass surveillance programs and making recommendations on U.S.-EU security and economic issues, including concerns about the U.S.-EU PNR accord. The \"Moraes report\" criticized NSA's surveillance programs and made recommendations on U.S.-EU security and economic issues, including concerns about the U.S.-EU PNR accord and calls to suspend the SWIFT agreement. It urged timely conclusion of negotiations on the U.S.-EU Data Privacy and Protection Agreement and called for the U.S. to recognize privacy rights of EU citizens. The Parliament's resolution on the report is not binding on the European Commission. The European Parliament criticized NSA surveillance programs and called for stronger data protection reforms to recognize privacy rights of EU citizens. The resolution is not binding but carries political weight. The European Parliament demanded stronger data protection reforms in response to reported NSA programs and U.S. spying activities. New data protection rules were agreed upon in December 2015, with concerns raised by U.S. officials and business leaders about potential impacts on U.S.-European law enforcement cooperation and U.S. companies. The EU and U.S. reached an agreement on new data protection rules in December 2015, with concerns raised by U.S. officials and business leaders about potential impacts on law enforcement cooperation and U.S. companies. U.S. officials have reassured EU leaders that surveillance activities comply with U.S. law and oversight. The U.S. aims to address EU concerns and maintain support for existing accords. The U.S. government has been working to address EU concerns regarding NSA surveillance operations, including the PRISM program. A high-level U.S.-EU working group was established to discuss the implications for the privacy rights of EU citizens. In November 2013, the European Commission issued a report on the findings of this working group. In November 2013, the European Commission issued a report on the findings of a working group discussing the implications of NSA surveillance operations on the privacy rights of EU citizens. The report included recommendations to address European concerns about U.S.-EU data flows and restore transatlantic trust. U.S. and EU policymakers have been exploring ways to implement some of these proposals, including legislation to provide EU citizens with the right to seek redress in the U.S. In June 2014, the Obama Administration announced plans to work with Congress to pass legislation allowing EU citizens to seek redress in U.S. courts for law enforcement data privacy violations. The Judicial Redress Act (H.R. 1428 and S. 1600) was signed into law in February 2016 to address this key EU demand. The Judicial Redress Act (H.R. 1428) was signed into law in February 2016 to address EU demands for redress in U.S. courts for law enforcement data privacy violations. Controversy over Europe's role in the U.S. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program surfaced in 2006, with reports of secret access to SWIFT financial data. U.S. officials assured data protection for counterterrorism purposes. In 2001, the US gained access to SWIFT financial data for counterterrorism purposes. Despite assurances from US officials, concerns remained about data protection and privacy rights in the EU. In 2007, a deal was reached to continue US access to SWIFT data, but worries persisted. Changes were made to SWIFT's systems architecture in 2009 to address some of these concerns. In 2009, changes to SWIFT's systems architecture were made to address data protection concerns, including reducing data stored on U.S. servers and transferring a large portion of data to a storage location in Europe. This led to a new U.S.-EU agreement for sharing SWIFT data with the U.S. Treasury Department, which was approved by the European Parliament under the Lisbon Treaty. In November 2009, the European Parliament rejected the new U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement due to concerns about data protection and privacy rights of EU citizens. Opponents of the accord argued that it lacked sufficient protections for EU citizens' personal data and privacy rights. The European Parliament's concerns about SWIFT and the TFTP led some MEPs to assert their new powers and block U.S. access to SWIFT data until data privacy and civil liberties issues were addressed. Negotiations for a revised U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement began in May 2010 to address EP concerns, including ensuring judicial remedy for European citizens in the United States. In May 2010, negotiations started for a revised U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement to address European Parliament concerns about data abuse and bulk data transfers. Some MEPs called for targeted transfers and greater supervision over U.S. access to SWIFT data. In June 2010, U.S. and EU officials reached a new draft SWIFT agreement that included provisions for legal redress for EU citizens in the U.S. and gave Europol authority over U.S. Treasury Department requests for SWIFT data. Despite this, some MEPs remained dissatisfied with certain aspects of the draft. The new draft SWIFT agreement in June 2010 provided legal redress for EU citizens in the U.S. and gave Europol authority over U.S. Treasury Department requests for SWIFT data. Some MEPs were still unhappy with certain provisions, leading to two additional changes to the draft. An independent observer appointed by the European Commission would oversee the extraction of SWIFT data in Washington, DC, and plans for an EU equivalent to the U.S. TFTP had to be presented within a year. The European Parliament approved the final U.S.-EU SWIFT accord on July 8, 2010, with 484 votes to 109, entering into force on August 1, 2010, for five years. An independent observer from the European Commission oversaw the extraction of SWIFT data in Washington, DC, and plans for a European equivalent to the U.S. TFTP had to be presented within a year. The European Parliament approved the final U.S.-EU SWIFT accord on July 8, 2010, with 484 votes to 109, entering into force on August 1, 2010, for five years. The agreement allowed for automatic extensions unless one party notified the other six months in advance. Some MEPs expressed concerns about the EU's role in the U.S. TFTP and the implementation of the SWIFT accord. The European Parliament approved the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord in July 2010, entering into force on August 1 for five years. Concerns were raised about the EU's role in the U.S. TFTP and the implementation of the agreement. MEPs criticized Europol for approving vague U.S. requests for SWIFT data. The European Commission recommended measures to increase transparency in the TFTP, including providing more information to Europol in writing. A second review in December 2012 concluded that the TFTP had provided concrete benefits. The Commission recommended measures to increase transparency in the TFTP, including providing more information to Europol in writing. The second review in December 2012 concluded that the TFTP had provided concrete benefits in the fight against terrorism. The unauthorized disclosures of alleged U.S. surveillance activities in Europe since June 2013 have renewed European concerns about how the United States handles the personal data of EU citizens. In October 2013, the European Parliament passed a nonbinding resolution calling for the immediate suspension of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord following reports of NSA monitoring activities in EU countries. The European Parliament passed resolutions calling for the suspension of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord due to NSA surveillance allegations in EU countries. However, actually suspending the SWIFT accord would require action from the European Commission and member states, which they are not inclined to do. Reviews of the TFTP program show that SWIFT data has been valuable for European intelligence services. The European Parliament called for the suspension of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord due to NSA surveillance allegations, but actually suspending it would require action from the European Commission and member states. Reviews of the TFTP program show that SWIFT data has been valuable for European intelligence services in investigating terrorist threats. In May 2004, the US and EU agreed to share passenger data for flights to or from the US, leading to privacy concerns in Europe. The European Parliament challenged the agreement in court, resulting in its annulment in May 2006. In May 2006, the European Parliament challenged the US-EU passenger data sharing agreement in court, leading to its annulment due to legal basis issues. In July 2007, a new seven-year agreement was reached between the United States and the EU to ensure the continued transfer of PNR data. In July 2007, the US and EU reached a new agreement on the transfer of PNR data, allowing the US to share data with other agencies, store it for up to 15 years, access sensitive passenger information, and required airlines to send data to US authorities. The 2007 US-EU agreement on PNR data transfer allowed the US to access sensitive passenger information and required airlines to send data to US authorities 72 hours before a flight. The agreement reduced the number of data fields collected from 34 to 19, but faced objections from many MEPs. The European Parliament had to approve the 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement for it to remain in force. Many MEPs objected to key elements such as the amount of data transferred, data retention period, and lack of redress for citizens. Concerns were raised about potential data mining by U.S. authorities. Rejecting the agreement would create legal uncertainties and practical difficulties for travelers. In May 2010, the European Parliament postponed its vote on the 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement due to concerns about data misuse and profiling. The Parliament called for a \"global external PNR strategy\" to set requirements for all EU PNR agreements. In September 2010, the European Commission issued the strategy and called for the renegotiation of the EU's PNR agreements with the United States. The European Commission issued a \"global external PNR strategy\" in September 2010, calling for the renegotiation of EU PNR agreements with the United States, Australia, and Canada. The strategy emphasized using PNR data for combating terrorism and serious crimes, providing clear information to passengers about data exchange, and ensuring passengers' right to redress in case of denial to board a plane. The European Commission's PNR strategy emphasizes providing clear information to passengers about data exchange, ensuring their right to redress, and limiting the retention of PNR data. In November 2010, the European Parliament endorsed new PNR negotiations with the United States. In November 2010, the European Parliament endorsed new PNR negotiations with the United States, emphasizing the need for data exchange to be necessary and proportional. The Obama Administration agreed to discuss adjustments to the PNR accord in recognition of the EP's concerns. The Obama Administration agreed to discuss adjustments to the PNR accord with the EU in recognition of concerns raised by the European Parliament. U.S. officials maintained that the 2007 accord protected data and privacy rights, citing joint reviews that confirmed no misuse of PNR data. In mid-May 2011, resolutions were introduced in the House (H.Res. 255) and passed in the Senate (S.Res. 174) essentially supporting the existing 2007 U.S.-EU PNR accord and urging DHS to reject any revised PNR agreement that may degrade operational effectiveness or invalidate bilateral deals with EU member states. In mid-May 2011, resolutions were introduced in the House and passed in the Senate supporting the existing 2007 U.S.-EU PNR accord and urging DHS to reject any efforts by the EU to modify the agreement. In late May 2011, the United States and the European Commission concluded negotiations on a revised PNR agreement with new innovations to enhance passenger information protection. The United States and the European Commission concluded negotiations on a revised PNR agreement in May 2011, introducing new provisions to enhance passenger information protection. The draft accord included measures such as depersonalizing and masking passenger records after six months, reducing the storage time of PNR data, and limiting access to authorized personnel. U.S. officials believed the agreement provided greater legal certainty and clarity on passenger rights to redress. The revised U.S.-EU PNR agreement stored data in an \"active\" database, restricted access to authorized personnel, and ensured passenger rights to redress. It also allowed for consultation if the EU developed its own PNR system in the future. Despite these changes, some press reports raised concerns. The U.S.-EU PNR agreement was revised to include provisions for consultation if the EU developed its own PNR system in the future. However, some MEPs were still unsatisfied with the agreement, citing concerns about data retention, data transfer requirements, and passenger data privacy. The U.S.-EU PNR agreement was revised to extend data retention for up to 15 years, increase data transmission time to at least 96 hours, and broaden the use of PNR data for criminal offenses. In October 2011, a hearing on intelligence-sharing and terrorist travel highlighted the negotiations on the agreement. The Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence discussed the U.S.-EU PNR agreement, with U.S. officials stating that the 2011 draft addressed EU concerns on data security, protection, and passenger rights. Negotiations continued to further address European concerns. In November 2011, the United States and the EU concluded a new draft PNR agreement with \"real improvements\" over the previous version leaked in May. The agreement included changes to limit the use of PNR data to terrorist or serious transnational crimes resulting in three years or more in prison, addressing EU demands. In November 2011, the US and EU finalized a new draft PNR agreement with improvements over the leaked May version. Changes included limiting PNR data use to terrorist or serious transnational crimes with varying retention times based on the crime type. EU member states approved the agreement in December 2011, with Germany and Austria abstaining due to concerns over data retention and redress provisions. In December 2011, EU member states approved the new U.S.-EU PNR agreement, with Germany and Austria abstaining due to concerns over data retention and redress provisions. Some MEPs had reservations about the changes in the accord but others supported it, citing stronger data protection guarantees compared to the 2007 version. MEPs approved the U.S.-EU PNR agreement in April 2012, despite some concerns about data privacy safeguards. The European Commission argued that the new accord provided stronger data protection guarantees than the 2007 version. The Parliament's vote of 409 to 226, with 33 abstentions, signaled support for the agreement. U.S. officials welcomed the decision. The U.S.-EU PNR agreement was approved by the full Parliament on April 19, 2012, with a vote of 409 to 226 and 33 abstentions. U.S. officials welcomed the endorsement, highlighting the commitment to countering terrorism while protecting privacy and civil rights. The agreement was officially adopted by the EU on April 26, 2012, and came into force on August 8, 2012, valid for seven years with the possibility of renewal for another seven years. The U.S.-EU PNR accord was officially adopted by the EU on April 26, 2012, and entered into force on August 8, 2012. It will be valid for seven years and can be renewed for another seven years. In November 2013, the European Commission published the results of a joint review of the PNR program, stating that it is an efficient tool to fight terrorism and serious crimes, with U.S. authorities implementing it correctly. The U.S.-EU PNR agreement is seen as an effective tool to combat terrorism and serious crimes, with U.S. authorities implementing it correctly. However, concerns have been raised about data protection safeguards in light of U.S. surveillance activities. The European Parliament has called for clarification on whether U.S. laws adequately protect PNR data stored in cloud systems on U.S. soil. The European Parliament's resolution raised questions about the PNR program and called for clarification on data protection safeguards for PNR data stored in cloud systems on U.S. soil. U.S. and EU leaders view information-sharing agreements like SWIFT and PNR as crucial in fighting terrorism, but negotiations on data sharing have been challenging. Washington has sought an umbrella agreement to streamline the process. U.S. officials have long sought an umbrella agreement with the EU to simplify negotiations on data-sharing agreements. In 2009, the European Parliament called for a framework agreement to protect personal data in the fight against terrorism and crime. In May 2010, the European Commission proposed a draft mandate for negotiations. In 2009, the European Parliament called for a U.S.-EU framework agreement to protect personal data in the fight against terrorism and crime. The European Commission proposed a draft mandate in May 2010 for negotiating such an accord that could apply to all U.S.-EU data-sharing agreements in law enforcement. The Commission aimed to bridge U.S.-EU differences in privacy rights application and ensure high data protection standards on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Commission proposed a draft mandate in May 2010 for negotiating a U.S.-EU framework agreement to bridge privacy rights differences and ensure high data protection standards. This agreement would not provide the legal basis for data transfer but would require specific agreements for transfers like SWIFT or PNR. EU member states approved the Commission's mandate in December 2010, leading to negotiations on a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) between the United States and the EU in March 2011. In December 2010, EU member states approved the Commission's mandate for negotiating a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) with the United States. The negotiations aimed to establish mutual recognition of data protection systems to protect citizens' privacy rights effectively. The U.S. hoped for an EU finding of \"adequacy\" for U.S. data protection. The U.S. and EU aimed to establish mutual recognition of data protection systems to protect citizens' privacy rights effectively. Negotiations for a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) made considerable progress on data security, transparency, and oversight. In June 2012, U.S. and EU officials made progress in negotiating a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA), focusing on data security, transparency, and oversight. Controversial issues included purpose limitation, retention times, and redress for European citizens. EU officials pushed for the U.S. Privacy Act of 1974 to be amended to extend judicial redress to EU citizens. European citizens pushed for the U.S. Privacy Act of 1974 to be amended to extend judicial redress to EU citizens. However, U.S. Administrations argued that EU citizens could seek redress through other means such as agency administrative redress or other U.S. laws. This led to a stall in the DPPA negotiations. Observers noted that the DPPA negotiations were stalled due to the lack of judicial redress, but the revelations of U.S. surveillance activities in 2013 injected new momentum. The European Parliament called for the negotiations to resume promptly, emphasizing the importance of concluding the DPPA for restoring transatlantic trust. MEPs urged the European Commission and U.S. authorities to resume DPPA negotiations without delay. The EP's \"Moraes report\" emphasized the need for the DPPA to restore transatlantic trust and urged the U.S. to provide EU citizens with judicial redress for privacy violations. Attorney General Holder announced the Obama Administration's commitment to seeking legislation to ensure EU citizens' privacy rights within the DPPA. The Obama Administration, led by Attorney General Holder, committed to seeking legislation to provide EU citizens with judicial redress for privacy violations within the DPPA negotiations. This decision aimed to restore EU trust in U.S. data privacy. The Obama Administration made efforts to restore EU trust in U.S. data privacy by committing to provide judicial redress for privacy violations within the DPPA negotiations. This led to the finalization of the DPPA text by U.S. and EU negotiators, with the EU waiting for U.S. judicial redress legislation to be adopted before signing the agreement. The DPPA would not be signed until U.S. judicial redress legislation was adopted. In March 2015, H.R. 1428 and S. 1600 were introduced to extend judicial redress provisions to citizens of covered countries or regional organizations like the EU. H.R. 1428 and S. 1600 aim to extend judicial redress provisions to citizens of covered countries or regional organizations like the EU, following the invalidation of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement by the CJEU. The Judicial Redress Act gained importance after the CJEU invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement due to inadequate data protection and lack of judicial remedies for EU citizens in the U.S. The CJEU decision highlighted the lack of judicial remedies for EU citizens in the United States, leading to concerns about U.S.-EU data transfers. The Judicial Redress Act aimed to address these issues and strengthen confidence in the new \"Privacy Shield\" agreement. The Judicial Redress Act aims to address concerns about U.S.-EU data transfers and strengthen confidence in the new \"Privacy Shield\" agreement, but questions remain about its effectiveness in meeting EU standards and easing concerns about U.S. government access to personal data in the commercial sector. The Judicial Redress Act, H.R. 1428, passed the House on October 20, 2015, and was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 28, 2016, with an amendment introduced by Senator John Cornyn. The Cornyn amendment included provisions related to the applicability of the act to citizens of countries that permit data transfer to the U.S. for commercial purposes without impeding national security interests. The Judicial Redress Act, H.R. 1428, was signed into law on February 24, 2016, after passing the Senate and House. This act is seen as necessary for the formal signature of the U.S.-EU DPPA, with the EU warmly welcoming its adoption. The Judicial Redress Act, H.R. 1428, was signed into law on February 24, 2016 (P.L. 114-126), after approval by the House. The EU welcomed the act's enactment, stating it will pave the way for the U.S.-EU DPPA signature. EU member states and the European Parliament must also approve the DPPA for it to enter into force. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security highlighted the importance of transatlantic data flows and the need for approval of the DPPA by EU member states and the European Parliament. Cooperation between the United States and the EU in border control, aviation, and maritime security has been emphasized over the last decade. In the last decade, the United States and the EU have focused on cooperation in border control, aviation, and maritime security. They have signed agreements on information exchange for lost passports and promoting biometric identifiers for travel document security. In 2010, they pledged to strengthen global aviation security measures and collaborated on an ICAO declaration on aviation security. In October 2010, the United States and the EU collaborated on an ICAO declaration on aviation security, involving 190 countries. They have also worked together to enhance cargo security and global supply chain security. In June 2011, they reaffirmed their commitment to improving supply chain security and promoting global cooperation on the issue. U.S. and EU officials are working to find a balance in enhancing border security measures. In June 2011, the United States and the EU reaffirmed their commitment to enhancing supply chain security and global cooperation. Both are working to balance border security with facilitating transatlantic travel and commerce. Recent incidents have brought aviation and air cargo security to the forefront of discussions. Several incidents in recent years have highlighted the importance of aviation and air cargo security in U.S.-EU discussions. This includes the 2009 attempt to blow up an airliner with a device hidden in underwear and the 2010 Yemen bomb plot involving printer cartridge packages with explosives. In July 2014, U.S. authorities implemented stricter rules for carrying electronic devices. Printer cartridge packages containing explosives were shipped from Yemen on various cargo and passenger flights, with one package intercepted in the UK after being transferred in Germany. Tighter rules for carrying electronic devices on international U.S.-bound flights were implemented in July 2014 due to fears of Al Qaeda-linked groups using devices to disguise explosives, highlighting the ongoing terrorist threat to aviation. U.S. and EU have closely aligned rules and regulations since 2001, working together to address gaps in policies. The ongoing terrorist threat to aviation is highlighted by the use of electronic devices to disguise explosives. U.S. and EU have closely aligned rules and regulations since 2001, working together to address gaps in policies, such as coordinating air cargo security measures. In 2008, the United States and the EU agreed to coordinate air cargo security measures to ensure 100% screening of cargo on passenger flights between their territories, in compliance with the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. The United States and the EU have agreed to coordinate air cargo security measures to ensure 100% screening of cargo on passenger flights, eliminating duplication of security controls and enhancing cargo security. The US and EU have agreed to coordinate air cargo security measures to ensure 100% screening of cargo on passenger flights, eliminating duplication of security controls. This mutual recognition will enhance cargo security, save time and money for operators, improve transatlantic shipments, and reduce costs. Both sides will exchange information on the evolution and implementation of their security regimes. The US and EU have agreed to coordinate air cargo security measures to ensure 100% screening of cargo on passenger flights. This mutual recognition agreement will enable European operators to meet US requirements and improve transatlantic shipments. Despite some differences in perspective, both sides are committed to promoting cooperation in aviation and air cargo security. In the aftermath of the 2009 attack, the US accelerated body scanner installation at airports and urged the EU to do the same. Some EU countries supported this, while others had concerns about privacy and health risks. The European Parliament eventually approved the use of body scanners at EU airports with safeguards in place. In July 2011, the European Parliament approved the use of body scanners at EU airports with safeguards to protect privacy and health. Safeguards included producing stick figure images, banning x-ray scans, and making scans voluntary with the option for a manual search. The European Parliament approved the use of body scanners at EU airports in July 2011 with safeguards to protect privacy and health, including producing stick figure images, banning x-ray scans, and making scans voluntary with the option for a manual search. In November 2011, the European Commission adopted these conditions as common standards for body scanners, but member states are not required to deploy them. Some EU officials have expressed concerns about the use of body scanners at U.S. airports due to privacy and health worries. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration announced in January 2013 that full-body scanners producing revealing images would be removed from airports by June 2013. European concerns about privacy and health regarding body scanners at U.S. airports were partially alleviated. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration announced in January 2013 that revealing body scanners would be removed from airports by June 2013. Concerns about privacy and health regarding body scanners at U.S. airports were partially alleviated. Members of Congress and European Parliament had expressed privacy concerns about the scanners. U.S. officials were worried about planned changes to EU regulations on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage following a 2006 plot to use liquid explosives on transatlantic flights. The EU announced plans to eliminate restrictions on liquids in cabin baggage by April 2013, causing concern for U.S. officials who have been working to harmonize regulations with the EU since the 2006 plot to use liquid explosives on transatlantic flights. The EU planned to lift restrictions on liquids in carry-on baggage by April 2013, causing worry for U.S. officials due to concerns about security and potential flight delays. The EU postponed the 2013 deadline to ease liquid and gel restrictions in carry-on baggage due to concerns about airline security and potential flight delays. In January 2014, the EU lifted prohibitions on \"duty-free\" liquids and gels in cabin baggage as a first phase towards ending all restrictions by January 2016. The EU lifted restrictions on \"duty-free\" liquids and gels in cabin baggage in January 2014 as a first step towards ending all restrictions by January 2016. The US and EU signed a customs cooperation accord in April 2004, including extending the US Container Security Initiative (CSI) throughout the EU to screen maritime cargo containers for dangerous substances. In May 2012, the US and EU agreed to recognize each other's trusted shipper programs to improve supply chain security and trade opportunities for trusted traders designated by C-TPAT or the EU's Authorized program. The US and EU mutual recognition accord aims to streamline customs procedures for trusted traders, enhancing supply chain security and trade opportunities. This agreement benefits around 15,000 designated companies by lowering costs, simplifying procedures, and allowing customs authorities to focus on risky consignments. Recent tensions have eased over a provision in the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. The US-EU mutual recognition accord aims to streamline customs procedures for trusted traders, benefiting around 15,000 designated companies. Recent tensions have eased over a provision in the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, which set a five-year goal of scanning all containers bound for the US for nuclear devices at foreign ports. EU officials found 100% container scanning unrealistic and costly, shared by US policymakers in both the Bush and Obama Administrations. The US and EU officials found 100% container scanning unrealistic and costly, leading to concerns about disrupting trade and placing a financial burden on ports and businesses. US policymakers extended the deadline for implementing 100% scanning due to worries about lower profits and higher transportation costs for importers. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security extended the 100% scanning deadline for high-risk cargo shipments by two years, with an additional two-year extension announced later. Proponents argue that current manifest data is insufficient for determining risk. U.S.-EU tensions have arisen over the Visa Waiver Program and its application to all 28 member states. The U.S. Visa Waiver Program (VWP) has caused tensions between the U.S. and EU due to the desire for equal application to all member states. New EU members wanted to join the VWP after 2004 enlargement but faced exclusion for not meeting requirements. The EU pushed for full visa reciprocity between the U.S. and EU. The EU pushed for full visa reciprocity with the U.S., wanting all member states to join the Visa Waiver Program. Some Members of Congress supported extending the program to new EU members, while others had security concerns post-9/11. Many European allies supported the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) in the fight against terrorism, but some had security concerns post-9/11. Changes to the VWP were made in the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 to strengthen security measures and allow more countries to qualify. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53) strengthened the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) by enhancing security measures and expanding eligibility to more EU members and other interested countries. This included requirements for countries to meet security and passport standards, sign information-sharing agreements, and submit biographical information through ESTA. The Act also allowed waivers for specific admission requirements under certain circumstances. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) was strengthened by P.L. 110-53, allowing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to waive admission requirements for new EU member states. Currently, 23 out of 28 EU member states belong to the VWP, with efforts to include the remaining five (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Poland, and Romania). In 2014, a revised EU reciprocity mechanism aimed to achieve full visa reciprocity with the United States. The EU is working towards including the remaining five member states (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Poland, and Romania) in the Visa Waiver Program. A revised EU reciprocity mechanism allows the European Commission to suspend visa-free travel for a third country's citizens if there is no full visa reciprocity. So far, no visa-free travel has been suspended under this mechanism. The European Commission may suspend visa-free travel for a third country's citizens if there is no full visa reciprocity, pending approval from EU member states and the European Parliament. The VWP is a concern for U.S. officials due to reports of Europeans fighting in Syria and Iraq, who can easily return home and enter the United States without prior screening. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) is a concern for U.S. officials due to reports of Europeans fighting in Syria and Iraq. The Obama Administration supports the VWP for transatlantic commerce and tourism, but has implemented enhanced security measures for VWP travelers. In 2014, DHS announced that VWP travelers must provide additional biographic information through ESTA. In August 2015, new traveler screening requirements were introduced for VWP countries to enhance security measures. Following the November 13, 2015, attacks in Paris, the Obama Administration made additional changes to the VWP to strengthen security. The Obama Administration made changes to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) after the Paris attacks, requiring ESTA to capture past travel to terrorist safe havens and evaluating VWP countries for cooperation with the U.S. on security measures. The Obama Administration made changes to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) after the Paris attacks, requiring ESTA to capture past travel to terrorist safe havens and evaluating VWP countries for cooperation with the U.S. on security measures. Additionally, legislation was passed to enhance VWP security by prohibiting entry for individuals who have traveled to certain countries after March 1, 2011. The 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act amended the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to enhance security by prohibiting entry for individuals who have traveled to Syria, Iraq, Iran, or Sudan after March 1, 2011. These individuals and dual nationals of these countries must now obtain a visitor visa at a U.S. consulate abroad to travel to the United States. Additionally, all VWP participant countries are required to issue electronic passports, validate machine-readable passports at all ports of entry, and implement screening protocols and information-sharing. The 2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act amended the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to enhance security by prohibiting entry for individuals who have traveled to Syria, Iraq, Iran, or Sudan after March 1, 2011. The legislation mandates that VWP participant countries issue electronic passports, validate machine-readable passports at all entry points, and implement screening protocols. DHS announced an expansion of VWP travel restrictions to individuals who have visited Libya, Somalia, and Yemen since March 1, 2011, but dual nationals of these countries are exempt for now. EU officials have expressed concerns about the new VWP requirements. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) was amended in 2016 to enhance security by restricting entry for individuals who have visited certain countries after March 1, 2011. Dual nationals of Libya, Somalia, and Yemen are currently exempt from these restrictions. EU officials have raised concerns about the new VWP requirements, arguing that they could create a de facto visa regime and discriminate against dual nationals. The new legislation amends the Visa Waiver Program to restrict entry for individuals who have visited specific countries after March 1, 2011. It may affect European citizens traveling for legitimate reasons but may not detect those joining terrorist groups. Exemptions are provided for government and military personnel, with the Secretary of DHS having authority to waive exclusion on a case-by-case basis. Examples of eligible waivers include journalists and humanitarian NGO workers. EU leaders have expressed concerns about the new VWP requirements. The DHS has the authority to waive exclusion from the Visa Waiver Program on a case-by-case basis. Examples of eligible waivers include journalists and humanitarian NGO workers. Concerns have been raised about potential reciprocal measures from EU leaders and discrimination based on ethnicity in the new VWP legislation. Representative Justin Amash introduced the \"Equal Protection in Travel Act 2016\" to eliminate the VWP. Representative Justin Amash introduced H.R. 4830, the \"Equal Protection in Travel Act 2016,\" to eliminate Visa Waiver Program restrictions on dual nationals, addressing concerns of discrimination based on ethnicity. A companion measure, S. 2449, was introduced by Senator Jeff Flake. These changes aim to prevent the EU from imposing reciprocal visa requirements on U.S. citizens traveling to Europe, emphasizing the balance between freedom and security. The EU and U.S. aim to prevent reciprocal visa requirements by making changes to the Visa Waiver Program. The balance between freedom and security is emphasized, with a focus on civil liberties and human rights. U.S. policies on suspected terrorist detainees have caused tension with Europe in the past. The U.S.-European tension over suspected terrorist detainees, especially during the George W. Bush Administration, involved criticism of U.S. policies like Guantanamo Bay, military commissions, and \"enhanced interrogation techniques.\" European media focused on \"extraordinary rendition\" and CIA detention facilities in Europe, leading to investigations by the European Parliament. The European media focused on \"extraordinary rendition\" and CIA detention facilities in Europe, leading to investigations by the European Parliament and other bodies. European leaders and analysts criticized U.S. terrorist detainee and interrogation policies as breaching international and European law, and degrading shared values on human rights and prisoner treatment. Many European leaders and analysts criticized U.S. terrorist detainee and interrogation policies as breaching international and European law, degrading shared values on human rights and prisoner treatment. The Bush Administration defended these policies as crucial tools in the fight against terrorism, denying allegations of violating U.S. human rights commitments. The Bush Administration defended its detainee and rendition policies as important tools in the fight against terrorism, denying allegations of violating U.S. human rights commitments. U.S.-EU frictions over terrorist detainee policies have subsided to some degree since the start of the Obama Administration. EU and other European officials welcomed President Obama's announcement in January 2009 that the United States intended to close the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo. The Obama Administration's efforts to address U.S.-EU frictions over terrorist detainee policies included plans to close the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo, banning torture, and reviewing Bush Administration legal opinions. A special envoy was appointed to persuade countries to accept detainees cleared for release. In March 2009, the U.S. State Department appointed a special envoy to work on closing the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo, persuading countries in Europe and elsewhere to accept detainees cleared for release. Some EU members accepted released detainees, while others declined. The Obama Administration has faced challenges in closing Guant\u00e1namo, with some observers noting frustration over other countries' reluctance to accept more detainees. Congressional opposition has also been a hurdle. The Obama Administration has struggled to close Guant\u00e1namo due to challenges such as other countries' reluctance to accept detainees and Congressional opposition. Despite efforts, the promise to shut down Guant\u00e1namo has not been fulfilled. The Obama Administration has faced challenges in closing Guant\u00e1namo due to reluctance from other countries and Congressional opposition. Despite efforts, the promise to shut down Guant\u00e1namo has not been fulfilled. In March 2011, President Obama signed an executive order creating a system of indefinite detention for dangerous detainees at Guant\u00e1namo. The Administration also lifted a freeze on new military commission trials for detainees. European policymakers are concerned that Guant\u00e1namo serves as a recruiting tool for terrorist groups. The Obama Administration lifted the freeze on new military commission trials for Guant\u00e1namo detainees in March 2011.
