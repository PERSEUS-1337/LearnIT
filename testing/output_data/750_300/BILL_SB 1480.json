    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 254.5 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require claims for property tax exemptions to be filed by February 15th each year with the assessor. Approval is contingent upon obtaining a valid organizational clearance certificate. Financial statements are only necessary if requested by the assessor. The assessor must have a valid organizational clearance certificate before approving a property tax exemption claim. Financial statements are required only if requested. The assessor reviews claims for welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to ensure they meet specific requirements. The assessor may audit the owner or operator to ensure compliance with property tax exemption requirements, including justifying capital investments for plant expansion and verifying property usage for exempt activities. The assessor may conduct an audit to verify if the owner or operator meets exemption requirements. The assessor can deny a welfare exemption claim even if an organizational clearance certificate has been granted. If the property is found ineligible for exemption, the claimant will be notified in writing. If the assessor determines that the property is ineligible for the exemption, the claimant will be notified in writing. The claimant can then seek a refund of property taxes by filing a refund claim with the county, and if denied, can file a refund action in superior court. An applicant granted a welfare exemption for property exempted under specific sections does not need to reapply if there are no changes and the property is used by a governmental entity or nonprofit. Notification to the assessor is required if eligibility changes or if the property is no longer owned by the applicant. The applicant must inform the assessor by February 15 if they become ineligible for the welfare exemption or if the property no longer meets the requirements. Prior to the lien date, the assessor must annually send a notice to applicants exempt from filing an annual application. The notice, in a prescribed form, will detail circumstances where the property may lose exemption eligibility and remind applicants to inform the assessor if the property no longer qualifies. The assessor must annually send a notice to applicants exempt from filing an annual application, detailing circumstances where the property may lose exemption eligibility. The notice informs applicants how to reaffirm exemption eligibility for the next fiscal year, as failure to do so may result in additional contact by the assessor to verify exempt activity. Upon indication of incorrectly granted exemptions, the assessor will reevaluate eligibility and cancel exemptions if property no longer qualifies. If a welfare or veterans\u2019 organization exemption on the property is incorrectly allowed, an escape assessment will be made for the amount of the exemption, with interest and a penalty of 10% of the escape assessment, not exceeding $250, for failure to notify the assessor as required. The board reviews the assessor's administration of welfare and veterans' organization exemptions to ensure proper implementation. Section 1840 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended. Section 1840 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to allow counties, cities, and municipal corporations to request a review, equalization, or adjustment of property assessments by the board. Applications must be submitted in writing by November 30 or within 60 days of receiving the tax bill for assessments made outside the regular period. Every application must present the necessary information to the board, with a copy filed with the assessor. The board will provide notice and a hearing upon receiving a timely application, as per their rules. Failure to file on time will result in the applicant being barred from relief under Section 11 of Article XIII or this section. Section 4674 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended. Any excess proceeds from the delinquent tax sale trust fund not claimed by parties of interest may be transferred to the county general fund after a specified period. County costs related to maintaining property files and processing claims may be deducted before the transfer. The county auditor may transfer excess proceeds from the delinquent tax sale trust fund to the county general fund, deducting costs related to maintaining property files and processing claims before the transfer."
