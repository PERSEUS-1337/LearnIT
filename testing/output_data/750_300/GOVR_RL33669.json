    "content": "The national debate arose over the NSA's secret Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP), questioning its compliance with FISA and the need for additional authority. The program involved warrantless surveillance of international communications involving individuals in the US believed to be linked to al Qaeda. The Bush Administration asserted constitutional and statutory support for its program of warrantless surveillance of international communications involving individuals in the US believed to be linked to al Qaeda. Senator Mitch McConnell introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 and the Terrorist Tracking, Identification and Prosecution Act of 2006. Senator Mitch McConnell introduced two bills on September 22, 2006, S. 3931 and S. 3929, addressing electronic surveillance programs for detecting and preventing terrorist threats. Additional bills related to surveillance have been introduced in the 110th Congress. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, enacted in 1978, provides a framework for electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information. Three bills related to surveillance programs have been introduced in the 110th Congress: H.R. 11, S. 187, and S. 139. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) provides a statutory framework for electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information and authorizes the production of tangible things for investigations related to foreign intelligence or international terrorism. The Bush Administration argued that FISA lacked the speed and agility to combat terrorism effectively. The Bush Administration argued that FISA lacked speed and agility in combating terrorism. Attorney General Gonzales informed the Senate Judiciary Committee about FISC orders authorizing surveillance on international communications involving suspected members of terrorist organizations. The Attorney General announced that surveillance previously conducted under the TSP will now be subject to FISC approval, with the President deciding not to reauthorize the program when the current authorization expires. Intelligence Committees were briefed on the classified details of the FISC orders. The Attorney General announced that surveillance previously conducted under the TSP will now be subject to FISC approval, with the President deciding not to reauthorize the program when the current authorization expires. Intelligence Committees were briefed on the classified details of the FISC orders. The NSA program has faced legal and constitutional challenges, including a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. The NSA program, previously conducted under the TSP, will now require FISC approval. A lawsuit challenged the program's constitutionality, leading to a ruling that it violated various laws and amendments. The NSA program, previously conducted under the TSP, will now require FISC approval. A lawsuit challenged the program's constitutionality, leading to a ruling that it violated various laws and amendments, including the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act. The decision has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The American Civil Liberties Union v. National Security Agency case involves a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the NSA program, which now requires FISC approval. S. 3931 and Title II of S. 3929 aim to create a new Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to address electronic surveillance programs. S. 3931 and Title II of S. 3929 propose creating a new Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to address electronic surveillance programs under FISA. The measures also include amendments to other FISA provisions related to electronic surveillance without a warrant, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court orders, emergency surveillance, and limitations on liability for aiding in electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. The bills propose changes to electronic surveillance under FISA, including repealing wartime authorities for surveillance without a warrant, modifying definitions, criminal provisions, and congressional oversight. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 proposes changes to FISA definitions and criminal provisions, including addressing weapons of mass destruction and international movements of surveillance targets. Sec. 3 of S. 3931 creates a new Title VII in FISA for electronic surveillance programs. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 proposes changes to FISA definitions and criminal provisions, including creating a new Title VII in FISA for electronic surveillance programs under Sec. 3 of S. 3931. This new Title VII deals with electronic surveillance programs defined as programs for gathering foreign intelligence information or protecting against international terrorism where naming every person, address, or location is not feasible. The proposed changes under the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 include creating a new Title VII in FISA for electronic surveillance programs aimed at gathering foreign intelligence information or protecting against international terrorism. This new Title VII allows for electronic surveillance in situations where naming every person, address, or location is not feasible, and where immediate or extended surveillance is necessary for effective intelligence gathering. The FISC would have jurisdiction to review, authorize, and reauthorize such electronic surveillance programs under the proposed legislation. The proposed legislation under the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 introduces a new Section 702(a) of FISA, granting the FISC jurisdiction to review, authorize, and reauthorize electronic surveillance programs for obtaining foreign intelligence or combating international terrorism. Initial authorization can last up to 90 days, with reauthorization determined by the FISC. If an application is denied, the Attorney General can submit new applications without limit. The FISC can authorize electronic surveillance programs for up to 90 days, with reauthorization determined by the FISC. If an application is denied, the Attorney General can submit new applications without limit or appeal to the FIS Court of Review. The Attorney General must discontinue surveillance of a target under Title VII of FISA if criteria for electronic surveillance under Section 104 of Title I of FISA are met, unless certain conditions are fulfilled. Surveillance can only continue under Title VII if specific requirements are met. The Attorney General can continue surveillance under Title VII of FISA only if specific conditions are met, including obtaining an FISC order for electronic surveillance of the target. The bills also allow for the transfer of cases challenging the legality of classified communications intelligence activities related to foreign threats. The bills authorize the transfer of cases challenging the legality of classified communications intelligence activities related to foreign threats to the FIS Court of Review if it is deemed necessary for national security by the Attorney General. The Attorney General can request the transfer of a case to the FIS Court of Review if it is deemed necessary for national security. Proposed legislation requires the originating court to transfer the case upon the filing of such an affidavit. The proposed legislation requires the originating court to transfer a case to the FIS Court of Review upon the Attorney General's request for national security reasons. However, there is ambiguity in the language of the subsections regarding the transfer process and jurisdiction of the courts involved. The proposed legislation grants jurisdiction to the FISC to determine standing and legality of programs related to national security. Disclosure of national security information in criminal proceedings would be governed by specific acts. Any decision of the FISC can be appealed according to proposed subsections. The Classified Information Procedures Act and specific acts govern disclosure of national security information in criminal proceedings. Decisions of the FISC can be appealed to the FIS Court of Review and potentially to the U.S. Supreme Court. The FISC or originating court may dismiss challenges to the legality of electronic surveillance. The FISC decisions can be appealed to the FIS Court of Review and potentially to the U.S. Supreme Court. The FISC or originating court may dismiss challenges to the legality of electronic surveillance programs. New subsections in FISA set out requirements for approval of such programs. A new Section 703 of FISA outlines requirements for electronic surveillance program applications, with the FISC authorized to request additional information. Section 704 addresses the necessary findings for an ex parte FISC order approving such programs. Section 704 of S. 3931 creates a new subsection 704 in FISA for ex parte FISC orders approving electronic surveillance programs. The court must find the program consistent with the U.S. Constitution, and factors for constitutionality assessment are outlined. Section 705 of FISA addresses congressional oversight. The constitutionality of the program is addressed in subsection 704(c) of FISA. New Sec. 705 of FISA focuses on congressional oversight, requiring the Attorney General to submit classified reports every 180 days to the congressional intelligence committees on activities related to electronic surveillance programs authorized under Title VII of FISA. Subsection 705(c) clarifies that the title does not limit the authority or responsibility of. Sec. 8 of S. 3931, Sec. 208 of S. 3929, makes amendments to FISA by repealing certain sections that allow the President to authorize electronic surveillance. Congressional oversight is emphasized in new Sec. 705 of FISA, requiring the Attorney General to report to intelligence committees every 180 days on surveillance activities. Sec. 8 of S. 3931, Sec. 208 of S. 3929, repeals sections of FISA allowing the President to authorize surveillance without court orders for 15 days after a declaration of war. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 prohibits unauthorized interception of communications. Current 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 prohibits interception of communications without specific exceptions. One exception allows electronic surveillance by US officials in the course of their duties as authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Communications Act of 1934 allows US officials to conduct electronic surveillance in the course of their duties as authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This is outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(e) and (f). In 1934, US officials can conduct electronic surveillance as part of their official duties under the Constitution or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. This provision is known as the \"exclusivity\" provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(f), which allows for the acquisition of foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 allows the US Government to acquire foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications using means other than electronic surveillance. This Act and related procedures are the exclusive methods for conducting electronic surveillance and intercepting domestic wire, oral, and electronic communications. The exclusivity provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(f) prohibits electronic surveillance unless conducted under FISA, chapter 119, or chapter 121, as defined in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The amendments to FISA in Sec.8(b)(2) of S. 3931 and Sec. 208(b)(2) of S. 3929 address Section 109 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7. The exclusivity provision prohibits electronic surveillance unless conducted under FISA or related statutes. The amendments to FISA in Sec.8(b)(2) of S. 3931 and Sec. 208(b)(2) of S. 3929 address Section 109 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1809, focusing on criminal sanctions for unauthorized electronic surveillance and disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance. A person could face criminal liability for engaging in unauthorized electronic surveillance or disclosing information obtained through such surveillance without authorization by law. The penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance or disclosure of information obtained through such surveillance could increase from a fine of up to $10,000 to a fine of up to $100,000, with imprisonment increasing from up to 5 years. Under S. 3931 and S. 3929, penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance could increase to a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years. Amendments to FISA include expanding the definition of \"agent of a foreign power.\" The amendments in S. 3931 and S. 3929 expand the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA to include individuals expected to possess foreign intelligence information while in the United States. Penalties for unauthorized electronic surveillance could increase to a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years. The amendments in S. 3931 and S. 3929 expand the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA to include individuals expected to possess foreign intelligence information while in the United States. Sec. 9(b)(2) of S. 3931, Sec. 209(b)(2) of S. 3929, deletes the current definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(f), and replaces it with a new definition. Under the new definition, \"electronic surveillance\" would mean the intentional acquisition of information by directing surveillance at a known person in the United States. The new definition of \"electronic surveillance\" includes the installation or use of surveillance devices directed at a known person in the United States with a reasonable expectation of privacy, or the intentional acquisition of communication contents with a reasonable expectation of privacy. The new definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA includes the intentional acquisition of communication contents with a reasonable expectation of privacy within the United States, requiring a warrant for law enforcement purposes. Minimization procedures are in place to limit the acquisition and dissemination of non-publicly available information regarding unconsenting U.S. persons during foreign intelligence activities. The procedures aim to minimize acquisition and retention of non-publicly available information on unconsenting U.S. persons during foreign intelligence activities. Information not related to foreign intelligence is not disseminated without consent, unless necessary for understanding. The minimization procedures under FISA aim to limit dissemination of nonpublic information on U.S. persons in foreign intelligence activities, with exceptions for understanding foreign intelligence information. Minimization procedures under FISA restrict disclosure of communication involving U.S. persons in foreign intelligence activities, with exceptions for national security threats. Minimization procedures under FISA, as outlined in Sec. 105 of FISA, restrict the disclosure of communication involving U.S. persons in foreign intelligence activities, with exceptions for national security threats. Proposed changes in legislation would replace subsection 104(h)(4) of FISA with new language requiring that no contents of any communication originated or sent by a United States person be disclosed, disseminated, used, or retained in electronic surveillance approved under certain sections. The proposed changes in legislation would require that no contents of any communication originated or sent by a United States person be disclosed, disseminated, used, or retained for longer than 7 days in electronic surveillance approved under certain sections of FISA. The proposed legislation aims to limit the disclosure, dissemination, use, or retention of communication contents from a United States person in electronic surveillance under FISA to no longer than 7 days. It includes changes to definitions such as \"wire communication\" and \"contents\" in the current law. The current definition of \"contents\" in FISA would be replaced with a new definition under the proposed legislation. It includes information concerning the substance, symbols, sounds, words, purport, or meaning of a communication, excluding dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information. Section 102 of FISA authorizes electronic surveillance without a court order for acquiring foreign intelligence information. The proposed legislation would expand the application to include electronic surveillance directed at the contents of communications of foreign powers or agents of foreign powers. The amendment to Section 102 of FISA expands electronic surveillance to include acquisition of communications of foreign powers or agents of foreign powers, removing the requirement for the Attorney General to certify no substantial likelihood of acquiring U.S. person communications. The Attorney General must certify that electronic surveillance will not acquire U.S. person communications under FISA. Compliance assessments are required, and reports must be submitted to congressional intelligence committees. The Attorney General must certify electronic surveillance compliance with minimization procedures and report to congressional intelligence committees under FISA. If surveillance targets a foreign power agent, the report must justify the belief. The Attorney General must certify electronic surveillance compliance with minimization procedures and report to congressional intelligence committees under FISA. The procedures must include a statement of facts justifying the belief that the target is a foreign power agent. The Attorney General can direct a common carrier to provide assistance for authorized surveillance. The current Sec.102(a)(4), 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a)(4), allows the Attorney General to direct a common carrier to assist with electronic surveillance while maintaining secrecy and minimizing interference with their services. This provision is missing from the proposed subsection 102(a) of FISA, new 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1802(a). The proposed subsection 102(b)(1) of FISA creates new authority for the President, through the Attorney General, to authorize acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year concerning a person believed to be outside the US. The Attorney General can authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year on a person believed to be outside the US, as long as it does not constitute electronic surveillance and involves obtaining information from a communication service provider. The Attorney General can authorize the acquisition of foreign intelligence information from a wire or electronic communications service provider, custodian, or other person with access to such communications for up to one year. The acquisition must have a significant purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence information and must comply with minimization procedures. Specific facilities or places do not need to be identified in the certification. The Attorney General can authorize acquisition of foreign intelligence information from a communications service provider for up to one year, with minimization procedures in place. The certification does not need to specify the exact locations. Compliance with the Attorney General's certification and minimization procedures is required, with reports to be submitted to congressional intelligence committees. The Attorney General can authorize acquisition of foreign intelligence information from a communications service provider for up to one year, with minimization procedures in place. The certification would be transmitted to the FISC and maintained under seal unless needed for legality determination. The Attorney General can direct a person to provide necessary information, facilities, and assistance for the acquisition while protecting secrecy and minimizing interference. The Attorney General can direct a specified person to provide information, facilities, and assistance for acquisition of foreign intelligence while protecting secrecy. Records must be kept under approved security procedures. The government must compensate the person at the prevailing rate. The new subsection 102(d) of FISA requires the government to compensate a specified person for providing aid at the prevailing rate. If the person fails to comply with the Attorney General's directive, the Attorney General can seek recourse from the FISC. Failure to obey the FISC order could result in contempt of court. A person receiving a directive can challenge its legality by filing a petition with the FISC judges. Under the new subsection 102(f) of FISA, a person receiving a directive can challenge its legality by filing a petition with the FISC judges. The petition must be assigned to a judge within 24 hours for review. If deemed frivolous, the petition will be denied, and the directive affirmed. Failure to comply with the FISC order could result in contempt of court. The assigned judge must review a petition challenging a directive within 72 hours. If deemed frivolous, the petition is denied, and the directive affirmed. A petition can only be granted if the directive is found to be unlawful. The judge must review a petition challenging a directive within 72 hours. If found unlawful, the directive may be modified or set aside. If not, the judge must affirm it and order compliance. A petition to the FIS Court of Review must be made within seven days for further review. The FIS Court of Review must provide a written statement of reasons for its decision within seven days of the issuance of the FISC decision. The Government or any recipient of a directive can petition the U.S. Supreme Court for review. Judicial proceedings under Section 102 of FISA must be conducted promptly. Proposed subsection 102(g) of FISA requires the FIS Court of Review to transmit its record under seal to the Supreme Court. Judicial proceedings under Section 102 must be conducted expeditiously, with records maintained securely. All petitions under this section are to be filed under seal, and classified information may be reviewed by the court ex parte upon request by the Government. Proposed subsection 102(j) of FISA would prevent any legal action against communication service providers for assisting the Government under new directives. Proposed subsection 102(j) of FISA shields communication service providers from legal action for aiding the Government under new directives. Information acquired under Section 102 of FISA can be used or disclosed by federal officers in accordance with minimization procedures. Information acquired under Section 102 of FISA can only be used or disclosed by federal officers in accordance with minimization procedures and for lawful purposes. Disclosure for law enforcement purposes requires advance authorization from the Attorney General. No privileged communication can be disclosed without proper authorization. New subsection 102(k) of FISA states that privileged communication obtained under Section 102 shall not lose its privileged character. Proposed subsections 102(m) and (n) outline procedures for using or disclosing this information in federal, state, or local proceedings. The federal government can only introduce or use information acquired under FISA with proper authorization. The federal government can only introduce information acquired under FISA in proceedings if it complies with the requirements of proposed subsection 102(m). The federal government must notify the aggrieved person and the court before using information obtained under FISA in proceedings. Proposed subsection 102(n) requires a state or political subdivision to notify the aggrieved person, court, and U.S. Attorney General before using information obtained from a Section 102 acquisition in any legal proceeding. The state or political subdivision must notify the aggrieved person, court, and U.S. Attorney General before using information from a Section 102 acquisition in a legal proceeding. An aggrieved person can move to suppress evidence if the information was unlawfully acquired or the acquisition did not comply with an authorization or approval order. A motion to suppress evidence can be made if information from a Section 102 acquisition was unlawfully acquired or not in compliance with an authorization order. The Attorney General can file an affidavit stating that disclosure would harm national security, leading to a court or authority being notified. Proposed subsection 102(p) of FISA allows the Attorney General to file an affidavit under oath stating that disclosure would harm national security. This triggers a motion to suppress when seeking to discover materials related to a Section 102 acquisition. The U.S. district court will determine the lawfulness of a Section 102 acquisition and may review relevant materials in camera and ex parte. The U.S. district court will review materials in camera and ex parte to determine the legality of a Section 102 acquisition under FISA. If the acquisition is found to be unlawfully authorized, appropriate disclosure may be made to the aggrieved person. Proposed subsection 102(q) of FISA states that evidence obtained unlawfully in an acquisition authorized under Section 102 would be suppressed if the court finds it was not lawfully conducted. If the acquisition was lawful, the court may deny the aggrieved person's motion, except for necessary disclosure as required by due process. Proposed subsection 102(r) of FISA allows federal officers to consult with federal law when acquiring foreign intelligence information under Section 102 of FISA. Court decisions on the lawfulness of Section 102 authorizations are binding on all federal and state courts, except for U.S. court of appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court. Proposed subsection 102(r) of FISA allows federal officers to consult with federal law enforcement or state/local law enforcement when acquiring foreign intelligence information. Court decisions on Section 102 authorizations are binding on all federal and state courts, except for U.S. court of appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court. Proposed subsection 102(t) of FISA requires coordination for intelligence activities involving foreign powers or agents. Directives and orders under Section 102 must be retained for 10 years. Proposed changes to FISA include retaining directives and orders for 10 years, authorizing the Chief Justice to designate FISC judges, and providing authority for FISC orders under Title I of FISA. A new subsection 103(g) would be added to FISA, providing authority for FISC orders under Title I if the President authorizes the Attorney General. FISC judges can approve electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. Amendments to Sec. 104 of FISA are made in S. 3931 and S. 3929. The amendments to Sec. 104 of FISA in S. 3931 and S. 3929 involve replacing current subsections with new ones for authorizing electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. The application for a court order must include a certification that certain requirements are met, made by designated executive branch officials. The certification for authorizing electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes would now be made by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or an executive branch official authorized by the President. The certification for authorizing electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes would be made by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or an executive branch official authorized by the President. This process is governed by subsection 104(b) of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1804(b), which deals with excluding certain information from an application for a FISC order authorizing electronic surveillance on a foreign power. The application for authorizing electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes must include information about the surveillance techniques and U.S. persons likely to be affected. Proposed changes would strike current Sec. 104(b) of FISA and redesignate subsections 104(c)-(e). The proposed changes to FISA would allow for the review of surveillance applications by high-ranking officials upon written request. The Attorney General must personally review surveillance applications for certain targets under FISA, with proposed expansion to include the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Amendments to FISA would also impact the process for entering ex parte orders by FISC judges. The proposed amendment to FISA would redesignate subsections and change the process for entering ex parte orders by FISC judges. The proposed amendment to FISA would redesignate subsections and change the process for entering ex parte orders by FISC judges, including deleting and replacing certain subsections related to electronic surveillance orders. The proposed amendment to FISA would redesignate subsections and change the process for entering ex parte orders by FISC judges, including deleting and replacing certain subsections related to electronic surveillance orders. This includes replacing subsection 105(c)(1) with a new subsection that reorders current provisions and deletes certain requirements, while also addressing the exclusion of certain information in applications for court orders authorizing surveillance. The proposed amendment to FISA would change the process for entering ex parte orders by FISC judges, including addressing the exclusion of certain information in applications for court orders authorizing surveillance. This involves redesignating subsections and replacing certain provisions related to electronic surveillance orders. The proposed amendment to FISA would change the process for entering ex parte orders by FISC judges for electronic surveillance, specifying the type of surveillance involved and allowing extensions on the same basis as an original order. The proposed amendment to FISA would change the process for entering ex parte orders by FISC judges for electronic surveillance, specifying the type of surveillance involved, including whether physical entry is required. Extensions of an order authorizing electronic surveillance under Title I of FISA may be granted on the same basis as an original order, with exceptions for certain targeted surveillance. The proposed amendment to FISA would allow surveillance targeted against foreign powers or entities controlled by foreign governments for up to one year if no communication of a US person is expected. Extensions for surveillance of foreign agents not US persons can also be granted for one year. The proposed amendment to FISA allows surveillance targeted against foreign powers or entities controlled by foreign governments for up to one year if no communication of a US person is expected. Extensions for surveillance of foreign agents who are not US persons can also be granted for one year, with new findings required for each extension. The proposed amendment to FISA allows for surveillance extensions under Title I for up to one year based on new findings, with emergency authorization for electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 72 hours in certain situations. The Attorney General can authorize emergency electronic surveillance for up to 72 hours before obtaining a court order, if there is an urgent need for foreign intelligence information. A court order must be sought within this time frame, and surveillance must be terminated once the necessary information is obtained. The Attorney General can authorize emergency electronic surveillance for up to 72 hours before obtaining a court order under Sec. 105. Surveillance must be terminated once the information is acquired, denied by FISC, or at the end of the 72 hours. The use or disclosure of information acquired from surveillance is restricted without a court order. The current law allows the Attorney General to authorize emergency electronic surveillance for up to 72 hours without a court order. However, proposed changes would grant this authority to an executive branch officer appointed by the President with Senate approval. The Attorney General must still be informed of the surveillance activities. The new language would grant authority for emergency electronic surveillance to an executive branch officer appointed by the President with Senate approval. The Attorney General must be informed of the surveillance activities, and a FISC judge must be informed as soon as possible after authorization. The new law requires informing a FISC judge promptly after authorizing emergency electronic surveillance, with an application to be made within seven days. The new provision requires prompt notification to a FISC judge after authorizing emergency electronic surveillance, with an application to be submitted within seven days. The new provision allows for emergency electronic surveillance to be approved by an executive branch officer appointed by the President with Senate consent, replacing the previous 72-hour limit. Restrictions on disclosure and use of information obtained remain in place. The revised language allows for emergency electronic surveillance to be approved by an executive branch officer appointed by the President with Senate consent. The restrictions on disclosure and use of information obtained from such surveillance remain in place. The revised language in the new subsection of FISA requires minimization procedures for electronic surveillance to be followed when issuing a court order. It also modifies limitations of liability for those providing information or assistance with FISA surveillance. No cause of action would lie against providers of electronic communication services or others involved in surveillance activities. The revised language in the new subsection of FISA requires minimization procedures for electronic surveillance when issuing a court order. It also modifies limitations of liability for those providing information or assistance with FISA surveillance, protecting them from legal action. The revised language in the new subsection of FISA requires minimization procedures for electronic surveillance when issuing a court order. Sec. 106 of FISA limits the use of information acquired from electronic surveillance on unconsenting U.S. persons and includes notification requirements. It allows an aggrieved person to move to suppress unlawfully acquired information in an official proceeding. The revised language in the new subsection of FISA requires minimization procedures for electronic surveillance when issuing a court order. It includes notification requirements and allows an aggrieved person to move to suppress unlawfully acquired information in an official proceeding. The revised language in the new subsection of FISA requires minimization procedures for electronic surveillance, including the destruction of unintentionally acquired information under certain circumstances. The Attorney General can determine if the contents indicate a threat of harm before destruction. The Attorney General can determine if the contents of electronic surveillance indicate a threat of harm before destruction, as specified in the revised subsection of FISA. Amendments to subsection 106(i) of FISA in S. 3886 and S. 2453 are somewhat unclear. The provision in subsection 106(i) of FISA would be amended to include \"contain significant foreign intelligence information or\" after \"Attorney General determines that the contents.\" This language amendment is somewhat unclear and may result in a provision regarding unintentional acquisition of communication contents. The provision in subsection 106(i) of FISA would be amended to include \"contain significant foreign intelligence information or\" after \"Attorney General determines that the contents.\" This would involve the unintentional acquisition of communication contents, with a requirement for destruction unless certain criteria are met. The amending language in the current section expands circumstances for the destruction of unintentionally acquired communication contents within the United States. However, the inclusion of the phrase \"contain foreign intelligence information or\" may be redundant. The amending language in the current section expands circumstances for the destruction of unintentionally acquired communication contents within the United States. Sec. 9(g)(2) of S. 3930 and Sec. 209(g)(2) of S. 3929 make conforming amendments to subsection 106(k) and Sec. 108 of FISA is amended to add a new subsection 108(c) requiring oversight by key officials.

Sec. 9(i) of S. 3931 and Sec. 209(i) of S. 3929 make amendments to Title I of FISA, adding a new category to the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA. The bill S. 3929 expands oversight provisions of FISA by adding a new category to the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA, including those involved in the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The bill S. 3929 expands oversight provisions of FISA by adding a new category to the definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA, including those involved in sabotage, international terrorism, or the development of weapons of mass destruction. The bill S. 3931 and S. 3929 expand FISA's definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" to include individuals involved in sabotage, international terrorism, or the development of weapons of mass destruction. This includes those who knowingly engage in activities for a foreign power related to weapons of mass destruction. The bill S. 3929 would add a new subsection to FISA's definitions, expanding the definition of \"weapon of mass destruction\" to include destructive devices, weapons designed to cause harm through chemicals or biological agents. The bill S. 3929 expands the definition of \"weapon of mass destruction\" in FISA to include devices designed to cause harm through chemicals, biological agents, or radiation. The bill S. 3931 would expand FISA to cover the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in addition to sabotage or international terrorism. It also addresses the duration and extension of FISC orders for electronic surveillance and physical searches related to international movements of targets. The bill S. 3931 expands FISA to cover weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism. It introduces new subsections to allow surveillance and physical searches to continue even if the target is outside the United States, unless a motion to end the order is granted by the court. The bill S. 3931 expands FISA to cover weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism, allowing surveillance and physical searches to continue even if the target is outside the United States. Amendments would be made to FISA to reflect the replacement of current sections and the creation of new titles."
