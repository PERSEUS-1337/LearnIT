    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cavernous Angioma CARE Center Act of 2010\". It includes findings related to the Act. Congress finds that cavernous angioma, also known as cerebral cavernous malformations or CCM, affects approximately 1,500,000 individuals in the United States. This blood vessel disease is characterized by vascular lesions that develop in the brain and spinal cord. Detection of these lesions requires costly medical imaging techniques, and individuals may not be aware of the disease until serious symptoms occur. Cavernous angioma is a common vascular anomaly that may go unnoticed until serious symptoms like neurological deficits, seizures, stroke, or sudden death occur. Limited research means there is currently no treatment regimen for the disease other than brain and spinal surgery, which may not be an option for some individuals. Limited research means there is currently no treatment regimen for cavernous angioma other than brain and spinal surgery. Some individuals may not be candidates for surgery, leading to a lack of treatment options. Additionally, there is a shortage of physicians familiar with the disease, making timely diagnosis and appropriate care difficult for affected individuals. New Mexico has the highest population density of cavernous angioma in the world due to a specific disease-causing mutation. Other states with high rates include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, agreed to in May. The Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, adopted unanimously on May 13, 2009, highlights the critical need to increase research, awareness, and education about cerebral cavernous malformations. The National Institutes of Health supports biomedical research through extramural centers of excellence at institutes of higher education. The National Institutes of Health supports biomedical research through extramural centers of excellence at institutes of higher education, promoting a multidisciplinary approach to understand complex biomedical systems and translate scientific discoveries into clinical applications. There is a need for a Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care and Advocacy to address the public health threat posed by cavernous angioma in New Mexico and the United States. To address the public health threat of cavernous angioma, a Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center is needed in New Mexico and the US. This center aims to provide a model medical system, facilitate research for a cure, and improve medical care nationwide. The University of New Mexico has the expertise to establish this center. A Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center should be established at the University of New Mexico to develop a cure and enhance medical care for individuals with cavernous angioma nationwide.
