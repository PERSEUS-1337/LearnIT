The President has the authority to suspend, terminate, or not impose sanctions if the gains for the United States national interests do not outweigh the costs. This includes refraining from imposing sanctions or suspending/terminating their application. Additionally, the President can also reimpose sanctions if necessary. The President has the authority to refrain from imposing or suspend sanctions, and can subsequently reimpose them with prior notification to Congress. The President can choose not to impose sanctions and can later reinstate them with advance notice to Congress. Congress can disapprove of the President's decision within 30 days by enacting a joint resolution. The President can choose not to impose sanctions, and if so, the suspension or termination would take effect 30 days after a report is submitted to Congress, unless Congress enacts a joint resolution disapproving the determination within 30 days. In cases of suspension or termination of a sanction, it will take effect 30 days after the President submits a report to Congress, unless Congress enacts a joint resolution disapproving the determination. Congressional procedures for joint resolutions differ between the Senate and the House of Representatives. The provisions of section 601(b) of the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976 apply to the Senate. In the House of Representatives, a motion to proceed with a joint resolution is treated as highly privileged for quick consideration. This section supersedes any other provision of law."
