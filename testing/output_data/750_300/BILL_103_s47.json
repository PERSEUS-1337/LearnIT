The procedures include appointment of counsel, mandatory stay of execution, filing of habeas corpus petition, evidentiary hearings, and district court adjudication. The new chapter in Title 28 of the United States Code outlines special habeas corpus procedures in capital cases, including appointment of counsel, mandatory stay of execution, filing of habeas corpus petition, evidentiary hearings, and district court adjudication for prisoners in State custody subject to a capital sentence. This chapter applies to cases under section 2254 of this title for prisoners in State custody with a capital sentence, if certain conditions are met. It requires States to establish a mechanism for appointing competent counsel and paying litigation expenses for indigent prisoners in post-conviction proceedings after their capital convictions have been upheld. The chapter applies to cases under section 2254 for State prisoners with a capital sentence. States must establish a mechanism for appointing competent counsel for indigent prisoners in post-conviction proceedings after their capital convictions are final. The mechanism must provide standards for counsel appointment and offer representation to all State prisoners under a capital sentence. The chapter applies to cases under section 2254 for State prisoners with a capital sentence. States must establish a mechanism for appointing competent counsel for indigent prisoners in post-conviction proceedings after their capital convictions are final. The mechanism must provide standards for counsel appointment and offer representation to all State prisoners under a capital sentence. The court must appoint counsel for indigent prisoners under capital sentence or determine if the prisoner has rejected counsel understanding the legal consequences. The chapter applies to cases under section 2254 for State prisoners with a capital sentence. States must establish a mechanism for appointing competent counsel for indigent prisoners in post-conviction proceedings after their capital convictions are final. The court must appoint counsel for indigent prisoners under capital sentence or determine if the prisoner has rejected counsel understanding the legal consequences. Counsel appointed for a State prisoner under a capital sentence cannot have previously represented the prisoner at trial or on direct appeal unless requested. Ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during State or Federal collateral post-conviction proceedings in a capital case is addressed. Sec. 2257 mandates a stay of execution in capital cases, limits on stays, and allows for successive petitions. Ineffectiveness of counsel in post-conviction proceedings is not grounds for relief. Different counsel can be appointed at any phase of the proceedings. Sec. 2257 mandates a stay of execution in capital cases upon invoking post-conviction review procedures. Different counsel can be appointed at any phase of the proceedings. The application for a stay of execution must be made to a court with jurisdiction over section 2254 proceedings, stating that the State has initiated post-conviction review procedures. The stay expires if the prisoner fails to file a habeas corpus petition within the required time or if the relief petition is denied after district court and court of appeals review under section 2254. Upon completion of district court and court of appeals review under section 2254 of this title, the petition for relief is denied if the time for filing a petition for certiorari has expired, no petition has been filed, a timely petition for certiorari was filed and denied by the Supreme Court, or a timely petition for certiorari was filed and upon consideration, the Supreme Court denied the petition. Before a court of competent jurisdiction, a State prisoner under a capital sentence can waive the right to pursue habeas corpus review under section 2254 of this title, in the presence of counsel and after being advised of the consequences. A prisoner under a capital sentence can waive the right to pursue habeas corpus review in the presence of counsel. No Federal court can grant relief in a capital case unless the claim was not previously presented in State or Federal courts. The basis for a stay and relief request is a claim not previously raised in State or Federal courts, due to State action violating the Constitution, a new retroactively applicable Federal right recognized by the Supreme Court, or facts not discoverable with reasonable diligence in time. Sec. 2258 outlines the time requirements and tolling rules for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254. The petition must be based on new claims not previously raised in court, due to constitutional violations, new Supreme Court rulings, or facts not discoverable with reasonable diligence. The time requirements and tolling rules for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 are outlined in Sec. 2258. The petition must be filed within 180 days after an order is issued in compliance with section 2256(c) in the appropriate district court. Time requirements are tolled during the period from filing a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court until final disposition. The time requirements established by section 2258 for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 are tolled in specific circumstances, such as when a State prisoner seeks review of a capital sentence in the Supreme Court or has a post-conviction review pending before a State court. The time requirements for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 can be extended in certain situations, such as when a State prisoner has a pending post-conviction review before a State court and if counsel for the prisoner requests an extension with good cause shown. The time requirement for filing a habeas corpus petition under section 2254 can be extended if a State prisoner has a pending post-conviction review before a State court and shows good cause for counsel's inability to file within the 180-day period. The time requirement is continuously tolled from the initial filing for post-conviction review until the final disposition by the highest State court, as long as all State filing rules are met timely. The time requirement for filing a habeas corpus petition can be extended if a State prisoner has a pending post-conviction review and shows good cause for counsel's inability to file within 180 days. Tolling does not occur during a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court. When a State prisoner under a capital sentence files a habeas corpus petition, the district court shall conduct evidentiary hearings and review the case. Sec. 2259 outlines the procedures for habeas corpus relief for State prisoners under a capital sentence, including the sufficiency of the evidentiary record and district court adjudication based on claims presented in State courts. The procedures for habeas corpus relief for State prisoners under a capital sentence are outlined in Sec. 2259. The failure to raise a claim in State courts must be due to specific reasons outlined, such as State action violating the Constitution, a new retroactively applicable Federal right recognized by the Supreme Court, or the claim being based on undiscoverable facts. The procedures for habeas corpus relief for State prisoners under a capital sentence are outlined in Sec. 2259. Claims must be based on facts not discoverable through reasonable diligence in time for State post-conviction review. The district court will conduct any necessary evidentiary hearings for habeas corpus review and rule on the merits of the claims. The requirement of a certificate of probable cause to appeal from the district court to the court of appeals does not apply. The district court will rule on the merits of claims in habeas corpus cases. A certificate of probable cause is not required for appeals from the district court to the court of appeals, except for second or successive petitions."
