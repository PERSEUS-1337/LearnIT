    "content": "In 1992, the United States ratified the UNFCCC, calling for reducing greenhouse gases by 2000. Various actions were proposed, but carbon dioxide emissions continued to rise. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, which aimed for legally binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Administration focused on voluntary initiatives to curb emissions growth, as seen in the 2002 Climate Action Report. The Administration shifted to voluntary initiatives for climate change policy after rejecting the Kyoto Protocol in 2001. The 2002 Climate Action Report highlighted over 50 programs, with only six being regulatory, aimed at achieving energy or environmental goals that incidentally reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Several congressional proposals in the 109th Congress aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through improved monitoring and research, aligning with voluntary initiatives for climate change policy. In the 109th Congress, programs were introduced to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These programs focused on improving monitoring, enacting market-oriented reduction programs, and implementing energy-related initiatives to reduce emissions. The report focuses on comparing two proposals from the Senate's debate on the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Senators McCain and Lieberman introduced the Climate Stewardship Act of 2005 to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases through energy-related programs. In February 2005, Senators McCain and Lieberman introduced the Climate Stewardship Act of 2005 to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases through market-based mechanisms. In May 2005, an expanded version of the act was introduced to encourage innovation in carbon-intensive technologies and mitigate climate change effects. The Climate Stewardship Act of 2005, introduced by Senators McCain and Lieberman, aimed to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions through market-based mechanisms. It included provisions for innovation in carbon-intensive technologies and addressing climate change effects. The bill, similar to previous amendments, proposed mandatory economy-wide emission reductions using a flexible, market-based approach. S. 1151, also known as the Climate Stewardship Act of 2005, was defeated on a 38-60 vote. The bill aimed to require mandatory economy-wide emission reductions through a flexible, market-based strategy, allowing participation in international trading systems and carbon sequestration programs. It excluded residential and agricultural sources of greenhouse gases and entities emitting less than 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents annually. Senator Bingaman announced a draft amendment based on the National Commission on Energy Policy's report. The draft amendment proposed by Senator Bingaman, based on the National Commission on Energy Policy's report, aims to mandate an accelerated reduction in greenhouse gas intensity in the economy. It would require a 2.4% annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per dollar of projected gross domestic product between 2010 and 2019. The draft amendment mandates an accelerated reduction in greenhouse gas intensity in the economy, requiring a 2.4% annual reduction in emissions per dollar of GDP between 2010 and 2019, increasing to 2.8% annually after 2019. Implementation would involve a market-oriented allowance trading program with a cost-limiting safety valve for covered entities. The draft amendment includes a cost-limiting safety valve allowing covered entities to pay DOE instead of reducing emissions at $7 a ton in 2010. Both proposals aim to control U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, with S. 1151 placing an absolute cap on emissions. The draft amendment aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity, while S. 1151 would place an absolute cap on emissions from covered entities. Overall U.S. emissions are expected to grow under S. 1151, but economic growth would determine emissions growth or decline under the draft amendment. Under the draft amendment, overall U.S. emissions are expected to continue rising, with economic growth determining if emissions grow or decline. A cost-limiting \"safety valve\" allows covered entities to purchase extra tradeable allowances or make a payment to DOE at a set price. The draft amendment includes a cost-limiting \"safety valve\" for covered entities to purchase extra tradeable allowances or make a payment to DOE at a set price. S. 1151 does not limit the price per allowance that covered entities must pay, and the proposals differ in various aspects such as covered entities, agency responsibility, credit generation, and use of proceeds from allowance sales/auctions. The draft amendment and S. 1151 differ in various aspects including covered entities, agency responsibility, credit generation, and use of proceeds from allowance sales/auctions. Emission reduction estimates for both options have some uncertainty, particularly for the draft amendment. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) analyzed an earlier version of S. 1151 in 2004, estimating a 6.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. Contrasting with CRS's estimate of a 2.5% reduction, the draft amendment's impact on emissions remains uncertain. The draft amendment is estimated to result in a 2.5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 compared to business-as-usual scenarios. However, there is uncertainty regarding longer-term reductions. Emissions of greenhouse gases are expected to continue increasing under both options, albeit at a slower pace than business-as-usual. The percentage of greenhouse gases not covered by the bill would increase, leading to uncontrolled emissions. Under both options, greenhouse gas emissions would continue to increase, albeit more slowly than business-as-usual. In the case of S. 1151, uncontrolled emissions would rise due to the percentage not covered by the bill. The draft amendment would see covered emissions grow if economic growth outpaced the reduction in carbon intensity, potentially leading to a rise in emissions in the long term. The draft amendment could lead to a faster rise in emissions compared to S. 1151 if economic growth outstrips the reduction in carbon intensity. Table 2 shows projected emissions under both options. Sources: Data from 1990 and 2000, along with 2010 projections, were used for the U.S. submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The estimates for S.Amdt. 2028, a similar proposal to S. 1151, were based on analysis by the Energy Information Administration. The draft amendment calculations by CRS were derived from projected GDP and carbon intensity improvements. The draft amendment's estimated emission reductions are more uncertain than under S. 1151 due to uncertainties surrounding the number of covered entities. The estimates do not consider carbon sequestration potential. The draft amendment's emission reductions are more uncertain than S. 1151 due to uncertainties about the number of covered entities. Higher coverage means more reductions but lower certainty, while lower coverage means lower costs but greater uncertainty. The draft amendment calculates a future emissions baseline from projections of 2009 GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement, leading to uncertainties in emission reductions. Economic growth projections range from 2.5% to 3.6% annually. The draft amendment calculates future emissions baseline from 2009 GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement projections. Economic growth is uncertain, ranging from 2.5% to 3.6% annually. Carbon intensity improvement projection is also uncertain. The estimate of carbon intensity improvement projection for 2009 is uncertain, with a range of 165 to 159 million metric tons carbon equivalent per million dollars GDP. Current intensity levels are higher than projected under the Climate Change Initiative, with an estimate of 183 MMTCE/M$GDP in 2002. The draft amendment raises questions about its coverage extent. The draft amendment raises questions about coverage extent and the safety valve triggering a $7 per ton of carbon dioxide threshold. The draft amendment raises questions about coverage extent and the safety valve triggering a $7 per ton of carbon dioxide threshold. Analysis shows uncertainty in when the safety valve would be triggered, adding complexity to emission reductions achieved under the draft amendment. The projected cost under S. 1151 is more uncertain due to future growth in greenhouse gas emissions. The projected cost under S. 1151 is more uncertain than under the draft amendment due to future growth in greenhouse gas emissions by covered entities. Economic growth could lead to increased emissions that would need to be offset to maintain the cap, potentially resulting in higher costs for emission reductions. The cost estimates for S. 1151 are uncertain due to potential increases in emissions from economic growth. More emission reductions may lead to higher costs, with differing estimates placing potential permit prices at $9 or $15 per ton. The potential permit price for S. 1151 in 2010 ranged from $9 to $15 per ton, depending on assumptions about energy efficiency improvements, greenhouse gas reductions, carbon sequestration, and natural gas supply. The cost estimates are sensitive to the availability of options, with a market-based allowance trading system designed to achieve a least-cost solution. The cost estimates for S. 1151 range from $9 to $15 per ton, showing sensitivity and uncertainty. The draft amendment's cost estimates are less sensitive and incorporate economic growth into emissions limitations. The draft amendment incorporates economic growth into emissions limitations, allowing for some increase in future emissions if economic growth exceeds the mandated improvement in greenhouse gas intensity. This results in lower costs compared to S. 1151. The draft amendment's cost estimates are influenced by the availability of cost-effective control measures like energy efficiency improvements and carbon sequestration. The draft amendment's cost estimates are influenced by the availability of cost-effective control measures such as energy efficiency improvements, carbon sequestration, and non-CO2 greenhouse gas reductions. The amendment does not include international credits like S. 1151, which could introduce uncertainty or lower costs through international trading. The National Commission on Energy Policy set the permit price at $5 a ton in 2010 (2004$), with uncertainties in potential costs but a safety valve in place. The draft amendment's safety valve limits potential costs to $7 a ton in nominal 2010 dollars, narrowing the cost uncertainty range. The purpose of the safety valve is to bound the costs of any potential international trading. The draft amendment's safety valve limits potential costs to $7 a ton in nominal 2010 dollars, narrowing the cost uncertainty range. Market-based mechanisms focus on acceptable emissions levels or compliance costs to determine the economically efficient solution. The draft amendment's safety valve limits costs to $7 a ton in nominal 2010 dollars, narrowing cost uncertainty. Market-based mechanisms focus on emissions levels or compliance costs for an economically efficient solution, allowing the marketplace to determine the other variable. Tradeable permit programs set emissions caps while the marketplace determines permit value, while a carbon tax sets maximum unit cost for reducing emissions. The safety valve in the draft amendment sets the maximum cost per ton of CO2 for emission reduction, while the marketplace determines the actual reduction. The preference for a tradeable permit system or safety valve depends on views of cost uncertainty and benefits. For those confident in achieving CO2 reduction benefits, a tradeable permit program may be most suitable. If confident in achieving CO2 reduction benefits, a tradeable permit program may be most suitable. A safety valve may be preferred for those concerned about potential control costs to the economy. Emission reduction efforts focus on cost-effective control sources. A safety valve can cap control costs to the economy, but the exact CO2 reduction level is uncertain. Emitters would spend money on control up to the safety valve level, but the overall emissions reductions are not well known due to the varying control costs among emitters. The safety valve on the draft amendment could be viewed as a contingent carbon tax, raising a major policy question about economic costs and uncertainty in achieving emission reductions. The draft amendment raises a policy question about economic costs and uncertainty in achieving emission reductions through a contingent carbon tax. S. 1151 and the draft amendment propose market-based systems to limit greenhouse gas emissions, with S. 1151 focusing on total emissions and the draft amendment leaning towards price control. The draft amendment and S. 1151 propose market-based systems to limit greenhouse gas emissions, with S. 1151 focusing on absolute emission caps and allowing trading, while the draft amendment limits emissions intensity and includes a cost-limiting safety valve. Both proposals would likely result in lower emissions compared to business as usual, with S. 1151 expected to achieve larger and more certain reductions. Both the draft amendment and S. 1151 aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through market-based systems. S. 1151 focuses on absolute emission caps with trading, while the draft amendment limits emissions intensity and includes a cost-limiting safety valve. S. 1151 is expected to achieve larger and more certain reductions, while the draft amendment is likely to have lower and more predictable costs. Both proposals would slow the upward trend of U.S. emissions compared to current forecasts."
