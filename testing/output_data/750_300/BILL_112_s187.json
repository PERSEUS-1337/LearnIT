    "content": "The \"Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011\" ensures the availability of dual-fueled automobiles and light-duty trucks. The \"Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011\" mandates that manufacturers must produce a certain percentage of dual-fueled automobiles and light-duty trucks for sale in the United States. The \"Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011\" requires manufacturers to produce a specific percentage of dual-fueled vehicles. Model years 2014 and 2015 must be 50 percent dual-fueled, while model year 2016 and onwards must be 90 percent dual-fueled. There is an exception for vehicles that operate solely on electricity. The \"Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011\" mandates the production of dual-fueled vehicles. The Secretary of Transportation must establish regulations within a year of the Act's enactment. Additionally, there is a provision for promoting blender pumps. The Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011 requires the production of dual-fueled vehicles and mandates regulations by the Secretary of Transportation. It also includes a provision for promoting blender pumps capable of dispensing various gasoline and ethanol blends, including E-85 fuel. The Biofuels Market Expansion Act of 2011 mandates regulations by the Secretary of Transportation for dual-fueled vehicles and promotes blender pumps for dispensing gasoline and ethanol blends, including E-85 fuel. The Act defines E-85 fuel as a blend of gasoline with approximately 85% ethanol content and ethanol fuel blend as a mix of gasoline and ethanol with 0-85% denatured ethanol content. A major fuel distributor is defined as any person owning a distribution facility. The term \"major fuel distributor\" refers to a person owning a refinery or directly marketing its output, excluding those with less than 50 retail fueling stations. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. The Secretary of Energy defines a \"major fuel distributor\" as a person owning a refinery or directly marketing its output, excluding those with less than 50 retail fueling stations. The Secretary will provide grants to eligible facilities for installing blender pump fuel infrastructure, including infrastructure for the direct retail sale of ethanol fuel blends. The Secretary of Energy will provide grants for installing blender pump fuel infrastructure and subgrants to direct retailers for the same purpose. Major fuel distributors are not eligible for these grants. The Secretary of Energy offers grants for installing blender pump fuel infrastructure and subgrants to direct retailers for selling ethanol fuel blends. Major fuel distributors are not eligible for these grants, and the Federal share of project costs can be up to 50 percent. Eligible facilities or retailers must offer ethanol fuel blends for sale for at least 2 years within a 4-year period after installation. If an eligible facility or retailer receiving a grant under this program does not sell ethanol fuel blends for at least 2 years within a 4-year period after installing a blender pump, they must repay the Secretary an appropriate amount, not exceeding the grant provided. Authorization of appropriations is available for the Secretary to implement this program. Authorization of appropriations is available for the Secretary to carry out the grant program for blender pump installations, with varying amounts allocated for fiscal years 2012 to 2016. Authorization of appropriations for blender pump installations includes $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2015 and $350,000,000 for fiscal year 2016. This funding is for the installation of blender pumps by major fuel distributors at owned and branded stations, specifically for E-85 fuel. In this paragraph, E-85 fuel is defined as a blend of gasoline with approximately 85% ethanol content, while an ethanol fuel blend is a mix of gasoline and ethanol with 0-85% ethanol content. The term 'major fuel distributor' refers to a person owning a refinery or directly marketing its output, excluding those marketing through less than 50 retail fueling stations. The term 'major fuel distributor' excludes those marketing through less than 50 retail fueling stations. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the EPA Administrator and the Secretary of Agriculture, will promulgate regulations for major fuel distributors. The Secretary of Agriculture will promulgate regulations for major fuel distributors to ensure the installation of blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at majority-owned or branded stations in the US for a minimum of 5 years. The regulations require major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at majority-owned or branded stations for a minimum of 5 years. The regulations mandate major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at majority-owned or branded stations for a minimum of 5 years, with applicable percentages determined according to a specified table. The regulations require major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at majority-owned or branded stations. Applicable percentages increase over time: 10% in 2014, 20% in 2016, 35% in 2018, and 50% from 2020 onwards. Geographic distribution is also a factor. The regulations mandate major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at their stations. Starting from 2018, the requirement is set at 35%, increasing to 50% from 2020 onwards. Geographic distribution is a key consideration in implementing these regulations. The regulations require fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel and ethanol blends at a minimum percentage of their stations, ensuring geographic distribution. The Secretary mandates major fuel distributors to install blender pumps dispensing E-85 fuel in each State they operate to ensure availability. The Secretary requires major fuel distributors to take full financial responsibility for installing blender pumps and necessary equipment to ensure proper function. Additionally, production credits are given for exceeding the blender pumps installation requirement. The Secretary mandates major fuel distributors to bear the cost of installing blender pumps and essential equipment for their proper functioning. Production credits are provided for surpassing the installation requirement for blender pumps. The major fuel distributor earns credits for exceeding the required installation of blender pumps at owned and branded stations, which can be used in the following three calendar years. Trading credits are also allowed. The major fuel distributor can earn credits for exceeding blender pump installation requirements at owned and branded stations, which can be used in the following three consecutive calendar years. Credits can also be traded with other major fuel distributors. A major fuel distributor can earn credits for exceeding blender pump installation requirements at owned and branded stations, which can be used in the following three consecutive calendar years. Credits purchased cannot be used to fulfill the geographic distribution requirement. \"Loan guarantees available for renewable fuel pipeline projects.\" Loan guarantees available for renewable fuel pipeline projects.
