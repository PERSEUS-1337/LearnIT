    "content": "The Act titled \"High Performance Schools Act of 1999\" is established for the purpose of improving school performance. The Congress finds that American K-12 schools spend over $6 billion annually on energy costs, more than on books and computers combined. Educators and students perform best in a comfortable, healthy, and well-lit environment. Over half of the nation's K-12 schools are over 40 years old and need renovation for efficiency and comfort. Over half of our nation's K-12 schools are more than 40 years old and in need of renovation for efficiency and comfort. 6,000 new schools will be required over the next 10 years to accommodate the growing number of students. Inadequate ventilation, poor lighting, and uncomfortable temperatures can affect students' ability to concentrate and excel. Older schools often have inefficient water usage. A whole building approach is recommended for designing new schools. Inefficient water use in older schools can impact student performance. A whole building approach in designing new schools leads to high performance buildings and improves student and teacher performance. Adopting a whole building approach in school construction can lead to high performance buildings, lower life-cycle costs, and energy conservation, resulting in savings for educational resources. Construction and renovation projects in schools can save a significant amount on energy costs, allowing more funds for teachers and educational materials. Utilizing renewable energy sources like daylighting, passive solar heating, and wind power can meet a building's energy needs without increasing emissions. Additionally, using environmentally friendly products and ensuring adequate fresh air supply can improve indoor air quality in school buildings. Congress is considering legislation to help school districts improve indoor air quality and implement energy-efficient design and technologies in new school construction and renovations. The purpose of this Act is to assist school districts in producing high-performance elementary schools. Congress is considering legislation to assist school districts in building new schools and renovating existing ones to create high-performance, healthful, energy-efficient, and environmentally sound buildings. The legislation aims to help school districts construct new high-performance, energy-efficient buildings. The High Performance Schools Program is established in the Department of Education to provide grants to school districts for energy efficiency and program implementation. The High Performance Schools Program in the Department of Education provides grants to school districts to achieve energy efficiency performance levels at least 30 percent beyond the 1998 International Energy Conservation Code for new construction and existing buildings. Grants are given to districts with a demonstrated need due to increasing school enrollments or renovation investments. The High Performance Schools Program provides grants to school districts with demonstrated need for responding to enrollment increases or renovating facilities. Districts must show inadequate funds and commit to developing high performance buildings with the grant funds. The High Performance Schools Program provides grants to school districts with demonstrated need for responding to enrollment increases or renovating facilities. Districts must show inadequate funds and commit to developing high performance buildings with the grant funds, which can also be used for evaluating compliance and promoting the development of high performance school buildings. The High Performance Schools Program promotes the development of high performance school buildings through distributing information, organizing programs, obtaining technical services, and collecting data. The High Performance Schools Program promotes the development of high performance school buildings through distributing information, organizing programs, obtaining technical services, and collecting data. Grants can be used for promotional activities, facilitating financing, promoting energy service companies, and working with school communities. Grants under subsection (b) are provided to school districts with feasible plans developed in consultation with State offices of energy and education to achieve program purposes. The State agency, designated by the Governor, develops feasible plans for grants in energy and education. School districts are encouraged to supplement grant funds with other sources for plan implementation. SEC. 4. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS. Funds appropriated for the implementation of this Act shall be provided to Governors of the States, who will determine the State agency to administer the program of assistance to school districts. Funds allocated under section 5 will be divided with 70% for grants under section 3(b)(1), 15% for grants under section 3(b)(2), and 15% for grants under section 3(b)(3). Seventy percent of funds will be used for grants under section 3(b)(1), fifteen percent for grants under section 3(b)(2), and another fifteen percent for grants under section 3(b)(3). The Secretary of Education may retain up to $300,000 per year to assist State agencies in coordinating and implementing the program, including developing reference materials for high-performance school buildings. SEC. 5. Authorization of appropriations for grants under section 3(b) totaling $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, increasing annually to $230,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, with additional funding as needed for the following 6 fiscal years. SEC. 6. Definitions. The Act defines \"elementary school\" and \"secondary school\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. It also defines a \"high performance school building\" as one that maximizes renewable energy use, is cost-effective, and promotes energy conservation practices. A \"high performance school building\" maximizes renewable energy use, promotes energy conservation practices, and uses environmentally preferable materials. Renewable energy includes solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass power."
