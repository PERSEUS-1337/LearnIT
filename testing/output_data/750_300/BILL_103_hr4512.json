    "content": "The \"Welfare to Work Act of 1994\" may be cited as the short title. The Congress acknowledges the importance of transitioning individuals from welfare to work. The Congress recognizes the challenges welfare recipients face in finding entry-level jobs leading to permanent employment. They believe that exchanging AFDC payments for work would have greater economic value than traditional government workfare programs. AFDC recipients believe exchanging payments for work is more beneficial than government workfare programs. This approach aims to break the welfare cycle, provide a pathway to permanent employment, and support businesses in hiring AFDC recipients. To break the welfare cycle and support AFDC recipients in finding permanent employment, a one-year tax credit should be given to businesses for wages paid to employees who no longer qualify for AFDC benefits. SEC. 3. REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR HIRING AFDC RECIPIENTS. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a refundable credit for businesses hiring AFDC recipients. A credit against the tax imposed for the taxable year is allowed for qualified first-year wages, with 50% of wages up to $6,000 and 25% of wages between $6,000 and $12,000. Qualified first-year wages are defined as wages for services rendered in the 1-year period after the individual begins work. The term 'qualified first-year wages' refers to wages for services rendered in the 1-year period after the individual begins work for the employer. The 1-year period may be reduced by prior periods the individual worked for other employers if those wages were considered qualified first-year wages by another employer. The term 'qualified wages' refers to wages paid to qualified former AFDC recipients during the taxable year. The term 'wages' is defined as per section 51(d), excluding paragraph (4) thereof. The term 'qualified former AFDC recipient' refers to individuals certified by the designated local agency as family members receiving benefits under a State plan approved under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act. The term 'qualified former AFDC recipient' refers to individuals certified by the designated local agency as family members receiving benefits under a State plan approved under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act. An agency member is someone whose wages make their family ineligible for benefits under the State plan, excluding individuals in a targeted group. No credit is allowed for wages used to replace existing workers. No credit is allowed for wages paid to a qualified former AFDC recipient who replaces an employee with satisfactory performance and is terminated without cause. Certain definitions and special rules from section 51 apply for this purpose. Technical amendments are made to section 280C of the Code. Technical amendments are made to section 280C of the Code, with rules similar to subsections (d)(16), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), and (k) of section 51 and section 52 applying for this purpose. The Code is amended to include a new item in the table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The amendments made by this section apply to individuals who start working for the employer after the enactment of this Act."
