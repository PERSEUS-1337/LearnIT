    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Amendments Act of 2005\". It includes findings related to the Act. The \"Flood Control Act of 1944\" aimed to promote economic development in the US. The Oahe Dam Project, a part of this program, benefits the national economy but flooded Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation land. The Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project flooded the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation, causing economic and cultural damage to the tribe. Congress has compensated several tribes, including the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, affected by the Pick-Sloan projects. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe suffered injury from the Pick-Sloan projects, leading to inadequate compensation. Congress enacted the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act, creating a Tribal Recovery Trust Fund, but did not provide additional compensation for tribal members who lost land due to the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act created the Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund. The Act did not provide additional compensation for tribal members who lost land due to the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project. The purposes of the Act are to compensate tribal members who lost land and to capitalize the Trust Fund. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act established the Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund to compensate tribal members who lost land due to the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act is amended to address the inadequate compensation for land acquired under the Oahe Dam and Reservation project. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act is amended to ensure adequate compensation for land acquired by the United States from the Tribe and member landowners. This includes inserting \"and member landowners\" after \"Tribe\" in subsection (b)(1) and reorganizing definitions in Section 103 of the Act. The Equitable Compensation Act (Public Law 106-511; 114 Stat. 2365) is amended to define \"member landowner\" as a Tribe member or heir who owned land on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation acquired by the United States. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund under the Equitable Compensation Act is amended to include a definition of \"member landowner\" as a Tribe member or heir who owned land on the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation acquired by the United States for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Recovery Trust Fund is amended to include funding provisions, with the Secretary of the Treasury depositing 25 percent of the power program's proceeds into the Fund annually. The Treasury receives funds from the power program annually, with a specific amount deposited each fiscal year. The total amount deposited equals a set sum plus an additional amount. The amount referred to in paragraph (1)(B) is $290,722,958 plus interest or earnings that would have accrued if invested as of October 1, 2001. The amount invested in accordance with subsection (c) as of October 1, 2001 will have interest and earnings determined by applying the Lehman Government Bond Index. In subsection (d)(1), the start date for accruing interest is changed to October 1, 2005. The plan may provide for additional compensation to member landowners for land acquisition by the United States. The plan may provide for additional compensation to member landowners for land acquisition by the United States for the Oahe Dam and Reservoir Project. The Secretary of the Interior will provide records to the Tribe to help process claims of heirs of member landowners for the acquired land.
