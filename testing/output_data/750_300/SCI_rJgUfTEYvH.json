Recent works have explored probabilistic models, but they are computationally expensive or do not optimize data likelihood directly. This work introduces multi-frame video prediction with normalizing flows, enabling direct optimization. Our work introduces multi-frame video prediction with normalizing flows, allowing for direct optimization of data likelihood and high-quality stochastic predictions. Flow-based generative models offer a competitive approach to video generative modeling. Flow-based generative models are a viable approach to video generative modeling, with exponential progress in computational hardware and machine learning pushing the field into the mainstream. Machine learning advancements have improved various capabilities, but the application is often limited by the need for large amounts of supervision. The application of machine learning technology has been constrained to situations with large supervision or accurate simulations. An alternative is to use large unlabeled datasets with generative models for effective prediction of future events. Utilizing large unlabeled datasets with predictive generative models, such as in game-playing agents, offers an appealing alternative to supervised learning. Complex generative models must build an internal representation of the world to effectively predict future events, like physical interactions in videos. This approach allows for building models with a rich understanding of the physical world without the need for labeled examples. Building models with a rich understanding of the physical world can be achieved through large generative models trained on unlabeled datasets containing video sequences. This approach is useful for learning representations for downstream tasks or for applications like robotics where predicting the future enables effective decision making and control. In video prediction, the future is uncertain, and probabilistic models are studied to represent uncertain futures. However, these models are either computationally expensive or do not directly optimize data likelihood. This paper focuses on the problem of stochastic prediction. This paper focuses on stochastic prediction in video synthesis, proposing new models for generating diverse and realistic future frames based on past observations. This paper introduces a new class of video prediction models that can generate diverse and realistic future frames based on past observations. The approach extends flow-based generative models into conditional video prediction, addressing the unique challenges of high-dimensional video data. Flow-based models have been used for non-temporal data like images and audio sequences. Conditional video generation poses challenges due to the high dimensionality of video sequences. A latent dynamical system model is employed to predict future values, inducing Markovian dynamics on the latent state. An architecture inspired by the Glow model for image generation is described for flow-based video prediction models. VideoFlow is a flow-based video prediction model inspired by the Glow model for image generation. It achieves competitive results in stochastic video prediction on the BAIR dataset, rivaling the best VAE-based models. It produces high-quality qualitative results and avoids common artifacts seen in other models. VideoFlow achieves competitive results in stochastic video prediction on the BAIR dataset, producing high-quality qualitative results and avoiding common artifacts. It offers faster test-time image synthesis, making it practical for real-time applications like robotic control. VideoFlow optimizes the likelihood of training videos without relying on a variational lower bound. VideoFlow achieves faster test-time image synthesis for real-time applications like robotic control by optimizing the likelihood of training videos directly. Previous work focused on deterministic predictive models for future video frames. Predictive models have been a focus in research, with an emphasis on architectural changes and different generation objectives. The next challenge is to develop models that can successfully model deterministic environments. The next challenge in research is to address stochastic environments by building models that can effectively reason over uncertain futures in real-world videos. These videos are inherently stochastic due to random events or unobserved factors, such as off-screen events, unknown intentions of humans and animals, and objects with unknown physical properties. In stochastic environments, models struggle to predict uncertain futures in real-world videos due to random events or unobserved factors like off-screen events, unknown intentions, and objects with unknown properties. To address this challenge, various methods incorporate stochasticity through models based on variational auto-encoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks, and autoregressive approaches. Various methods incorporate stochasticity through models like variational auto-encoders (VAEs), generative adversarial networks, and autoregressive models. Among these, variational autoencoders optimizing an evidence lower bound on log-likelihood have been widely explored. Video prediction models based on variational autoencoders have been widely explored, while auto-regressive models directly maximize the log-likelihood of the data. However, synthesis with auto-regressive models is typically sequential and inefficient on modern hardware. Efforts have been made to speed up training and synthesis with such models. Video prediction models based on variational autoencoders have been widely explored, with efforts to speed up training and synthesis. The proposed VAE model produces better predictions compared to auto-regressive models, especially for longer horizons, exhibiting faster sampling and optimizing log-likelihood for high-quality long-term predictions. The proposed method for video prediction models utilizes a multi-scale architecture with stochastic variables for faster sampling and high-quality long-term predictions. Flow-based generative models offer advantages such as exact latent-variable inference and log-likelihood evaluation. At each timestep, xt is encoded into multiple levels of stochastic variables (zt) in flow-based generative models. These models offer advantages like exact latent-variable inference and log-likelihood evaluation. The latent variable z corresponding to a datapoint x is inferred by transforming x through invertible compositions. The transformations are constrained to be invertible to compute the log-likelihood of x exactly using the change of variables rule. In flow-based generative models, latent variables are inferred by transforming data through invertible compositions. The log-likelihood of the data is computed exactly using the change of variables rule. Parameters are learned by maximizing log-likelihood over a training set, allowing for sample generation from the data distribution. In flow-based generative models, latent variables are inferred through invertible compositions. A generative flow for video is proposed, breaking up the latent space into separate variables per timestep. The model uses a multi-scale architecture for generating frames of video. The multi-scale architecture for generating frames of video involves using invertible transformations to infer latent variables. The latent variable z is composed of multiple levels, each encoding information about the frame at a particular scale. The Jacobian determinant of the transformations is chosen to be simple to compute. In this subsection, invertible transformations with simple Jacobian determinants are chosen for convenience. Different types of matrices are explored for this purpose, such as triangular, diagonal, and permutation matrices. Specific techniques like Actnorm and Coupling are applied to the input data for further processing. In this subsection, invertible transformations with simple Jacobian determinants are chosen for convenience, including diagonal matrices. Techniques like Actnorm, Coupling, SoftPermute, and Squeeze are applied to process the input data efficiently. In this subsection, invertible transformations with simple Jacobian determinants are chosen for convenience. Techniques like Actnorm, Coupling, SoftPermute, and Squeeze are applied to reshape the input and infer latent variables at different levels for a multi-scale architecture. The multi-scale architecture uses invertible transformations to infer latent variables at different levels for each frame of the video. The latent prior is factorized using an autoregressive approach to obtain the set of corresponding latent variables. The latent prior in the multi-scale architecture is factorized using an autoregressive approach to infer latent variables at different levels for each frame of the video. The conditional prior is specified with a factorization that includes dependencies between latent variables at previous timesteps and at the same level. The architecture described in the appendix utilizes a factorized Gaussian density with a deep 3-D residual network to predict mean and log-scale. The log-likelihood objective involves the sum of log Jacobian determinants of invertible transformations mapping the video frames to latent variables. The log-likelihood objective of Equation (1) in Section B and C of the appendix consists of two parts: the invertible multi-scale architecture contributes via log Jacobian determinants, and the latent dynamics model contributes via log p \u03b8 (z) (Equation 5). Parameters are jointly learned by maximizing this objective, with the prior p \u03b8 (z) modeling temporal dependencies and the flow g \u03b8 acting on separate video frames. Fooling rates for SAVP-VAE, VideoFlow, and SV2P are provided in Table 1. In the architecture, the prior p \u03b8 (z) models temporal dependencies, while the flow g \u03b8 operates on video frames. Comparison of realism between SAVP-VAE and SV2P is done using a real-vs-fake 2AFC Amazon Mechanical Turk. VideoFlow model is conditioned on frame t = 1, generating trajectories at t = 2 and t = 3 for different shapes. Experimentation with 3-D convolutional flows was deemed computationally expensive compared to an autoregressive prior. VideoFlow model generates trajectories at t = 2 and t = 3 for different shapes. 3-D convolutional flows were found to be computationally expensive compared to an autoregressive prior. Due to memory limits, only a small number of sequential frames per gradient step could be used. Using 2-D convolutions is preferred to avoid changing the model's input distribution between training and synthesis, which can lead to temporal artifacts. Using 2-D convolutions in the flow f \u03b8 with autoregressive priors allows for synthesizing long sequences without introducing temporal artifacts. The generated videos display a blue border for conditioning frames and a red border for generated frames. VideoFlow is used to model the Stochastic Movement Dataset. Visit the website to view all generated videos and qualitative results. VideoFlow is used to model the Stochastic Movement Dataset. The first frame of each video shows a shape on a gray background, moving in one of eight directions with constant speed. A deterministic model averages out all possible directions in pixel space. The position of the shape at the next step can be predicted using only the speed of movement. VideoFlow is utilized to model the Stochastic Movement Dataset, where a deterministic model averages out all possible directions in pixel space. By extracting random temporal patches of 2 frames from each video, the model maximizes the loglikelihood of the second frame given the first, resulting in a low bits-per-pixel of 0.04. The VideoFlow model achieves a low bits-per-pixel of 0.04 on the holdout set by predicting future trajectories of shapes in videos. Comparison with other models like SV2P and SAVP-VAE is done using a real vs fake test on Amazon Mechanical Turk. VideoFlow outperforms SV2P and SAVP-VAE models in generating realistic videos, as shown in a real vs fake test on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The model achieves a low bits-per-pixel of 0.04 by predicting future trajectories of shapes in videos using the action-free BAIR robot pushing dataset. VideoFlow outperforms SV2P and SAVP-VAE models in generating realistic videos from the action-free BAIR robot pushing dataset. The models generate plausible trajectories with multiple outcomes due to partial observability and stochasticity. Training involves conditioning on input frames to generate target frames, with VideoFlow maximizing log-likelihood to achieve low bits-per-pixel. We train baseline models SAVP-VAE, SV2P, and SVG-LP to generate 10 target frames conditioned on 3 input frames. VideoFlow is trained to maximize log-likelihood of Bits-per-pixel. Average bits-per-pixel across 10 target frames is reported for the BAIR action-free dataset. Realism and diversity are measured using a 2AFC test and mean pairwise cosine distance in VGG perceptual space. Models have seen a total of 13 frames during training. Variational bound of bits-per-pixel is estimated. VideoFlow outperforms SAVP-VAE and SV2P models in bits-per-pixel on the test set. The high values of bits-per-pixel for the baselines are attributed to their optimization objective, which does not directly optimize the variational bound on the log-likelihood due to the presence of a \u03b2 = 1 term in their objective and scheduled sampling.

Conditioning frames are used to sample 100 videos from stochastic video generation models, with the closest video to the ground-truth selected based on PSNR, SSIM, and VGG perceptual metrics. The models were trained with ten target frames but tested to generate 27 frames, with the best possible values reported for each metric. The models were trained with ten target frames but tested to generate 27 frames. The closest video to the ground-truth was selected based on PSNR, SSIM, and VGG perceptual metrics. Higher values are better for all reported metrics. The BAIR robot-pushing dataset is stochastic, with many plausible futures. To evaluate the model, metrics from prior work were used. The model was evaluated by generating 100 videos from stochastic models and comparing them to the ground truth using PSNR, SSIM, and VGG perceptual metrics. In prior work, researchers evaluated generated videos using PSNR, SSIM, and VGG metrics to compare them to the ground truth. They found that tuning pixel-level variance and removing noise improved sample quality. In prior work, researchers found that tuning pixel-level variance and removing noise improved sample quality in videos. This can be achieved by sampling videos at a lower temperature, similar to a procedure in (Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018). By scaling the standard deviation of the latent gaussian distribution, higher quality videos can be obtained at the cost of diversity. In (Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018), networks trained with additive coupling layers can sample frames with a temperature T by scaling the standard deviation of the latent gaussian distribution. Results are reported with temperatures of 1.0 and optimal temperatures tuned using VGG similarity metrics. Low-temperature sampling hurt performance for SV2P and SAVP-VAE. Hyperparameters with disappearing arms perform best for SAVP-VAE. Our model with optimal temperature performs better or as well as the SAVP-VAE and SVG-LP models on VGG-based similarity metrics, which correlate well with human perception and SSIM. The model with temperature T = 1.0 is also competitive with state-of-the-art video generation models on these metrics. Our model with temperature T = 1.0 performs well on VGG-based similarity metrics, correlating with human perception and SSIM. VideoFlow, on the other hand, underperforms on PSNR as it models the conditional probability of joint distribution of frames. In terms of diversity and quality, we generate 10 videos for each set of conditioning frames in the test set and compute the mean distance in VGG perceptual space across these pairs. VideoFlow outperforms diversity values reported in prior work (Lee et al., 2018) while being competitive in realism. It also has the highest fooling rate at T = 0.6. VideoFlow outperforms diversity values from prior work at T = 0.6, with the highest fooling rate. Lower temperatures result in more realistic arm behavior, while higher temperatures lead to a more stochastic motion with noisier background objects. At higher temperatures, the arm motion becomes more stochastic, leading to a drop in realism. Interpolations between different shapes and frames are displayed in the BAIR robot pushing dataset using VideoFlow encoder. Interpolations between the initial and final frames of two test videos in the BAIR robot pushing dataset show cohesive arm motion. The VideoFlow encoder is used to encode frames into latent space for interpolation, with different levels capturing motion of objects at various scales. The multi-level latent representation is used for interpolating motion of background objects and arm motion. Different shapes with fixed type but varying size and color are encoded into the latent space, showing smooth interpolation of shape size. Colors are sampled from a uniform distribution during training, with all interpolated colors matching those in the training set. During training, colors of shapes are sampled from a uniform distribution, reflected in experiments where all interpolated colors match those in the training set. VideoFlow is used to detect the plausibility of temporally inconsistent frames in the future. Our VideoFlow model can predict future frames with temporal consistency, even in the presence of occlusions. The latent state z t is limited to information present in frame x t due to a bijection between them. The VideoFlow model can forget objects if they are occluded for a few frames, due to the bijection between the latent state z t and frame x t. Future work aims to address this by incorporating longer memory in the model, such as using recurrent neural networks or more memory-efficient backpropagation algorithms. The VideoFlow model uses recurrent neural networks or memory-efficient backpropagation algorithms to detect temporally inconsistent frames in videos. It conditions on the first three frames of a video to predict the plausibility of the 4th frame occurring. VideoFlow model uses recurrent neural networks to predict the likelihood of the 4th frame in a video based on the first three frames. The model assigns decreasing log-likelihood to frames further in the future, showing less likelihood to occur in the 4th time-step. The architecture is inspired by the Glow model for image generation.

Future work includes incorporating memory for long-range dependencies and applying the model to challenging tasks. The dataset consists of 8-bit videos with each dimension rescaled to the domain [0, 255/256]. The dataset consists of 8-bit videos rescaled to [0, 255/256] with added uniform noise to prevent infinite densities at datapoints. The empirical distribution is adjusted with additive noise to prevent infinite densities at datapoints, aiding in optimization of log-likelihood. Lowering temperature in latent gaussian priors of VAE models decreases performance, with VideoFlow benefiting from low-temperature sampling. Lowering temperature from 1.0 to 0.0 decreases VAE models' performance, while VideoFlow benefits from low-temperature sampling due to noise removal tradeoff. Reducing temperature reduces stochasticity in arm motion, impacting performance. Correlation shown between training progression and generated quality.

Hyperparameters include a learning rate schedule with linear warmup and linear decay, training for 300K steps with Adam optimizer. Models were tuned using VGG cosine similarity metric. Latent loss multiplier values used are 1e-3, 1e-4, and 1e-5. SAVP-VAE model applies linear decay on learning rate for the last 100K steps. For the SAVP-GAN model, tuning involves adjusting the gan loss multiplier and learning rate on a logscale. Comparisons are made between P(X4 = Xt|X<4) and VGG cosine similarity, as well as correlation between cosine similarity and bits-per-pixel using a pretrained VGG network. In the low parameter regime, VideoFlow model with 4x parameter reduction remains competitive with SVG-LP on VGG perceptual metrics, showing a weak correlation between VGG perceptual metrics and bits-per-pixel.
