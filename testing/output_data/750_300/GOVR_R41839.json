The CFPB will have supervisory and enforcement authority over a wide range of consumer financial products and services, including deposit taking, mortgage lending, credit card lending, loan servicing, debt collection, and more. It will serve as the primary federal consumer financial supervisor for many institutions offering these services and can prescribe regulations to implement existing consumer laws. The CFPB, as the primary federal consumer financial supervisor, will have authority to implement existing consumer laws like TILA and RESPA. Some of its powers took effect when Dodd-Frank was signed in 2010, with others to follow.

The appointment of a Director also affects the Bureau's authority. The designated transfer date for the CFPB's powers is July 21, 2011.

After this date, the Bureau will acquire consumer compliance supervisory and enforcement powers over larger depository institutions, as well as rulemaking authority under various consumer laws. The Secretary's interim Bureau powers may be more expansive post-transfer date. The Secretary's interim Bureau powers may expand after the transfer date, potentially leading to substantive actions impacting financial institutions in consumer markets. For example, the FRB proposed regulations under TILA authority. The FRB proposed regulations under its TILA authority to impose origination standards on certain mortgage lenders, with a 474-page proposal open for comments until July 22, 2011. The authority to prescribe regulations under TILA will transfer to the Bureau on July 21, 2011. On July 21, 2011, the authority to prescribe regulations under TILA will transfer to the Bureau. Final regulations imposing mortgage origination standards must be prescribed by the Bureau, not the FRB. The Secretary may also have the authority to issue these regulations until a Bureau Director is appointed. The authority to prescribe regulations under TILA will be transferred to the Bureau under CFP Act, subtitle F. The Secretary may issue final regulations until a Bureau Director is appointed, but the limits of the Secretary's authorities may not always be clear. The CFP Act may be open to multiple interpretations, leading to potential lawsuits from parties impacted by the Secretary's actions. Parties impacted by the CFP Act may initiate lawsuits claiming actions exceed the Secretary's authority due to multiple interpretations of the legislation. Predicting outcomes of such lawsuits is challenging due to various facts and circumstances involved."
