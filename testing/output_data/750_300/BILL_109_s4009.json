    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmental Justice Enforcement Act of 2006\". The Act, known as the \"Environmental Justice Enforcement Act of 2006,\" is necessary due to a Supreme Court decision in Alexander v. Sandoval that weakens statutory protections against discrimination established by Congress over almost four decades. The decision undermines these protections by denying victims of discrimination the right to seek redress in Federal court. The Sandoval decision undermines protections against discrimination established by Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by denying victims the right to bring action in Federal court. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was created to prevent federal funding from supporting discriminatory programs based on race, color, or national origin. Regulations were put in place to ensure broad protections for beneficiaries of the law. The Department of Justice's regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 aimed to prevent discrimination and retaliation in programs receiving federal funding. The regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibit retaliation and discrimination in federally funded programs. These regulations, drafted by executive branch officials involved in drafting the Act, have never been invalidated despite a failed attempt by Congress in 1966. The Supreme Court has acknowledged Congress's failure to disapprove these regulations. Congress considered and rejected a proposal to invalidate the disparate impact regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court has recognized that Congress's failure to disapprove regulations implies that they accurately reflect congressional intent. Title VI was designed to benefit those discriminated against and relied on private attorneys general for enforcement. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 aimed to benefit those discriminated against and relied on private attorneys general for enforcement. The Supreme Court affirmed individuals' private right of action in cases of discrimination under Title VI. The Supreme Court affirmed individuals' private right of action in cases of discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, despite the need for explicit statutory statements of a right of action. The Supreme Court recognized an implied right of action under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, despite the need for explicit statutory statements of a right of action. Congress established a right to attorney's fees in private actions brought under Title VI in 1972. In 1972, Congress established a right to attorney's fees in private actions brought under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court had no basis in law or legislative history for denying a right of action under regulations promulgated pursuant to title VI while permitting it under the statute. The regulations were congressionally mandated and specifically directed by Congress to effectuate the Act. The regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were congressionally mandated to effectuate antidiscrimination provisions, stressing their importance by requiring approval from the President. Regulations prohibiting discriminatory practices are consistent with prohibitions of disparate treatment, which require intent to be shown. Regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 must be approved by the President. Prohibitions on discriminatory practices align with prohibitions on disparate treatment, which require intent to be shown. The Supreme Court cases Griggs v. Duke Power Co., Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., and Washington v. Davis provide guidance on identifying unlawful discrimination based on disproportionate burden, invidious purpose, and impact on different races. The interpretation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits practices that may have an invidious purpose, as evidenced by the disparate impact method of proof in discrimination cases. The interpretation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits practices with disparate impact, as seen in enforcing title VII. The Supreme Court's use of a disparate impact standard reinforces this stance. The Federal financial assistance is reinforced by the use of a disparate impact standard in enforcing title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Congress reinstated the disparate impact standard as law in the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Congress also reinstated a private right of action under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By reinstating a private right of action under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress ensures entities are not unfairly accused of discrimination based solely on numerical imbalances. Without this right, equality of opportunity may solely rely on Federal agencies, which could fail to take necessary action. Action by Congress to specify a private right of action under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is necessary to ensure individuals have a remedy if denied equal access to various programs and services. This is crucial as Federal agencies may not always take necessary action due to administrative burdens or other reasons. Individuals must have a remedy if denied equal access to various programs and services under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court's decision in Sandoval has led to the dismissal of many claims challenging discriminatory actions. Maintaining a private right of action is crucial for addressing discrimination. The regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 challenge actions with discriminatory effects. A private right of action will be maintained by waiving sovereign immunity, as with other provisions of the Act. SEC. 3. PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION. Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to include provisions regarding discrimination based on disparate impact. An aggrieved person must demonstrate that a covered entity has a policy or practice causing a disparate impact on race, color, or national origin. An aggrieved person must show that a covered entity's policy or practice causes a disparate impact based on race, color, or national origin, and the entity fails to prove it is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals. The aggrieved person must demonstrate that a particular policy or practice causes a disparate impact based on race, color, or national origin, and show that a less discriminatory alternative exists but is not adopted by the covered entity. The aggrieved person must demonstrate that each challenged policy or practice causes a disparate impact, unless the decisionmaking process cannot be separated for analysis. If a specific policy or practice is shown not to cause a disparate impact, the covered entity is not required to prove it. The decisionmaking process may be analyzed as one policy or practice. If a specific policy or practice does not cause a disparate impact, the covered entity is not required to prove it is necessary to achieve program goals. Demonstrating necessity for a policy or practice cannot be used as a defense against intentional discrimination claims. In the United States, no person shall face discrimination or retaliation for opposing prohibited policies, making charges, or participating in investigations under this title. The term 'demonstrates' in this context refers to meeting burdens of production and persuasion. SEC. 4. RIGHTS OF ACTION. Amends Section 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to allow any person aggrieved by a covered entity's failure to comply with the title to bring a civil action in Federal or State court. SEC. 5. RIGHT OF RECOVERY. Amends Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide for the right of recovery after section 602. SEC. 5. RIGHT OF RECOVERY. Amends Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide for the right of recovery for aggrieved persons. In an action brought under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, an aggrieved person can recover equitable and legal relief for intentional discrimination, including compensatory and punitive damages, attorney's fees, and costs. Punitive damages are not available against government entities. In an action brought under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, an aggrieved person can recover equitable relief, attorney's fees, and costs for unlawful discrimination based on disparate impact. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendments are retroactive to April 24, 2001, and apply to all actions pending on or after that date, except for actions against a State under the disparate impact standard."
