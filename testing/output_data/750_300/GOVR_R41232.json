Representative Norm Dicks and Chris Van Hollen cited Secretary of Defense Robert Gates' warning of war funding running out in August. Representative Norm Dicks and Chris Van Hollen raised concerns about war funding running out in August, leading to a House debate on a resolution invoking the War Powers Act to withdraw troops from Pakistan. The House debated a resolution to withdraw U.S. troops from Pakistan within 30 days or by December 31, 2010. The resolution was defeated, and the Senate failed to adopt cloture on a related bill. In FY2002, a resolution was defeated due to Pakistan public opinion hostility towards the United States. The Senate failed to adopt cloture on H.R. 4899, indicating inability to pass the bill.

The Senate and House had disagreements on the amended version, but ultimately, the President signed the bill into law on July 29, 2010. The House and Senate passed H.R. 4899 with funding totaling $81.8 billion. The bill was signed into law on July 29, 2010, providing $64.4 billion in supplemental funding for various purposes including deploying more troops for the Afghan War, disaster assistance, Haiti earthquake recovery, border security, and settling court cases for American Indians and black farmers. The FY2010 supplemental requests included $5.1 billion for U.S. Disaster Relief Fund, $33.0 billion for Defense Department to deploy troops to Afghanistan, $4.5 billion in foreign assistance for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan, $2.8 billion for Haiti reconstruction, $13.4 billion for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, and $243 million for appropriations-related.

The Senate and House considered H.R. 4899, which included $3.4 billion for land trust claims of American Indians and $1.2 billion for discrimination claims of black farmers in the Pigford II case. One of the main issues was the effect of this spending on the federal deficit, with different amounts of rescissions and mandatory savings spending in each version of the bill. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 4899 included various amounts of offsets to reduce spending, with the final version containing $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings to offset proposed spending of $81.8 billion. The impact on the deficit depends on the net amount of new Budget Authority needed. In the amended version of H.R. 4899, $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings were included to offset the proposed $81.8 billion spending. Congressional rules dictate that spending must align with discretionary and mandatory spending limits unless designated as emergencies. The final version of H.R. 4899 allocated almost all of its $45.8 billion discretionary spending as emergency funds. In the final version of H.R. 4899, almost all $45.8 billion in discretionary spending was designated as emergency funds, exempt from budget caps. Congress has the authority to designate spending as emergency, distinguishing between discretionary and direct (mandatory) spending. The President's supplemental request includes $64.4 billion in spending, with $46.3 billion as discretionary and $18.1 billion as mandatory. The requests were submitted to Congress as part of the FY2011 budget amendments. The Administration submitted emergency supplemental funding requests to Congress as part of the FY2011 budget, totaling $64.4 billion in discretionary and mandatory spending. Emergency appropriations are seen as bypassing budgetary constraints, with Congress defining emergency spending as essential, sudden, compelling, or unanticipated. In the current fiscal environment, some Members are concerned about the impact of additional spending on the deficit. Congress may debate whether to increase spending above the appropriated levels for the year and subsequent fiscal years. Members are concerned about the impact of additional spending on the deficit. Congress debates whether to increase spending above appropriated levels and must decide if the additional spending warrants increasing the budget deficit or if it should be offset by cutting federal spending or increasing revenues. Congress considers all spending and revenue legislation, including supplemental appropriations bills, within rules and procedures addressing these policy options. Congress considers all spending and revenue legislation, including supplemental appropriations bills, within rules and procedures to address policy options. The FY2010 supplemental appropriations request was considered within budget constraints and rules, such as congressional pay-as-you-go rules and the Statutory PAYGO Act of 2010. Congress could have exempted spending from these constraints by designating it as an emergency. Congress could have exempted spending from budget rules by designating it as an emergency, but this designation itself could be subject to a point of order. During consideration of the supplemental appropriation measure, an emergency designation could exempt spending from budget rules, but could also be subject to a point of order, which may be waived in both houses. In the House, a special rule can waive the point of order, while in the Senate, a waiver motion requiring a three-fifths affirmative vote of Senators can be used. During consideration of H.R. 4899 from late March to late July 2010, various government agencies and plaintiffs in legal cases cited deadlines for supplemental funding. Admiral Thad Allen and Secretary Janet Napolitano urged Congress to act in a June 4, 2010 letter. Admiral Thad Allen and Secretary Janet Napolitano urged Congress to raise the cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund due to insufficient funding for response operations within two weeks. The Coast Guard warned that the Emergency Fund from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund would run out in two weeks at the current response pace. They could hit the $150 million cap by June 18, 2010, and additional funds wouldn't be available until October 1, 2010. Congress passed S. 3473 to address the funding issue. The House and Senate passed S. 3473, P.L. 111-191, raising the cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to $1 billion for the Deepwater Horizon Spill. Funds can be withdrawn in $100 million increments and must be reported to Congress within seven days. The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion in bridge funds for war funding in FY2010. The Deepwater Horizon Spill act allows funds to be withdrawn in $100 million increments and must be reported to Congress within seven days. The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion in bridge funds for war funding in FY2010, almost double the previous year. Secretary of Defense Gates stated that an additional $33 billion was needed for troops deploying to Afghanistan by Memorial Day. Gates emphasized the need for an extra $33 billion for 30,000 troops deploying to Afghanistan by Memorial Day. The Army, Navy, and USMC could cover regular base activities and war operations through August 2010 based on current funding and requests. Based on DOD data, the Army, Navy, and USMC could cover regular base activities and war operations through August 2010. Secretary of Defense Gates expressed concern about the lack of progress on the supplemental funding and urged passage by July 4, as funds for the Navy and Marine Corps will run out in July, leading to disruptions in other programs. Secretary of Defense Gates expressed concern about the lack of progress on the supplemental funding, urging passage by July 4 as funds for the Navy and Marine Corps will run out in July, leading to disruptions in other programs. There is a risk of furloughing civilians and not being able to pay active duty military by mid-August if the base budget runs out. In early to mid-August, there is a risk of running out of funding in the base budget, leading to potential furloughs for civilians and inability to pay active duty military. The Army and Marine Corps could face funding shortages by August, with reprogramming requests needed for continued operations. Joseph Westphal testified that the Army had funds through mid-August and could last through the recess with approved reprogramming requests. Each service had funds available in their War Bridge Operation and Maintenance accounts, with the Army having $15.3 billion. The Army and Marine Corps could rely on already appropriated war bridge funds. The Army and Air Force received $2.2 billion and $1.3 billion respectively. Monthly spending increased by 20% as additional troops arrived. The Army and Marine Corps relied on already appropriated war bridge funds through August. Services tapped base budget funding to finance war funding temporarily. The services used base budget funding to temporarily finance war funding, allowing them to last through July and into August. FEMA also limited fund releases for disaster relief to extend funding until the FY2010 Supplemental was considered. In order to extend the Disaster Relief Fund until the FY2010 Supplemental was considered, FEMA limited fund releases for claims, delayed interagency reimbursements, and recovered funds from previous years. Despite initial estimates of insolvency by the end of June 2010, FEMA had a balance of $952 million in the Disaster Relief Fund as of June 7, 2010. FEMA had a balance of $952 million in the Disaster Relief Fund as of June 7, 2010, which could last another three months if spent at the normal rate of $350 million a month. FEMA had a balance of $952 million in the Disaster Relief Fund as of June 7, 2010, which could last another three months if spent at the normal rate of $350 million a month. However, there was a backlog of $1.4 billion in projects awaiting payment for infrastructure and mitigation projects, which did not meet the policy's immediate needs criteria. The State Department needed its disaster assistance funding replenished by June 1, 2010 to respond to future humanitarian crises, or else U.S. capacity to respond to emergencies could be limited. Congress did not enact the $1.15 billion appropriation. The State Department needed its disaster assistance funding replenished by June 1, 2010 to respond to future humanitarian crises. Congress did not enact the $1.15 billion appropriation by the mid-April 2010 deadline to settle the Pigford II court case. The settlement of the Cobell suit for government mismanagement of funds and lands held in trust for American Indians is a priority for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the White House. The deadline for Congress to approve the settlement is August 6, 2010, with uncertainty about further extensions. Members of Congress raised issues during consideration of the FY2010 supplemental regarding setting a timeline for congressional evaluation. The FY2010 supplemental raised issues for Congress to consider, including setting a timeline for evaluating spending on the Afghan War, preventing corruption in foreign aid for Afghanistan and Iraq, monitoring corruption in Haiti relief, and determining if additional domestic spending should be considered emergency spending or offset with prior year budget rescissions. The Administration requested $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund to prevent funding shortages for expected disaster needs and unanticipated claims. The FEMA Disaster Relief Fund is projected to run out of funds by May or June 2010, prompting FEMA to reduce expenditures by limiting payments to arbitration awards and immediate needs projects. In response to the projected shortage of funds in the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund by May or June 2010, FEMA implemented measures to reduce expenditures, including limiting payments to arbitration awards and immediate needs projects. Representative James Oberstar highlighted FEMA's actions in a May 5, 2010 hearing, mentioning limited claims payments, delayed reimbursements, and fund recovery from previous years to stretch available funds. Congress questioned why FEMA had not requested disaster relief funds earlier, raising concerns about the emergency nature of the situation and delays in congressional action on the supplemental. In response to the projected shortage of funds in the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund, FEMA implemented measures to reduce expenditures, including limiting payments to arbitration awards and immediate needs projects. Congress raised questions about the timing of disaster relief fund requests and delays in congressional action on the supplemental. Higher spending levels in recent years also raised concerns about FEMA's budgeting practices. Members did not express concerns about the limited information provided by FEMA on the fund's status or potential compensation payments from arbitration rulings. In response to concerns about FEMA's budgeting practices, the Obama Administration criticized previous administrations for unrealistic budgeting. The Administration requested $2.0 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund in FY2010, but Congress provided $1.6 billion. In FY2011, the Administration is requesting $1.9 billion for the DRF. Compared to previous years, neither request represents significant changes. The Obama Administration requested $2.0 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund in FY2010, but Congress provided $1.6 billion, $400 million below the request. In FY2011, the Administration is requesting $1.9 billion for the DRF, citing the occurrence of 59 disasters in 2009 and 18 in 2010. The current supplemental request is mainly for additional arbitration rulings, some related to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In 2010, 18 disasters occurred, compared to 74 in 2008 and 63 in 2007. The current supplemental request is mainly for additional arbitration rulings, some related to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Higher funding levels for the Disaster Relief Fund may be necessary to address the devastation caused by Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005 and 2008. Some argue for increased funding to avoid the need for supplemental funding, while others disagree. Recovery from disasters may take five years or longer. Congress may need to consider funding the Disaster Relief Fund at a higher level to avoid supplemental funding. Some argue for maintaining the status quo, while others believe disasters are unpredictable emergencies. FEMA's request for DRF replenishment lacks sufficient information for evaluation by Congress. FEMA's request for Disaster Relief Fund replenishment lacks sufficient information for Congress to evaluate. FEMA could provide more details on how the fund has been used for past disasters and pending arbitration cases to justify the $5.1 billion requested in P.L. 111-212. FEMA requested $5.1 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund in P.L. 111-212, with $5 million allocated to the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General. An additional $396 million was added for various disaster relief efforts. The final version of H.R. 4899 added $396 million in disaster relief funding for floods in Tennessee and Rhode Island, fishery disasters in Alaska, tornado damages in the Midwest, and Gulf Coast hurricane recovery projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the timeliness of information provided by OMB regarding disaster relief funding requirements. The FY2011 request is expected to be $1 billion to $2 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized OMB for delays in providing information on disaster relief funding. The FY2011 request is expected to fall short by $1-2 billion, including funds for Hurricane Katrina. H.R. 4899 allocated $5.1 billion for the DRF and additional funding for HUD and Army Corps of Engineers. The funding allocated for disaster-relief activities includes $100 million for Housing and Urban Development, $227 million for Army Corps of Engineers, $49 million for Commerce Department, and $18 million for Agriculture Department's emergency forest restoration program. The final version of H.R. 4899 allocated $10 million for drought relief and $49 million for the Commerce Department's economic development assistance program. It also included $18 million for the Agriculture Department's emergency forest restoration program. Additionally, the federal cost share for recovery from floods in Rhode Island and Tennessee was set at no less than 90%. FEMA was directed to create an interagency taskforce with the Army Corps of Engineers and OMB to address community concerns related to flood map updates. The interagency taskforce, comprised of the Army Corps of Engineers and OMB, will track and address community concerns related to FEMA's flood map updates. The DOD and State Department/USAID FY2010 supplemental requests provide funding for troop deployment to Afghanistan and economic assistance to support military operations. Obama's FY2011 budget submission focuses on counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. The Obama Administration requested a $33 billion supplemental appropriation for FY2010 to deploy additional troops to Afghanistan as part of the counterinsurgency strategy. The goal is to reverse the deteriorating security situation, target the insurgency, secure population centers, and train more Afghan forces. President Obama announced on December 1, 2009, the deployment of additional troops to Afghanistan to reverse the security situation, target the insurgency, secure population centers, and train Afghan forces. By June 1, almost 94,000 troops were in Afghanistan, with the remaining 4,000 expected by September 2010. The goal is to transfer responsibility to the Afghans by July 2011. As of June 1, nearly 94,000 troops were in Afghanistan, with the remaining 4,000 expected to arrive by September 2010. This deployment would bring the total number of troops in Afghanistan to around 98,000, tripling the number deployed in October 2008. Before leaving office, President Bush increased troop levels in response to security concerns, bringing the number close to 46,000 in May 2009. President Bush increased troop levels in Afghanistan to around 46,000 in May 2009. President Obama approved additional troop increases, bringing the total to 98,000 by fall 2010. NATO allies also increased troop levels from 38,370 in December 2009 to 48,000 in March 2010. The U.S. plans to increase its troop levels in Afghanistan to 98,000 by fall 2010, with NATO allies also increasing their troop levels to 48,000 by March 2010. The total number of foreign troops in Afghanistan is expected to reach about 148,000 by fall, with Afghan security forces totaling 243,000. The Defense Department's budget includes $33 billion to support the additional troops deploying to Afghanistan. The Defense Department requested $33 billion to support additional troops deploying to Afghanistan, with a total of 389,000 foreign and Afghan forces. The FY2010 war spending rose to $160 billion, with $99 billion for Afghanistan and $61 billion for Iraq. Total spending in FY2010 increased by $12 billion compared to FY2009. The FY2010 war spending totaled $160 billion, with $99 billion allocated for Afghanistan and $61 billion for Iraq. The total funding for the Afghan War reached $314.1 billion with the passage of the FY2010 Supplemental, and could rise to $427.7 billion if the FY2011 request is approved. In comparison, the total funding for Iraq was $706.2 billion with the FY2010 Supplemental, and could reach $752 billion with the pending FY2011 request. If the FY2011 request is approved, the total funding for the Afghan War could rise to $427.7 billion, while the total funding for Iraq could reach $752 billion. President Obama's new strategy deployment raised concerns about evaluating its effectiveness. President Obama's new strategy for the Afghan War raised concerns about evaluating its effectiveness and the timeline for U.S. forces' withdrawal, with a warning that the commitment was not open-ended and a potential delay in the July 2011 drawdown. Both Secretary of Defense Gates and Admiral Mullen emphasized that the July 2011 date marked the start of transitioning, not the complete withdrawal. The U.S. drawdown in July 2011 may be delayed, with Secretary Gates stating it could be a several-year process. General Petraeus described the initiative as an 18-month campaign to be evaluated in September 2011. Members of Congress raised concerns about the timing of the evaluation. General Petraeus, now head of U.S. Central Command, described the initiative as an 18-month campaign to be evaluated in September 2011. Concerns were raised by members of Congress about the timing of the evaluation and the long-term future of U.S. military involvement. During House consideration of H.R. 4899 on July 1, 2100, three amendments were debated and rejected to increase congressional participation in decision making about the U.S. military commitment. Amendments were debated and rejected to increase congressional participation in decision making about the U.S. military commitment. Amendment No. 3 proposed cutting off all funding for Afghanistan and was defeated 25 to 376. Amendment Number 4 aimed to limit DOD funding to the withdrawal of U.S. troops and was defeated 100 to 321. Amendment No. 5 required the Administration to submit a new National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) by April 4, 2010, with a timetable for troop redeployment. The Administration was required to submit a new National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) by April 4, 2010, outlining a timetable for troop redeployment from Afghanistan. Despite concerns rising after a military operation in Marjah, the amendment to begin an orderly withdrawal of U.S. troops after July 1, 2011 was defeated in Congress. Concerns have increased over Afghanistan following the operation to re-take Marjah with additional U.S. troops. The campaign for Kandahar, a Taliban stronghold, has been delayed. $30 billion of the $33 billion DOD supplemental request was allocated for Afghanistan. The $30 billion in DOD's supplemental request for Afghanistan included funds for operations, force protection, training Afghan security forces, higher fuel costs, equipment reconstitution, military intelligence, and more. The $30 billion DOD supplemental request for Afghanistan includes funds for operations, force protection, training Afghan security forces, higher fuel costs, equipment reconstitution, military intelligence, national intelligence, military construction, and defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Some policymakers estimate the cost of deploying 30,000 more troops at $1 million per troop. The DOD cost for deploying 30,000 more troops in Afghanistan is estimated at $1 million per troop. Different functional categories in the request include funding for military personnel, operations, and Coalition Support Funds for Pakistan's counter-terror operations. DOD developed functional categories for its request, with different funding rates for Operations and Coalition Support. Funding between FY2009 and FY2011 for the Afghan war is shown in Table 3. DOD's estimates differ from CBO's, and the Operations category is expected to increase with troop levels. DOD estimates for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan show a per troop cost of $875,000, higher than CBO's estimate of $467,000. Both DOD and CBO assume the same monthly troop strength, reflecting gradual troop deployment. The DOD per troop cost for deploying 30,000 troops to southern Afghanistan is higher than CBO's estimate. DOD attributes the high costs to setting up and operating facilities in a region with few existing troops. The DOD's request for additional troops in southern Afghanistan is high due to the need to set up and operate facilities in a region with few existing troops. In 2009, concerns about accurate budgeting for the wars led to funds being transferred to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act transferred $5 billion of DOD's Operation and Maintenance funding to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund (OCOTF) for future use. Concerns may arise about the accuracy of DOD's estimates for FY2010, as obligations reported in the first five months only account for 22% of the total requested amount. Monthly spending would need to more than double in the next seven months to utilize all funds. In the first five months of FY2010, DOD reported obligations for operational costs at 22% of the total requested amount. Monthly spending would need to double in the next seven months to utilize all funds, indicating that DOD's estimates may be high. An additional $2.6 billion was requested to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund. The DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund in FY2010, bringing total funding to $9.2 billion. Concerns were raised about the need for all the funds, achievability of the plan, oversight, training problems, contracting disputes, and trainer shortages. The DOD requested $2.6 billion in additional funds in FY2010 to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces. The new plan aims to increase Afghan Security forces to 243,000 by October 2010 and 305,600 by FY2011, with the Afghan Army growing to 171,000 and the Afghan Police to 134,000 by October 2011. The Afghan Army and Police saw significant growth from 2009 to 2011, with the Army increasing by 76% and the Police by 43%. NATO partners endorsed these increases in January 2010. The DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion in FY2010 to sustain the growth of the Afghan Army, pay soldiers more, and provide infrastructure. The DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion in FY2010 to sustain the growth of the Afghan Army, pay soldiers more, and provide infrastructure. Congress has appropriated $25.5 billion for the Afghan Security Forces so far, with pending requests for FY2010 and FY2011 totaling $14.2 billion, bringing the total through FY2011 to $39.8 billion. DOD has not provided an estimate of the ultimate cost or number of years needed to support Afghan Security forces. The DOD has requested an additional $2.6 billion in FY2010 to sustain the growth of the Afghan Army and pay soldiers more. General McChrystal proposed doubling the Afghan Army and Police to 400,000, but this goal has not been endorsed by the Obama Administration. DOD is responsible for training the Afghan Army, while both DOD and the State Department jointly manage training for the Afghan police. General Mullen described the goal of doubling the Afghan Army and Police to 400,000 as aspirational and not endorsed by the Obama Administration. Training for Afghan Security forces is managed jointly by DOD and the State Department, with U.S. military personnel, NATO teams, and private contractors carrying out the training. However, they have faced challenges such as high attrition rates, leadership deficiencies, absenteeism, logistical limitations, and questionable capabilities. The Department has faced numerous challenges in training Afghan security forces, including high attrition rates, leadership deficiencies, absenteeism, logistical limitations, illiteracy, corruption, and insurgent attacks on recruits and police. Coordination issues between DOD, State Department, and NATO have also been identified as significant problems. Hearings in 2010 highlighted problems in Afghan police training, including coordination issues between DOD, State Department, and NATO, reliance on problematic private contractors, and lack of personnel for contract management and oversight. Despite additional trainers from DOD and requests for more from NATO allies, challenges persist. Despite efforts to address shortages in personnel for contract management and oversight, concerns remain about the shortfall in trainers for the Afghan army and police. DOD has sent additional trainers and requested more from NATO allies, but there are still reported shortages, which could lead to increased reliance on contractors. Senator Levin cited concerns about the lack of trainers, with only 44% of the required trainers currently assigned. Despite efforts to address shortages in personnel for contract management and oversight, concerns remain about the shortfall in trainers for the Afghan army and police. DOD's April 1, 2010, Afghan Section 1230 Metrics report noted that only 44% of the required trainers are currently assigned. Members may want to know the number of trainers needed for initial and follow-on training, how this requirement will be met in terms of U.S. military personnel, coalition partner teams, and contractor personnel, and the current status of trainers in-country. Despite concerns about shortages in personnel for contract management and oversight, there are also worries about the shortfall in trainers for the Afghan army and police. The DOD's April 1, 2010, Afghan Section 1230 Metrics report highlighted that only 44% of the required trainers are currently assigned. Questions arise regarding the number of trainers needed for initial and follow-on training, how this requirement will be met in terms of U.S. military personnel, coalition partner teams, and contractor personnel, and the current status of trainers in-country. Additionally, there are uncertainties about the impact on DOD's funding if these personnel are not available as expected, potentially hampering the ramp-up of training efforts. The Afghan police training contract was delayed due to a bid-protest, but Congress allowed the Secretary of State to use a previously awarded contract. DOD planned to hold a full competition, which would have caused further delays and reduced funding in FY2010. DOD still has nearly $3.6 billion in funding available according to reports from May 31, 2010. DOD intended to hold a full competition for the Afghan police training contract, which would have caused delays and reduced funding in FY2010. However, DOD still has almost $3.6 billion in available funding from FY2009 and FY2010. This suggests that DOD had an additional six months of funding available for the rest of FY2010, even without the additional $2.6 billion requested in the supplemental. Members have raised concerns about the necessity of emergency supplementals for ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some Members question the need for emergency war supplementals as DOD had almost $3.6 billion available for FY2010, even without the $2.6 billion requested. DOD's original FY2010 request was enacted in the DOD Appropriations Act. The decision to deploy more troops in December 2009 could justify an emergency designation for the supplemental request. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-118) included funding for war efforts. Some argue that the supplemental request should be designated as emergency spending due to the deployment of additional troops. Key components of the request include funding for training Iraqi Security Forces, offsetting fuel increases, and replacing war-worn equipment. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act included funding for war efforts, with key components such as training Iraqi Security Forces, offsetting fuel increases, and replacing war-worn equipment. Some argue that certain requests, like $1 billion for training in the Iraqi Security Forces Fund, are less clearly related to new deployments and should be part of DOD's regular FY2011 appropriation request. Congress has become less willing to pay for Iraqi security forces with the turnover of responsibility to the Iraqi government and the rise in oil prices in 2008. Congress has become less willing to fund Iraqi security forces due to the turnover of responsibility to the Iraqi government and the rise in oil prices in 2008. The $1 billion for the Iraqi Security Forces Fund is argued to be necessary for modernization efforts and to ensure security in Iraq, especially with lower oil revenues. Some may challenge the emergency designation of this funding, suggesting that it could be covered in DOD's base budget. Additionally, providing $2 billion for higher fuel costs could also be covered within the base budget. Some argue that the emergency designation for funding Iraqi security forces could be covered in DOD's base budget. Providing $2 billion for higher fuel costs may also be covered within the base budget. DOD has typically used cash resources or transferred funds from less urgent needs to cover unanticipated increases in fuel prices. The $1.7 billion for reset to replace war-worn equipment could be loosely tied to the additional 30,000 troops. An infusion of budget authority is needed for the $1.7 billion request for reset to replace war-worn equipment, which could be tied to the additional 30,000 troops. The impact of combat operations on equipment in Afghanistan may be gradual, making it difficult to predict replacement needs. The Department of Defense also has a backlog of war-related procurement that needs to be spent. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request, including adjustments for excess funding, fuel pricing changes, and combat losses. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request, including adjustments for excess funding, fuel pricing changes, and combat losses. This included a $108 million decrease to military personnel for excess requirements, a $436 million decrease to operation and maintenance, a $400 million cut rejecting a DOD proposal, and a $512 million increase to procurement accounts for additional combat losses. The Senate version of H.R. 4899 included adjustments to DOD funding, such as a $400 million cut rejecting a proposal and a $512 million increase for combat losses. Both House and Senate versions approved funding for training Afghan and Iraq security forces. The final version also required assessments of threats from Guantanamo detainees to be provided to congressional intelligence committees. The final version of the bill includes approved funding for training Afghan and Iraq security forces. It also requires assessments of threats from Guantanamo detainees to be provided to congressional intelligence committees. Additionally, the bill dropped a provision for $300 million for base closure related transportation improvements. The Administration requested a total of $529 million for military construction, including $521 million for military construction in Afghanistan. The Administration requested $529 million for military construction, with $521 million allocated for Afghanistan. This would double the FY2009 level for war-related construction, raising concerns about the possibility of creating permanent bases in Afghanistan. Congress allowed spending for a \"long-term presence\" but prohibited certain expenditures. The Administration requested $529 million for military construction, with $521 million allocated for Afghanistan. Concerns arise about the possibility of creating permanent bases in Afghanistan despite Congress allowing spending for a \"long-term presence.\" The urgency of the current funds for military construction in Afghanistan is unclear. The $521 million military construction request for Afghanistan aims to create infrastructure to support 30,000 additional U.S. troops. Projects include expanding airfield capacity, logistics capacity, and basic infrastructure in southern provinces. The $521 million military construction request for Afghanistan aims to support 30,000 additional U.S. troops by expanding airfield and logistics capacity in key locations. The supplemental request is split between Army and Air Force construction, with Army projects focused in southern provinces and Air Force projects planned in southern, northern, and western provinces to support airlift and special operations forces. Army construction also includes waste and waste water management. The military construction request for Afghanistan includes projects in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. Construction plans involve airfield expansion in Nimruz, Balkh, and Herand provinces to support airlift and special operations forces. Army projects include waste management systems, fuel storage facilities, utilities infrastructure, gravel roads, and a command headquarters at FOB Tombstone in Helmand. Air Force projects consist of runway and apron construction at FOB Delaram in the west, and perimeter security facilities at Kunduz and Mazar e Sharif in the north. The military construction projects in Afghanistan include a runway and apron at FOB Delaram in the west, perimeter security facilities at Kunduz and Mazar e Sharif in the north, and a helicopter apron at FOB Dwyer in southern Helmand province. Congress is concerned about the spending on construction projects in the country. The military construction projects in Afghanistan include various facilities such as runways, aprons, and storage areas at different locations. Congress is concerned about the long-term implications of this spending and has adopted measures to prevent the establishment of permanent bases in the country. In Afghanistan, military construction projects support short-term warfighting and troop stationing. Congress has taken steps to prevent the establishment of permanent bases in the country, as seen in the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act. The FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits the establishment of permanent military bases in Afghanistan, with no clear definition of projects signaling permanency. The FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits establishing permanent military bases in Afghanistan without clear definitions of projects indicating permanency. Congress made an exception in P.L. 111-84 allowing the use of Operation & Maintenance funds for military construction supporting a \"long-term presence\" in Afghanistan. The FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits permanent military bases in Afghanistan without clear definitions of projects indicating permanency. Congress allows Operation & Maintenance funds for military construction supporting a \"long-term presence\" in Afghanistan, reversing prior restrictions on funding for such facilities. The distinction between funding for permanent troop stationing and long-term presence facilities is sometimes unclear, leading to periodic denials of funds for projects signaling a permanent presence. Congress has periodically denied funds for projects perceived as signaling a permanent presence without justification as part of a comprehensive plan for troop stationing. Some projects in the FY2010 Supplemental could fall into this category. DOD received flexibility to use O&M funds for temporary facilities to meet urgent military operational requirements starting in FY2004. DOD received flexibility to use O&M funds for temporary facilities to meet urgent military operational requirements in Iraq and Afghanistan from FY2004 to FY2009, with a cap of $100 million to $200 million per year. Funds were not allowed for construction at military installations with a long-term U.S. presence expected. The DOD was given flexibility to use O&M funds for urgent military requirements in Iraq and Afghanistan from FY2004 to FY2009. Congress changed the law in 2009 to allow $200 million for projects in U.S. Central Command and $300 million for construction in Afghanistan to meet urgent military needs, even for long-term presence. In FY2009, the DOD added $409 million from O&M accounts for construction in Afghanistan to the $900 million total spent on military construction, increasing the amount significantly. In FY2009, DOD added $409 million from O&M accounts for construction in Afghanistan to the $900 million appropriated, raising the total to $1.4 billion. This nearly equaled the entire amount spent on construction between FY2003 and FY2008, doubling DOD's construction investment in Afghanistan in a single year. If DOD dedicated the full $500 million in O&M available for military construction in Afghanistan, the total in FY2010 would reach $2.4 billion. In FY2009, DOD added $409 million from O&M accounts for construction in Afghanistan, doubling their construction investment in a single year. If DOD dedicated the full $500 million in O&M for military construction in FY2010, the total would reach $2.4 billion. DOD has also submitted a new legislative proposal to use O&M monies for minor construction in support of contingency operations until October 1, 2012, potentially increasing funding for military construction in Afghanistan. If the FY2011 proposal is approved by Congress, total funding for military construction in Afghanistan could increase further. Key bases in Afghanistan have received significant investments, including $1.3 billion in Bagram Air Base and $767 million in Kandahar Air Base. Additionally, $595 million has been allocated for Forward Operating Base Tombstone/Bastion. The FY2011 DOD authorization includes a request for $181 million for Kandahar Air Base, $595 million for Forward Operating Base Tombstone/Bastion, and new language allowing the use of O&M funds for minor military construction projects up to $3 million each in support of contingency operations until September 30, 2012. The FY2011 DOD authorization includes a request for $181 million for Kandahar Air Base and $595 million for Forward Operating Base Tombstone/Bastion. It also proposes a temporary two-year authority for DOD to use O&M funds for unspecified minor military construction projects of up to $3 million each in support of contingency operations worldwide. The proposal increases the per project cap from $750,000 to $3 million due to rising construction costs in Afghanistan. The DOD proposed increasing the per project cap for unspecified minor construction projects from $750,000 to $3 million due to rising construction costs in Afghanistan. This would allow DOD to spend \"amounts necessary\" for these projects without a total funding limit. Quarterly reporting to congressional defense committees would be done after-the-fact within 60 days. The DOD proposed quarterly reporting to congressional defense committees within 60 days for Central Command projects, instead of the 7-10 day pre-notification. Questions were raised about the urgency of the $521 million supplemental request given DOD's available budget authority of $2.1 billion for military construction projects in Afghanistan. DOD had $2.1 billion in budget authority available for military construction projects in Afghanistan. In FY2009, about $607 million was obligated, but in FY2010, the average monthly obligation fell to $26 million. To obligate all funds by the end of the fiscal year, DOD would need to increase monthly obligations six-fold to $300 million. To obligate all $2.1 billion in funds available, DOD needs to increase monthly obligations to $300 million. $700 million must be obligated by September 30, 2010, and $1.4 billion by September 30, 2011. DOD also needs to increase monthly obligations four-fold to $100 million to spend FY2009 funds before they lapse. To spend all available funds, DOD needs to increase monthly obligations significantly. For FY2009, obligations would need to increase four-fold to $100 million monthly. Similarly, for FY2010 projects, obligations would need to average $116 million monthly. With supplemental funds, obligations would have to triple from the FY2009 rate to $150 million monthly. The FY2010 supplemental request for DOD would need to treble from the FY2009 rate to $150 million a month and increase six-fold from the current FY2010 rate. Total funding for military construction/family housing in H.R. 4899 was $657 million, including $649 million for war-related construction in Afghanistan. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 allocated $657 million for military construction, with $649 million for war-related projects in Afghanistan and $8 million for Air Force family housing utility bills. The final funding exceeded the request by $127.5 million to accelerate Air Force projects planned for FY2011. The Senate report for FY2011 authorized the use of O&M funds for contingency projects, with military construction funds available for two years instead of four. The final bill did not include $16.5 million added by the House. The final version of the bill for FY2011 did not include $16.5 million added by the House for a new Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood, TX. The Administration's FY2010 Supplemental request addressed foreign economic assistance for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The FY2010 Supplemental request under the international affairs budget function focused on foreign economic assistance and civilian operational requirements in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The request aimed to address the drawdown of U.S. military forces in Iraq, increase responsibilities in Afghanistan, and demonstrate support to Pakistan.

The FY2010 Supplemental request focused on foreign aid amounting to $2.6 billion for U.S. security, economic growth, social services, and democratization objectives. Funding was requested for specific needs in each country, excluding P.L.480 food aid and Global Health/Child Survival accounts. If approved, the total accounts for the three countries would increase from $6 billion to $10 billion. The FY2010 Supplemental request focused on foreign aid amounting to $2.6 billion for U.S. security, economic growth, social services, and democratization objectives. The enacted version raised the FY2010 total level to about $9.2 billion, a 55% increase over the FY2009 appropriation. The total international affairs war-related foreign aid and diplomatic operations funding in the enacted version of the FY2010 supplemental is $3.7 billion, $714 million less than the Administration request. The FY2010 supplemental provides $3.7 billion for international affairs war-related foreign aid and diplomatic operations, $714 million less than the Administration request. The focus is on civilian programs in Afghanistan to support governance, economic growth, and social services alongside U.S. military efforts. Strengthening the U.S. civilian presence and increasing aid to local government are key strategies. The December 2009 \"surge\" strategy in Afghanistan accelerated the need for civilian assistance delivery to support governance, economic growth, and social services alongside U.S. military efforts. The new strategy aims to rapidly increase stability and reduce insurgency strength by creating jobs and providing social services in problematic provinces. The new strategy in Afghanistan aims to increase stability and reduce insurgency strength by creating jobs and providing social services in contested areas. Key concerns include Afghan government's leadership, coordination between U.S. military and civilian aid programs, and cooperation from local communities. The U.S. government is prepared to provide leadership and support to local communities in conflict zones, but concerns remain about corruption in the Afghan government hindering effective service delivery. Monitoring and accountability of aid distribution are also key concerns as aid levels increase. The U.S. government is increasing aid personnel and requesting more oversight to ensure accountability in aid programs. The Afghanistan supplemental request aims to boost international affairs funding for the country, with P.L. 111-212 also increasing aid and State support. The U.S. government is increasing aid personnel and requesting more oversight to ensure accountability in aid programs. The Afghanistan supplemental request aims to boost international affairs funding for the country, with P.L. 111-212 significantly raising aid and State support.

Additionally, $50 million is allocated for expanding Ministry of Health services, $50 million for secondary and vocational education, $7 million for improving revenue collection through tax administration reform, $19.5 million for trade agreements and infrastructure, $4.5 million to strengthen branches of the Central Bank, and $215 million for capacity building in the Ministry of Agriculture and watershed support. The INCLE account, implemented by the State Department, allocated funds for various sectors including trade agreements, financial sector, agriculture, private sector development, and economic opportunities. Three quarters of the $200 million request aimed at supporting the justice sector and injecting rule of law activities into the provinces. The State Department allocated $8.6 million to expand credit union services, including Islamic-compliant financing. The request included funding for the justice sector, such as expanding the corrections program, model prisons, increasing the number of judges and prosecutors, and supporting legal aid, with a specific focus on women's justice. The State Department allocated funds for various justice sector initiatives, including increasing judges, prosecutors, and criminal investigators, supporting legal aid, women's justice activities, counternarcotics police, and drug treatment facilities. The FY2010 State Department Diplomatic and Consular Programs request of $211 million aimed to support international affairs assistance programs and grow civilian personnel. The FY2010 State Department Diplomatic and Consular Programs request of $211 million aimed to further civilian personnel growth through a proposed 457 position increase, including U.S. direct hires for district-level work and staff for Kabul ministries and Provincial Reconstruction Teams. The Administration proposed hiring 245 staff for district-level work and Kabul ministries, utilizing a \"whole of government\" approach with federal employees from various agencies. Additionally, about 200 locally employed staff were suggested to provide support to American personnel in the field. The Department of State Inspector General's report in February 2010 praised management and personnel. The Department proposed hiring 200 locally employed staff to support American personnel in the field. A report praised management at the U.S. embassy in Kabul but expressed concerns about overwork due to staff tripling in the past year. The rapid expansion would strain resources for staff management and housing. The supplemental funding request for Afghanistan reconstruction includes additional funds for staff management, housing, and security needs. $14 million is allocated for SIGAR and $3 million for the State Department Inspector General for oversight of the assistance program. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Afghanistan foreign aid and diplomatic operations, which is lower than the $2.0 billion request. The enacted version also cuts the ESF request by $267 million compared to the Administration's request.

The Senate report expresses concerns about providing aid directly to the government of Afghanistan. The Senate report recommends reducing good governance activities by $160 million and alternative development by $35 million in the enacted version of H.R. 4899 for Afghanistan foreign aid. Concerns were raised about providing aid directly to the Afghan government, leading to limits on direct government budget support to $100 million. The INCLE account was also cut by $31 million due to doubts about the Government of Afghanistan's commitment to reforming the justice system. The enacted version of the legislation reduced the INCLE account by $31 million due to concerns about the Afghan government's commitment to reforming the justice system. It also addressed oversight issues by rejecting a request for SIGAR funding, citing available funds from previous appropriations. Additionally, the legislation imposed conditions on Afghanistan aid. The enacted legislation imposes conditions on Afghanistan aid, including consultation with Afghan government representatives and civil society, specific benchmarks for progress, and cooperation from the Government of Afghanistan. The aid to Afghanistan is contingent on consultation with society, specific benchmarks for progress, cooperation in reform efforts, respect for women's rights, and removal of corrupt officials. Aid for the Electoral Commission is dependent on no involvement in fraud in past elections, and support for reconciliation with former combatants like the Taliban is subject to certain conditions.

The FY2010 supplemental had two components, reflecting the new strategic environment due to the drawdown of U.S. military forces. Despite the decrease in U.S. military presence in Iraq, there was a significant increase in U.S. assistance and State Department operations. The total U.S. assistance program to Iraq would have risen by 64% from the previous year, with the enacted legislation boosting Iraq economic aid programs by 89%. State operations account alone would have seen a 79% increase under the enacted legislation. The FY2010 supplemental included a significant increase in U.S. assistance and State Department operations for Iraq. Total economic aid programs for Iraq were boosted by 89% over the previous year. The State operations account saw a 79% increase under the enacted legislation. The most significant element was the request for $517.4 million in INCLE funds for the transition of responsibility for police training from the Department of Defense to the Department of State. The State Department requested $517.4 million in INCLE funds for the transition of police training responsibility from the Department of Defense to the Department of State, effective October 1, 2011. This transition includes advising the Ministry of Interior, police, and border forces, with a smooth handover planned by the end of FY2010. Training of the Iraqi military remains under the Department of Defense. The State Department requested $517.4 million in INCLE funds for the transition of police training responsibility from the Department of Defense to the Department of State. A smooth handover is planned by the end of FY2010, with training of the Iraqi military remaining under the Department of Defense.

The program is expected to employ up to 2,000 U.S. government and contractor personnel, with funding for aircraft and expanded aviation facilities for efficient staff travel. The FY2010 supplemental request included $1.57 billion for State Department operational costs in Iraq to maintain civilian outreach following the military drawdown. Currently, there are over 1,200 direct-hire American employees from 14 civilian agencies in Iraq. The United States maintains over 1,200 direct-hire American employees from 14 civilian agencies in Iraq to address civilian outreach following the military drawdown. These employees are stationed at various locations including the Embassy in Baghdad, Regional Embassy Office in Basrah, and Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) with logistical and security support from the military. During the 2007 surge, embedded PRTs (ePRTs) were established to allow civilian presence in additional locations protected by combat battalions. During the 2007 surge, embedded PRTs (ePRTs) were established to allow civilian presence in additional locations protected by combat battalions. Civilian federal employees conduct various diplomatic and assistance missions, including economic interests, political analysis, public diplomacy, reconstruction efforts, and rule of law programs. The embedded PRTs (ePRTs) were established during the 2007 surge to provide political analysis, public diplomacy outreach, and oversight of U.S. government assistance programs in Iraq. As combat battalions have withdrawn from cities, the embedded PRTs are being phased out, with regular PRTs expected to be terminated by 2011. The State Department plans to establish two consulates and three temporary Provincial Diplomatic Teams (PDTs) to maintain a U.S. civilian presence outside of Baghdad. The State Department plans to establish two consulates and three temporary Provincial Diplomatic Teams (PDTs) to maintain a U.S. civilian presence outside of Baghdad, as regular PRTs are being phased out by 2011. Additionally, two U.S. Forces-Iraq managed PRTs will remain through the end of 2011. The supplemental funding request includes realigning infrastructure for the presence of an Embassy, consulates, PDTs, and interim Defense Department PRTs. State Department will assume greater responsibility for infrastructure costs previously borne by the military.

This includes site development for consulate facilities and security requirements for new field facilities, totaling $834.6 million. The Department of State will need to provide for large increases in contract employees to handle security, operations planning, and maintenance of vehicles. The Department of Defense will need to hire more contract employees to provide various services such as security, operations planning, vehicle maintenance, cleaning, and food preparation. There are concerns about whether the Department has expanded its capabilities in contract management to oversee the increasing number of contracts and task orders in Iraq. The Department of Defense needs more personnel to manage contracts in Iraq. H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Iraq, $407 million less than requested. P.L. 111-212 cuts $540 million from diplomatic operations. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Iraq, $407 million less than the request. P.L. 111-212 cuts the request for diplomatic operations by $540 million, with $527 million intended for consulate construction in Basrah and northern Iraq.

The enacted version of H.R. 4899 increases INCLE funds by $133 million, reconfiguring their use for police training program implementation, management, and security. Funding is contingent on Iraqi Government support and cooperation. The Pakistan supplemental request for funding did not reflect a significant change in U.S. policy compared to requests for Afghanistan and Iraq. The Administration's FY2010 supplemental request for Pakistan aimed at specific programs, subject to the Iraqi Government's support and cooperation. The Administration's FY2010 supplemental request for Pakistan focused on specific infrastructure needs to show support and counter insurgency. The request included $244 million in ESF, with $50 million for cash payments to help displaced people. The FY2010 supplemental request for Pakistan included $244 million in ESF for various needs such as cash payments for displaced people, water and sanitation infrastructure, agriculture irrigation systems, and solutions to the energy crisis.

The earthquake in Haiti is considered one of the most devastating catastrophes in history, affecting around 3 million people. The Haiti earthquake, deemed the most devastating catastrophe in history by an Inter-American Development Bank study, has affected approximately 3 million people. Over 2 million are displaced, with an estimated 230,000 deaths and 300,600 injured. The relief effort is expected to last for months in a country already designated as one of the 50 least developed in the world. The United Nations had designated Haiti as one of the 50 least developed countries before the earthquake, facing a high risk of remaining in poverty and needing attention from the international community. Protecting the displaced population is a critical issue, with an estimated 1.69 million displaced in Port-au-Prince and 597,000 in other poverty-stricken areas. Some Haitians have also left the country as refugees. In Haiti, millions are displaced in Port-au-Prince and hundreds of thousands have relocated to poverty-stricken areas outside the capital. Some Haitians have become refugees in other countries. Aid workers are providing basic necessities to Internally Displaced Populations, but there is a shortage of emergency shelter. Providing adequate shelter and sanitation for the displaced is now an urgent priority as the rainy season begins. The rainy season is starting in Haiti, and there is a shortage of emergency shelter for Internally Displaced Populations. Providing waterproof shelter and improving sanitation are urgent priorities.

As recovery progresses, food needs are expected to decrease, with a focus on the most vulnerable and food-for-work programs. Relief operations will continue through 2010, with a transition from relief to reconstruction activities. The international community, including the United Nations and the United States, has provided significant humanitarian assistance in response to the natural disasters in Haiti over the last decade. Relief and reconstruction activities are expected to continue through 2010, addressing both humanitarian concerns and long-term recovery efforts. The international community, including the United Nations and the United States, has provided significant humanitarian assistance in response to natural disasters in Haiti. The United Nations, along with other partners, remains at the forefront of the on-the-ground response for humanitarian assistance in Haiti. Disaster risks in Haiti are significant, and experts emphasize the need to develop a disaster response capacity to sustain reconstruction efforts in the future. Humanitarian assistance generally receives strong bipartisan congressional support. The United States is a leader in providing humanitarian assistance during disasters, with strong bipartisan congressional support. The Administration may deplete disaster accounts to fund immediate relief efforts, as seen in the case of Haiti. Developing a disaster response capacity is crucial for sustaining reconstruction efforts in the future. The United States may deplete disaster accounts to fund relief efforts, impacting its ability to respond to future emergencies if not replenished by June 1, 2010.

The United Nations issued a $1.44 billion Revised Humanitarian Appeal for Haiti, with $874 million (58%) commitments received as of June 4, 2010. It is unclear if donor amounts represent pledges or obligations, and government pledges may not always translate into actual contributions. The funds committed to relief may not necessarily be new contributions. The figures listing donor amounts for Haiti relief represent pledges or specific obligations, but pledges made by governments may not result in actual contributions. It is uncertain if the funds committed to relief are new contributions, as they may have been allocated elsewhere previously. It will take time to see how the costs of the Haiti disaster will be shared among international donors. Sustaining donor interest in Haiti and honoring existing pledges could be challenging as the situation stabilizes. Maintaining funding priorities and securing funds for other disasters adds to this challenge. The international community faces challenges in sustaining donor interest and honoring pledges for Haiti relief efforts. Criticisms have been raised about the slow delivery of humanitarian assistance, while others argue against unfair criticism. The weakened capacity of the Haitian government, damaged infrastructure, and logistical challenges further complicate the aid efforts. Some argue that unfair criticism has been directed at the pace of international aid efforts in Haiti due to challenges like the weakened capacity of the Haitian government, damaged infrastructure, and logistical issues. Evaluations of the relief response will continue as recovery efforts progress, with concerns about bureaucratic red tape, government capacity, the role of the United States, and coordination among aid organizations. Some experts are concerned about bureaucratic red tape, Haitian government capacity, US involvement, and coordination issues in the humanitarian response to the Haiti disaster.

The $36.2 million requested for USAID reimbursements to HHS would pay for medical, surgical, and mortuary assistance teams deployed to Haiti, including personnel and supplies for a 250-bed hospital. U.S. disaster assistance to other nations does not typically involve accepting large numbers of disaster victims into the United States. Some forms of assistance rendered to Haitian earthquake victims may be unprecedented, such as the use of NDMS for mass medical evacuation. The use of NDMS for mass medical evacuation of Haitian earthquake victims into the United States required rapid policy development for patient selection, hospital assignment, and reimbursement. The President's supplemental request included $15 million for this purpose. The President's supplemental request included $15 million for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to cover immigration-related costs for Haitian migrants affected by the 2010 earthquake.

Critics question the limited approach to aid priorities. The revised Haitian development strategy aims to catalyze economic growth and provide services outside of Port-au-Prince. The revised Haitian development strategy, supported by a supplemental request, aims to catalyze economic growth and provide services outside of Port-au-Prince to address the urban-rural imbalance in the country. Funds in the request target both short- and long-term elements of this decentralization strategy, meeting the immediate needs of newly displaced populations in less developed areas. The supplemental request for the Haitian development strategy aims to decentralize services outside of Port-au-Prince, focusing on immediate needs of displaced populations and strengthening local governance and infrastructure. Scientists are assisting in selecting less vulnerable areas for development, but officials caution that neglected areas will require significant investment and relocation should not be forced. Experts caution that economic growth alone is not enough to reduce poverty in Haiti, emphasizing the need for targeted poverty reduction programs. Aid to Haiti should focus on building the capacity of Haitians to eventually take over projects. However, there is a tension between effectiveness and efficiency in development efforts. Aid to Haiti should prioritize building the capacity of Haitians for long-term sustainability, despite the tension between effectiveness and efficiency in development efforts. This may require more time, funding, and personnel, as well as a shift towards measurable outcomes that may take longer to achieve. The supplemental proposal requested $749 million in Economic Support Funds for International Assistance programs in Haiti, focusing on rehabilitating infrastructure, providing technical assistance, and working on reconstruction projects for essential services like shelter and water infrastructure. The 2012 program aimed to assist the Haitian government in infrastructure rehabilitation, public outreach, reconstruction projects for essential services, and finance projects.

The House's amended version of the bill included substantial funding not requested by the Administration for preventing layoffs of teachers, law enforcement officials, and firefighters, as well as providing additional Pell Grants. However, these funds were not included in the final version of H.R. 4899, but may be included in other bills. For example, the Senate passed an amendment to H.R. 1586, providing $10 billion for education. The Senate passed an amendment to H.R. 1586, providing $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund and an increase in federal Medicaid reimbursements. The House plans to consider this bill after recess, with funds expected to prevent layoffs of law enforcement and firefighters. The bill is offset over ten years according to CBO. The House plans to return from recess the week of August 8 to consider a bill that includes funds to prevent teacher layoffs. President Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan emphasized the need for federal funds to prevent teacher layoffs, but a budget request for funds was not made. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include funds to prevent teacher layoffs because that was not included in the Senate May 27 version that the House passed on July 27. The House did not include funds to prevent teacher layoffs in the final version of H.R. 4899, despite earlier plans to allocate $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund. The House withdrew its support for this version and adopted the Senate's version instead. The House withdrew support for the $10 billion Education Jobs Fund in H.R. 4899 and adopted the Senate version instead, which included cuts to various education programs triggering a veto threat from the Administration. The Administration issued a veto threat due to proposed cuts to education programs, potentially leading to layoffs of 275,000 teachers and staff. The American Association of School Administrators estimates pupil-to-teacher ratios could increase from 15:1 to 17:1. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) provided funds this year to prevent teacher layoffs, with pupil-to-teacher ratios estimated to increase from 15:1 to 17:1. The Education Jobs Fund proposed distributing funds to state governors based on a population-based formula similar to ARRA. The HAC majority draft bill aims to ensure funds are available before schools open in the fall. The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund authorized through the ARRA was used to prevent teacher layoffs. The HAC majority draft bill would require the U.S. Department of Education to distribute funds to states within 45 days of enactment. States must meet maintenance of effort requirements to receive funds, with additional requirements for Texas. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include supplemental funding for hiring programs. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include supplemental funding for hiring programs under the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office, with additional maintenance of effort requirements for Texas. The House-amended version of the HAC bill dropped the proposed $1.179 billion funding for the COPS hiring program, which was intended to help law enforcement agencies facing budget shortfalls. This funding was later receded from by the House on July 27, 2010. If tax revenues do not rebound, states may need to lay off officers again, as the proposed funding might not be sufficient to meet the current demand for hiring funds. The proposed $1.179 billion for the COPS hiring program may not be enough to meet the demand for hiring funds, as seen with over 7,200 applications requesting $8.3 billion for 40,000 positions. The H.R. 4899 bill and Administration request did not include funds for firefighter hiring and retention. The HAC draft proposed $500 million for the SAFER program. The H.R. 4899 bill and Administration request did not include funds for firefighter hiring and retention. The HAC draft proposed $500 million for the SAFER program, which provides grants to local fire departments for hiring and maintaining firefighter staffing levels. Funding for SAFER was $210 million in FY2009, $420 million in FY2010, and $305 million requested in FY2011. The House July-amended version did not provide funds for the SAFER program, which had received $210 million in FY2009, $420 million in FY2010, and a requested $305 million in FY2011. Proponents argue for an additional $500 million to prevent firefighter staffing reductions at the state and local levels, while opponents believe the current funding is sufficient given the need to reduce federal spending. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 contains $32 million for the Department of Agriculture to address credit shortages in the farm loan program and rural housing loan guarantee program. P.L. 111-212 did not include most of the proposed funding for agricultural enterprises, post-secondary students, nuclear energy projects, and energy efficiency projects. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $32 million for the Department of Agriculture to address credit shortages in the farm loan program and rural housing loan guarantee program, responding to high demand for government loans since 2008. Without supplemental appropriations, qualified loan applications from farmers or rural homebuyers may go unfunded for the rest of FY2010.

Without supplemental appropriations, qualified loan applications from farmers or rural homebuyers may go unfunded for the rest of FY2010. The enacted version offsets $50 million within agriculture by limiting outlays from a mandatory bioenergy program. It also raises fees for receiving loan guarantees and adds $697 million of loan guarantee authority for Section 502 rural housing loans. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $32 million for the Department of Agriculture to address credit shortages in the farm loan program and rural housing loan guarantee program.

Additionally, there is a request for $75 million for direct loans under Section 502 in FY2011, with a new fee structure to allow $12 billion of loan guarantees at no cost to the government. The final version dropped $50 million for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) to purchase commodities for local food distribution networks included in the July House amended version, as well as $979 million of other rescissions from Agriculture Department. The final version of the FY2010 supplemental bill dropped $50 million for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and $979 million from Agriculture Department accounts, including funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), rural development, rural broadband funding, and unobligated balances from the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The FY2010 supplemental bill included funding cuts for various programs, such as The Emergency Food Assistance Program and Agriculture Department accounts. The Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee Program did not receive funding, but the Administration's FY2011 request is pending for clean energy projects. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) stated that DOE's FY2011 LGP request for $500 million for credit subsidy costs would be reduced by the $180 million it asked the House to include in the supplemental. The House July-amended version included $180 million for the DOE Loan Guarantee Program to support innovative energy technology projects, with $90 million for advanced nuclear power facilities and $90 million for renewable energy and energy efficiency technology projects. DOE estimates that a total of three nuclear power plant LGP projects are currently under review at DOE. The House July-amended version included $180 million for the DOE Loan Guarantee Program to support innovative energy technology projects, with $90 million for advanced nuclear power facilities and $90 million for renewable energy and energy efficiency technology projects. This funding could potentially support up to $18 billion in loan guarantee authority. The DOE Loan Guarantee Program received $180 million in the House July-amended version to support innovative energy technology projects, including $90 million for advanced nuclear power facilities and $90 million for renewable energy and energy efficiency technology projects. The program was established in 2005 to support energy technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with the first real funding in FY2009 from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. The Recovery Act allocated $6 billion for commercial renewable energy projects, with $2 billion later redirected to the Cash-for-Clunkers program. The Speaker of the House pledged to restore the $2 billion to the Loan Guarantee Program. The enacted H.R. 4899 did not include $4.95 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program, proposed to bridge a funding gap. The House proposed additional funding of $5.7 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program in the FY2011 appropriation to bridge a funding gap. The House Appropriations Committee FY2011 subcommittee allocations include an additional $5.7 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program, while the Senate Appropriations Committee did not include this funding but provides a $4,860 discretionary maximum award level in AY2011-12. The Federal Pell Grant program, authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, is the largest federal source of grant aid for postsecondary education, estimated to provide need-based grant aid to approximately 8.3 million undergraduate students in FY2010. The Pell Grant program is the largest federal source of grant aid for postsecondary education, providing need-based aid to around 8.3 million undergraduate students in FY2010. It is funded through discretionary and mandatory appropriations. In June 2010, the Administration requested an additional $600 million for border security, partially offset by rescinding $100 million from the Department of Homeland Security funds for SBInet. The Administration requested an additional $600 million for border security along the Southwest Border of the United States, with $399 million for the Department of Homeland Security and $201 million for the Department of Justice. This includes funding to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol agents, two new unmanned aerial detection systems, and 160 new Immigration agents. $100 million in DHS funds for SBInet would be rescinded. The Administration requested $600 million for border security, with $399 million for DHS and $201 million for DOJ. DHS funding includes hiring 1,000 new Border Patrol agents, new aerial detection systems, ICE agents, CBP officers, and canine teams. DOJ funding would increase law enforcement presence with ATF Gunrunner Teams and FBI Hybrid Task Forces. The $201 million of DOJ funding aims to enhance border enforcement operations along the Southwest border by adding ATF Gunrunner Teams, FBI Hybrid Task Forces, DEA agents, equipment, operational support, attorneys, immigration judges, and support for detention and incarceration costs for criminal aliens. Funding will also support Mexican law enforcement operations with ballistic and DNA analysis, information sharing, and technical capabilities. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212 did not include funding for border security, but H.R. 5875 passed by the House allocated $701 million for this purpose, $100 million more than the Administration's request. The funding includes support for additional detention and incarceration costs for criminal aliens and Mexican law enforcement operations. H.R. 5875 allocated $701 million for border security on July 28, 2010, $100 million more than the Administration's request. $201 million is designated for DOJ for border security efforts, mainly for law enforcement personnel. The Administration also requested $118 million for activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Administration requested $118 million in discretionary supplemental appropriations for activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. This included a proposal to increase the U.S. Coast Guard's funding limit for response activities, which was enacted separately in P.L. 111-191 on June 15, 2010. The Administration requested $118 million in discretionary supplemental appropriations for activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. This included funding for the Spill Liability Trust Fund to pay for response activities, enacted separately in P.L. 111-191 on June 15, 2010. The request also included programs such as an Oil Spill Relief Employment Assistance program and additional funding for inspections and enforcement by the Department of the Interior. The Employment Assistance program will provide National Emergency Grants for temporary employment and expanded employment search assistance, funded by parties responsible for the oil spill. Additionally, $29 million will go to the Department of the Interior for inspections and other activities related to the spill, $13 million to NOAA for economic impact mitigation on fishermen and fishery-related businesses, and $10 million to the Department of Justice for enforcement actions under the Oil Pollution Act and Clean Water Act. $7 million for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for research and support of oil spill response; $5 million for Economic Development Administration grants for economic assistance in affected areas.

The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides funding for oil-spill related programs, including relief for fisheries in the Gulf and a study on the ecosystem. It also authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to use discretionary funds for dredging to mitigate oil spill impacts. Additionally, the Administration requested $17.9 billion in additional mandatory spending for various purposes such as benefits for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, settling the Cobell and Pigford II cases, and discrimination claims of black farmers. The enacted H.R. 4899 provides funding for oil-spill related programs, including relief for fisheries in the Gulf and a study on the ecosystem. It authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to use discretionary funds for dredging to mitigate oil spill impacts. Additionally, $3.4 billion is allocated for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, $1.2 billion for settling the Cobell case, $1.2 billion for the Pigford II case, and $175 million for Coast Guard funding and a new unemployment benefit program. The Secretary of the VA has authority to determine benefits for veterans exposed to hazardous substances like Agent Orange. The Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs has authority to determine benefits for veterans exposed to hazardous substances like Agent Orange, which may not be subject to budget procedural constraints. The Administration proposed categorizing additional mandatory funding for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill as emergency funding, exempt from budget procedural constraints like PAYGO rules. However, spending for court settlements would require new legislative authority and funds, potentially subjecting it to budget rules such as PAYGO. The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs has the authority to establish presumptions of service connection for conditions related to Agent Orange exposure, including Parkinson's disease, ischemic heart disease, and hairy cell/B cell leukemia. This may require new legislative authority and funding, potentially subjecting it to budget rules like PAYGO. The Secretary of the VA announced plans to establish a presumption of service connection for Parkinson's disease, ischemic heart disease, and hairy cell/B cell leukemia for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. The estimated cost for these new presumptions is $13.4 billion in FY2010, with approximately 86,000 veterans eligible for retroactive benefits. The VA estimates that the costs for new presumptions of service connection for certain conditions will be $13.4 billion in FY2010. Approximately 86,000 veterans are eligible for retroactive benefits, with some also eligible for an increase in disability rating or new disability compensation. Payments will begin when final regulations are published, impacting disability compensation and pensions in FY2011. The VA estimates that new presumptions for service connection will cost $13.4 billion in FY2010. Payments will start once final regulations are issued, affecting disability compensation and pensions in FY2011. CBO suggests $5 billion may be sufficient for FY2010, differing from the VA's estimate. The VA estimates $13.4 billion is needed for new service connection presumptions in FY2010. CBO suggests $5 billion may suffice due to uncertainty in regulations and processing time. H.R. 4899 includes $13.4 billion for Agent Orange benefits, approved by Senate and House versions. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $13.4 billion for additional veterans benefits related to Agent Orange, approved by both the Senate and House. Section 902 prohibits the VA from paying these claims until the Congressional review period expires. This will not impact veterans' disability compensation amounts unless Congress enacts a resolution changing the regulations. The Administration requested $4.6 billion to settle two longstanding cases against the government: $1.15 billion for the Pigford Black Farmers Discrimination Case; and $3.4 billion for the Cobell Indian Trust Litigation Settlement. Claimants argue that settlements could be voided if funds are not appropriated before a certain date. The government requested $1.15 billion for the Pigford Black Farmers Discrimination Case and $3.4 billion for the Cobell Indian Trust Litigation Settlement. Claimants argue that settlements could be voided if funds are not appropriated before a certain date, with the most recent deadline for the Cobell case being August 6, 2010. The FY2010 budget supplemental requested $1.15 billion for the Pigford II discrimination case brought by 70,000 black farmers against the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Pigford II discrimination case settlement requested $1.15 billion in emergency appropriation for 70,000 black farmers. The settlement was announced on February 18, 2010, and is final and non-appealable. If Congress fails to appropriate the funds by March 31, 2010, claimants could void the settlement. The Pigford II settlement requested $1.15 billion in emergency appropriation for 70,000 black farmers, but funds were not appropriated by the deadline. The settlement is final and non-appealable, with a provision allowing claimants to void it if funds are not allocated. The Administration also requested $3.4 billion for another settlement in the Cobell v. Salazar case. The Administration requested $3.4 billion in FY2010 supplemental appropriations to settle litigation over mismanagement of individual Indian trust fund accounts in the Cobell v. Salazar case. $1.4 billion would be distributed to plaintiffs, $2 billion for trust land interests consolidation, and $60 million for education scholarships. The settlement requires legislative authorization by August 6, 2010. The Cobell lawsuit settlement involves $60 million for education scholarships and trust land interests owned by the plaintiffs. The deadline for legislative authorization has been extended multiple times, with uncertainty about further extensions. Interior's mismanagement of Individual Indian Monies trust accounts led to the lawsuit. Interior's mismanagement of Individual Indian Monies trust accounts, dating back to the 19th century, has led to difficulties in accurately accounting for payments. With an estimated 384,000 accounts and a total asset value exceeding $460 million, the Cobell settlement may be supported by both plaintiffs and defendants to end years of costly litigation. The Cobell settlement involves an estimated 384,000 IIM accounts with a total asset value over $460 million. Both plaintiffs and defendants may support the settlement to end years of costly litigation. Congressional approval for the settlement is divided among Indian organizations and plaintiffs. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 does not include the requested $4.6 billion appropriation for the settlements. The House version of H.R. 4899 did not include the $4.6 billion appropriation for the Cobell and Pigford II court settlements requested by the Administration. The House and Senate rules require that direct spending must be offset by increasing revenues or reducing other direct spending to avoid a point of order. The earlier House version included language providing direct spending authority to use the Judgment Fund for the settlements. Senate rules require that direct spending must be offset by increasing revenues or reducing other direct spending to avoid a point of order. Language for using the Judgment Fund for Cobell and Pigford II court settlements was dropped from the final version of H.R. 4213. Senator Reid's office may propose passing these provisions in a separate bill by unanimous consent or attaching them to other bills. Funding for the court settlements may be included in another bill with offsets or savings in mandatory programs. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include provisions from the earlier House July amended version that identified $4.68 billion in mandatory savings over ten years from two new provisions intended to reduce government medical care expenditures. Funding for court settlements may be included in another bill with offsets or savings in mandatory programs under PAYGO provisions. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include provisions from the earlier House July amended version that identified $4.68 billion in mandatory savings over ten years. One provision would increase rebates states receive from drug manufacturers by including more forms of drugs in the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price (AMP). The second provision would reduce drug expenditures for federal programs by giving the FTC more authority to limit deals between brand name and generic drug makers. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include provisions from the earlier House July amended version. The amended version aimed to increase rebates states receive from drug manufacturers by including more forms of drugs in the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) and giving the FTC more authority to limit deals between brand name and generic drug makers. The proposal aims to include injected, infused, and inhaled forms of outpatient drugs in the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) for Medicaid rebates, increasing the amount owed by manufacturers to states. The House proposal aims to include injected, infused, and inhaled forms of outpatient drugs in the AMP calculation for Medicaid rebates, potentially reducing federal Medicaid expenditures by $2.1 billion over 10 years. The Senate did not accept provisions to add additional drug forms to the definition of AMP, which would have reduced federal Medicaid expenditures by $2.1 billion over 10 years. The House amended version of H.R. 4899 includes provisions to prevent pay-to-delay arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry. The House amended version of H.R. 4899 includes provisions to prevent pay-to-delay arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry, where a brand-name drug company compensates a generic drug company to delay the entry of a generic drug into the market. This practice has been a concern since the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984. Since the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, the FDA can approve generic drugs after the patent period ends, reducing costs for consumers. The House-passed health reform package included provisions to prevent pay-to-delay arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry. The House-passed health reform package included provisions to prevent pay-to-delay arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry by making unlawful any agreement involving compensation for delay of generic drug development. The House-passed health reform package included provisions to prevent pay-to-delay arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry by making unlawful any agreement involving compensation for delay of generic drug development. This would reduce federal budget deficits by $2.68 billion over the 2010-2020 period. The House-passed health reform package aimed to reduce federal budget deficits by $2.68 billion over the 2010-2020 period by preventing pay-to-delay arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry. However, the Senate did not accept the provisions related to Preserving Access to Generic Drugs, and the enacted version did not include $538 million for initiatives to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs.

However, the Senate did not accept the provisions related to Preserving Access to Generic Drugs. The House had included $538 million for initiatives to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs, targeting agencies like HHS, IRS, DOL, and SSA. These funds were meant for efforts to reduce improper payments and combat illegal activities. The House-passed health reform package included $538 million for initiatives to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs. Federal agencies are responsible for conducting activities to ensure appropriate expenditures and entitlement to benefits. The funding was allocated for enhanced tax enforcement by IRS and the HHS Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account, with a portion used by CMS for Medicare and Medicaid programs. Approximately half of the $538 million allocated for initiatives to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs would be used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for Medicare Advantage, Medicare drug benefits, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. $65 million would go to the HHS Office of the Inspector General, $60 million to the Department of Justice for fraud and abuse investigations, $38 million to the SSA for disability reviews, and $5 million to the DOL for in-person activities. The $538 million allocated for initiatives to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs includes funding for HHS fraud and abuse investigations, SSA disability reviews, and DOL in-person activities. The funds are available until September 2011 for DOL, SSA, and IRS, and until September 30, 2012 for HHS. CBO estimated that this funding would increase the federal deficit by $538 million in 2010. The funding for DOL, SSA, and IRS is available until September 2011, while HHS funds are available until September 30, 2012. CBO estimated that additional PI funding would increase the federal deficit by $538 million in 2010, with no estimated savings. This would increase federal budget deficits by the same amount over the period 2010-2020. Additionally, the Administration proposed expanding Coast Guard funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund and setting up a new unemployment assistance program. The Administration proposed expanding Coast Guard funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to finance response activities and setting up a new unemployment assistance program for individuals not eligible for other benefits. This fund allows up to $150 million per year for response activities and is supported by an excise tax on petroleum. Additionally, a 1 cent increase in the tax per barrel of oil was proposed to replenish the trust fund.

The fund allows up to $150 million per year and is supported by an excise tax on petroleum. A 1 cent increase in the tax per barrel of oil was also proposed to replenish the trust fund. The new unemployment benefit program would be funded by the parties responsible for the oil spill under the Oil Pollution Act. The Administration proposed expanding Coast Guard funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to finance response activities and setting up a new unemployment assistance program. The new program would be funded by the responsible parties under the Oil Pollution Act, with mandatory appropriations authorized as advances from the trust fund. CBO estimated $125 million in mandatory appropriations for the program. The Administration's proposal includes expanding Coast Guard funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. CBO estimated $125 million in mandatory appropriations, with $150 million in spending offset by $25 million recovered from responsible parties. The Coast Guard would be authorized to make advances of $100 million each from the trust fund, exceeding the annual limitation of $150 million. The Administration proposed to increase the cap on expenditures from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to $1.5 billion to respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, with $1.575 billion available for obligation by the end of FY2010. The Administration proposed to increase the cap on expenditures from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to $1.5 billion for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Office of Management and Budget estimated $1.575 billion would be available by the end of FY2010. The proposed increase would enhance federal emergency response capabilities exclusively for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Coast Guard would need to notify Congress of any advanced funds within 7 days. The final version of H.R. 4899 included provisions for the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund that were the same as those in legislation, P.L. 111-191 ( S. 3473 ) that Congress passed separately on June 15, 2010, in response to concerns raised by Admiral Thad Allen, National Incident Commander for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and Department of Homeland. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund provisions in H.R. 4899 mirrored those in legislation P.L. 111-191 (S. 3473) passed separately on June 15, 2010, in response to concerns about hitting the $150 million cap. The legislation raised the cap to $1 billion for the Deepwater Horizon spill and allowed $100 million withdrawals with 7-day notifications to Congress. CBO estimated $50 million in FY2010 costs offset by reimbursements.
