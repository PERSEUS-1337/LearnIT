    "content": "Critical infrastructure (CI) encompasses machinery, facilities, and information crucial for governance, public health, and the economy. Adverse events can result from loss or disruption of CI systems, whether due to natural disasters or deliberate attacks. This report outlines four key areas of policy concern for Congress: defining and identifying CI, understanding and assessing CI risk, federal organization for CI, and the role of the private sector. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) on critical infrastructure protection, issued in 1998, was the first significant policy in this area. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 was the first policy guidance for critical infrastructure protection, emphasizing national vulnerability to asymmetric attacks and the importance of critical infrastructure for national power. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 highlighted the national vulnerability to asymmetric attacks and the critical role of infrastructure in national power. The directive defined critical infrastructure as essential systems for the economy and government, setting goals to eliminate vulnerability to non-traditional attacks. Establishing consistent criteria for assessing asset criticality has proven challenging. The national goal is to eliminate vulnerability to non-traditional attacks on critical infrastructure, but establishing consistent criteria for assessing critical assets is challenging due to the complexity and interconnectedness of the U.S. and global economies. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 defines critical infrastructure as the industrial and demographic foundations of national mobilization against catastrophic risks, focusing on protecting assets and systems. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 defines critical infrastructure as vital systems and assets that, if incapacitated or destroyed, would have a debilitating impact on national security, economic security, public health, or safety. This policy has evolved from a focus on physical foundations to a broader concern. The critical infrastructure policy has evolved to include essential services and conveniences for the public. The threats to critical infrastructure have expanded, with the intelligence community focusing on asymmetric threats from state and non-state adversaries. The intelligence community has expanded its focus on asymmetric threats to critical infrastructure posed by state and non-state adversaries. These threats may involve physical or cyber attacks to disrupt domestic systems and assets, or cause mass civilian casualties. Additionally, natural disasters and other causes of damage have become more prominent in critical infrastructure policy and practice. The focus on asymmetric threats to critical infrastructure has expanded to include physical or cyber attacks by state and non-state adversaries, as well as natural disasters. The definition of critical infrastructure has broadened to include events with disruptive effects at all levels of society and government. The definition of critical infrastructure has expanded to include infrastructure-related events with disruptive effects at all levels of society and government. Policy emphasizes infrastructure as an enabler of prosperity, public safety, and civic life, reflecting local perspectives. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) defines critical infrastructure as assets, systems, and networks that underpin American society, considering impacts of various hazard events. The policy guidance for interagency coordination and public-private partnerships defines critical infrastructure as assets, systems, and networks that underpin American society. Successive Administrations have expanded CI policy to focus on society-centric resilience at the system level. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated U.S. election systems as critical infrastructure in January 2017, including physical locations and technology infrastructure. The DHS designated U.S. election systems, including physical locations and technology infrastructure, as critical infrastructure due to their essential role in supporting the nation's civic life. This designation is in line with Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21) and the 2013 NIPP, which outline 16 critical infrastructure sectors. The federal government designates critical infrastructure sectors based on Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21) and the 2013 NIPP. Public-private partnerships are non-regulatory and coordinated by DHS, with other federal agencies sometimes taking the lead as Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs). The critical infrastructure sectors are designated by the federal government based on PPD-21 and the 2013 NIPP. Public-private partnerships, coordinated by DHS, involve other federal agencies as Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs). The roles and responsibilities of the public and private sectors are discussed in the final section of the report. The expanding definitions of critical infrastructure have policy implications for Congress. Each sector has formal coordination bodies with private sector stakeholders and SLTT government representatives. New communities of interest emerge within the critical infrastructure enterprise. New public and private sector communities of interest emerge within the critical infrastructure enterprise, each with its own unique perspective on criticality. There is no single, consistently applied definition of critical infrastructure, reflecting diverse interests and perspectives that continue to evolve. The definition of critical infrastructure has not changed in nearly two decades, but the identification and prioritization of critical systems and assets reflect diverse interests and perspectives that continue to evolve. The multiplicity of official definitions in common use reflects efforts to negotiate boundaries of responsibility, government programs, and public-private sector relationships. Critical infrastructure policy reflects diverse constituencies' efforts to negotiate congressional responsibility, government program scope, and public-private sector relationships. There are two orientations: Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) focuses on identifying and protecting assets based on consequences of loss or disruption. Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) prioritizes and safeguards infrastructure assets based on their criticality, defined by the impact of their loss or disruption on essential functions of society, the economy, or government. Critical infrastructure resilience (CIR) involves investing in hazard mitigation and preparedness to ensure the availability of critical infrastructure functions during emergencies. The national critical infrastructure policy in the United States and other developed countries emphasizes investments in hazard mitigation and preparedness during steady-state periods, and adaptation during emergencies. The policy reflects a hybrid approach that combines elements of both critical infrastructure protection (CIP) and critical infrastructure resilience (CIR), favoring a focus on system resilience over asset protection. This shift in focus has occurred since the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, when concerns with physical protection of critical assets were predominant in policy circles. The national critical infrastructure policy in the United States and other developed countries has shifted towards system resilience over asset protection. This hybrid approach combines elements of both critical infrastructure protection (CIP) and critical infrastructure resilience (CIR). The term \"critical infrastructure security\" is used in this report to discuss CI policy without favoring CIP or CIR. Legislation and government policy directives since 2001 have often required the creation of asset lists, catalogs, databases, and reports to identify critical infrastructure. The report discusses critical infrastructure security policy, focusing on the creation of asset lists and databases to identify critical systems and assets that require higher levels of protection. Despite the simple logic of knowing what needs protection, complexities arise in practice, leading to ongoing national-level issues with asset identification and prioritization in critical infrastructure. The logic of identifying and prioritizing critical infrastructure assets introduces complexities in practice. Inventory requirements are the first step in risk management strategies for protection. Defining criticality criteria remains a debated topic, but list decisions help define priorities. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets, released in February 2003, directed the Department of Homeland Security to develop a uniform methodology for identifying critical facilities, systems, and functions. The definitional criteria of criticality continue to be debated, but list decisions help define priorities in practice. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets, released in February 2003, directed the Department of Homeland Security to develop a uniform methodology for identifying critical facilities, systems, and functions. This strategy led to the release of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) in December 2003, which served as the basis for critical infrastructure policy development until it was replaced by PPD-21 in 2013. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) in December 2003 directed federal departments to identify, prioritize, and protect critical infrastructure to prevent deliberate attacks. It laid the foundation for CI policy until replaced by PPD-21 in 2013. The 2006 NIPP aimed to protect critical infrastructure and key resources from deliberate attacks. However, a 2006 DHS Inspector General report found shortcomings in the national database of CI assets, which had grown rapidly from 160 to 77,069 assets, including nuclear power plants and dams. The 2006 DHS Inspector General report identified shortcomings in the Department's National Asset Database, which had expanded to include 77,069 assets ranging from nuclear power plants to petting zoos. The report highlighted entries of questionable criticality and non-standardized data collection procedures. The 2006 DHS Inspector General report identified issues with the National Asset Database, including non-standardized data collection procedures and questionable criticality of listed assets. Legislation was subsequently passed to create a national database of vital systems and assets, along with a classified list of prioritized critical infrastructure. The 9-11 Commission Act of 2007 requires a national database of vital systems and assets, along with a classified list of prioritized critical infrastructure. The Secretary determines assets that could cause catastrophic effects if disrupted or destroyed. Quality control procedures are in place to ensure asset nominations meet criticality thresholds. The 9-11 Commission Act of 2007 mandates a national database of vital systems and assets, with quality control procedures to ensure nominations meet criticality thresholds. A 2013 GAO report highlighted concerns about changes in criteria and methodology for identifying critical assets. The report documented changes in nomination and adjudication criteria used by NCIPP to assess criticality of nominations based on potential adverse consequences. Methodological adjustments were made to account for unique CI characteristics. The report highlighted the importance of assessing critical infrastructure based on potential adverse consequences, including fatalities, economic loss, mass evacuation length, and national security impacts. Methodological adjustments were made to consider unique characteristics of critical infrastructure. Recommendations were made for an independent peer review of asset nomination vetting methods to ensure the accuracy of the NCIPP list. The report recommended an independent peer review of asset nomination vetting methods for election infrastructure in federal elections. This review would ensure the accuracy of the NCIPP list, which prioritizes assets of national significance. This prioritization affects government actions such as risk assessments, regulatory regimes, grant programs, criminal prosecutions, and emergency preparedness. The NCIPP list prioritizes assets of national significance, impacting government actions like risk assessments, regulatory regimes, grant programs, criminal prosecutions, and emergency preparedness. Despite its importance, some states opt out of participating due to compliance burdens, technical limitations, and cost-benefit calculations. The exact number of nominated assets is classified but is in the thousands. The 2013 GAO report found that some states were not participating in the NCIPP list due to compliance burdens, technical limitations, and cost-benefit calculations. States lacked expertise to assess consequences of failure or disruption accurately, making the list incomplete. Additionally, DHS failed to provide documentation for statutory reporting requirements in recent years. The NCIPP list is not a complete national inventory of critical systems and assets. DHS failed to provide documentation for statutory reporting requirements. Persistent difficulties exist in assuring completeness, quality, and currency of centralized inventories of CI assets. CIR prioritizes adaptive use of critical capabilities for continuity of service during stress on critical infrastructure systems. The CIR approach expands CI inventory data collection to include all assets in a sector for emergency planning. It identifies alternative means to maintain critical functions during compromised situations. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) is a major CI interagency database that compiles data from public and private sector partners. It is used to identify alternative means of maintaining critical functions and providing essential services during compromised situations. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) compiles data from public and private sector partners to provide essential information to eligible organizations at all government levels. HIFLD includes hundreds of data layers curated by designated partner agencies, encompassing critical assets such as energy, communications, transportation, and water systems. HIFLD includes critical assets like energy, communications, transportation, and water systems, as well as non-critical assets that may become important in emergencies or policy decisions. For example, HHS used HIFLD during the 2017 hurricane season to locate day care centers in affected areas. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) utilized the HIFLD during the 2017 hurricane season to find day care centers in impacted areas. These centers, while not classified as critical infrastructure, were crucial for HHS to ensure the safety of children in those areas. The HIFLD partnership model enables relevant agencies to access infrastructure data for real-world use cases, without directly supporting federal oversight or regulation. The HIFLD partnership model provides infrastructure data for real-world use cases, informing preparedness and incident management activities of federal and SLTT agencies. It contrasts with the declining state participation in NCIPP, but CIP-based approaches to inventory of critical infrastructure assets remain relevant. The declining state participation in NCIPP contrasts with the continued relevance of CIP-based approaches to inventory critical infrastructure assets. Provisions in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act require DHS to assess critical utilities and security assets at risk, while specific high-risk chemical manufacturing facilities are subject to DHS inspection and regulatory enforcement under CFATS. Specific high-risk chemical manufacturing facilities are subject to DHS inspection and regulatory enforcement under CFATS, requiring protection against cyber and physical threats. Congress may need to consider the implications of the policy shift towards system-level resilience for legacy programs like the NCIPP asset list. DHS policy changes could further diminish the profile of NCIPP and asset-protection approaches to critical infrastructure risk management. Congress may need to consider the impact of policy changes on legacy programs like the NCIPP asset list, including stakeholder participation costs and data gathering efficiency. Updates to National Asset Database requirements may also be necessary to align with emerging CISA programs and priorities. Efforts to identify and prioritize critical infrastructure systems and assets are part of a larger national effort to understand homeland security risks. Congress may need to update National Asset Database requirements to align with emerging CISA programs and priorities. Efforts to identify and prioritize critical infrastructure systems and assets are part of a larger national effort to understand and assess homeland security risks. Risk assessments inform planning, resource allocation decisions, congressional appropriations, emergency preparedness, regulatory oversight, federal grant funding, and voluntary security measures by CI owner-operators. DHS defines risk as the potential for unwanted outcomes resulting from incidents or events. DHS defines risk as the potential for unwanted outcomes resulting from incidents or events, with threat, vulnerability, and consequence as key components. Threat is defined as any occurrence, individual, entity, or action that has the potential to harm life, information, operations, the environment, and/or property. Threat assessments typically include data on human adversaries or natural hazards. Threat assessments involve evaluating potential harm from natural or man-made occurrences, individuals, entities, or actions. This includes analyzing data on human adversaries or natural hazards to estimate likelihood and severity of events. Vulnerability assessments provide information on assets or systems that may be open to exploitation or damage from threats or hazards. Vulnerability assessments identify assets or systems susceptible to exploitation or damage from threats. Recommendations for resilience measures may be included to mitigate vulnerabilities. DHS defines consequence as the impact of an event. Criticality assessments focus on potential consequences of adverse events on infrastructure systems and assets. The DHS defines consequence as the impact of an event, incident, or occurrence. Criticality assessments focus on potential consequences of adverse events that disrupt or destroy infrastructure systems and assets, using various technical and non-technical methods. Different modeling methodologies are developed by research centers, universities, and industry groups to inform infrastructure security investments. Non-technical assessments are also made by subject-matter experts and responsible officials based on accumulated knowledge. Since 2007, DHS has utilized risk assessments based on threat, vulnerability, and consequence to guide planning, programs, and budget activities. Critics question the effectiveness of this approach. Critics challenge DHS's risk assessment formula R=f(TVC) as it struggles to assign probabilities to rare events like terrorist attacks and lacks independence between threat, vulnerability, and consequences. This raises concerns about its application in resource allocation decisions. The DHS risk assessment formula R=f(TVC) struggles with assigning probabilities to rare events like terrorist attacks and lacks independence between threat, vulnerability, and consequences. This raises concerns about its application in resource allocation decisions. DHS recognized the need for a \"complete systemic risk picture\" for critical infrastructure in 2018 and proposed revisions to risk assessment approaches. Legislative and executive branch initiatives in 2018-2019 aimed to establish the basis for significant changes in CI risk assessment. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 (CISA Act; P.L. 115-278) established the CISA agency to take over NPPD functions, elevating CI risk management as a policy focus. CISA created the National Risk Management Center (NRMC) for planning. The creation of CISA as a dedicated agency for infrastructure security elevates CI risk management as a policy focus. CISA has established the National Risk Management Center (NRMC) to manage national CI risk with an evolved approach emphasizing cross-sector analysis and capabilities-oriented approaches. Congress may request information from CISA on its efforts to institutionalize new risk management methods and approaches. The National Risk Management Center (NRMC) under CISA focuses on cross-sector analysis and capabilities-oriented approaches for CI risk management. Congress may request information on new risk management methods and validation by external reviewers. Various organizations like National Laboratories, DHS Centers of Excellence, universities, and industry groups provide expertise in infrastructure risk assessment methodology. The Homeland Security Act guides the Secretary of Homeland Security on leveraging these resources for homeland security support. The Homeland Security Act guides the Secretary of Homeland Security on leveraging organizational resources for homeland security support. Congress may establish funding priorities and program guidance for organizations to support national CI security goals. Federal organization addressing CI issues has evolved in response to threats and homeland security maturation. Federal attention to critical infrastructure (CI) policy increased in the 1990s due to concerns about potential malicious exploitation of technology and physical infrastructure. The development of federal organizations to address CI issues has evolved in response to evolving threats and the maturation of the homeland security enterprise, with three distinct periods of development outlined: initial policy development in the late 1990s, post-9/11 reorganization to counter terrorist threats, and the ongoing transition to an all-hazards resilience framework for infrastructure security. The Clinton Administration established the Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in 1996 to address emerging cyber threats. Two years later, PDD-63 was issued to eliminate vulnerabilities in critical infrastructures. The Administration established the Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in 1996 to address emerging cyber threats. PDD-63 was issued two years later to eliminate vulnerabilities in critical infrastructures. The directive focused on increasing interagency coordination to swiftly eliminate significant vulnerabilities within five years. The National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection and Counter-Terrorism was created to lead these efforts. The National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-Terrorism was established to lead interagency coordination efforts in response to cyber threats and vulnerabilities in critical infrastructures. Congress chartered the Gilmore Commission to assess terrorist threats and the implementation of PDD-63, which resulted in a report titled \"Toward a National Strategy for Combating Terrorism.\" The Gilmore Commission was established in 1999 to assess terrorist threats and the implementation of PDD-63. In December 2000, they submitted a report titled \"Toward a National Strategy for Combating Terrorism\" to Congress and the White House. The report found that the implementation of PDD-63 was incomplete and that the Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) were still in early stages of development. The National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counterterrorism lacked program and budget authority, with no overall national Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) strategy in place. The National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) had not taken significant actions to establish its basic functions for threat assessments and response coordination. The National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) under FBI auspices had not taken concrete actions to establish its basic functions for threat assessments and response coordination. The 9/11 attacks prompted urgent national concern for homeland security policy and critical infrastructure protection, leading to legislative initiatives to reestablish the Office of Homeland Security and enhance national coordination. The 9/11 attacks prompted urgent national concern for homeland security policy. Two legislative tracks emerged: one favored reestablishing the Office of Homeland Security with added responsibilities, while the other focused on improved interagency coordination for increased protection against terrorist attacks. The two legislative tracks for homeland security policy post-9/11: one favored improved interagency coordination for increased protection against terrorist attacks, while the other favored comprehensive consolidation of government counterterrorism functions under a single federal agency. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 was influenced by the recommendations of the Hart-Rudman Commission to consolidate security functions for better coordination and executive authority. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, influenced by the Hart-Rudman Commission, aimed to centralize counterterrorism functions and improve interagency coordination. The Act transferred infrastructure security functions to DHS, previously spread across various sectors like business, finance, and public health. The creation of DHS was deemed high risk by GAO in 2003 due to the challenges of managing the transfer of numerous agencies. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 centralized counterterrorism functions and transferred infrastructure security functions to DHS from diverse sectors like business, finance, and public health. GAO designated the creation of DHS as high risk in 2003 due to the challenges of managing the transfer of numerous agencies. DHS incorporated nearly three dozen federal agencies into four major directorates, prioritizing homeland security missions. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 centralized counterterrorism functions and transferred infrastructure security functions to DHS from various sectors. The new department prioritized homeland security missions, especially counterterrorism, representing a shift from previous infrastructure policy. The Office of Management and Budget noted that Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) was a separate but related mission to counterterrorism. Before 9/11, the White House viewed Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) as only tangentially related to counterterrorism. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) distinguished CIP as a separate but related mission in a report to Congress on federal counterterrorism programs in August 2001. They emphasized that infrastructure risks included hazards beyond terrorism, such as equipment failure, human error, weather, natural disasters, and criminal activity. The focus was on combating terrorism, with CIP efforts mentioned only when directly impacting this mission. The 2001 report emphasized that Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) was only tangentially related to counterterrorism, focusing on combating terrorism. CIP funding for counterterrorism was minimal, amounting to less than half a percent of the total budget. After 9/11, infrastructure programs impacting counterterrorism were included in the 2003 OMB report to Congress. The White House requested a budget increase of $12.1 billion for FY2004, a 450% increase from pre-9/11 levels, with a focus on counterterrorism efforts across federal departments and agencies. This included infrastructure programs highlighted in the 2003 OMB report to Congress. The White House requested a $12.1 billion budget increase for FY2004, a 450% rise from pre-9/11 levels, focusing on counterterrorism efforts across federal departments and agencies. The 2003 report did not provide a separate estimate of the CIP-related budget overlap with counterterrorism, as CIP had been largely redefined as a counterterrorism mission. The creation of a new department was intended to institutionalize CIP and other homeland security missions as top federal priorities under unified leadership. More than half of pre-9/11 homeland security funding was transferred to a single agency, but independent agencies within DHS retained significant independence. Other departments outside DHS also kept many infrastructure security functions they had before 9/11. Despite significant changes, critical infrastructure protection (CIP) remains a highly distributed enterprise competing for limited resources across the federal government. Counterterrorism remained a focal point for CIP policy, but by 2005, Hurricane Katrina highlighted the need for improved infrastructure security measures. By 2005, public perception of the terrorist threat had significantly decreased, with only 6%-8% considering it a major issue, despite counterterrorism remaining a focal point for critical infrastructure security policy. After 2005, public concern about terrorism in the United States decreased to 6%-8%, with occasional increases due to high-profile incidents. In early 2019, terrorism was not listed as a top public concern in Gallup surveys. The failure of New Orleans' levy system after Katrina highlighted the vulnerability of critical systems to various hazards beyond terrorism. Issues such as equipment failure, human error, weather disasters, and criminal activity were also emphasized. The New Orleans levy system failure after Katrina highlighted the vulnerability of critical systems to diverse hazards beyond terrorism. The Critical Infrastructure Task Force argued for a shift in government policies to improve asset resilience against various threats. The Council debated government infrastructure policies, arguing for a focus on resilience against various threats, not just terrorism. The House Committee on Homeland Security also discussed resilience in 2008, with DHS officials emphasizing the importance of policies that promote both resilience and protection. In 2008, the House Committee on Homeland Security held hearings on resilience, with DHS officials emphasizing policies that encourage resilience and protection. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review highlighted the diverse missions and stakeholders in the expanding enterprise, emphasizing the importance of preventing terrorist attacks in the United States. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) submitted to Congress emphasized the diversity of missions and stakeholders within DHS. It acknowledged the importance of preventing terrorist attacks in the US while also addressing other threats such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, transnational crime, and contagious diseases. The QHSR highlighted DHS's leadership in managing risks to critical infrastructure and other homeland security missions. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) highlighted DHS's leadership in managing risks to critical infrastructure and other homeland security missions, including disaster response, cybersecurity, and border security. It emphasized the decentralized nature of homeland security, involving diverse stakeholders in the public and private sector. In 2013, PPD-21 replaced HSPD-7 as the authoritative policy guidance for federal homeland security efforts. In 2013, PPD-21 replaced HSPD-7 as the authoritative policy guidance for federal infrastructure protection. It focused on all-hazards critical infrastructure resilience and national disaster preparedness efforts. The 2014 QHSR expanded critical infrastructure security to include factors like aging and neglect of systems, emphasizing resilience against all hazards and integration with the national preparedness system. The 2014 QHSR expanded critical infrastructure security to include factors like aging and neglect of systems, emphasizing resilience against all hazards. DHS did not submit a QHSR to Congress in 2017 as required, leaving no current departmental-level statement on strategic direction and priorities for infrastructure security. The boundaries of responsibility for critical infrastructure security and the definition of critical infrastructure itself are still being negotiated among Congress and the executive branch. The boundaries of responsibility for critical infrastructure security and the definition of critical infrastructure itself are still being negotiated among Congress, executive branch departments, SLTT jurisdictions, and private-sector stakeholders. For example, in 2002 Congress directed the transfer of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS under the Homeland Security Act due to concerns about terrorist threats to the nation's food and agriculture sector. In 2018, Congress authorized the transfer of a replacement facility and its functions back to USDA from DHS under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018. This decision was made based on concerns about terrorist threats to the nation's food and agriculture sector. The Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-141) proposed by the White House focuses on critical infrastructure security in the federal government, emphasizing an all-hazards approach. Congress may need to determine the division of responsibilities between homeland security and areas like commerce, trade, and public utilities regulation. The evolving definition of homeland security raises questions about the division of responsibilities between homeland security and other areas like commerce, trade, and public utilities regulation. DHS has not submitted a top-level strategy to Congress since 2014, despite a quadrennial review being due in 2017. The definition of homeland security is evolving beyond counterterrorism roots. DHS has not submitted a top-level strategy to Congress since 2014. Congressional interest in homeland security strategy was shown by the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019 (H.R. 1892) passed the House of Representatives unanimously and was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on May 15, 2019. The proposed act would require DHS to consult with relevant advisory committees when developing its strategy, linking it with budgeting and program management. The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019 would require DHS to consult with advisory committees when developing its strategy, linking it with budgeting and program management. Congress has periodically defined organizational relationships within DHS, transitioning from a centralized to a more federated structure emphasizing operational components. The Department of Homeland Security has transitioned from a centralized directorate structure to a more federated one, emphasizing the operational role of its components. The National Protection and Programs Directorate became an agency within DHS in 2018. Congress may consider the level of centralization or federation that best supports the critical infrastructure security mission. The 2018 CISA Act established the National Protection and Programs Directorate as an agency within DHS. Congress may need to assess the organizational structure within DHS to determine the best approach for securing critical infrastructure. The management of critical infrastructure risk in a complex ownership and regulatory environment poses ongoing policy challenges. Policymakers generally support a federated partnership model for collaboration between the public and private sectors to address these challenges. The regulatory environment poses enduring policy challenges for securing critical infrastructure. Policymakers generally support a federated partnership model for collaboration between the public and private sectors, emphasizing voluntary collaboration over regulatory mandates. CI owner-operators hold ultimate responsibility for assessing and mitigating risk at the enterprise level, while executive branch agencies manage risk at the national level through a collaborative effort between the public and private sectors. Infrastructure risk management is a collaborative effort between public and private sectors, relying on incentives, information sharing, and voluntary investments in security. While private individuals or entities largely handle investments in critical infrastructure security, serious risks are collectively borne by the public and larger business community. Government and private-sector representatives work together to assess and manage risks under the current partnership structure. The private sector and individuals handle investments in critical infrastructure security, but serious risks are collectively borne by the public and larger business community. Government and private-sector representatives collaborate to determine necessary investments in security and resilience to manage infrastructure risk at the societal level. It is challenging to determine responsibility for upfront costs and regulatory oversight measures. At the policy level, determining responsibility for upfront costs and regulatory oversight measures for critical infrastructure resilience is challenging. The federal government relies on the private sector to voluntarily invest in risk management strategies to support national resilience goals. The 2013 NIPP emphasizes government efforts to encourage industry to invest in national resilience goals through public-private partnerships. Incentives for industry participation include improved access to risk information from the government. The 2013 NIPP emphasizes government efforts to encourage industry to invest in national resilience goals through public-private partnerships. Incentives for industry participation include improved access to risk information from government sources on security threats and hazards, national-level risk analyses, and the opportunity to influence critical infrastructure policy. Congress acted to reduce barriers to information sharing between the public and private sectors through the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 reduced barriers to information sharing between public and private sectors, ensuring confidentiality of industry information shared with DHS. Public-private coordination councils provide a forum for policy discussions. A 2019 OECD report found that voluntary information sharing and collaboration are beneficial. The public-private coordination councils established under Presidential directives provide a forum for policy discussions. A 2019 OECD report noted that voluntary partnerships may not provide sufficient incentives for investments in resilience, leading developed countries to implement regulatory mandates in certain sectors. Regulatory mandates are preferred for critical infrastructure sectors where incident impacts are significant. Most developed countries use regulatory mandates to spur investments in resilience in critical infrastructure sectors where incident impacts are potentially catastrophic. Collaborative approaches are favored as risks become more privatized and harms are more isolated in their impacts. According to an academic survey, collaborative approaches in public-private partnerships for critical infrastructure security are favored as risks become more privatized. Policymakers aim to limit government regulation in CI security, as seen in PDD-63 and the creation of DHS with broad responsibilities but narrow regulatory mandates. The Homeland Security Act established DHS with broad responsibilities but limited regulatory mandates. Various agencies like TSA, Coast Guard, and CISA have specific roles in regulating aspects of security in sectors like oil and gas, port security, and chemical facilities to prevent terrorist threats. CISA directly regulates certain chemical facilities under the Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards program to prevent terrorist exploitation of the industry. Other agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission enforce safety requirements for civilian nuclear facilities. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates civilian nuclear facilities, enforcing safety and reporting requirements stemming from the Three Mile Island incident in 1979. Infrastructure security, including protection against deliberate attacks, falls under NRC oversight, not DHS. Dual responsibilities for regulation and partnership are typically separated to avoid overlap, a lesson learned from past experiences like NIPC's integration with the FBI's law enforcement functions. The NRC oversees infrastructure security, focusing on protection against deliberate attacks, separate from DHS. DHS infrastructure security programs aim to enhance collaboration with partners through information sharing, training, and assessments. The DHS infrastructure security programs focus on voluntary collaboration with partners through information sharing, training, and assessments. Current CI partnership structures operate under PPD-21 authority and the 2013 NIPP framework, emphasizing distributed responsibility among stakeholders. The 2013 NIPP outlined a decentralized infrastructure protection effort with distributed responsibility among stakeholders. NIPP partnerships are administered by CISA at the federal level, with each CI sector having its own GCC and SCC. The NIPP framework includes 16 CI sectors, each with its own Government Coordinating Council (GCC) and Sector Coordinating Council (SCC) for interagency coordination. DHS leads or co-leads 10 GCCs as the Sector-Specific Agency (SSA), with other SSAs including EPA, GSA, and various federal departments. DHS leads or co-leads 10 of the 16 GCCs as the Sector-Specific Agency (SSA), along with other agencies like EPA, GSA, and federal departments. SSAs use NIPP partnership structures to create sector-specific infrastructure protection plans tailored to each sector's unique characteristics and requirements. These plans analyze sector risks and interdependencies to support the overall goals of the NIPP. The NIPP utilizes various partnership structures to develop sector-specific infrastructure protection plans that consider unique sector characteristics and risks. Sector-specific plans analyze risks, interdependencies, stakeholders, and partners to establish resilience goals and effectiveness measures. Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) consist of private-sector associations and CI owner-operators, recognized by Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs) as representative of the sector, with an advisory role to the federal government. Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) are comprised of private-sector trade associations and individual CI owner-operators. They are self-organized and recognized by Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs) as representative of the sector. SCCs have advisory roles to the federal government and facilitate coordination and information-sharing between government and private-sector stakeholders. They may also support Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) specific to their sector for information sharing. The National Council of ISACs currently lists 24 member organizations. Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) in various sectors facilitate information sharing among stakeholders. ISACs maintain operations centers, deploy representatives to national cybersecurity and communications centers, conduct preparedness exercises, and provide informational products for members. Private-sector participation in SCC activities varies across critical infrastructure sectors. Private-sector participation in SCC activities varies widely across critical infrastructure sectors. Four cross-sector councils represent key stakeholder groups with broad interests. The State, Local, Territorial, and Tribal Government Coordinating Council enhances infrastructure resilience partnerships between jurisdictions. The Critical Infrastructure Cross-Sector Council coordinates cross-sector issues among SCCs. The Federal Senior Leadership Council (FSLC) is composed of senior officials from federal departments and agencies responsible for implementation of the NIPP, chaired by the CISA Director. It exercises leadership over cross-sector councils. The Federal Senior Leadership Council (FSLC) is responsible for implementing the NIPP and is chaired by the CISA Director. It forges policy consensus among federal agencies on CI risk management strategies, coordinates with other cross-sector councils, and collaborates with international partners. The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) facilitates discussions between CI stakeholders on sensitive issues by providing legal exemptions for NIPP coordinating councils and member organizations. CIPAC's Charter has been renewed multiple times since its establishment in 2006. CIPAC provides legal exemptions for NIPP coordinating councils and member organizations to facilitate discussions on sensitive infrastructure security topics. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee (HSAC) offers advice to the Secretary of Homeland Security on related matters. Members are appointed by the Secretary. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee (HSAC) provides policy advice and recommendations to DHS and other relevant agencies. Members, including leaders from various sectors, are appointed by the Secretary. Subcommittees focus on specific homeland security issues like cybersecurity and emerging technologies. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council advises the President and SSAs on critical infrastructure policy. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council, comprised of senior industry leaders, advises the President and SSAs on critical infrastructure policy. It serves as an intermediary between coordination councils, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the President, facilitating consultation between public and private sector representatives at the highest levels of government. Established in 2001 by executive order, it monitors the development and operations of critical infrastructure. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council advises the President and SSAs on critical infrastructure policy, serving as an intermediary between coordination councils, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the President. It was established in 2001 to monitor and improve risk management practices in critical infrastructure sectors through various partnership activities. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council advises on critical infrastructure policy through partnership activities that involve governmental and non-governmental stakeholders in various formats such as symposia, research collaborations, and emergency preparedness. This partnership structure is flat and includes representatives from multiple sectors to promote system resilience. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) is a distributed partnership structure maintained by DHS, with operational elements for coordination and information sharing among critical infrastructure sectors. It collects, analyzes, and shares real-time threat information, conducts training and exercises, and provides decision support to private sector partners. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) collects, analyzes, and shares threat information in real-time within the critical infrastructure partnership network. It provides decision support and conducts training and exercises for private sector partners. The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) monitors cybersecurity incidents and performs related analytic functions. CISA administers both the NICC and the NCCIC. The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) serves as a monitoring and incident response center for cybersecurity incidents. CISA administers both the NICC and the NCCIC, aiming to increase trust and information sharing between the public and private sectors. The partnership system's policy premise is to encourage industry investment in system-level resilience through collaboration initiatives. The partnership system aims to increase industry willingness to invest in system-level resilience through collaboration and information-sharing initiatives. Key questions include the extent of private sector participation in these initiatives, the incentivization of effective investments in risk reduction programs, and appropriate legislative remedies for broader risk reduction investments. The diversity and breadth of critical infrastructure enterprise as currently defined lead to varying answers on the appropriateness of legislative remedies for broader risk reduction investments. Empirical analyses on collaboration within the voluntary framework are limited, with only half of CI sectors showing strong engagement in CIP issues through NIPP partnership structures. Strong communities of interest are found in sectors with robust trade or professional associations. A 2013 study revealed that less than half of critical infrastructure sectors had active \"communities of interest\" engaging in CIP issues through NIPP partnerships. Strongest engagement was seen in sectors with specific threats and unified trade associations. Private-sector risk mitigation investment is influenced by cost-benefit analysis, with some owners expecting government coverage for social costs from terrorist attacks. GAO testimony in 2014 emphasized these points to Congress. The GAO testified to Congress in 2014 about challenges in DHS partnership efforts for critical infrastructure protection. They identified key factors affecting effectiveness, including barriers to information sharing, sharing assessment results, and evaluating partnership performance. DHS was found to not systematically collect data on reasons for industry participation or non-participation. The GAO testified to Congress in 2014 about challenges in DHS partnership efforts for critical infrastructure protection, including barriers to sharing information and evaluating partnership performance. DHS did not systematically collect data on reasons for industry participation or non-participation in security surveys, hindering program effectiveness. The GAO testified to Congress in 2014 about challenges in DHS partnership efforts for critical infrastructure protection. DHS agreed to corrective measures, but GAO had not verified their progress. There is extensive partnership activity across multiple sectors, but few measures to assess effectiveness in meeting resilience goals. Congress may explore DHS's progress in implementing data gathering and analysis initiatives to better ascertain partnership system effectiveness. Congress may explore the progress DHS has made in implementing GAO recommended data gathering and analysis initiatives to better ascertain the effectiveness of the partnership system in incentivizing industry information sharing and investments in risk reduction. CISA and its predecessor organizations have not provided reliable data on public-partnership programs' reach and effectiveness in incentivizing bidirectional information sharing and private investments in national resilience. Congress may address gaps in public-partnership programs by introducing reporting requirements and enhancing regulatory authorities of federal departments to meet national critical infrastructure resilience goals. Enhancement of regulatory authorities of federal departments and agencies may be necessary to meet national critical infrastructure resilience goals, especially when voluntary measures are ineffective or emergent threats require immediate action. An example is the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA), which expands the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to prevent foreign adversaries from gaining control of critical infrastructure assets. Congress may also provide oversight when regulatory authorities related to infrastructure security are insufficient. CISA plans to maintain sector-specific public-private partnerships for information sharing and policy coordination. Congress may need to consider adjusting or replacing these structures to align with the federal risk management approach emphasizing inter-sectoral analysis and resilience. Congress may need to consider adjusting or replacing sector-specific public-private partnerships for information sharing and policy coordination to better align with the federal risk management approach emphasizing inter-sectoral analysis and resilience."
