    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2013\". Congress finds that a significant amount of energy in the United States is released as waste heat from power plants, industrial facilities, and buildings. This waste heat can be recovered and used for building heating or industrial processes. Renewable energy resources in the United States can be used to meet local thermal and electric energy requirements, including recovering waste heat for building heating, industrial process heating, air conditioning, process cooling, or electricity generation. Local energy resources can be utilized to reduce energy waste and meet energy needs efficiently. The use of local renewable energy resources can help meet thermal and electric energy needs in communities in the United States, enhancing energy reliability and competitiveness. The use of local waste heat and renewable energy resources strengthens US industrial competitiveness, reduces reliance on fossil fuels and emissions, increases energy supply resiliency and security, and keeps energy dollars in local economies, creating jobs. District energy systems offer a key opportunity in this regard. District energy systems are crucial for tapping waste heat and renewable energy resources, expanding combined heat and power systems, and serving colleges and universities. District energy systems deliver thermal energy from a CHP system to various end users like colleges, hospitals, and downtown areas. They help reduce peak power demand and constraints on power transmission by shifting demand through thermal storage, generating power near load centers, and meeting air conditioning needs. District energy systems involve shifting power demand through thermal storage, generating power near load centers with a CHP system, and meeting air conditioning needs with chilled water produced by a CHP system or other energy sources. Evaluation and implementation of district energy systems are complex and often require technical assistance. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption by addressing barriers such as lack of capital funding for implementation. The Act aims to encourage the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, reduce air pollution, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and retain energy dollars in local economies. It also aims to facilitate the implementation of local energy projects. The Act aims to encourage the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, enhance energy supply resiliency, reduce air pollution, strengthen industrial competitiveness, and retain energy dollars in local economies. It also aims to facilitate the implementation of local energy projects by providing technical assistance and low-cost financing for infrastructure construction. The Act aims to promote the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, improve energy supply resiliency, decrease air pollution, enhance industrial competitiveness, and keep energy dollars in local economies. The Act promotes the use of waste heat and renewable thermal energy to reduce fossil fuel consumption, improve energy supply resiliency, decrease air pollution, enhance industrial competitiveness, and keep energy dollars in local economies. A Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system generates electric energy and heat efficiently by recovering conventionally rejected heat. A District Energy System provides thermal energy to buildings from one or more plants for space heating and air conditioning. The term \"district energy system\" refers to a system that provides thermal energy to buildings for various uses. The term \"Loan Guarantee Program\" is for the Local Energy Infrastructure Loan Guarantee Program. The term \"local energy infrastructure\" refers to a system that recovers or produces useful thermal or electric energy. The Local Energy Infrastructure Program, established under section 5, defines \"local energy infrastructure\" as a system that recovers or produces useful thermal or electric energy from waste energy or renewable resources, generates electricity using combined heat and power systems, distributes electricity in microgrids, stores thermal energy, or distributes/transfers thermal energy via district energy systems for building heating and cooling. The term \"microgrid\" refers to a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within defined electrical boundaries that can operate independently from the main grid. A microgrid can operate independently from the main grid and connect or disconnect to enable grid-connected or island-mode operation. The term \"renewable energy resource\" includes biomass and fuels produced from biomass materials. The term \"renewable thermal energy\" includes heating or cooling energy derived from biomass, gaseous or liquid fuels, geothermal energy, municipal solid waste, or solar energy as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The term \"renewable thermal energy\" includes heating or cooling energy derived from renewable energy resources, natural sources like cold lake or ocean water, or other renewable thermal energy sources as determined by the Secretary of Energy. The term \"thermal energy\" refers to heating or cooling energy in the form of hot water, steam, chilled water, or other media used for space heating, domestic hot water, air conditioning, or process cooling. Waste energy is defined as energy that is not utilized efficiently. The term \"waste energy\" refers to energy contained in exhaust gases, steam, water, or oil in power generation systems, industrial processes, or tail gas. The term \"waste energy\" refers to energy in exhaust gases, steam, water, or oil in power generation systems, industrial processes, or tail gas, as well as other forms of waste energy like pressure drops and condenser water. The term \"waste energy\" includes energy from exhaust gases, steam, water, or oil in power generation systems, industrial processes, or tail gas, as well as other forms like pressure drops and condenser water.
