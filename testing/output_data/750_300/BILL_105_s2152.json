    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Microcredit for Self-Sufficiency Act of 1998\". Congress finds that over 1 billion people in the developing world live in severe poverty, with high child mortality rates and preventable deaths from malnutrition and disease. Women in poverty face greater workloads and fewer opportunities compared to men. Nearly 33,000 children die daily from preventable malnutrition and disease. Women in poverty have heavier workloads and limited access to education and economic opportunities compared to men. Directly assisting the poorest, especially women, in developing countries positively impacts family incomes, child nutrition, health, and education. The poor in developing nations, especially women, lack stable employment and social safety nets. Many poor women in developing countries lack stable employment and social safety nets, leading them to turn to self-employment for income. However, they struggle to access credit at reasonable rates to grow their businesses, trapping them in poverty. Many poor individuals struggle to access credit at reasonable rates to build their asset base or expand self-employment activities. They are forced to pay high interest rates to money lenders. An international Microcredit Summit aimed to expand access to credit for the world's poorest families, especially women, by 2005. The Microcredit Summit aimed to provide access to credit and financial services to 100 million of the world's poorest families, particularly women, by 2005. This initiative would benefit nearly half of the world's 1 billion absolute poor by enabling them to expand their incomes and businesses through self-sustaining microcredit programs. Microcredit programs through organizations like Grameen Bank and Accion International have successfully provided loans to the very poor, with repayment rates averaging 95 percent or higher. These programs help reduce poverty by giving access to loans at reasonable interest rates. Microcredit institutions like FINCA have high repayment rates, reducing poverty and dependency on foreign assistance. Interest income from loans can cover institutional costs, ensuring long-term sustainability. Loans are recycled, leveraging foreign assistance resources for new benefits to participants. In 1994, AID launched a Microenterprise Initiative in consultation with Congress to expand funding for sustainable microcredit institutions that provide credit, training, and mobilize domestic savings for poverty reduction and economic development. In 1994, AID launched a Microenterprise Initiative with Congress to expand funding for microcredit institutions. The Initiative aimed to support programs providing credit to the poorest with loans under $300. Funding for microenterprise activities fell to $111,000,000 in fiscal year 1996, with only 39 percent supporting these programs. Increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the poorest is crucial to achieving the Microcredit Summit's goal. AID's funding for microenterprise activities in the developing world should be expanded to $160,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 to align with the growing capacity of microcredit institutions. The Microcredit Summit's goal is to expand AID's funding for microenterprise activities in the developing world to $160,000,000 for fiscal year 1999. This will parallel the growing capacity of microcredit institutions and help reach tens of millions of the poorest with microcredit. The Microcredit Summit aims to increase funding for microenterprise activities to $160,000,000 in 1999, focusing on institutions serving the poorest. To reach millions of the poorest with microcredit, successful microcredit institutions need to expand and replicate. PVOs and NGOs have shown competence in developing networks of local microcredit institutions to help the very poor achieve financial stability. PVOs and NGOs have expertise in establishing networks of local microcredit institutions to assist the very poor in achieving financial sustainability. AID should prioritize investing in these organizations through its central funding mechanisms to expand successful microcredit institutions. By prioritizing investment in PVOs and NGOs through AID's central funding mechanisms, successful microcredit institutions can be expanded globally to provide financial services to the world's poorest families. AID can lead in supporting microenterprise for the poorest and improve coordination efforts at the operational level to promote best practices. The Act aims to expand AID's support for microenterprise development for the poorest by improving coordination efforts and promoting best practices in providing financial services. It also focuses on making microenterprise development a key component of AID's economic growth strategy. The Act aims to expand AID's support for microenterprise development by making it the centerpiece of the economic growth strategy. It also focuses on increasing assistance for providing credit to the poorest sector in developing countries, especially women.
