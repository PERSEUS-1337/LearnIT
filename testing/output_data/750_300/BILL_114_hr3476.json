    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\" is a condensed summary of the section title and findings. The Act is titled the \"Prevent a Government Shutdown Act of 2015\" and Congress finds that the Budget Control Act of 2011 set spending caps and required deficit reduction through negotiations or sequestration. The threat of cuts was meant to prompt lawmakers to create a substitute package of revenue increases and spending cuts. The threat of draconian cuts in discretionary and mandatory spending levels was intended to push lawmakers to negotiate a better solution. Despite unsuccessful negotiations, a sequester occurred in fiscal year 2013. This led to a two-year agreement with higher defense and non-defense discretionary spending levels for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. Lawmakers negotiated a two-year agreement setting higher levels of defense and non-defense discretionary spending for fiscal years 2014 and 2015 to avoid deep budget cuts. Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry criticized the level of defense spending under sequestration for undermining armed forces capabilities, readiness, morale, and modernization. The Chairs of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees criticized defense spending cuts under sequestration, stating it undermines armed forces capabilities, readiness, morale, and modernization. Senior military leaders testified that with sequestration-level spending, they cannot execute the National Military Strategy. The impact of the cuts on non-defense discretionary spending is also becoming increasingly clear. NDD United, an alliance of over 2,500 organizations, is working to protect NDD investments. The impact of sequestration cuts on non-defense discretionary spending is clear, affecting economic recovery, business growth, public health, education, oversight, fraud recovery, scientific discovery, and infrastructure. The impact of sequestration cuts on non-defense discretionary spending includes weakening public health preparedness, reducing resources for schools and colleges, compromising federal oversight, hindering scientific discovery, eroding infrastructure, and threatening global emergency response. This is evident in the proposed cuts to the Department of Education and housing vouchers in the fiscal year 2016 bills. The House Committee on Appropriations proposed cuts for fiscal year 2016, including reducing the Department of Education by $2.8 billion, removing housing vouchers from families, and providing $1.4 billion less for the Department of Veterans Affairs than requested by the President. The sequester, if eliminated, would boost economic recovery according to the Congressional Budget Office. Eliminating the sequester would boost economic recovery by increasing GDP and employment, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Relief from the sequester would also allow Congress to pass appropriations legislation and prevent a government shutdown. Relief from the sequester would prevent a government shutdown, as seen in the 16-day shutdown in 2013 which cost the economy 120,000 private-sector jobs and shrunk GDP growth by 0.2 to 0.6 percent. 6.6 million days' worth of work were lost through furloughs of Federal employees. The 2013 government shutdown cost the economy 120,000 private-sector jobs and shrunk GDP growth by 0.2 to 0.6 percent. It resulted in 6.6 million days' worth of work lost through furloughs, $500 million in visitor spending lost at national parks, $4 billion in delayed tax refunds, 6,300 children losing access to Head Start, and delayed food safety inspections. Immediate negotiations are necessary to prevent another shutdown and fund vital services for fiscal year 2016. To prevent another government shutdown and fund vital services for fiscal year 2016, immediate negotiations on a budget agreement are needed. This should include raising discretionary spending caps for defense and non-defense, eliminating the non-defense sequester, and reducing the defense sequester by the same amount. Congress should aim to offset the cost of sequester relief with deficit reduction. Congress should agree to offset the cost of sequester relief with deficit reduction from closing special interest tax loopholes, but sequester relief must occur regardless of this agreement. Bipartisan, bicameral agreement on sequester relief is outlined in Section 2. A bipartisan measure shall be negotiated to increase discretionary spending limits for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, with provisions to reduce the deficit. Members will be appointed within one day of the Act's enactment.
