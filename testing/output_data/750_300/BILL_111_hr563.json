    "content": "The Act titled \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" requires priority for SCHIP coverage of children in families with income under 200 percent of the federal poverty level. The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" amends the Social Security Act to include income-related data in annual reports on the success of states in providing health insurance coverage for children at various income levels. The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" requires the Secretary to establish standards for data collection and reporting on health insurance coverage for children at different income levels based on percentages of the poverty line. The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" requires family income levels to be determined based on gross income relative to percentages of the poverty line for coverage of low-income children. The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" mandates that states must submit a plan to cover all qualified low-income children with creditable health coverage by fiscal year 2010 to be considered approved under section 2106. The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" requires states to submit a plan for covering low-income children with health insurance by fiscal year 2010, which must be approved by the Secretary. The \"SCHIP Expansion for Kids in Need Act of 2009\" mandates states to submit a health insurance plan for low-income children by fiscal year 2010. The Secretary can approve or disapprove the plan based on its design to ensure coverage, with the opportunity for resubmission if needed. The Secretary can approve or disapprove a state's health insurance plan for low-income children, providing an opportunity for resubmission if modifications are needed. The state will be promptly notified of the approval or disapproval. The term 'qualified low-income child' refers to a child whose family's gross income meets certain criteria. In subsection and section 2105(c)(8), a 'qualified low-income child' is defined as a child whose family's gross income does not exceed 200 percent of the poverty line for the family size and meets all eligibility requirements except those related to income. The amendment in section 2105(c) of the Act limits the use of SCHIP funds based on increases in income eligibility levels for low-income children. The State cannot receive payment under this section if its income eligibility level for its child health plan exceeds the level in effect before the enactment, unless it proves that no more than 10 percent of low-income children are affected. The State must maintain its income eligibility level for its child health plan unless it proves that no more than 10 percent of low-income children are not covered. The State must maintain income eligibility levels for its child health plan, with exceptions for qualified low-income children and those meeting eligibility standards as of the enactment date."
