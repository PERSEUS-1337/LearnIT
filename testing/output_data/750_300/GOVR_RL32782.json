    "content": "In February 2002, the Bush Administration proposed \"Clear Skies\" to amend the Clean Air Act by placing emission caps on electric utility emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg. The caps would be imposed in two phases: 2010 (2008 for NOx) and 2018. Clear Skies was introduced in the 108th Congress as H.R. 999 and S. 485, and a modified version was introduced in the 109th Congress as S. 131. The Clear Skies proposal introduced emission caps on electric utility emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg in two phases: 2010 (2008 for NOx) and 2018. A modified version was introduced in the 109th Congress as S. 131 by Senator Inhofe, focusing on a cap-and-trade implementation scheme. EPA states that Clear Skies would deliver guaranteed emissions reductions at a fraction of command and control costs. The Clear Skies proposal focuses on a cap-and-trade implementation scheme for reducing emissions of SO2, NOx, and mercury. EPA believes this approach would provide guaranteed emissions reductions at a lower cost compared to command and control methods. The cap-and-trade provisions are considered less significant in terms of the proposal's impact on the Clean Air Act structure. EPA has already used a regional cap-and-trade program to control NOx emissions in the eastern United States under existing Clean Air Act authority. The EPA has proposed cap-and-trade regulations to control NOx emissions in the eastern United States under the Clean Air Act. Additionally, they have proposed regulations to achieve reductions in SO2 and NOx levels over 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia. There are also proposed regulations for mercury reductions, although their legality is in question. These provisions in the Clear Skies proposal aim to alter existing sections of the Clean Air Act. The Clear Skies proposal aims to alter existing sections of the Clean Air Act for affected electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program, believing certain CAA provisions are no longer necessary. EPA Administrator Whitman stated the need for changes in legislation to achieve similar mercury reductions. The Clear Skies proposal aims to simplify regulations by combining various provisions of the Clean Air Act into one streamlined process, as stated by EPA Administrator Whitman. This would eliminate the need for regulations such as New Source Review, regional haze, BART, MACT standards, NOx SIP Call, 126 Rule, and acid rain for affected utilities. The Clear Skies proposal aims to simplify regulations by combining various provisions of the Clean Air Act into one streamlined process for utilities. This would eliminate the need for regulations such as New Source Review, regional haze, BART, MACT standards, NOx SIP Call, 126 Rule, and acid rain. The potential impact of Clear Skies legislation on the Clean Air Act structure for electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program is examined in a report. The report analyzes the potential impact of Clear Skies legislation on the Clean Air Act structure for electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program. It focuses on Title I regulations and how they affect utility planning and operations based on factors like location, facility age, and fuel type. The regulatory structure generally applies to SO2, NOx, and particulate matter requirements. The Clean Air Act regulations apply to factors like facility location, age, and fuel type. The addition of Title IV in 1990 did not change the Act's basic requirements. The Clean Air Act, established in 1970 and expanded in 1977, remains the backbone of the Act. Title IV, added in 1990, did not alter the Act's basic requirements. It introduced National Ambient Air Quality Standards, New Source Performance Standards, and Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate to protect and enhance air quality. The Clean Air Act of 1970 established National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) to limit air pollutants and protect public health. NAAQS cover pollutants like SO2, NOx, and PM, with EPA setting primary standards for health protection. States are responsible for compliance with these federally enforceable standards. The EPA sets NAAQS to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety, periodically reviewing them based on health data. States enforce NAAQS through State Implementation Plans, focusing on reducing emissions to ensure compliance. The 1970 Clean Air Act mandates states to require new sources to use LAER technology in areas not meeting NAAQS. The 1970 Clean Air Act mandates states to require new sources to use Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology to control pollution levels and prevent emissions from increasing. LAER is based on the most stringent emission rate without considering cost or energy use, while existing sources in nonattainment areas must use Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) determined by states. The 1970 Clean Air Act established emission standards for new and existing sources of air pollution. New sources must use Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) technology, while existing sources in nonattainment areas must install Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT). Additionally, the Act set New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities, including limits for SO2, NOx, and PM10, which are reviewed every eight years. The Clean Air Act established emission standards for new and existing sources of air pollution, including NSPS for fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities. The Act requires a review of standards every eight years and addresses interstate pollution through mechanisms like regional commissions and state petitions. The Clean Air Act established emission standards for air pollution sources, including NSPS for electric generating facilities. Interstate pollution is addressed through regional commissions and state petitions. The NOx SIP Call regulates NOx emissions in 20 states and the District of Columbia, with states given emission budgets to achieve. EPA encouraged states to implement the rule through a cap-and-trade program. The Clean Air Act established emission standards for air pollution sources, including NSPS for electric generating facilities. EPA successfully encouraged states to implement the rule through a cap-and-trade program, with existing sources subject to state controls in nonattainment areas and major new sources subject to NSPS requirements. The 1977 Clean Air Act introduced the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program, focusing on controlling ambient concentrations of pollutants in clean air areas. It allows for some increase in pollution levels based on classification. Title I of the Clean Air Act focuses on regulating pollution levels in clean air areas, allowing for some increase based on classification. Class I areas like national parks have strict limits on degradation, while Class II areas have moderate allowances. States can reclassify Class II areas to Class III, permitting degradation up to the NAAQS. New sources in PSD areas must undergo preconstruction review and install Best Available Control. States can reclassify Class II areas to Class III, allowing degradation up to the NAAQS. New sources in PSD areas must undergo preconstruction review and install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) determined on a case-by-case basis by state permitting agencies. BACT must be at least as stringent as federal NSPS, but can be more so if needed to avoid violating emission limitations or the NAAQS. BACT must be at least as stringent as federal NSPS, but can be more so if needed to avoid violating emission limitations or the NAAQS. The regional haze program focuses on preventing and remedying visibility impairment from manmade air pollution in national parks and wilderness areas. Sources built between 1962 and 1977 are required to install Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART). The EPA established a regional haze program in 1999 to improve visibility in national parks and wilderness areas by imposing stricter controls on pollutants like NOx and SO2. Additionally, Title I requires fossil fuel-fired electric generating facilities built between 1962 and 1977 to install Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) to reduce pollutants that impair visibility. The EPA established a two-phase federal regulatory program for 188 hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) listed in the Act, including mercury. The first phase involves promulgating Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for all major sources of the pollutants. MACT must be at least as stringent as the best controlled similar source. In the second phase, additional regulations are implemented eight years after MACT is promulgated. The EPA Administrator determines MACT standards for hazardous air pollutants, which must be as stringent as the best controlled similar source. Electric utilities receive special treatment under Section 112, with regulations required to address residual risks from HAPs. EPA must report to Congress on public health hazards from electric generating units' emissions before issuing MACT. In Section 112(n), EPA must report to Congress on public health hazards from electric generating units' emissions before issuing MACT standards. EPA initially found regulation under Section 112 to be \"appropriate and necessary,\" but later proposed a cap-and-trade program as its preferred approach. EPA proposed a cap-and-trade program under Section 111 as its preferred approach for regulating emissions from electric generating units. States can implement more stringent standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) than federal ones, with some states already doing so. Several states, such as Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Wisconsin, have implemented more stringent standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) than federal regulations. Clear Skies would bring changes to current laws, including the establishment of national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, and the extension and revision of the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2. Some changes would remove existing authority, such as the hazardous air pollutant provisions of Section 112 related to mercury emissions. The Clear Skies proposal includes establishing national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, extending and revising the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2, and making changes to existing authorities related to hazardous air pollutants. Additional authorities include cap-and-trade programs for SO2, NOx, and Hg, statutory emission standards for electric generating units, and the option for sources in other industries to opt in. The Clear Skies proposal includes establishing national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, extending and revising the Title IV cap-and-trade program for SO2, and making changes to existing authorities related to hazardous air pollutants. Additional authorities include cap-and-trade programs for SO2, NOx, and Hg, statutory emission standards for electric generating units, and the option for sources in other industries to opt in. Authorities removed or limited include provisions for major sources and changes to hazardous air pollutant provisions. The Clear Skies proposal includes national cap-and-trade programs for utility emissions of NOx and mercury, extending the Title IV program for SO2, and making changes to hazardous air pollutant provisions. Authorities removed include provisions for major sources, changes to mercury emissions control, and a moratorium on petitions to control interstate air pollution. The Clear Skies proposal includes changes such as a moratorium on petitions to control interstate air pollution, stricter requirements for such petitions after the moratorium, reduced penalties for noncompliance in the SO2 cap-and-trade program, preemption of state requirements for NOx and mercury, elimination of NSR for major source modifications, removal of BART requirements for visibility protection, and establishment of a 50 km zone around Class I areas for PSD. The proposed changes include a 50 km zone around Class I areas for PSD requirements, exemption of affected units in PSD Class II areas from pollution limitations, extension of deadlines for meeting NAAQS, and moratoriums on ozone nonattainment provisions and conformity requirements. The Clear Skies proposal includes a cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Mercury emissions, replacing Title IV of the Clean Air Act. It sets caps in two phases and establishes trading programs for flexibility. Additionally, it includes extensions for meeting ozone and PM 2.5 NAAQS deadlines, and moratoriums on ozone nonattainment provisions and conformity requirements. The proposal aims to replace Title IV of the Clean Air Act with a multi-pollutant cap-and-trade program, setting caps on emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg in two phases. Phase 1 caps for EGUs are 2.19 million tons of NOx in 2008, 4.5 million tons of SO2 in 2010, and 34 tons of mercury in 2010. Phase 2 caps, effective in 2018, are 1.79 million tons of NOx, 3.0 million tons of SO2, and 15 tons of mercury. Allowance trading program provisions are similar to existing ones. The S. 131 Phase 2 caps, effective in 2018, are set at 1.79 million tons of NOx, 3.0 million tons of SO2, and 15 tons of mercury. Allowances would be allocated free to EGUs based on historic fuel usage, with adjustments for factors specified in the bill. A small pool of allowances would be set aside for SO2, NOx, and Hg programs. The bill would adjust allocation of allowances for EGUs based on factors specified, with a small pool set aside for new units. National emission standards for SO2, NOx, and Hg from new and reconstructed EGUs would be more stringent than current NSPS. The new emission standards for SO2, NOx, and Hg from new and reconstructed EGUs are stricter than current NSPS, with lower limits for NOx and particulate matter. The Hg standard is more stringent for some units but allows more emissions for others compared to proposed MACT standards. The National Emission Standards for SO2, NOx, and Hg from new and reconstructed EGUs are stricter than current NSPS, with lower limits for NOx and particulate matter. The proposed MACT for bituminous-fired EGUs allows two and a half times as much emissions as the National Emission Standards. The National Emission Standards would apply to fewer units and be reviewed every eight years. Non-utility sources can opt into the cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions. S. 131 allows non-utility units to opt into the cap-and-trade program for SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions. Units can determine allowances based on heat input or product output. Allocations for SO2 and NOx emissions start at 70% of baseline in 2010, and 50% in 2018. Mercury allocations start in 2010 based on federal or state hazardous limits. Units opting into the cap-and-trade program under S. 131 would receive allocations based on baseline emissions for SO2 and NOx, starting at 70% in 2010 and 50% in 2018. Mercury allocations would align with federal or state hazardous air pollutant standards from 2010 onwards. Compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants in various categories would be exempted for participating units. Units opting into the cap-and-trade program would be exempt from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutants in various categories and permanently exempt if EPA accepts their application. They would also not be considered a major source for 20 years under certain parts of the Act. The ClearSkies proposal would exempt opt-in units from certain requirements for 20 years if pollution control equipment is properly maintained. It also introduces a new \"transitional\" designation for areas instead of \"nonattainment\" under the Clean Air Act. ClearSkies proposes establishing a new \"transitional\" area category in place of nonattainment designations under the Clean Air Act for areas that will attain new ozone and PM 2.5 standards by December 31, 2015. EPA modeling shows that most nonattainment counties would qualify for this transitional status, with others able to qualify by implementing additional local controls. The Clear Skies proposal aims to create a \"transitional\" area category to replace nonattainment designations under the Clean Air Act for areas expected to meet new ozone and PM 2.5 standards by 2015. Around 88% of ozone and two-thirds of PM 2.5 nonattainment counties would qualify for this status, with others eligible by implementing local controls. This change extends attainment deadlines and removes statutory requirements for nonattainment areas until after 2017, including exemptions from major source requirements. Clear Skies proposal exempts affected units from major source requirements under Parts C and D of the Clean Air Act for 20 years after enactment. This includes exemptions from NSR, BART, and BACT, unless located near designated national parks. The Clear Skies proposal exempts affected units from major source requirements under the Clean Air Act for 20 years after enactment, including NSR, BART, and BACT, unless located near designated national parks. Within 50 km of Class I areas, units remain subject to PSD requirements. In nonattainment areas, affected units are exempt from nonattainment NSR, LAER, and offset requirements. Clear Skies proposal exempts affected units from major source requirements under the Clean Air Act for 20 years after enactment, including NSR, BART, and BACT, unless located near designated national parks. In nonattainment areas, affected units are exempt from nonattainment NSR, LAER, and offset requirements if they meet certain criteria within three years of enactment. The Clear Skies proposal aims to exempt pollution control equipment maintenance and repair for emissions reduction within three years of enactment. Changes to the Hazardous Air Pollutant Provisions would limit regulation of hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utility steam generating units, with exceptions for non-mercury pollutants based on public health concerns. The Administrator would have the authority to address non-mercury hazardous air pollutants from EGUs based on public health concerns and emission controls, with a peer-reviewed study required before imposing controls. Any standards imposed could not take effect before January 1, 2018. A determination to impose controls on non-mercury hazardous air pollutants from EGUs would require a peer-reviewed study and public comment, with standards not taking effect before January 1, 2018. S. 131 exempts units opting into cap-and-trade from compliance deadlines for hazardous air pollutant regulations and MACT standards. Additionally, Clear Skies proposes changes to Section 126 petitions under the Clean Air Act. Clear Skies proposes changes to Section 126 petitions under the Clean Air Act, establishing a moratorium on petitions to control interstate air pollution from affected units and setting stricter requirements for acceptance of such petitions. The amendment to Section 126 of the Clean Air Act establishes a moratorium on petitions for controlling interstate air pollution from affected units. The Administrator cannot require submission of State Implementation Plans (SIPs) subjecting units to Section 126 requirements before December 31, 2014. The amendment to Section 126 of the Clean Air Act establishes a moratorium on petitions for controlling interstate air pollution from affected units. The Administrator may not require submission of SIPs subjecting affected units to Section 126 requirements with an effective date before December 31, 2014. When reviewing a petition under Section 126, the Administrator must consider emissions reductions required by relevant nonattainment areas' attainment dates. The Administrator must also ensure that emission reductions from affected units are cost-effective compared to other sources. Clear Skies would replace the Clean Air Act's existing Section 411 in 2008, reducing penalties for noncompliance. The Administrator must determine cost-effective emission reductions from affected units compared to other sources in upwind areas. Clear Skies would replace the Clean Air Act's Section 411 in 2008, reducing penalties for noncompliance with the sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program. The penalties would be set at $2,000 per ton with no inflation adjustments. The Clear Skies bill would reduce penalties for noncompliance with the sulfur dioxide cap-and-trade program to $2,000 per ton without inflation adjustments, cutting the penalty by about one-third initially. States would be prohibited from interfering with the program. The Clear Skies bill prohibits states from enforcing limits more stringent than those in the bill, particularly under cap-and-trade programs. This could result in increased emissions in one jurisdiction offsetting reductions in another. Additionally, the bill limits the ability to control out-of-state pollution through Section 126 petitions. The Clear Skies bill limits states from enforcing stricter emission limits than those in the bill, potentially leading to increased emissions offsetting reductions in other areas. It also restricts the ability to control out-of-state pollution through Section 126 petitions. Additionally, the bill eliminates New Source Review for modifications of EGUs, exempting them from NSR for 20 years but establishing National Emission Standards for new EGUs. The Clear Skies bill exempts EGUs and opt-in facilities from NSR for 20 years but sets National Emission Standards for new EGUs. The standards apply to reconstructed units with a cost criterion for qualification. The standards for reconstructed units under the Clear Skies bill have a cost criterion for qualification, exempting them from NSR unless it is feasible to meet the standards. EPA's attempt to establish a 20% threshold for modifications was criticized and stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The 20% threshold for modifications under the Clear Skies bill was criticized and stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals on December 24, 2003. The bill also exempts EGUs and opt-in facilities from Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for 20 years after enactment to protect visibility in national park and wilderness areas. The Clear Skies bill exempts EGUs and opt-in facilities from BART requirements for 20 years to protect visibility in national park and wilderness areas. In Class I PSD Areas, affected units within 50 km of a Class I area must comply with PSD requirements for new construction or reconstruction. The Clear Skies bill exempts affected units in Class II PSD Areas from having to offset emissions to maintain ambient air quality. Permit applicants must identify Class I areas within 100 km of the unit's location for new source permits. Clear Skies bill exempts affected units in Class II areas from offsetting emissions to maintain air quality. It extends deadlines for ozone and PM2.5 NAAQS compliance. The Clear Skies bill introduces a new \"transitional\" area classification for areas that can show they will meet ozone and PM 2.5 standards by 2015. These transitional areas will not face penalties until that date, but if they fail to meet the standards after 2015, they will be designated as nonattainment by 2017. The Clear Skies bill introduces a new \"transitional\" area classification for areas that can show they will meet ozone and PM 2.5 standards by 2015. If an area fails to achieve the standard after 2015, it would be designated nonattainment by June 2017 and would have to impose controls to reach attainment by 2022. Ozone transitional areas would be exempt from statutory requirements until 2017. The Clean Air Act's Subpart 2 outlines specific requirements for ozone nonattainment areas, including LAER standards, offset requirements for new sources, RACT for existing sources, vehicle inspection programs, vapor recovery, reformulated gasoline use, and penalties for non-compliance. EPA proposes to maintain these requirements for areas that fail to meet standards. The EPA proposes to maintain requirements for ozone nonattainment areas, including LAER standards, offset requirements, RACT, vehicle inspection programs, vapor recovery, reformulated gasoline use, and penalties for non-compliance. Transitional areas may be able to roll back statutory requirements if they demonstrate attainment by 2015. Clear Skies proposes reclassifying most ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas as \"transitional,\" allowing them to potentially roll back statutory requirements by demonstrating attainment by 2015. This would eliminate the need for conformity requirements under the Clean Air Act, which currently mandate that federally funded projects in nonattainment areas conform to the area's SIP for clean air. Failure to demonstrate conformity can result in a suspension of federal transportation funds. Proposed Clear Skies legislation would reclassify most ozone and PM 2.5 nonattainment areas as \"transitional,\" eliminating the need for conformity requirements until 2018. The legislation would also make changes to Title I regarding electric generating units and industrial sources opting into the program. Under the proposed Clear Skies legislation, Title I would undergo significant changes for electric generating units (EGUs) and industrial sources opting into the program. The key structural change would be the removal of location as a variable for controlling EGUs, except within 50 km of a PSD Class I area. Emission limitations and the allowance system under Clear Skies would not be based on whether an EGU is in an attainment or nonattainment area, allowing trading regardless of location or state/local government restrictions. The emission limitations under Clear Skies are not tied to the location of EGUs, allowing trading regardless of state or local restrictions. This would eliminate states' ability to set stringent rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas. The ability to set stringent LAER or offset rules on EGUs in nonattainment areas would be eliminated under Clear Skies. State and local governments would also be unable to restrict trading by EGUs within nonattainment areas, preventing them from influencing actual emissions. Additionally, the state's enforcement mechanism NSR would be eliminated for EGUs covered by Clear Skies, limiting the effectiveness of state standards. Clear Skies aims to prevent states from setting stringent standards under their own Clean Air Act equivalent statute, limiting their ability to restrict allowance trading and achieve additional emissions reductions. The state would be unable to prevent the sale of allowances or force neighboring utilities to reduce emissions until after 2014. Clear Skies aims to limit states' ability to set stringent standards under their own Clean Air Act equivalent statute, restricting allowance trading and additional emissions reductions. The state could not prevent allowance sales or compel neighboring utilities to reduce emissions until after 2014. The legislation establishes a new \"transitional\" designation for areas not meeting air quality standards, aiming to achieve attainment by December 2015 through Clear Skies and other measures. Clear Skies introduces a \"transitional\" designation for areas not meeting air quality standards, aiming for attainment by December 2015 through various measures. It also includes provisions to protect Class I areas and limit states' ability to set stringent standards. Clear Skies aims to protect Class I areas within 50 km, but there are debates on its effectiveness. States face challenges in protecting areas not meeting Class I requirements due to restrictions on imposing controls. The controversy over EGU age remains unresolved under Clear Skies. Clear Skies aims to reduce disparities in requirements for new and existing sources by setting up allowance reserves. Existing sources would have more generous allocation formulas, while new sources operate on a first-come, first-serve basis once the reserve is exhausted. The allocation formulas for existing sources under Clear Skies are more generous than for new sources, which operate on a first-come, first-serve basis. Once the reserve is exhausted, no further allowances are available for new sources. Existing units maintain an advantage over new facilities in receiving allowances. Table 4 outlines the regulation of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants under Clear Skies. New and existing Electric Generating Units (EGUs) would no longer be subject to Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards or residual risk standards. This absence of unit-specific standards could make it challenging to address areas with higher concentrations of mercury. The absence of unit-specific standards under Clear Skies could make it difficult to address \"hot spots\" with higher mercury concentrations. State standards set under their own Clean Air Act would not be completely controlling, allowing for extra reductions to create additional allowances for trading. The state's legislation to regulate mercury emissions could lead to additional allowances for trading with upwind utilities. The Administrator retains authority to address non-mercury HAPs from EGUs under stringent conditions, including a requirement for a peer-reviewed study on public health concerns. Standards for non-mercury HAPs cannot be implemented before 2018. Former Administrator Whitman has highlighted the central issue in Clear Skies' interaction. Former Administrator Whitman has identified the central issue in Clear Skies' interaction with the Clean Air Act regarding utility controls and achieving NAAQS. Clear Skies will not meet the ozone or fine particulate NAAQS within current compliance deadlines. Clear Skies will not achieve the 8-hour ozone or fine particulate NAAQS within current compliance deadlines, requiring additional controls and time for attainment in some nonattainment areas. The current draft of Clear Skies would limit states' options for electric utility controls to reach the required standards. Clear Skies, as currently drafted, would limit states' options for electric utility controls to achieve NAAQS attainment and maintain PSD increments. The opt-in provision creates uncertainty about the reach of Clear Skies, potentially reducing state and local authorities' options for achieving clean air standards. Mercury contamination issues in 45 states could be exacerbated by Clear Skies' controls. Clear Skies' proposed controls on mercury emissions from electric utilities could worsen mercury contamination issues in 45 states, limiting states' options to achieve clean air standards. Clear Skies would limit state options to reduce mercury emissions, extending compliance deadlines and potentially leading to overcontrol in the early years of implementation. The Clear Skies program may lead to overcontrol in the early years of implementation due to extended compliance deadlines. Achieving reductions early under a cap-and-trade program does not guarantee more reductions in the long term, as demonstrated by the ability to increase emissions later using banked allowances. This additional flexibility can complicate compliance strategies for state and local authorities."
