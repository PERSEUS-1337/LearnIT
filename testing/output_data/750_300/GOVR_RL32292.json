    "content": "Offshoring, also known as offshore outsourcing, involves U.S. businesses contracting with firms outside the country to provide services that would have been done by in-house employees. This practice has expanded from blue-collar to white-collar occupations, raising concerns about job loss among U.S. workers. Offshoring, or offshore outsourcing, has evolved from U.S. manufacturers to service providers, leading to concerns about job loss among U.S. workers. The unemployment rate remains high, raising questions about the labor market implications of offshore outsourcing. Some believe it has contributed to \"jobless recoveries\" from past recessions. The labor market implications of offshore outsourcing during the 2009 recession were unclear. Some believed it contributed to job loss, while others argued that the historical link between economic growth and job creation would eventually lead to recovery. The labor market did recover from the 2001 recession, supporting estimates that offshoring alone accounted for 3% of net job loss in the early 2000s. Offshoring may have contributed to job loss during the 2009 recession, with estimates suggesting it accounted for 3% of net job loss in the early 2000s. Some argue that offshoring is hindering the labor market's recovery from the 2007-2009 recession, causing painful adjustments for workers but benefiting the nation as a whole by enabling firms to sell a greater variety of higher quality products. Many economists agree that trade and globalization benefit the nation by enabling firms to sell a greater variety of products at lower prices. However, there are concerns about whether this applies to services offshoring. Companies engaged in offshoring may be the main beneficiaries, using profits to increase dividends and raise stock prices. Milberg et al. suggest that companies engaged in offshoring of service activities may benefit by increasing dividends, raising stock prices, and pursuing mergers and acquisitions instead of reinvesting in the U.S. economy. The movement of services jobs to other countries may have different implications for the labor market and public policy compared to production jobs. The offshoring of service jobs to other countries may impact the labor market differently than the movement of production jobs. Data shows that factory workers have lower education levels compared to administrative and professional workers. There is concern that offshoring service jobs may result in a decrease in entry-level jobs for college graduates. The offshoring of service jobs may lead to a decrease in entry-level positions for college graduates, raising concerns about job opportunities for well-educated workers affected by offshoring. Congress aims to support workers facing job losses due to offshoring through trade adjustment assistance programs. Assistance programs aim to help well-educated office workers who lose their jobs to offshoring. Congress supports job growth and assists workers affected by job losses, whether due to economic downturns or shifts in job composition. Some policymakers advocate for measures to encourage U.S. firms to create jobs domestically instead of overseas. The notion that offshoring depresses job growth in the United States has led to support for measures encouraging U.S. firms to expand employment domestically. Some policymakers advocate for trade and labor policies to level the playing field for U.S. companies, while others prefer limited government intervention for promoting economic growth. This report briefly examines these issues without delving into all the details addressed in other CRS reports. This report briefly examines the development of outsourcing by U.S. companies and synthesizes information on offshore outsourcing's impact on U.S. employment since the early 2000s to help policymakers evaluate retraining and income support programs for displaced workers. Since the early 2000s, information has been released on offshore outsourcing's impact on U.S. employment. Major U.S. companies began relocating manufacturing work abroad in the 1970s and 1980s, displacing well-paid U.S. factory workers. This data helps policymakers assess the effectiveness of retraining and income support programs for displaced workers. During the 1970s and 1980s, U.S. companies faced competition from Japanese and European multinational corporations, leading to the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs previously held by well-paid U.S. factory workers. This was exacerbated by the recessions of the early 1980s, prompting companies to focus on core missions and outsource activities to specialized domestic enterprises for greater efficiency. Operations were restructured by outsourcing jobs to temporary help agencies, professional services establishments, and independent contractors. The outsourcing of jobs to specialized domestic enterprises for greater efficiency, including janitorial services and professional services like accounting firms, became a permanent reorganization of work in the United States. The 2001 recession further prompted U.S. employers to utilize technological innovations to minimize physical distance between companies. The 2001 recession prompted U.S. employers to achieve further efficiencies by utilizing technological innovations that minimize physical distance between companies. This has allowed U.S. firms to extend offshoring beyond goods production to services, such as software coding, credit-card processing, medical imaging interpretation, and financial analysis. The 2001 recession led U.S. firms to expand offshoring from goods production to services like software coding, credit-card processing, medical imaging interpretation, and financial analysis. This shift affected both information technology (IT) workers and IT-enabled workers, with events like the Y2K crisis boosting other countries' ability to export services, particularly IT services, to the United States and other developed nations. The ability to export services, especially IT services, to the United States and other developed countries was boosted by events like the Y2K crisis. Companies in the late 1990s turned to India for code fixes due to a shortage of computer programmers. Low-wage foreign nations also produced a large number of well-educated individuals with IT and accounting skills. The educational systems of low-wage foreign nations have produced an abundant supply of well-educated individuals with IT and accounting skills. This has allowed for IT services to be provided from non-English-speaking, low-wage nations worldwide. IT services can now be provided from various low-wage nations worldwide, allowing U.S.-based companies to fragment tasks across borders in manufacturing and information services. This includes tasks like research, design, management, and IT support being located in different countries. The extension of task fragmentation to service activities, such as research, design, management, and IT support across different countries, has contributed to increased wage dispersion in the United States. Technological change and deunionization have also played a role in the polarization of wages during the 1980s and 1990s. There is no comprehensive database available to determine the exact number of jobs lost to offshoring. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' data on extended mass layoffs since 2004 underestimates jobs lost to offshoring, as it only includes large layoffs from firms with at least 50 employees. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' data on extended mass layoffs since 2004 underestimates jobs lost to offshoring, focusing on large layoffs from firms with at least 50 employees. The series is better at picking up losses at manufacturers than at service providers, with relatively few job losses attributed to work moving away from the United States. In the third quarter of 2012, out of over 100,000 workers separated in extended mass layoffs, less than 1,600 were let go due to work movement, representing less than 1% of the total. Few job losses result from work moving away from the United States, with less than 1% of workers separated in extended mass layoffs in the third quarter of 2012 having their jobs moved to another country. Forrester Research, Inc. provided statistics on offshoring of service sector jobs, forecasting a total of 3.4 million jobs being offshored. Forrester Research, Inc. forecasted that 3.4 million service-sector jobs could move abroad between 2003 and 2015, with 1.7 million jobs relocating outside the United States in the first 7 years. This suggests a trend of increasing offshoring of service activities. Forrester Research predicted that 3.4 million service-sector jobs could move overseas between 2003 and 2015, with 1.7 million jobs relocating in the first 7 years. This trend indicates a growing offshoring of service activities. Researchers have focused on identifying which jobs are at risk of being offshored and estimating U.S. employment in these activities. Researchers have focused on determining which jobs in the United States are susceptible to being moved abroad, estimating that about 11% of total U.S. employment in 2001 could potentially be sent overseas. Certain jobs in the United States have attributes that make them vulnerable to being offshored, such as no need for in-person customer service, IT-enabled work processes, routinized tasks, significant pay gap with destination countries, and few language barriers. Occupational groups at risk include office support, auditors, computer programmers, medical transcriptionists, paralegals, and technical writers, mainly in industries like information and finance. Certain jobs in the United States vulnerable to offshoring include office support, auditors, computer programmers, medical transcriptionists, paralegals, and technical writers. These jobs are concentrated in industries like information, finance, and insurance. A study by the Brookings Institution projected that only 2.2% of jobs in metropolitan areas may be lost due to offshoring from 2004-2015. The study by the Brookings Institution projected that only 2.2% of jobs in 246 metropolitan areas may be lost due to offshoring from 2004-2015. Five metro areas, including Boulder, CO; Lowell, MA; San Francisco, CA; San Jose, CA; and Stamford, CT, might lose somewhat more jobs by 2015, with another 23 areas also at risk of job loss. These vulnerable areas tend to be very populous, with 1 million or more residents. The study projected that 2.2% of jobs in 246 metropolitan areas may be lost due to offshoring from 2004-2015. Five metro areas, including Boulder, CO; Lowell, MA; San Francisco, CA; San Jose, CA; and Stamford, CT, are most vulnerable to services offshoring, with another 23 areas at risk. These areas tend to be populous, located in the Northeast and West, and have high concentrations of IT jobs or IT-enabled back-office jobs. The study by Jensen and Kletzer developed a geographically based approach to estimate the share of tradable and nontradable jobs in various industries. About 9.4% of total U.S. employment in 2000 was found to be in offshorable industries. These industries are concentrated in populous areas in the Northeast and West with high concentrations of IT jobs or IT-enabled back-office jobs. In 2000, about 9.4% of total U.S. employment was in offshorable industries, including manufacturing and professional services. Manufacturing and professional services industries were found to have above-average vulnerability to offshoring. Jensen and Kletzer ranked 457 service occupations based on their vulnerability to being offshored by examining task content. Jensen and Kletzer examined 457 service occupations to rank their vulnerability to offshoring based on task content. They found that occupational groups such as computer and mathematical, architecture and engineering, legal, and business and financial operations were highly offshorable. Jensen and Kletzer identified occupational groups like computer and mathematical, architecture and engineering, legal, and business and financial operations as highly offshorable. These groups accounted for a large share of employment in offshorable categories, with a significant percentage of bachelor's degree holders making them more vulnerable to offshoring. In 2005, BLS found that service occupations with higher educational attainment were more vulnerable to offshoring. Out of 515 service occupations, 160 were estimated to be susceptible to offshoring, with a focus on professional and technical categories, especially computer and mathematical science occupations. In 2007, around 30 million jobs in offshorable service-providing occupations were susceptible to offshoring, with over one-fifth of total employment in that year. Despite vulnerability, employment in these occupations grew slightly faster than overall service-providing employment from 2001 to 2007. Wage growth was also comparatively greater in these offshorable occupations during the same period. Employment in offshorable occupations grew faster than overall service-providing employment from 2001 to 2007. Wage growth was also higher in these occupations. However, the 33 most vulnerable service-providing occupations to offshoring experienced below average employment and wage growth during this period. These vulnerable occupations range from office and administrative support to professional and related occupations. Blinder categorized occupations into office and administrative support roles with low education requirements and professional roles with higher educational requirements. He also created an offshorability index for various occupations based on the need for personal interaction. The majority of occupations are non-offshorable. Blinder categorized occupations based on the need for personal interaction, with a majority being non-offshorable. He estimated that about 200 U.S. occupations and 30 million workers were highly offshorable or offshorable, which he considered a conservative estimate. Blinder estimated that about 200 U.S. occupations and 30 million workers were highly offshorable or offshorable, but he believed this was a conservative estimate. He then created moderate and aggressive estimates, totaling 25.6% and 29.0% of all U.S. jobs, respectively. Contrary to conventional wisdom, he noted that the more offshorable occupations are not low-end jobs. Blinder estimated that 25.6% to 29.0% of all U.S. jobs are highly offshorable or offshorable, totaling almost 40 million workers. He found that offshorable occupations are not necessarily low-end jobs, contradicting conventional wisdom. Research on offshoring of services occupation by BLS economists, along with Blinder's study, contradicts the results of Jensen and Kletzer. Different measures of offshorability may explain the varying results. Blinder and Krueger found that about one in four U.S. jobs are potentially offshorable, suggesting offshorability is significant. Three methods indicate that approximately 25% of U.S. jobs could be offshored, similar to Blinder's estimate. Offshorability is prominent in factory and administrative roles, as well as in industries like manufacturing, finance, information, and professional services. Despite concerns, only a fraction of the potential market for offshoring IT and business processes has been tapped into, possibly due to executives needing to learn more about offshore operations. Some experts believe fears about offshoring services are exaggerated. Only a small portion of the potential market for offshoring global IT and business processes has been utilized, as executives need to learn how to effectively use offshore talent. The management challenge will become more pressing as global salaries rise, diminishing cost advantages from outsourcing. Deloitte Consulting predicts that outsourcing will no longer be seen as a \"holy grail\" and companies will not outsource simply as a trend. Some experts believe fears about offshoring services are exaggerated. Deloitte Consulting predicts outsourcing will no longer be seen as a \"holy grail\" and companies will not outsource as a trend. Organizations will define core functions to keep inhouse for control and confidentiality. Some will only outsource short-term, while others will re-insource, eroding the outsourcing market. Dell, for example, brought back help services to the United States. Some organizations are re-insourcing key functions, eroding the outsourcing market. Dell, for instance, returned help services to the United States due to customer dissatisfaction. Other U.S. firms are employing IT service providers in the U.S. to fix software produced abroad. Companies are also bringing back call center operations and legal support work to rural low-cost areas in the U.S. \"Reshoring\" has been credited for part of the manufacturing sector's employment rebound since the recession. Some companies are bringing back call center operations and legal support work to the United States, particularly in rural low-cost areas. \"Reshoring\" has contributed to the employment rebound in the manufacturing sector since the end of the recession, with about one-fifth of U.S. manufacturers bringing production back from overseas in 2011. This trend is attributed to China's decreasing manufacturing wage and cost advantages, long delivery times, rising shipping costs, quality control issues, and the separation of design and production personnel. Perry highlighted the trend of companies bringing back production and jobs to the United States due to various factors such as China's shrinking manufacturing wage and cost advantages, long delivery times, rising shipping costs, quality control issues, and intellectual property concerns. Several companies, including Caterpillar and Otis Elevator, have already reshored their operations. Despite potential factors that could have slowed down offshoring, offshore IT service providers were able to address U.S. firms' concerns effectively. Offshore providers of IT services were able to address U.S. firms' security concerns post-9/11, allowing for continued outsourcing of maintenance jobs by U.S. airline carriers to overseas locations. Concerns over unrest in certain regions have also been a periodic issue for U.S. outsourcers. Outsourcing of maintenance jobs overseas for international aircraft, including domestic routes, has led to concerns over unrest in some regions. Global providers of software services have responded by diversifying work locations, including near-shore markets like Canada and Mexico. Some U.S. employers prefer moving work to Canada due to fewer cultural differences with the United States compared to countries like India or the Philippines. Outsourcing of maintenance jobs overseas for international aircraft has led to concerns over unrest in some regions. Global providers of software services have responded by diversifying work locations, including Canada and Mexico. Some U.S. employers believe moving work to Canada reduces customers' potential antipathy to offshoring. Despite rising labor costs in some Asian nations like India, low wages in countries like Vietnam continue to draw U.S. jobs. Data on the number of U.S. workers losing jobs to offshore outsourcing is lacking. A comprehensive data series on the number of U.S. workers losing jobs to offshore outsourcing is lacking. Empirical analyses focus on jobs susceptible to movement abroad, potentially overstating actual job losses. Other factors influencing employers' decisions on work location are not considered."
