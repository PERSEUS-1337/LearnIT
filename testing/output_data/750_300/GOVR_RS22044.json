Prior to P.L. 105-17 in 1997, states had to ensure participation of children with disabilities in private schools. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires states to provide a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) to children with disabilities. Before P.L. 105-17 in 1997, states had to ensure the participation of children with disabilities in private schools. Regulations detailed that private school students should have equitable access to program benefits comparable to those provided to public school students. The vague \"equitable participation\" standard led to variations among states, localities, and courts. Prior to P.L. 105-17, the courts had differing views on whether children with disabilities in private schools should receive services comparable to those in public schools. Some courts gave local authorities discretion, resulting in fewer services for these children, while others aimed to equalize costs between public and private school children. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 rejected the \"equitable participation\" standard for providing services to children with disabilities in private schools, instead focusing on the number and location of enrolled children to determine program assistance under Part B. The IDEA Amendments of 1997 shifted from the \"equitable participation\" standard to focus on the number and location of children with disabilities enrolled in private schools for program assistance under Part B. Special education services were to be provided to these children in private schools, with funding proportional to federal funds available to the local educational agency. The 1997 IDEA Amendments changed the focus to providing special education services to children with disabilities in private schools, including parochial schools. The 2004 reauthorization further clarified the responsibilities of local educational agencies to ensure fair and equitable services for these children. The 2004 reauthorization clarified the responsibilities of local educational agencies to ensure fair and equitable services for children with disabilities in private schools. The changes reflect current policy and aim to resolve issues related to services for these children. The Committee made important changes to clarify the responsibilities of local educational agencies for children with disabilities in private schools. These changes aim to resolve contentious issues that have arisen in recent years. Children with disabilities can be placed in private schools by the LEA or SEA to fulfill the FAPE requirement, with the cost covered by the LEA. Parents can also unilaterally place their child in a private school, but the cost is not covered by the LEA unless certain conditions are met. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA made changes to provisions for children placed in private schools by their parents, with the cost covered by the LEA. IDEA requires some services for children in private schools, even if parents unilaterally place them there. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA made changes to provisions for children placed in private schools by their parents, with the cost covered by the LEA. Children with disabilities enrolled in private schools by their parents are entitled to special education services as per specific requirements. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA made changes to provisions for parentally placed children in private schools, with the LEA covering the cost. Specific requirements apply to children with disabilities enrolled in private schools by their parents, including the number and location of such children in the school district served by the LEA. The general provision was modified to require that children be located in the LEA's school district, aiming to protect LEAs from working with private schools in multiple jurisdictions. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA made changes to provisions for parentally placed children in private schools, with the LEA covering the cost. The intent was to protect LEAs from working with private schools in multiple jurisdictions, but this provision has sparked controversy due to issues like disproportional effects on LEAs with many private schools and potential conflicts with state laws. Five requirements exist for children parentally placed in private schools. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA introduced changes for parentally placed children in private schools, with concerns about funding disparities for LEAs with high concentrations of private schools and potential conflicts with state laws. Five requirements exist for these children, including equal funding for direct services. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added provisions for parentally placed children in private schools, emphasizing direct services over indirect services like professional development. A new provision regarding the calculation of the proportionate amount was also included, requiring thorough child find processes after consultation with private school representatives. The 2004 reauthorization of IDEA added provisions for parentally placed children in private schools, emphasizing direct services over indirect services like professional development. A new provision was added for calculating the proportionate amount, requiring thorough child find processes after consultation with private school representatives. The final regulations discuss and provide an example of the proportionate share calculation, maintaining the requirement that services may be provided on the premises of private, including religious schools. The new law under P.L. 108-446 added provisions for parentally placed children in private schools, including religious schools. It requires maintaining records of children evaluated, determined to have disabilities, and served under private school provisions. LEAs must supplement, not supplant, federal funds with state and local funds. The new law under P.L. 108-446 added provisions for parentally placed children in private schools, including religious schools. Each LEA must maintain records of children evaluated, determined to have disabilities, and served under private school provisions to ensure federal funds are serving their intended purpose. The requirement for finding children with disabilities remains the same as previous law. The new law under P.L. 108-446 added provisions for parentally placed children in private schools, including religious schools, to ensure equitable participation and accurate count of children with disabilities. Child find activities' cost cannot be used to meet the LEA's spending obligation. The new law under P.L. 108-446 added requirements for equitable participation and accurate count of parentally placed private school children with disabilities. Child find activities' cost cannot be used to meet the LEA's spending obligation, and consultation with private school officials and parents is mandated. P.L. 108-446 mandates LEA consultation with private school officials and parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities. This includes discussing child find processes, federal funding allocation, consultation procedures, and operational details. The consultation process between LEA, private school officials, and parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities includes discussing funding allocation, service provision, and decision-making processes. The consultation process between LEA, private school officials, and parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities includes discussing funding allocation, service provision, and decision-making processes. The new law requires a written affirmation of the consultation signed by the representatives of the LEA. The new law requires a written affirmation of the consultation signed by the representatives of the participating private schools. If the private school representatives do not sign within a reasonable period of time, the LEA shall forward the documentation to the SEA. Compliance procedures are also added by P.L. 108-446, allowing private school officials to submit complaints to the SEA alleging lack of meaningful and timely consultation by the LEA. Compliance procedures for private school officials to submit complaints to the SEA regarding lack of consultation by the LEA are outlined in P.L. 108-446. If dissatisfied with the SEA's determination, complaints can be escalated to the Secretary of Education. The 2004 reauthorization outlines procedures for private school officials to submit complaints to the Secretary of Education if dissatisfied with the SEA's determination regarding equitable services. Services must be provided by public agency employees or through contract, and must be secular, neutral, and nonideological. The new law requires that services for pupils attending private schools be controlled and administered by a public agency. If a child with a disability is unilaterally placed in a private school, the cost is not covered by the LEA unless certain findings are made by a hearing officer or court. The new law states that the cost of private school placement for children with disabilities is not covered by the LEA unless specific findings are made. Reimbursement may be reduced or denied if parents fail to give notice, but exceptions exist in cases where the school prevented notice, parents were unaware of the requirement, or compliance would harm the child. Reimbursement cannot be reduced or denied if parents were prevented from providing notice, were unaware of the requirement, or if compliance would harm the child. The new law also allows for exceptions if parents are illiterate, cannot write in English, or if compliance would result in serious emotional harm to the child. The provision in 108-446 allows reimbursement to not be reduced or denied if the parent is illiterate, unable to write in English, or if compliance with the notice requirement would cause serious emotional harm to the child. The issue of private school reimbursement for parents of a child with a disability who never received special education services from the school district is not addressed in the statute. In a recent Supreme Court case, the Court upheld an appeals court decision in a 4-4 split. In a recent Supreme Court case, the Court upheld an appeals court decision in a 4-4 split, allowing parents of a child with a disability to receive private school reimbursement even if the student never received special education services from the school district. The Court's decision does not set a precedent for lower courts, and the issue remains unsettled."
