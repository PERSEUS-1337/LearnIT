    "content": "The \"Cord Blood Education and Awareness Act of 2009\" includes sections on public education campaigns, patient informed consent, professional education, targeted education grants, and authorization of appropriations. The Act also contains findings related to cord blood education and awareness. Congress finds that leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma are responsible for a significant number of deaths in the United States, especially among children and young adults. Up to 16,000 leukemia patients annually require a bone marrow transplant but face challenges in finding a suitable match. Umbilical cord blood stem cells have been effectively used in treating various blood diseases, with over 14,000 transplants worldwide in the last 20 years. This offers hope for leukemia patients who cannot find a suitable bone marrow match, especially among children and young adults. Cord blood cells have been used in over 14,000 transplants worldwide in the last 20 years. They are a rich source of stem cells for allogeneic transplantation, especially for children, with lower rates of graft versus host disease compared to bone marrow. Cord blood cells have also been effective in treating nonmalignant blood, immune, and metabolic disorders. Cord blood cells have a lower rate of graft versus host disease than bone marrow and are easier to match based on HLA typing. They have been used to effectively treat nonmalignant blood, immune, and metabolic disorders such as aplastic anemia, sickle cell anemia, severe combined immunodeficiencies, and leukodystrophies. Researchers have found that cord blood cells contain various types of stem cells, including pluripotent cells that can differentiate into different tissues. Cord blood cells contain various types of stem cells, including pluripotent cells that can differentiate into every cell type in the human body. Clinical research is ongoing to study the use of cord blood cells in treating type 1 diabetes, brain injury, and cerebral palsy. Clinical research and experimental use of autologous cord blood cells are being studied for treating type 1 diabetes, brain injury, cerebral palsy, hearing loss, renal failure, spinal cord injury, and congenital heart valve defects. Over 90% of cord blood cells from more than 4,000,000 births in the US are discarded annually. Less than a quarter of states mandate information for expectant parents. In the United States, over 90% of cord blood cells from 4,000,000 births are discarded annually. Less than a quarter of states require expectant parents to receive information about banking cord blood. In 2005, the Institute of Medicine recommended clear information for donors regarding their options. In 2005, the Institute of Medicine recommended that donors be provided with clear information about their options for banking cord blood cells, including a balanced perspective on different options. Informed consent should be obtained before labor and delivery, after adequate disclosure of information. SEC. 3. PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must develop and publish a public information resource on umbilical cord blood within a year of this Act. It will explain the uses of cord blood for individuals related or unrelated to a mother or newborn, and the differences in using it. The curr_chunk discusses the use of umbilical cord blood, including cord blood cells and stem cells, for individuals related or unrelated to a mother or her newborn child. It explains the differences between using one's own cord blood cells (autologous) and using related or unrelated cord blood stem cells (allogeneic use) in disease treatment, as well as the distinctions between public and private umbilical cord blood banking. It also outlines the options available to a mother regarding the stem cells in the umbilical cord blood after delivery. The curr_chunk discusses options for umbilical cord blood banking, including donating to a public bank, storing in a private family bank, or using a family donor banking program for immediate or extended family members. The curr_chunk discusses options for umbilical cord blood banking, including donating to a public bank, storing in a private family bank, or using a family donor banking program for immediate or extended family members. It also mentions the medical processes involved in cord blood collection and criteria like medical or family history that can impact a family's decision on cord blood banking. The curr_chunk discusses medical processes for cord blood collection, criteria affecting family decisions on banking, ownership options, and costs of public and private banking. It also covers the availability of public and private cord blood banks. The curr_chunk provides information on the average cost, availability, and accreditation of public and private umbilical cord blood banking, including details on public and private cord blood banks in the United States, free family banking, and sibling donor programs for those with a medical need. It also discusses the racial and ethnic groups that may benefit from cord blood banking. The curr_chunk explains the availability of free family banking and sibling donor programs for those with a medical need. It also mentions the racial and ethnic groups in need of publicly donated cord blood samples. The curr_chunk discusses the patient informed consent document. The Secretary will develop a patient informed consent document on cord blood disposition, to be signed by expectant women before delivery. It will include information on cord blood banking options and the medical value of cord blood stem cells in disease treatment. The patient informed consent document will provide information on cord blood banking options (public donation, private banking, disposal) and the medical value of cord blood stem cells in disease treatment. A declaration will be signed by expectant women to choose the disposition of their child's cord blood stem cells. SEC. 5. Duty of certain professionals to disclose information to, and obtain informed consent from, pregnant patients. Effective 1 year after the enactment of this Act, healthcare professionals providing prenatal care must inform pregnant women about umbilical cord blood banking options before the third trimester or at the first visit. They should also aim to provide this information at least 2 weeks before the estimated due date. Healthcare professionals must inform pregnant women about umbilical cord blood banking options before the third trimester or at the first visit. They should aim to provide this information at least 2 weeks before the estimated due date and obtain written informed consent regarding the disposition of cord blood stem cells. The provider sought consent from the woman for cord blood banking options, but she refused. Medicaid regulations require healthcare professionals to inform pregnant women about cord blood banking before the third trimester and obtain written consent. The Medicaid regulations require healthcare professionals providing ambulatory prenatal care to pregnant women to comply with informing them about cord blood banking options and obtaining written consent before the third trimester. Physicians receiving funds for such care must enforce these requirements. The Medicaid regulations mandate healthcare providers offering prenatal care to pregnant women to inform them about cord blood banking options and obtain written consent before the third trimester. Non-compliance may result in payment reductions to the State. The Secretary may reduce payments to States under certain sections of the Act for non-compliance with informing pregnant women about cord blood banking options. This also applies to employer group health plans under ERISA. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include informing pregnant women about blood cord banking in employer group health plans. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include informing pregnant women about blood cord banking in employer group health plans. Group health plans must require healthcare professionals providing prenatal care to pregnant women to comply with blood cord banking information requirements. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 now includes provisions for informing pregnant women about blood cord banking in employer group health plans. Healthcare professionals providing prenatal care to pregnant women must comply with blood cord banking information requirements. The amendments made by this subsection apply to physicians and other health care professionals. The amendments made by this subsection apply to physicians and other health care professionals for agreements and arrangements entered into or renewed after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary will create educational materials on umbilical cord blood stem cells for healthcare providers offering prenatal services. Additionally, targeted education grants will be provided. The Secretary may grant targeted education on umbilical cord blood stem cells to health care providers, ethnic and racial minorities, families with genetic disease history, and populations affected by specific conditions. The Secretary may provide targeted education on umbilical cord blood stem cells to health care providers, ethnic and racial minorities, families with genetic disease history, and populations affected by specific conditions. This includes minorities for whom public cord blood samples may be difficult to find, families with a genetic history of diseases treated by cord blood, and populations affected by conditions currently or potentially treated with cord blood stem cells. Authorization of appropriations: $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2010 and $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2011 through 2014."
