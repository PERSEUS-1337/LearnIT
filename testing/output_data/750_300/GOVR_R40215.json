He proposed creating a special oversight board chaired by a Chief Performance Officer to review and address problems. The Obama Administration planned to establish an oversight board chaired by a Chief Performance Officer to review problems related to contracts and financial information. They also intended to create a website, Recovery.gov, to provide transparency on stimulus legislation. The Obama Administration established Recovery.gov to provide transparency on stimulus legislation and financial information about contracts. An oversight board was created to root out waste and inefficiency in government spending. Numerous oversight provisions were included in economic stimulus legislation. The House and Senate included oversight provisions in economic stimulus legislation to address waste and inefficiency in government spending. Concerns have been raised about agencies' capacity to spend funds rapidly while improving competition and oversight. Concerns have been raised about agencies' capacity and a depleted contracting workforce to spend stimulus funds rapidly while improving oversight. Questions have been raised about the resources of inspectors general and the Government Accountability Office for oversight. The House and Senate passed their versions of the stimulus bill in January and February 2009, with negotiations ongoing to reconcile differences. The House and Senate passed their versions of the stimulus bill in January and February 2009. As of February 12, negotiations were ongoing to reconcile differences in the two versions. Challenges in responding to a crisis include balancing speed with prudence and reconciling values of transparency, accountability, efficiency, effectiveness, and equity. Agencies and policymakers often have little time for planning or reflection in such circumstances. In formulating a response to a crisis, it is important to reconcile values of transparency, accountability, efficiency, effectiveness, and equity. Agencies and policymakers often have limited time for planning or reflection in such situations. Long-term issues include building the capacity of federal agencies, Congress, and the President to better respond to crises and how to anticipate and prevent avoidable crises. The 9-11 Commission emphasized the importance of \"institutionalizing imagination\" to address such challenges. The 9-11 Commission emphasized the importance of \"institutionalizing imagination\" to address challenges in anticipating and avoiding preventable crises. The federal government is seen as a system of \"nested\" oversight, with multiple entities engaging in simultaneous oversight activities. Congress oversees the President and agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Inspectors general and congressional support agencies play a role in oversight as well. Within the federal government, multiple entities engage in oversight activities. Congress oversees the President, agencies, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Inspectors general and agencies like the Government Accountability Office (GAO) assist in oversight. OMB is responsible for managing and overseeing various agencies, while agencies also monitor their own activities as mandated by Congress. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) plays a key role in overseeing agencies' activities, ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, and preventing fraud. Tools such as monitoring, analysis, and evaluation are used to develop an oversight framework. In developing an oversight framework, various perspectives on objectives include compliance with laws, adherence to congressional intent, avoidance of mismanagement, fair allocation of resources, and effectiveness of funded activities. The oversight framework aims to ensure compliance with laws, congressional intent, and effective allocation of resources for funded activities. Implementation by agencies, nonfederal recipients, OMB, oversight board, and IGs will determine how oversight provisions are approached.

Selected general oversight provisions in the House- and Senate-passed versions of economic stimulus legislation are analyzed in Table 1. References to \"the Act\" within each bill generally refer to either Division A or Division B of the bill, not to the entire bill."
