The Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2013 is aimed at addressing musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare workers, particularly nurses and nursing assistants. Patient lifting, transferring, and repositioning injuries are identified as the leading cause of these injuries, posing a significant risk to the employees' health and welfare. The physical demands of the nursing profession, particularly patient lifting, transferring, and repositioning, lead to a high rate of injuries among healthcare workers. Many nurses suffer from chronic back pain, with a significant percentage requiring leave from work, resulting in a material impairment of their health. Patients are safer when lifted using mechanical lift programs, reducing injuries like skin tears and pressure ulcers. This also decreases the risk of patients being dropped during care. Assistive patient handling is crucial for patient safety. The development of assistive patient handling technology has reduced injuries among nursing staff and patients, making manual patient handling outdated in many healthcare facilities. Patient handling technology and practices have led to a significant decrease in injuries among nursing staff and healthcare workers. This has resulted in reduced lost work days, staff turnover, and workers' compensation costs for musculoskeletal disorders. Several states have also implemented safe patient handling measures. Studies have shown that assistive patient handling technology reduces workers' compensation costs for musculoskeletal disorders. Some States have implemented safe patient handling standards, demonstrating the feasibility of such programs. Establishing safe patient handling standards for healthcare workers is critical for protecting their health and safety. Establishing safe patient handling standards for healthcare workers, including direct-care registered nurses, is crucial for protecting their health and safety, addressing the nursing shortage, and improving patient safety. The table of contents for this Act is provided. The Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard is established to protect healthcare workers, including registered nurses, and improve patient safety in facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The Secretary of Labor must promulgate an interim final standard on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention within 1 year of the enactment of the Act to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for healthcare workers. The safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard must be finalized within 2 years of the Act's enactment. It will require the use of engineering controls to prevent injuries from manual patient handling by healthcare workers. The prevention standard mandates the use of engineering controls and mechanical technology to reduce injuries from manual patient handling by healthcare workers. If mechanical technology is not feasible, alternative controls like trained lift teams must be utilized to minimize injury risks. The standard requires healthcare employers to implement safe patient handling programs, including trained lift teams, to reduce injury risks for nurses and healthcare workers. The standard mandates healthcare employers to develop safe patient handling programs within 6 months, including hazard identification and control measures. Additionally, employers must purchase technology and equipment within 2 years. The final standard requires healthcare employers to purchase and provide safe patient handling equipment and technology within 2 years. Input from healthcare workers, including direct care registered nurses, is also mandated. Health care employers must involve health care workers in developing and implementing safe patient handling programs, including purchasing technology and equipment. Employers are also required to establish a data tracking and review program. Health care employers must involve health care workers in developing and implementing safe patient handling programs, including purchasing technology and equipment. They are also required to establish a data tracking and review program to analyze relevant data and ensure compliance with safe patient handling standards. Health care employers must involve health care workers in developing safe patient handling programs and consider incorporating technology. They should also establish a data tracking program to ensure compliance with safe patient handling standards. Health care employers are required to consider incorporating safe patient handling technology into facility design and construction. They must also provide education and training to health care workers on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, technology, equipment, and devices on an annual basis. Health care employers must train workers on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies annually. Training should cover identifying and controlling musculoskeletal hazards and be conducted by knowledgeable individuals using interactive simulated training. The health care employer must provide annual training on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies. Training should be interactive and hands-on, conducted by knowledgeable individuals. Additionally, a uniform notice explaining these standards must be posted in the workplace. The health care employer must post a uniform notice explaining safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards, policies, training, reporting procedures for injuries, and workers' rights under this Act. The health care employer must conduct an annual evaluation of the safe patient handling program, including procedures, technology, equipment, injury assessment, and new technology. The health care employer must conduct an annual evaluation of the safe patient handling program, including procedures, technology, equipment, injury assessment, and new technology. This evaluation should involve nurses, other healthcare workers, and their representatives, with documented input. Employers are required to take corrective action based on the evaluation. Additionally, there is a right to refuse unsafe assignments. The health care employer must conduct an annual evaluation of the safe patient handling program, involving nurses and other healthcare workers. Corrective action should be taken based on the evaluation. Employees have the right to refuse unsafe assignments to prevent injury. The health care worker must communicate safety concerns to the employer and if violations persist, the Secretary of Labor will conduct unscheduled inspections to ensure compliance with safety standards. The Secretary of Labor will conduct unscheduled inspections to ensure compliance with safe patient handling standards. SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF SAFE PATIENT HANDLING, MOBILITY, AND INJURY PREVENTION STANDARD TO FACILITIES RECEIVING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID FUNDS. The Social Security Act is amended to include safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards in facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The Social Security Act is amended to include safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards in Medicare and Medicaid funded facilities. The amendments specify the effective date for these standards to be implemented in health care facilities. SEC. 4. NONPREEMPTION. Effect on Other Laws: This Act does not preempt state laws unless they conflict with this Act. It also does not diminish states' authority to enact laws providing equal or greater protections for employees. Rights of health care workers are retained under this Act. The Act does not diminish the rights of health care workers under any Federal or State law or collective bargaining agreement. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"direct-care registered nurse,\" \"employee,\" and \"employment.\" The Act defines terms related to employment in the healthcare sector, including the provision of services and actions involving the physical movement or support of patients by healthcare workers. The term \"health care employer\" refers to various healthcare facilities that employ direct-care registered nurses or other healthcare workers for actions involving patient care that pose a risk of musculoskeletal injury. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"health care worker\" and \"lift team\" in healthcare facilities employing direct-care registered nurses or other healthcare workers. The curr_chunk defines \"lift team\" as healthcare workers trained in safe patient handling and injury prevention practices."
