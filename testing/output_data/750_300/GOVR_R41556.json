    "content": "The Middle East poses challenges to U.S. foreign policy due to relationships with key Arab and non-Arab states like Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Turkey. Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas are aligned against U.S. interests, with the latter two designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the U.S. State Department. Iran is believed to be pursuing nuclear weapons capability. Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas pose challenges to U.S. interests as designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations. Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons could have serious global consequences, potentially leading to preemptive strikes by Israel. Iran's strong ties to Syria complicate U.S. efforts for Israeli-Arab peace. Iran's strong ties to Syria complicate U.S. efforts for Israeli-Arab peace and trigger wider war concerns. Despite some improvement in the U.S. image in the Middle East under the Obama Administration, dissatisfaction with U.S. policy in the region persists. Muslim world outreach and attempts to close Guantanamo have not diminished the influence of actors like Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, and Hamas aligned against U.S. interests. The Obama Administration's attempts to improve U.S. relations in the Middle East have not reduced the influence of state and non-state actors aligned against U.S. interests. Regional actors like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey are taking more responsibility for resolving disputes, diminishing U.S. diplomacy in the region. The Middle East continues to face challenges from global financial effects. The Middle East faces challenges from global financial effects and domestic socioeconomic issues like poverty, income inequality, and high unemployment. Lack of respect for human rights and democracy are criticized by citizens and international observers. The United States advocates for economic and political reform in the region. The Middle East faces challenges from global financial effects and domestic socioeconomic issues like poverty, income inequality, and high unemployment. Lack of respect for human rights and democracy are criticized by citizens, advocacy groups, and international observers. The United States advocates for economic and political reform in the region, addressing issues such as water resource scarcity. Congressional considerations include responses to Palestinian divisions, Hamas' control of the Gaza Strip, Israeli settlements, and budget constraints on supporting regional initiatives. The 112th Congress faces challenges in responding to Palestinian divisions, Hamas' control of Gaza, Israeli settlements, and obstacles to the peace process. They must also address budget constraints while supporting regional initiatives and dealing with radical regimes like Iran and Syria. Congress may need to employ new tools to change their behavior and reinforce existing policy tools. The United States remains vulnerable to threats at home and abroad. The 112th Congress may face challenges in the Middle East including Palestinian divisions, Hamas control of Gaza, Israeli settlements, and peace process obstacles. They must address budget constraints, support regional initiatives, and deal with radical regimes like Iran and Syria. Congress may need new tools to change behavior and reinforce existing policies. The United States remains vulnerable to terrorist threats from Al Qaeda-inspired groups. The 112th Congress may face challenges in the Middle East including Palestinian divisions, Hamas control of Gaza, Israeli settlements, and peace process obstacles. They must address budget constraints, support regional initiatives, and deal with radical regimes like Iran and Syria. Congress may need new tools to change behavior and reinforce existing policies. The 112th Congress may also need to consider adopting stricter economic sanctions against Iran to address its nuclear development. The 112th Congress may need to consider adopting stricter economic sanctions against Iran to address its nuclear development. There is a growing international consensus to impose sanctions targeting Iran's energy sector to compel compromise on its nuclear program. The 112th Congress may need to consider adopting stricter economic sanctions against Iran to address its nuclear development. Efforts to curb international investment in Iran's energy sector began in 1996 with the Iran Sanctions Act, targeting Iran's energy sector to isolate it from the international financial system. The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (CISADA) expanded the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) to restrict Iran's gasoline imports and impose penalties on foreign companies doing business with Iran's energy sector. CISADA also includes measures to limit access to the U.S. market for banks conducting transactions with sanctioned Iranian entities. The Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (CISADA) aims to restrict Iran's gasoline imports and impose penalties on foreign companies dealing with Iran's energy sector. It also limits access to the U.S. market for banks conducting transactions with sanctioned Iranian entities. Additionally, CISADA follows the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929, which bans heavy weapons sales to Iran and sanctions Iranian entities linked to its Revolutionary Guard. The June 9, 2010 adoption of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 imposes a ban on heavy weapons sales to Iran and sanctions Iranian entities linked to its Revolutionary Guard. European Union sanctions, enacted on July 27, 2010, prohibit EU involvement in Iran's energy sector and restrict trade financing and banking relationships with Iran. Japan and South Korea also announced similar restrictions on Iranian energy trade in early September 2010. Sanctions imposed by major economic powers like the EU, Japan, and South Korea are having a growing effect on Iran's economy, leading to international firms exiting the Iranian market. However, there is no consensus on whether these sanctions are causing a shift in Iran's commitment to its nuclear program. Empirical data is scarce regarding the impact of sanctions on Iran's nuclear program. Major international firms have announced their exit from the Iranian market in 2010. There is uncertainty about whether sanctions are influencing Iran's nuclear program commitment. The 112th Congress may consider additional Iran sanctions legislation and support for Iran's domestic opposition. The United States and Israel have maintained strong bilateral relations based on various factors, including domestic U.S. support for Israel and shared strategic interests. The United States and Israel have strong bilateral relations based on factors like domestic U.S. support for Israel, shared strategic goals in the Middle East, democratic values, and historic ties dating back to 1948. U.S. foreign aid plays a significant role in strengthening these ties, despite occasional disagreements over issues like Israeli settlements and arms sales. The United States and Israel have strong bilateral relations, with U.S. foreign aid playing a significant role in cementing these ties. Despite occasional disagreements over issues like Israeli settlements and arms sales, successive Administrations and many lawmakers view Israel as a reliable partner in the region. Critics argue that U.S. aid exacerbates tensions in the Middle East, with some Arab commentators suggesting that it indirectly causes suffering to Palestinians. Congress has taken measures to strengthen Israel's position. Some in the Middle East argue that U.S. foreign aid worsens tensions in the region, especially by supporting Israeli arms purchases. Congress and successive administrations have consistently affirmed their commitment to strengthening Israel's military edge. Assistant Secretary of State Andrew J. Shapiro reiterated the Obama Administration's dedication to preserving Israel's security in 2010. The Obama Administration reaffirmed its commitment to preserving Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME) in 2010. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. aid to Israel to maintain its QME, with a request of $3 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for FY2011. Defense appropriations for missile defense systems co-research and development with Israel could also be a key issue. The Obama Administration requested $3 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for Israel in FY2011 to preserve its Qualitative Military Edge (QME). Congress appropriated over $202 million for U.S.-Israeli missile defense in FY2010, with additional support of $205 million for the purchase of Iron Dome short-range missile defense batteries. In March 2010, the Obama Administration announced $205 million in defense assistance for Israel to purchase Iron Dome short-range missile defense batteries. Congressional aid appropriations have historically supported peace treaties and the peace process in the region. President Obama declared Israeli-Palestinian peace a U.S. national security interest due to its impact on relations in the Middle East. His call for a halt to Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank was met with resistance from PLO Chairman Mahmud Abbas. The lack of peace has affected U.S. relations with countries in the Middle East and provided extremists with a cause. President Obama's call for a halt to Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank led to short-lived proximity talks between the parties. Settlements remain an obstacle to peace talks as Israel continues with settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The Administration's efforts to halt Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank were short-lived, with settlements remaining a key obstacle to peace talks. Despite offering incentives for a three-month freeze, Israel continued with settlement activity in both the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The US offered incentives to Israel for a settlement freeze but abandoned the effort in December. Final status issues in negotiations include borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees, and water. Congress remains interested in the peace process due to its oversight role in foreign policy and support for Israel. Several resolutions were introduced in the 111th Congress regarding the Arab-Israeli peace process. In the 111th Congress, resolutions were introduced regarding Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and relocating the U.S. embassy there. Congress emphasizes its commitment to an undivided Jerusalem as Israel's capital, while the Obama Administration maintains that Jerusalem is a final status issue for the parties. In the 112th Congress, legislation restricts U.S. official conduct with the Palestinian Authority in Jerusalem, emphasizing Congress's commitment to an undivided Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Appropriations legislation also required a new Palestinian state to act peacefully and counter terrorism. Congress passed resolutions supporting Israel's right to self-defense against rocket attacks from Gaza and a flotilla attempting to break Israel's blockade. In the 112th Congress, legislation may revisit moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, conditions for a new Palestinian state, and reactions to possible violent confrontations between Israeli forces and Palestinian groups. If an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord is achieved, the Administration may call on Congress to provide additional assistance to Israel. The Administration may request additional aid from Congress for Israel and Palestinians in the event of an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord. U.S. aid to Palestinians supports U.S. policy priorities of combating terrorism, promoting stability, and fostering peaceful coexistence with Israel. U.S. aid policy towards Palestinians during the 111th Congress focuses on combating terrorism, promoting stability, and fostering peaceful coexistence with Israel. The policy aims to address humanitarian needs in the Gaza Strip and prevent destabilization. The U.S. aid policy towards Palestinians during the 111th Congress continues the policy established in 2007 after the split between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza. Annual U.S. bilateral assistance to the region has averaged over $600 million, with spikes in funding following conflicts. Annual U.S. bilateral assistance to the West Bank and Gaza Strip has averaged over $600 million annually, including direct budgetary assistance and non-lethal security assistance for the PA. Additional humanitarian assistance for Palestinian refugees has averaged over $200 million annually since 2007. Congressional concerns include the potential diversion of funds to Palestinian terrorist groups. U.S. assistance to Palestinians, provided mostly through UNRWA, has averaged over $200 million annually since 2007. Aid is subject to vetting and oversight due to concerns about funds being diverted to terrorist groups. Policymakers urge Arab states to increase their contributions. The US provides assistance to Palestinians through UNRWA, with an average of over $200 million annually since 2007. Policymakers call for increased contributions from Arab states. The Administration proposed sales of military equipment to Saudi Arabia worth over $60 billion, including fighter aircraft and related services. The proposed sales to Saudi Arabia include upgrades of existing fighter aircraft and new weaponry worth over $60 billion. This includes 84 new F-15SA fighter aircraft, upgrades to 70 F-15S fighter aircraft, 70 new AH-64D Block III APACHE helicopters, and various other helicopters. The Obama Administration aims to maintain long-term relationships and U.S. influence through these sales, raising policy questions for Congress about their rationale and impact on regional security. The proposed sales to Saudi Arabia aim to strengthen their position against Iran and maintain long-term relationships to ensure continued U.S. influence. This raises policy questions for Congress regarding the rationale for the sales and their impact on regional security and Israel's security. The Obama Administration has praised U.S.-Saudi counterterrorism cooperation with regard to Al Qaeda. The Obama Administration has praised improvements in U.S.-Saudi counterterrorism cooperation with regard to Al Qaeda, while U.S. concerns about human rights in Saudi Arabia and the export of religious extremism persist. Saudi leaders share U.S. concerns about Iranian policies and regional ambitions but remain wary of embracing Iraq's elected government and engaging Israel beyond a standing Saudi peace proposal. The export of religious extremism persists in Saudi Arabia, with no clear solutions in sight. Saudi leaders share U.S. concerns about Iranian policies and regional ambitions but are cautious about engaging with Iraq's government and Israel beyond the Arab Peace Initiative. In the 111th Congress, committees reviewed proposed arms sales after congressional briefings from Administration officials. 198 members of Congress raised concerns and strategic questions about the proposed sales in a letter to the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration responded to concerns raised by 198 members of Congress regarding proposed arms sales to Saudi Arabia in November 2010. They emphasized the importance of strengthening the U.S. military partnership with Saudi Arabia while maintaining Israel's qualitative military edge. The U.S. government aims to enhance its military partnership with Saudi Arabia while ensuring Israel's military superiority in the region. Proposed sales of F-35 fighter aircraft to Israel would help maintain its advanced fighter capabilities. Legislation introduced in December 2010 sought to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia, prompting potential oversight by Congress on military training and cooperation with the country. The United States has been involved in training and arming the Saudi Arabian military since the 1940s. Congress may seek additional oversight on military training, arms sales, and counterterrorism cooperation with Saudi Arabia. New programs for Saudi interior security forces and critical infrastructure security are also being implemented. The US has been training and arming the Saudi military since the 1940s. Congress has oversight on arms sales and can block or modify them. New programs for Saudi security forces are being implemented. In the 112th Congress, Congress may seek to alter or provide enhanced oversight of U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia due to policy concerns. This action would not enjoy expedited procedural privileges outlined in the Arms Export Control Act. The threat of Yemen-based terrorists attacking the U.S. homeland is a growing concern. In the 112th Congress, there may be a focus on U.S. counterterrorism policy in Yemen due to the threat of Yemen-based terrorists attacking the U.S. homeland. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has attempted attacks, including the failed bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in 2009 and the attempted destruction of air cargo flights in 2010. American citizen Anwar al Awlaki, a radical ideologue of AQAP, has also tried to indoctrinate and motivate U.S. citizens. American citizen Anwar al Awlaki, a radical ideologue of AQAP, has attempted to indoctrinate U.S. citizens and motivate them to carry out terrorist bombings on U.S. soil. He has been linked to radicalizing individuals involved in various attacks, including the Fort Hood mass shooting, the failed Christmas Day bombing of Flight 253, and the Times Square car bombing attempt. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen to address terrorism threats. Options include using drones and placing military units under CIA control. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen to address terrorism threats. Reports suggest the CIA may use drones or place military units under its control. Limited U.S. military presence in Yemen may require time to employ assets effectively against Al Qaeda-affiliated groups. Congress may assess the balance between short-term counterterrorism needs and long-term strategies. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen to address terrorism threats. Congress may assess the Administration's ability to balance short-term counterterrorism needs with long-term stabilization goals in Yemen. Lawmakers may demand more U.S. military involvement in Yemen if AQAP poses a threat to the United States. Some members may push for Yemen to cooperate with the U.S. in apprehending wanted AQAP operatives. The 112th Congress may consider new appropriations for Yemen, as the U.S. provided $290 million in FY2010. The United States may increase aid to Yemen, with the Defense Department proposing $1.2 billion in security assistance over a five- or six-year period. Yemeni forces have launched campaigns against terrorist threats, and Congress may consider new appropriations for Yemen. The Defense Department proposes $1.2 billion in security assistance to Yemen over five or six years. Yemeni forces have conducted campaigns against terrorist threats, raising questions about long-term U.S.-Yemeni security cooperation and disagreements over Yemen's policy of releasing alleged terrorists. Disagreements arise over Yemen's policy of releasing alleged terrorists to placate tribal leaders and domestic Islamist politicians who oppose U.S. interference. Iraq's political system shows peaceful competition and attempts at cross-sectarian alliances, but ethnic and factional infighting persists with questionable use of power and legal institutions. Holding key political offices is seen as a matter of life and death. Iraq's political system faces ongoing ethnic and factional infighting, delaying the agreement on leadership after the 2010 national elections. With U.S. intervention, major factions reached a breakthrough on government positions in November 2010, leading to the implementation of the agreement. Since November 2010, Iraq's Council of Representatives reached a breakthrough with U.S. intervention, forming a new government. Concerns arise over U.S. influence waning, dominance of Iran-aligned parties, and potential conflicts between Kurdistan Regional Government and nationalist Arabs. Some experts question whether stability will continue in Iraq after the U.S. forces depart at the end of 2011, as violence persists and uncertainty prevails despite the drawdown of U.S. forces. The drawdown of U.S. forces to below 50,000 personnel and a formal end of the U.S. combat mission in Iraq has raised concerns about stability post-2011. Some experts fear that without U.S. troops, Iraq could become a \"failed state\" due to widening rifts among ethnic and sectarian communities. U.S. officials doubt Iraqi Security Forces will meet benchmarks by the end of 2011, but the formation of the government may pave the way for a long-term strategic partnership. The formation of the government in Iraq will allow U.S. officials to address their goals of securing a long-term strategic partnership and defining terms of security cooperation. However, opposition from some Iraqi parties and their inclusion in key positions may complicate efforts to secure lasting cooperation. The U.S. government is transitioning from military to civilian leadership in Iraq, with the State Department overseeing these initiatives. The U.S. government is transitioning from military to civilian leadership in Iraq, with the State Department overseeing a large expansion in civilian personnel and associated security needs. U.S. economic assistance to Iraq has declined significantly since the 2003-2007 period, when funding was obligated for reconstruction and security efforts. During the 2003-2007 period, significant funding was allocated for reconstructing war-damaged infrastructure, winning hearts and minds in Iraq, and building security forces. U.S. Economic Support Fund (ESF) assistance reached $382.5 million in FY2010. The Administration's FY2011 request aimed to maintain economic aid at that level and continue supporting Iraq's security forces, despite Senate appropriators recommending cuts. Funding for Iraq in FY2011 is provided under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011. Future economic and security assistance for Iraq may face resistance in the 112th Congress due to concerns about Iraq's ability to invest in its own reconstruction and security forces. Iraq's oil revenues are expected to increase, but its domestic investment needs remain a priority. Security assistance for Iraq in the 112th Congress may encounter opposition due to concerns about Iraq's capacity to invest in its reconstruction and security forces. Despite expected growth in oil revenues, Iraq still faces significant financial challenges. The transition to a civilian-led presence in Iraq presents new opportunities for congressional oversight, including reviewing appropriations, authorization requests, and arms sales for U.S.-Iraqi security cooperation. Additionally, Turkey, a long-term U.S. NATO ally, is involved in bilateral relations. The opening of new avenues for oversight in Iraq by Congress may involve considering appropriations, authorization requests, and arms sales for U.S.-Iraqi security cooperation. Turkey, a U.S. NATO ally, has complex bilateral relations that have drawn congressional attention, particularly regarding issues of interest to diaspora communities such as Greek-Americans and Armenian Americans. These communities demand changes in Turkey's policies on various issues including the Greek Orthodox Church, religious freedom, Cyprus, and the Armenian national \"genocide\" of 1915-1917. Issues of interest to diaspora communities, including Greek-Americans and Armenian Americans, involve demands for Turkey to change its policies on the Greek Orthodox Church, religious freedom, Cyprus, and the Armenian national \"genocide\" of 1915-1917. Congressional concern heightened after Turkey's actions against U.N. Security Council sanctions on Iran and a violent confrontation with Israeli commandos. In response to heightened concerns, legislation in the 111th Congress urged Turkey to respect the property and religious rights of the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul. The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved H.Res. 252, calling on the Administration to affirm U.S. support for these rights. The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved H.Res. 252 to recognize the international status of the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul and affirm the U.S. historical record on the Armenian genocide. The House also passed H.Res. 1631 to protect Greek Orthodox religious sites in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus. In the 112th Congress, issues concerning the rights of the Greek Orthodox Church in Turkey may resurface. In the 112th Congress, issues regarding the protection of Greek Orthodox religious sites in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus and the rights of the Greek Orthodox Church in Turkey may arise. Ankara may seek US funding for missiles and radar as part of a new missile defense architecture adopted at the NATO summit in 2010. In the 112th Congress, Ankara may request US funding for missiles and radar in Turkey as part of a new missile defense system. Congressional oversight hearings may be prompted by possible political changes in Turkey following the 2011 national election. U.S. policy towards Syria may also be of interest to lawmakers in the 112th Congress. Francis J. Ricciardone's nomination in the 112th Congress was not voted on in the 111th Congress due to a hold by a member. U.S. policy towards Syria, particularly in relation to peeling Syria away from Iran, may be a focus for lawmakers in the 112th Congress. The Obama Administration, upon taking office in 2009, showed a willingness to engage in diplomatic dialogue with the Syrian government to secure cooperation on various regional issues. The Obama Administration showed a willingness to engage Syria diplomatically in hopes of securing cooperation on regional issues, but U.S. sanctions against Syria have remained in force. Critics argue that the change in tone towards Syria was superficial. Now, after two years of diplomatic attempts, the administration appears to be shifting tactics. The Obama Administration's diplomatic engagement with Syria has not led to significant changes, with critics calling the shift in tone superficial. Recently, there has been a shift towards pressuring Syria to play a more constructive role in Lebanon and the Arab-Israeli peace process, coinciding with renewed international concern about Lebanon due to Hezbollah's threats. The Obama Administration's shift towards pressuring Syria to play a more constructive role in Lebanon and the Arab-Israeli peace process has coincided with renewed international concern about Lebanon. Hezbollah's threats to destabilize the country if indictments are issued by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon for the murder of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri have raised tensions. Congress may consider imposing new sanctions against the Asad regime, while some lawmakers advocate for continued U.S. engagement with Syria. During the 111th Congress, lawmakers introduced the Syria Accountability and Liberation Act, proposing sanctions on countries aiding Syria's access to weapons of mass destruction and those investing in Syria's energy sector. Congress may impose new sanctions on the Asad regime amidst tensions in U.S.-Syrian relations. Additionally, funding for democracy and governance programs for opposition members and human rights activists may be considered. The appointment of Robert S. Ford as Ambassador-Designate to Syria remains on hold, with no Senate confirmation vote scheduled. Supporters argue that sending an ambassador to Syria is crucial for U.S. interests, while opponents see it as a concession. Supporters argue that sending an ambassador to Syria is crucial for U.S. interests, as there has been no U.S. Ambassador in Damascus since 2005. Opponents view it as a concession to a rogue Syrian regime. U.S. policy towards Lebanon aims to support the unity government led by Prime Minister Saad Hariri, counter Iranian and Syrian influence, and contain Hezbollah. The U.S. has provided economic and military assistance to strengthen state institutions, especially in the security sector. The United States aims to limit Iranian and Syrian influence in Lebanon and support the government led by Prime Minister Hariri. Economic and military assistance has been provided to strengthen state institutions, with a focus on the security sector. The U.S. also contributes $10 million annually to the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. Challenges include increased sectarian tension due to pending STL indictments and Hezbollah's efforts to discredit the tribunal. Prime Minister Hariri's government is facing challenges due to pending STL indictments, leading to increased sectarian tension as Hezbollah tries to discredit the tribunal. Hezbollah's leader has rejected any potential indictment, calling it a U.S. and Israeli attack on the \"resistance.\" Recent statements by Hariri, retracting earlier claims about Syria's involvement in an assassination, have raised questions about U.S. support for him and the STL. The Hariri government's legitimacy is partly tied to the success of the STL. Recent statements by Hariri retracting earlier claims about Syria's involvement in an assassination have raised questions about U.S. support for him and the STL. The Hariri government's legitimacy depends on the STL's success, but Hezbollah and the opposition could challenge his power if the STL proceeds with indictments. Changes in the Lebanese government could impact U.S. policy and assistance to Lebanon, especially if Hezbollah gains a larger role. Members of the 112th Congress may need to consider the Obama Administration's request for $246 million in FY2011 foreign assistance. The 112th Congress may need to consider the Obama Administration's request for $246 million in FY2011 foreign assistance to Lebanon, which aims to increase the central authority of the Lebanese state and deter non-state actors. The recent incident where the Lebanese Armed Forces fired on an Israeli unit could impact U.S. policy and assistance, especially if Hezbollah's role expands. The Lebanese Armed Forces fired on an Israeli unit along the Blue Line, resulting in casualties. Some members of Congress halted a $100 million FMF appropriation for Lebanon to investigate the use of U.S. equipment. The hold was lifted after consultations, but raised concerns about future U.S. assistance to Lebanon. The Lebanese Armed Forces used U.S. equipment against Israel, leading to a temporary hold on $100 million in aid. The incident raised concerns about future U.S. assistance to Lebanon. The 112th Congress may support a more democratic government in Egypt amidst a possible leadership transition. Egypt remains a key partner of the United States in the region. Egypt is the Arab world's largest country and a key partner of the United States in regional affairs. Its domestic politics are closely watched by U.S. policymakers, with some hoping for political liberalization to spread across the Middle East. Others believe a stable, autocratic Egypt at peace with Israel is in the U.S. interest. In November and December 2010 parliamentary elections in Egypt, the ruling National Democratic Party won over 90% of all seats, with just one Muslim Brotherhood independent winning a seat. Some believe that political liberalization in Egypt could spread across the Middle East, while others argue for a stable, autocratic Egypt at peace with Israel in the U.S. interest. In the December 2010 parliamentary elections in Egypt, the ruling National Democratic Party won over 90% of all seats, with just one Muslim Brotherhood independent winning a seat. The State Department expressed concern over reports of disruptions to opposition candidates' campaign activities, arrests of their supporters, and denial of media access to some opposition voices. The recent elections in Egypt raised concerns due to reports of disruptions to opposition candidates' campaigns, arrests of their supporters, denial of media access to opposition voices, election-day interference, and intimidation by security forces. These irregularities question the fairness and transparency of the process. Congress has provided Egypt with significant military and economic aid in recent years, and funding for democracy promotion could be used as a tool to address these issues. Congress has provided Egypt with an estimated $1.5 billion in military and economic aid over the last few fiscal years. Funding for democracy promotion in Egypt has been controversial, with the Egyptian government opposing foreign support to independent NGOs working on political reform and government accountability. During the Bush Administration, some Economic Support Funds were directed towards these efforts. During the Bush Administration, Economic Support Funds were directed towards USAID programming in democracy and governance (D&G) sector and direct support to Egyptian NGOs. In FY2005, Congress directed that \"democracy and governance activities shall not be subject to the prior approval of the government of Egypt.\" U.S. democracy assistance has decreased as overall economic aid to Egypt has decreased. The Obama Administration has directed that democracy and governance activities in Egypt should not require prior approval from the government. Economic aid for democracy promotion has decreased, with $25 million provided in FY2010. Some believe this shift is to ease tensions with the Egyptian government, while others argue that U.S. funding has been ineffective and should focus on areas with a more immediate impact on Egyptians' daily lives. Some critics suggest that U.S. aid to Egypt should be tied to improvements in human rights and religious freedom. The U.S. government's global war on Al Qaeda since 9/11 has weakened the organization's ability to attack the U.S. The U.S. government's global war on Al Qaeda since 9/11 has considerably weakened the organization's ability to attack the United States. However, Al Qaeda's survival, regional affiliates' strength, and appeal among some Muslims overseas and in the U.S. remain challenging. Al Qaeda operatives are determined to attack the U.S. and exploit vulnerabilities, reactions, and policy mistakes. Recent events indicate increased sophistication among Al Qaeda supporters. Recent events suggest that Al Qaeda operatives are determined to attack the United States and exploit vulnerabilities, reactions, and policy mistakes. Al Qaeda supporters are conducting more sophisticated ideological outreach via the Internet, promoting independent, low-cost operations by individuals with limited linkages to established terrorist networks. These trends may complicate U.S. and allied counterterrorism efforts by amplifying the spread of Al Qaeda's ideology and making terrorism threats more diffuse, less predictable, and less vulnerable to disruption. In the Middle East, a series of overlapping dilemmas now confront U.S. policymakers. Recent events suggest that Al Qaeda operatives are determined to attack the United States and exploit vulnerabilities. Al Qaeda supporters are using the Internet for ideological outreach, promoting low-cost operations by individuals with limited links to terrorist networks. These trends complicate U.S. and allied counterterrorism efforts, making threats more diffuse and less predictable. In the Middle East, U.S. policymakers face dilemmas in pursuing counterterrorism goals alongside other strategic priorities. The ongoing presence of U.S. military forces in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia is a subject of Al Qaeda rhetoric despite the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq. Limited operations against Al Qaeda figures and counterterrorism assistance programs have faced criticism for sovereignty violations. The U.S. government's actions in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia have faced criticism for sovereignty violations and support for undemocratic regimes, despite efforts to promote democratic reform in countries like Egypt, Jordan, and the West Bank and Gaza. Public opinion polls show that Muslims in many countries remain skeptical of U.S. outreach efforts. The U.S. government's outreach to Muslims in the West Bank and Gaza has faced criticism for potentially empowering Islamist parties. Despite increased U.S. efforts, public opinion polls show skepticism towards U.S. intentions and policies among Muslims in many countries. Suggestions vary on how to address Al Qaeda, with some advocating for direct action and others proposing a containment strategy. Some suggest the U.S. should confront religious extremism and destroy Al Qaeda operatives, despite acknowledging potential costs. Others argue for a containment strategy, believing direct intervention may have more negative consequences than benefits. Another viewpoint is that a lasting victory over extremists can only be achieved if Muslims reject extremism in their own communities. Additionally, there is a call for a positive U.S. agenda in the Middle East beyond security and counterterrorism concerns. Some argue for confronting religious extremism and destroying Al Qaeda operatives, while others advocate for a containment strategy. A lasting victory over extremists may be achieved by Muslims rejecting extremism in their communities. A positive U.S. agenda in the Middle East beyond security and counterterrorism concerns is also seen as crucial. The 111th Congress focused on U.S. counterterrorism policy through hearings and legislation, including the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009. The 112th Congress may continue to address these issues. The 112th Congress may evaluate U.S. counterterrorism strategy and engagement with predominantly Muslim countries, focusing on issues like U.S.-Iraqi partnership, defeating Al Qaeda affiliates, and securing peace in the Middle East. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. counterterrorism strategy in the Middle East, including maintaining partnerships with Iraq, defeating Al Qaeda affiliates, and promoting peace in the region. Relevant Congressional Research Service reports on Iran sanctions and regional perspectives are available for further analysis. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. counterterrorism strategy in the Middle East, including partnerships with Iraq, defeating Al Qaeda affiliates, and promoting peace. Relevant Congressional Research Service reports on Iran sanctions and regional perspectives are available for analysis.
