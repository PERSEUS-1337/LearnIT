    "content": "The \"Wellness and Prevention Act of 2007\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The Congress finds that improving population health and reducing medical costs requires preventive methods. Organizations in the US need more public health professionals as there are only about 6,000 board-certified preventive medicine physicians. Many healthcare costs are spent on avoidable chronic conditions, yet the number of preventive medicine programs and students has decreased. The number of preventive medicine residency programs and individuals pursuing preventive medicine has significantly decreased in recent years. Preventive medicine physicians are uniquely trained to serve patients and communities, and a strong public health system requires a strong preventive medicine workforce. Loan payment assistance is provided for preventive medicine physicians. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may pay up to $20,000 of medical education loans for eligible preventive medicine physicians who receive board certification in preventive medicine between fiscal years 2008 and 2012. Application for payment must be submitted to the Secretary as required. Definitions in this section include an \"eligible preventive medicine physician\" as a physician certified in preventive medicine from 2008 to 2012, a \"medical education loan\" as a loan for medical school expenses, and a \"school of medicine\" as defined in the Public Health Service Act. The term \"school of medicine\" is defined in the Public Health Service Act as a medical education institution. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2008 through 2012 to implement this section. SEC. 4. WELLNESS PROGRAM EMPLOYER CREDIT.
