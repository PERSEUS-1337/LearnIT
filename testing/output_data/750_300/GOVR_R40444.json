    "content": "Eligibility for health benefits under CHIP is available to different groups through various federal authorities and mechanisms, including children, pregnant women, parents, and childless adults. Title XXI defines a targeted low-income child as someone under 19 without health insurance, not eligible for Medicaid before March 31, 1997. States can set the income level for these children up to 200% of the federal poverty level. States have the authority to expand eligibility for children under 19 to any level they choose, with the upper income limit set at 200% of the federal poverty level. CHIPRA reduces federal payments for higher-income CHIP children seeking CMS approval for eligibility expansion. CMS approval allows states to expand eligibility for children under CHIPRA, but reduces federal payments for higher-income CHIP children. States can cover qualifying children in two ways under these rules. States with federal approval plans or state laws can assist qualifying children through Medicaid or separate CHIP programs. Medicaid rules apply for Medicaid coverage, while Title XXI rules apply for separate CHIP programs. Federal share of program costs are involved in both cases. Title XXI does not establish individual entitlement to benefits but entitles states with approved CHIP plans to federal allotments based on a distribution formula. Low-income children covered under CHIP-funded Medicaid expansions are entitled to benefits. Title XXI provides federal allotments to states with approved CHIP plans based on a distribution formula. Low-income children covered under CHIP-funded Medicaid expansions receive benefits, but there is no individual entitlement for children covered under separate CHIP programs. States can expand Medicaid for targeted low-income children by creating new eligibility groups authorized in Title XXI or by relaxing financial rules for existing Medicaid programs. States can cover low-income children by expanding Medicaid programs through new eligibility groups or relaxing financial rules. Many states opt to cover these children under existing Medicaid pathways instead of creating new coverage groups to reduce administrative burden. Medicaid eligibility pathways for low-income children can be expanded through existing programs or separate CHIP programs, reducing administrative burden. States can determine eligibility based on factors such as geography, age, income, resources, residency, and disability status. Title XXI allows states to use factors like geography, age, income, resources, residency, disability status, access to other health insurance, and duration of CHIP eligibility to determine eligibility. Before CHIPRA, states could cover adult pregnant women through Section 1115 waivers or by providing health benefits coverage. Prior to CHIPRA, states could cover adult pregnant women through Section 1115 waivers or by providing health benefits coverage, including prenatal care and delivery services. As of October 2007, 17 states offered pregnancy-related services to adults using CHIP funds, with 6 states using the \u00a71115 waiver authority and 12 states extending coverage through other means. In October 2007, 17 states provided pregnancy-related services to adult females through CHIP funds. 6 states used \u00a71115 waivers, and 12 states extended coverage to unborn children of adult pregnant women. Tennessee was the only state that did not extend coverage to unborn children of undocumented aliens. In FY2008, 364,161 unborn children were enrolled in CHIP, with nearly half in California. CHIPRA added a new state option to cover pregnant women under CHIP through a state plan amendment, with certain conditions to be met by states. States have the option to cover pregnant women under CHIP through a state plan amendment, with specific conditions to be met. This includes meeting Medicaid income standards, no pre-existing conditions or waiting periods, and applying CHIP cost-sharing protections. Pregnant women must meet eligibility restrictions similar to CHIP children, with coverage extending from pregnancy through the postpartum period. Pregnant women can be covered under CHIP with eligibility criteria similar to CHIP children. Coverage includes prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care, with infants born to these women also eligible for Medicaid or CHIP. States can provide temporary enrollment for up to two months (presumptive eligibility) until formal determination is made. Benefits for pregnant women under CHIP include all services available to CHIP children, prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care. Infants born to these women are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP up to age one, with eligibility subject to redetermination. States may also offer postpartum services and coverage for legal immigrants arriving after August 22, 1996. CHIPRA clarified that states can offer postpartum services to legal immigrants arriving after August 22, 1996, who were previously ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP benefits for five years. The law also requires consideration of the sponsor's income and resources for those with a legally binding affidavit of support when determining eligibility for federally means-tested programs. The law requires sponsors' income and resources to be considered for immigrants in determining eligibility for federally means-tested programs. CHIPRA allows states to waive the five-year bar for pregnant women and children lawfully residing in the US. CHIPRA allowed states to waive the five-year bar for pregnant women and children lawfully residing in the US for Medicaid or CHIP coverage. States that elect this option must ensure that the cost of care will not count against an individual's sponsor. The provision under CHIPRA allows states to extend coverage for pregnant women without counting the cost of care against the sponsor. Eligibility redetermination requires further documentation if initial legal residence proof is no longer valid. Under current law, Section 1115 of the Social Security Act grants the Secretary of Health and Human Services broad authority to modify aspects of the CHIP program, including expanding eligibility to populations not typically eligible. Some states have covered adults with CHIP funds through waivers, which are initially effective for five years. Adults with expired legal residence documentation must provide further evidence of lawful residence. Certain states have covered adults with CHIP funds through waivers, initially effective for five years. Waiver renewals for adult coverage are subject to renewal every three years. However, waiver renewals have not been approved for some states since 2007, leading to transitions of adult populations out of CHIP coverage. Since 2007, some states have faced federal CHIP shortfalls and have not had waiver renewals approved, leading to transitions of adult populations out of CHIP coverage. As of January 7, 2009, 4 states have CMS authority to extend coverage to childless adult populations, and 7 states have authority to cover parent populations. CHIPRA will end coverage for nonpregnant childless adults by the end of 2009. States with existing waivers for childless adults can apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage. CHIPRA terminates CHIP coverage of nonpregnant childless adults by the end of 2009. States with existing waivers for childless adults can apply for Medicaid waivers to continue coverage. Budget neutrality standards are required for succeeding fiscal years to be tied to waiver spending in the preceding fiscal year. Coverage of parents is permitted for states with CHIP parent coverage waivers in effect during FY2009. CHIPRA requires budget neutrality standards for succeeding fiscal years to be tied to waiver spending in the preceding fiscal year. Coverage of parents is permitted for states with CHIP parent coverage waivers that were in effect during FY2009, but beginning in FY2012, allowable spending under the waivers will be subject to a set-aside amount from a separate allotment and will be matched at the state's regular Medicaid FMAP unless the state is able to prove it meets certain coverage benchmarks. In FY2013, even states meeting the coverage benchmarks will not get the enhanced FMAP for parents. CHIPRA requires budget neutrality standards for succeeding fiscal years to be tied to waiver spending in the preceding fiscal year. In FY2012, allowable spending under waivers for parent coverage will be subject to a set-aside amount and matched at the state's regular Medicaid FMAP unless certain coverage benchmarks are met. In FY2013, states meeting the benchmarks will not receive the enhanced FMAP for parents. Additionally, CHIPRA prohibits waiver spending for parents with family income exceeding eligibility thresholds set in February 2009. CHIPRA included provisions for access and enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP, authorizing $100 million in outreach and enrollment grants for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. Funds will be allocated for a national enrollment campaign, outreach for Native American children, and campaigns in rural areas and underserved populations. CHIPRA authorizes $100 million in outreach and enrollment grants for Medicaid and CHIP. 20% of the funds will target outreach for Native American children, while the remaining 80% will go to state and local governments and community-based organizations for campaigns in rural areas and underserved populations. Grant funds will focus on proposals addressing cultural and linguistic barriers to enrollment. Additionally, CHIPRA requires state plans to describe procedures for reducing administrative barriers to enrollment and revising them as needed. CHIPRA requires state plans to describe procedures for reducing administrative barriers to enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP, with a state option to use findings from \"Express Lane\" agencies for eligibility determination. States have the option to use Express Lane agencies for eligibility determination for programs like Medicaid and CHIP, allowing for automatic enrollment with family consent. States can rely on applicant's reported income for eligibility determination. Under CHIPRA, states can use Express Lane agencies for automatic enrollment in Medicaid or CHIP with family consent. States may rely on reported income for eligibility, dropping the requirement for signatures on application forms. Under CHIPRA, states can use Express Lane agencies for automatic enrollment in Medicaid or CHIP with family consent. CHIPRA also eliminates the need for signatures on Medicaid or CHIP application forms under penalty of perjury. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 required proof of citizenship and identity for Medicaid applicants, but CHIPRA allows states to use verified Social Security Numbers as an alternative. Under CHIPRA, states can use verified Social Security Numbers as an alternative for citizenship documentation in CHIP. Table 1 displays each state's CHIP program type, upper-income eligibility, and enrollment data. New Jersey has the highest reported upper income eligibility limit for children in CHIP at 350% of the FPL. The highest state-reported upper income eligibility limit for children in CHIP is 350% of the FPL in New Jersey, with 11 states and the District of Columbia having CHIP coverage above 250% FPL. Additionally, 11 states have income thresholds between 200% and 250% FPL, while 22 states have upper income limits at 200% FPL. Six states set maximum income levels below 200% FPL, and CHIP enrollment reached nearly 7.4 million. In FY2008, CHIP enrollment reached almost 7.4 million children, with 5.3 million covered in separate state programs and 2.1 million under Medicaid. Waiver authority under CHIP has been used to expand coverage for adult populations in twelve states. In FY2008, waiver authority under CHIP was used to expand coverage for adult populations in twelve states, with about 335,000 adults enrolled in CHIP. Most of these adults were parents, while some were childless adults or pregnant women. The number of CHIP-enrolled adults in FY2008 decreased compared to previous years due to waivers not being renewed or scaled back. In FY2008, Michigan, New Mexico, and Minnesota reported more adult CHIP enrollees than children. States may cover low-income children under Medicaid or create a separate CHIP program. States using Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs must provide mandatory Medicaid benefits and optional services. States have the option to cover low-income children under their Medicaid program, create a separate CHIP program, or use a combination of both approaches. Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs must offer mandatory Medicaid benefits and optional services. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 allows states to enroll specified groups, including children in CHIP-financed Medicaid expansions, in new benchmark and benchmark-equivalent benefit plans. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-171; DRA) allows states to enroll specified groups, including children in CHIP-financed Medicaid expansions, in new benchmark and benchmark-equivalent benefit plans. These plans are similar to separate CHIP programs, and children under age 21 must receive benefits through the EPSDT Program, including well-child care and screenings. The EPSDT Program provides benefits for low-income children, including well-child care, immunizations, and necessary medical care. States can choose from three benefit options for separate CHIP programs. States can choose from three benefit options for separate CHIP programs: benchmark benefit package, benchmark equivalent coverage, or any other health benefits plan approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Benchmark benefit package options include the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan, state employee health coverage, or other approved health coverage. Benchmark-equivalent coverage is a package of benefits with the same actuarial value as one of the benchmark benefit packages. States can choose this option for their CHIP programs, covering each benefit in the basic benefits category, which includes inpatient and outpatient services. Benchmark-equivalent coverage for CHIP programs must include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physicians' surgical and medical services, lab and x-ray services, well-baby and well-child care with immunizations. It should also cover at least 75% of the actuarial value for additional services like prescription drugs, vision, and hearing services. Benchmark-equivalent coverage for CHIP programs must include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, physicians' surgical and medical services, lab and x-ray services, well-baby and well-child care with immunizations. It should also cover at least 75% of the actuarial value for additional services like prescription drugs, vision, and hearing services. States are encouraged to cover other categories of service not listed above, with exceptions for abortions in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories have CHIP programs, with various approaches to coverage. CHIP programs in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five territories cover a range of services, with different approaches used. CHIPRA brought changes to mental health and substance abuse coverage under CHIP, ensuring comprehensive care. CHIPRA made changes to mental health and substance abuse coverage under CHIP, ensuring that financial requirements and treatment limitations for these benefits are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. CHIPRA made changes to mental health and substance abuse coverage under CHIP, ensuring that limitations for these benefits are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical benefits. Dental services are now a required benefit under CHIP. CHIPRA also made modifications to dental care under CHIP, with dental services now being a required benefit that includes services to prevent disease, promote oral health, restore oral structures, and treat emergency conditions. States have the option to provide dental services through benchmark dental benefit packages. States have the option to provide dental services through benchmark dental benefit packages modeled after plans for medical services. The new law includes provisions for dental education for parents of newborns and services through federally qualified health centers. States must report detailed information on the number of children receiving various types of dental care. The new law includes provisions for dental education for parents of newborns and services through federally qualified health centers. States must report detailed information on children's dental care, including the number of children by age group receiving various types of dental care. GAO will conduct a study on children's access to dental care under Medicaid and CHIP, with recommendations for addressing barriers to care and using mid-level providers to improve access. The report will include recommendations for federal and state actions to address barriers to dental care, and the feasibility of using mid-level providers to improve access under Medicaid and CHIP. CHIPRA allowed for dental-only supplemental coverage for children enrolled in employer coverage who meet CHIP eligibility criteria. CHIPRA allowed states to offer dental-only supplemental coverage to children enrolled in group or employer coverage who meet CHIP eligibility criteria. States can provide dental coverage consistent with new benchmark benefits plans or cost-sharing protections under CHIP, setting the income level up to their separate CHIP programs' limit. States can offer dental-only supplemental coverage to children meeting CHIP eligibility criteria, setting income levels up to their CHIP program limits. However, states must meet specific criteria to offer this coverage, including not limiting acceptance of applications or imposing enrollment caps. Additionally, states cannot provide more favorable dental coverage for children with dental-only supplemental coverage. States may not provide more favorable dental coverage or related cost-sharing protections for children with dental-only supplemental coverage than for CHIP children eligible for the full range of benefits. States have the option to not apply an eligibility waiting period for children with dental-only supplemental coverage. Under prior law, states could pay a beneficiary's share of costs for group health insurance in CHIP if cost-effective and not substituting for existing coverage. States using CHIP funds for employer-based plans had to ensure minimum benefits, cost-sharing ceilings, and a waiting period for children without group coverage. States using CHIP funds for employer-based plan premiums must ensure CHIP minimum benefits, cost-sharing ceilings, and a waiting period for children without group coverage. Medicaid allows premium assistance if the employer plan is comprehensive and cost-effective for the state. To be cost-effective under Medicaid, an individual's enrollment in an employer plan must have premiums, deductible, coinsurance, and other costs lower than the state's cost of providing Medicaid services. States must offer \"wrap-around\" coverage for services not included in private plans. Many employer plans and states find it challenging to meet all requirements, leading to the use of CHIP or Medicaid premium assistance to bypass restrictions. CHIPRA created a new state plan option for providing premium assistance under waivers for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and parents. States must offer \"wrap-around\" coverage for services not included in private plans, which has been challenging for many employer plans and states. States have the option to offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and/or parents with access to employer-sponsored insurance, meeting specific criteria. Under CHIPRA, states can provide premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible individuals with access to employer-sponsored insurance. The employer's group health plan must qualify as \"creditable coverage\" and be offered in a nondiscriminatory way. CHIP eligible individuals are not required to enroll in an employer's plan, and they can choose regular CHIP instead. The premium assistance subsidy covers the difference in out-of-pocket premiums for the employee and their child(ren). If an employer plan does not meet CHIP benefit requirements, individuals can opt for regular CHIP. CHIPRA allows states to offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible individuals with access to employer-sponsored insurance. The subsidy covers the difference in out-of-pocket premiums for the employee and their child(ren). If the employer plan does not meet CHIP benefit requirements, individuals can choose regular CHIP coverage instead. No cost-effectiveness test is required for child coverage using premium assistance. CHIPRA allows states to establish a separate test for family coverage under premium assistance. If the CHIP cost of covering the entire family in the employer-sponsored plan is lower than regular CHIP coverage for the eligible individual(s), the subsidy can pay the entire family's premium. States offering premium assistance must conduct outreach, and can create an employer-family premium assistance purchasing pool for certain employers. Under CHIPRA, states can establish an employer-family premium assistance purchasing pool for employers with less than 250 employees who have CHIP-eligible individuals. The new premium assistance provisions under Medicaid, not CHIP, apply to children in a Medicaid-expansion CHIP program. CHIPRA also streamlines coordination between public and private coverage, making loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility a \"qualifying event\" for purchasing employer-sponsored coverage. CHIPRA amends Federal laws to streamline coordination between public and private coverage, including making loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility a \"qualifying event\" for purchasing employer-sponsored coverage. It also requires health plan administrators to disclose information about their benefit packages to states upon request for evaluating the need to provide wraparound coverage. Cost-sharing refers to out-of-pocket payments made by beneficiaries of a health insurance plan, which may include premiums, fees, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. States are permitted to impose cost-sharing under Federal law. The text discusses cost-sharing in health insurance plans under CHIP, including monthly premiums, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. States can impose cost-sharing for some beneficiaries and services. Children under Medicaid must follow nominal cost-sharing rules, with exemptions for most low-income children. Children aged 18 in Medicaid expansions under CHIP may face service-related cost-sharing. DRA provided states with new guidelines. The Medicaid program has cost-sharing rules, with exemptions for most low-income children. Children aged 18 in Medicaid expansions under CHIP may face service-related cost-sharing. DRA provided states with new options for premiums and service-related cost-sharing for targeted low-income children under CHIP Medicaid-expansion programs. Premiums are not allowed for children in families with income under 100% FPL, and service-related cost-sharing is limited to nominal amounts. For children in families with income between 100%-150% FPL, no premiums may be imposed, but service-related cost-sharing can be up to 10% of the cost. For children in families with income under 100% FPL, no premiums are allowed and service-related cost-sharing is limited to nominal amounts. For children in families with income between 100%-150% FPL, no premiums may be imposed; however, service-related cost-sharing may be applied up to 10% of the cost. For children in families with income above 150% FPL, premiums are allowed, and service-related cost-sharing may be applied up to 20% of the cost. Total cost-sharing cannot exceed 5% of family income. Preventive services for children are exempt. Cost-sharing for Medicaid recipients is limited to 20% of the cost of services, with a total cap of 5% of family income. Preventive services for children are exempt from cost-sharing. Rules for prescription drugs and emergency room copayments are specified. States can require payment of premiums for Medicaid eligibility. Providers may deny care for non-payment of cost-sharing. The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) allows states to impose cost-sharing for Medicaid recipients, including premiums and service-related expenses. Providers may deny care for non-payment. CHIP programs may also require premiums based on family income, with limits for low-income families. For families with incomes under 150% FPL enrolled in separate state programs, premiums are capped according to federal Medicaid regulations. Cost-sharing is limited to nominal amounts for lower-income families and slightly higher amounts for those with income between 100%-150% FPL. Families above 150% FPL may face cost-sharing, but it must not be less for higher-income children than for lower-income children and is subject to a 5% out-of-pocket limit. Cost-sharing for families with income above 150% FPL must not be less for higher-income children than for lower-income children and is subject to a 5% out-of-pocket limit. States must inform families of these limits and provide a way to stop payments once the limits are reached. Preventive services are exempt from cost-sharing for all CHIP families regardless of income. Preventive services are exempt from cost-sharing for all CHIP families regardless of income, including newborn physician visits, physical examinations, laboratory tests, immunizations, dental services, and data collection improvements under CHIPRA 2009. CHIPRA 2009 aimed to expand data collection and reporting for CHIP and Medicaid, including developing child health quality measures and standardized reporting formats. States were encouraged to voluntarily report on pediatric care quality under both programs, with additional reporting requirements added to annual CHIP reports. CHIPRA 2009 aimed to develop child health quality measures and standardized reporting formats for CHIP and Medicaid. States were encouraged to voluntarily report on pediatric care quality, with additional reporting requirements added to annual CHIP reports. GAO will conduct a study on children's access to primary and specialty care under Medicaid and CHIP, and a new federal commission called MACPAC was established to review policies affecting both programs. CHIPRA 2009 established GAO to study children's access to primary and specialty care under Medicaid and CHIP. A new federal commission, MACPAC, will review policies impacting children's benefits, with regular reports to Congress and recommendations for improvement. HHS is required to conduct a federal evaluation of 10 states with approved CHIP plans. Congress will detail findings and recommendations for improving access and quality of care for children under Medicaid and CHIP. HHS is conducting a federal evaluation of 10 states with approved CHIP plans to assess outreach strategies, cost-sharing effects, and other factors. The federal evaluation of CHIP will assess outreach strategies, cost-sharing effects, and factors related to disenrollment and retention of children. Federal financing includes total appropriations, reallocation of funds, and other factors like matching rates and caps on expenses. The BBA 97 allocated approximately $40 billion for CHIP allotments from FY1998 to FY2007, with varying funding levels each year. Appropriations ranged from over $4.2 billion for FY1998-FY2001 to around $5.0 billion in FY2007, with fluctuations in between. The total annual appropriation for CHIP fluctuated over the years, starting at $4.2 billion for FY1998-FY2001, dropping to under $3.2 billion for FY2002-FY2004, then increasing to $4.1 billion for FY2005 and FY2006, and further rising to $5.0 billion in FY2007. The funding decrease during FY2002-FY2004, known as the \"CHIP dip,\" was due to budgetary constraints. The 110th Congress passed bills to reauthorize CHIP for FY2008-FY2012, but they were vetoed by President George W. Bush. The 110th Congress passed bills to reauthorize CHIP for FY2008-FY2012, but they were vetoed by President George W. Bush. In response, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 appropriated funds for CHIP allotments for FY2008 and FY2009, with additional funds allocated to address projected shortfalls in certain states. CHIPRA provided a national appropriation totaling $68.9 billion for CHIP allotments from FY2009 to FY2013, with annual allotments increasing each year. The allotment of funds among states is determined by a formula set in law. The CHIPRA provided increasing annual federal appropriations for CHIP from FY2009 to FY2013, totaling $68.9 billion. The allotment among states is determined by a formula based on the number of low-income uninsured children in each state. The CHIPRA provided increasing annual federal appropriations for CHIP from FY2009 to FY2013, totaling $68.9 billion. The allotment among states is determined by a formula based on the number of low-income uninsured children in each state. The allotment for each state is calculated based on survey estimates and adjusted by a geographic factor to ensure consistency with past allotments. If the total of all states' allotments does not exceed the national appropriation, that will be the state's allotment. The CHIP allotments are separate funding accounts for each state and territory, calculated based on state survey estimates. Allotments are available for a certain period of time, with payments taken from the earliest active account. Starting from FY2009, CHIP allotments will only be available for two years. The CHIP allotments for states are available for a certain period of time, with payments taken from the earliest active account. FY2009 federal CHIP allotments are the largest of three state-specific amounts based on state estimates and projections. The FY2009 federal CHIP allotment for states is determined by three state-specific amounts, including federal spending projections and growth factors. If the national appropriation is insufficient, allotments will be reduced proportionally. For FY2010, state allotments will be calculated based on four amounts. The FY2010 CHIP allotment for states is calculated based on four amounts, including FY2009 allotment, FY2006 unspent allotments, spending of funds provided to shortfall states, and Contingency Fund payments in FY2009. Allotments for FY2011 and FY2013 will be \"rebased\" for states. For FY2010, states' CHIP allotments are calculated based on FY2009 allotment, FY2006 unspent allotments, spending for shortfall states, and Contingency Fund payments. Allotments for FY2011 and FY2013 will be \"rebased\" using prior year spending as the new base. Unspent allotments are redistributed to other states after the period of availability ends. For FY2012, state allotments are calculated based on FY2011 allotment and Contingency Fund spending, multiplied by the state's growth factor. Unspent allotments are redistributed to other states at the end of the period. BBA 97 stipulated that states must exhaust their allotment within three years to be eligible for redistributed funds. In FY2006, insufficient funds were available for covering CHIP shortfalls in 12 states. In FY2006, funds were redistributed to states to cover projected federal CHIP shortfalls. Congress appropriated an additional $283 million in DRA to address shortfalls in two states, Illinois and Massachusetts. In FY2007, $147 million in unspent FY2004 allotments was available for redistribution. In FY2007, $147 million in unspent FY2004 allotments was available for redistribution to states facing funding shortfalls. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 specified how these funds would be distributed to delay shortfalls as much as possible. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 aimed to delay funding shortfalls for states in FY2007 by redistributing unspent FY2004 funds. The Act projected that shortfalls would be delayed until the end of March 2007, with provisions for further redistribution of unspent funds. The NIH Reform Act of 2006 aimed to delay funding shortfalls for states in FY2007 by redistributing unspent FY2004 funds. The Act projected an additional $138 million for shortfall states, delaying any state facing a shortfall of federal CHIP funds until May 2007. Shortfalls remaining for the rest of the fiscal year were projected at just over $600 million in 12 states. In May 2007, P.L. 110-28 was enacted to appropriate $650 million to cover federal CHIP fund shortfalls in 10 states for FY2007. Cumulative federal CHIP financing from 1998 to FY2007 is shown in Table 2. Unspent FY2005 allotments were redistributed to shortfall states for FY2008 under MMSEA. In FY2007, $650 million was allocated to cover federal CHIP fund shortfalls in 10 states. For FY2008, unspent FY2005 allotments were redistributed to states with shortfalls, along with an additional $1.6 billion for remaining shortfalls. In FY2009, unspent FY2006 allotments were also redistributed to states facing shortfalls. Total shortfall funding in FY2008 was just under $1 billion. In FY2008, $1 billion was provided for states' remaining shortfalls. MMSEA required redistribution of unspent FY2006 allotments to states facing shortfalls in FY2009. Additionally, up to $275 million was appropriated for states' remaining shortfalls through March 31, 2009. The increased FY2009 allotments from CHIPRA should prevent federal CHIP funding shortfalls for the second half of FY2009. The Child Enrollment Contingency Fund created under CHIPRA aims to prevent states from facing federal CHIP funding shortfalls. It receives a separate appropriation to provide direct payments to shortfall states. Enrollment Contingency Fund is an additional CHIPRA measure to prevent states from running out of federal CHIP funds. It receives a separate appropriation and can make direct payments to states for CHIP children above a target enrollment level. Payments cannot exceed 20% of the national allotment and are reduced proportionally if needed. CHIP is a federal-state matching program where the federal government matches state spending for program expenses. The CHIP program is a federal-state matching program where the federal government matches state spending for program expenses. The enhanced FMAP (E-FMAP) for CHIP means a state's share of expenditures is 30% lower than under the regular FMAP. The temporary Medicaid FMAP increases specified in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 are not considered in calculating the E-FMAP. The enhanced FMAP for CHIP ranges from 65% to 83.09%, with a ceiling of 85% and a floor of 65%. All CHIP assistance for targeted low-income children is eligible for the enhanced FMAP. Federal spending for CHIP administrative expenses is limited. The enhanced FMAP for CHIP ranges from 65% to 83.09%, with a ceiling of 85% and a floor of 65%. Medicaid and CHIP have federal spending limits for administrative expenses, with a 10% cap on state non-benefit expenses tied to the dollar amount drawn down for benefits. Under CHIPRA, states can only use up to 10% of federal funds for non-benefit costs, including administrative expenses. Federal CHIP bonus payments are available to states that increase Medicaid child enrollment and implement specific outreach activities. Funding for these payments comes from an initial $3.225 billion appropriation in FY2009 and unspent funds. States can receive federal CHIP bonus payments by increasing Medicaid child enrollment and implementing specific outreach activities. Funding for these payments includes an initial $3.225 billion appropriation in FY2009 and unspent national allotment and redistribution amounts."
