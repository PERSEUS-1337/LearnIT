    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to allow electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources within the WECC transmission network service area to comply with renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements. These products can be differentiated based on their grid operation impacts and must meet the requirements of this article. The amended Section 399.16 of the Public Utilities Code allows for the procurement of a balanced portfolio of eligible renewable energy resources that meet specific criteria and provide benefits outlined in Section 399.11. To qualify for the portfolio content category, renewable energy resources must connect to a California balancing authority or distribution facilities within the area. Importing electricity into a California balancing authority is allowed, but only the portion generated by the renewable energy resource counts towards the portfolio. Unbundled renewable energy credits earned by excluded entities can be used at a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity, meeting specific criteria and requirements. The renewable energy credit must be earned by a generating facility meeting specific criteria and used at a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity. The renewable energy credit is earned by a generating facility used at a wastewater treatment facility owned by a public entity, with generating capability first put into service on or after January 1, 2016. This includes new generation or operational changes resulting in incremental increases in electricity generation at the facility. Retail sellers must meet specific requirements for all procurement credited towards each compliance period, including firmed and shaped eligible renewable energy resource electricity products scheduled into a California balancing authority. Additionally, any electricity products that do not qualify under the mentioned criteria are also considered. The wastewater treatment facility in question does not participate in the small-scale bioenergy feed-in tariff program established by the commission. Retail sellers must meet requirements for procurement credited towards each compliance period, with a minimum percentage of eligible renewable energy resource electricity products meeting specific content requirements. Retail sellers must meet specific content requirements for eligible renewable energy resource electricity products associated with contracts executed after June 1, 2010. Not more than 25 percent for the compliance period ending December 31, 2013, 15 percent for the compliance period ending December 31, 2016, and 10 percent thereafter shall meet the product content requirements. Renewable energy resource contracts executed on or after June 1, 2010, not subject to limitations, shall meet the product content requirements. Any renewable energy resources contracts executed on or after June 1, 2010, must meet product content requirements. Restrictions on crediting renewable energy resource electricity products apply to contracts executed after January 13, 2011. Contracts executed before June 1, 2010, count towards procurement requirements if specific conditions are met. Contracts executed before June 1, 2010, count towards procurement requirements if specific conditions are met, including eligibility under previous rules and approval by the commission for electrical corporations. The renewable energy resource must meet eligibility rules at the time of contract execution. Approval by the commission is required for electrical corporations, even if granted after June 1, 2010. Contract amendments post-June 1, 2010, cannot increase capacity or change the energy source. Extensions are allowed for contracts with a 15-year procurement commitment. A retail seller can request a reduction in procurement content requirements if they cannot comply due to uncontrollable conditions. The commission can reduce the requirement but not below 65% after December 31, 2016. A public entity selling renewable energy credits cannot make marketing claims about the renewable attributes of the electricity that earned the credit. All renewable attributes are transferred to the purchaser of the credit. For calculating renewables portfolio standard obligations, electricity generated and sold by a public entity with renewable energy credits must be added to the total retail sales of the buyer."
