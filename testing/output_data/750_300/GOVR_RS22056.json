    "content": "Congress has been grappling with reauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act for over five years. The Act authorizes various specific Indian Health Service programs, including health professional recruitment, mental health services, urban Indian health services, and construction of health facilities. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act authorizes various programs such as health professional recruitment, mental health services, urban Indian health services, and construction of health facilities. Congress continues to appropriate funds for these programs despite the expiration of authorizations in FY2001. Major changes to the Act have been suggested but have not been accepted by HHS or other agencies, leading to ongoing negotiations for reauthorization. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act has seen proposed changes that have not been accepted by HHS or other agencies, leading to ongoing negotiations for reauthorization. Several reauthorization bills have been introduced in Congress, including S. 1057 and H.R. 5312, with discussions ongoing through multiple Congresses. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act has proposed changes not accepted by HHS, leading to ongoing negotiations for reauthorization. Congress faces a multi-billion-dollar problem with Indian trust funds. Congress faces a multi-billion-dollar problem stemming from Indian trust funds, with Indian individuals and tribes claiming as much as $176 billion owed due to the federal government's mismanagement of Indian trust funds and lands. This issue has resulted in lawsuits and the controversial reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians within the Department of the Interior. The mismanagement of Indian trust funds has led to claims of up to $176 billion owed to Indian individuals and tribes. This has resulted in lawsuits and the reorganization of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Office of Special Trustee for American Indians within the Department of the Interior. The Bureau of Indian Affairs has historically managed funds, lands, and physical assets held in trust for Indian tribes and individuals, totaling about 56 million acres of trust lands and $3.3 billion in funds' asset value. The Bureau of Indian Affairs historically managed funds, lands, and assets held in trust for Indian tribes and individuals, totaling about 56 million acres of trust lands and $3.3 billion in asset value. The funds are housed by the Treasury Department, with $2.9 billion in tribal accounts and $400 million in Individual Indian Money accounts. The BIA has faced criticism for its management, leading to reforms enacted in 1994. The American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 was enacted to address issues with the Bureau of Indian Affairs' management of trust funds and assets. This led to the creation of the Office of the Special Trustee to oversee reforms. Subsequently, IIM account holders filed a lawsuit demanding an accounting of their funds and correction of mismanagement. The 1994 American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act led to a class action lawsuit by IIM account holders against U.S. officials for fund mismanagement. This resulted in the reorganization of the BIA and OST, with congressional consideration of settling IIM and tribal claims. In 1999, the district court found that DOI and Treasury had breached their duties. The 1994 American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act led to a lawsuit by IIM account holders against U.S. officials for fund mismanagement. The district court found that DOI and Treasury breached their trust duties, ordering them to bring trust management up to current standards. The final stage of the lawsuit will determine the amount of money in the IIM plaintiffs' accounts. The court ordered DOI and Treasury to bring trust management up to current standards. The final stage of the lawsuit will determine the amount of money in the IIM plaintiffs' accounts, with differing methods proposed for calculating the total amount due. DOI estimated losses in the tens of millions using their method, while the plaintiffs suggested a different approach. The district court has twice ordered the DOI to conduct a historical accounting of all IIM trust account transactions and assets since 1887, without using statistical sampling. DOI estimated compliance would cost $12-13 billion. The plaintiffs' methods have shown estimated losses of over $100 billion. The district court has twice ordered the DOI to perform a historical accounting of all IIM trust account transactions and assets since 1887, estimated to cost $12-13 billion. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit overturned the orders. Congress has addressed the Cobell suit through oversight hearings and provisions in Interior appropriation acts. The DOI continues with its historical accounting plan. Congress has addressed the Cobell suit through oversight hearings and provisions in Interior appropriation acts, expressing concerns about the costs of the lawsuit impacting DOI trust reform implementation. No bills have been introduced to amend the 1994 Act regarding the historical accounting obligation. Congress has not introduced any bills to amend the 1994 Act regarding the historical accounting obligation, despite concerns about the costs of the Cobell lawsuit impacting DOI trust reform implementation. Current and possible future costs include expenses of ongoing litigation, a court-ordered historical accounting, and potential settlement amounts proposed by the Cobell plaintiffs. The Cobell settlement may cost $12-$13 billion for a court-ordered historical accounting. Funding sources include discretionary appropriations and the Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund.\" Some consider the Fund insufficient for a settlement, which could be as high as $100 billion according to Cobell plaintiffs. Congress may need to consider further court actions or delay the accounting. The Treasury Department's \"Judgment Fund\" may not be enough for a $12-$13 billion settlement for the Cobell case. Congress is considering various options, including waiting for court actions, delaying an accounting, or directing a settlement. Two bills have been introduced in Congress to establish a settlement fund for IIM claimants. Two bills introduced in the 109th Congress aim to establish an IIM accounting-claim settlement fund for payments to IIM claimants, review Indian trust asset management, increase payments for fractionated individual Indian trust interests, create a tribal trust management project, reorganize BIA and OST under a new Under Secretary for Indian Affairs, and mandate an annual independent audit of all Indian trust funds. The 109th Congress introduced two bills to establish an IIM accounting-claim settlement fund, review Indian trust asset management, and reorganize BIA and OST under a new Under Secretary for Indian Affairs. Hearings were held on the bills in 2005 and 2006, with further committee action pending on H.R. 4322. The 109th Congress introduced two bills for an IIM accounting-claim settlement fund and reorganization of BIA and OST. Hearings were held in 2005 and 2006, with further committee action pending on H.R. 4322. Senate Indian Affairs Committee mark-up of an amended S. 1439, with an $8 billion settlement amount, was scheduled for August 2 but withdrawn for more negotiations on trust management reform. DOI, BIA, and OST have proposed administrative changes since the 1994 Act, including transferring the office managing trust funds from BIA to OST in 1996. The DOI, BIA, and OST have made administrative changes to implement trust management reform since the 1994 Act. In 1996, the office managing trust funds was transferred from BIA to OST. In 2003, a reorganization split BIA trust management operations from other services, creating OST field operations to oversee trust management. The DOI reorganized trust management operations, creating OST field operations to oversee trust management at regional and agency levels. Tribal leaders and Cobell plaintiffs oppose the reorganization, citing lack of consultation and unclear new OST duties. DOI claims consultation occurred prior to the reorganization to meet a court-ordered deadline. The DOI reorganized trust management operations, creating new OST duties. The DOI consulted with tribes beforehand and faced a court-ordered deadline. Attempts to halt the reorganization in Congress have failed, with bills proposing changes in trust management not moving forward. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 propose reorganizing DOI management of Indian trust assets. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA; P.L. 100-497) was enacted to regulate gambling on Indian reservations and certain lands for tribal economic development. S. 1439 and H.R. 4322 propose reorganizing DOI management of Indian trust assets. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) was enacted to regulate gambling on Indian reservations and certain lands for tribal economic development. IGRA prohibits gaming on trust lands acquired after 1988, with exceptions for tribes without reservations, newly recognized tribes, restored tribes, and land-claim settlements. Critics argue that these exceptions can lead to \"reservation shopping\" for off-reservation gaming. Critics argue that exceptions in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act can lead to \"reservation shopping\" for off-reservation gaming. Bills introduced to curb these exceptions have been reported, deleting the requirement for secretarial and gubernatorial agreement but allowing applications filed before a certain 2006 date. Two bills, S. 2078 and H.R. 4893, aim to curb exceptions in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. They remove the requirement for secretarial and gubernatorial agreement but allow applications filed before specific 2006 dates to proceed. H.R. 4893 adds a geographic limitation, while both bills retain exceptions for certain tribes. The bills, S. 2078 and H.R. 4893, aim to limit exceptions in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. They remove the need for secretarial and gubernatorial agreement but allow applications filed before specific 2006 dates to continue. H.R. 4893 introduces a geographic limitation, while both bills maintain exceptions for certain tribes. Newly recognized, restored, and landless tribes face new and perceived unfair burdens under the proposed changes. The bills, S. 2078 and H.R. 4893, aim to limit exceptions in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act by adding new burdens on newly recognized, restored, and landless tribes. H.R. 4893's requirement for mitigation agreements is seen as unprecedented subjection of tribal sovereignty to local governments. Native Hawaiians, the indigenous people of Hawaii, are not currently affected by these bills. S. 2078 and H.R. 4893 aim to limit exceptions in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act by adding new burdens on tribes. Native Hawaiians, not considered Indians under federal law, lack a recognized political entity but benefit from federal programs. Recognition supporters fear legal challenges to Native Hawaiian programs without a recognized entity. Supporters of Native Hawaiian recognition are concerned about the lack of a recognized political entity, which could jeopardize federal and state programs benefiting Native Hawaiians. Currently, Native Hawaiians are excluded from the DOI's administrative process for recognition, requiring congressional action for establishment. Bills in the 109th Congress aim to create a process for recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity. The DOI process excludes Native Hawaiians, requiring congressional action for recognition. Bills in the 109th Congress aim to establish a Native Hawaiian political entity, leaving questions about governmental powers and lands for later negotiations. Proponents argue that Congress has the power to recognize such an entity. Proponents argue that Congress has the power to recognize a Native Hawaiian political entity due to its constitutional authority over indigenous native peoples in the United States. They also point out the special relationship Congress has with the Native Hawaiian people, evidenced by established programs like the Hawaiian homelands. Proponents argue that Congress has a special relationship with Native Hawaiians, similar to that with Indian tribes, as evidenced by established programs like the Hawaiian homelands. They claim that Native Hawaiians did not give up their sovereignty but had it forcibly taken away in the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Proponents argue that Native Hawaiians have not relinquished their sovereignty, which was forcibly taken away in the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii by Americans with the support of certain U.S. officials and armed forces. They maintain that Native Hawaiians, like Indian tribes, have a distinct community with cultural and political institutions. Opponents dispute this, stating that Congress's authority only extends to Indian tribes, not all indigenous peoples. Opponents dispute the recognition of a Native Hawaiian political entity, arguing that Congress does not have the constitutional authority to do so and that the US does not have a special responsibility to Native Hawaiians as it does for Indian tribes. They also argue that recognition would be based on race alone. Opponents of recognizing a Native Hawaiian political entity argue that it raises concerns over constitutionality and racial discrimination. They believe that unlike Indian tribes, the entity would not need to meet criteria of geography, community, and continuous political autonomy, setting a precedent for other race-based groups. The U.S. Civil Rights Commission also opposes the recognition, citing similar concerns. Native Hawaiian recognition could set a precedent for political recognition of other non-Indian groups based on race. The U.S. Civil Rights Commission opposed the passage of S. 147, citing concerns of racial discrimination. Some opponents argue that Native Hawaiian sovereignty claims are disputed, stating that sovereignty ended before 1893 or resided in the monarch, not the Native Hawaiian people. Bills similar to S. 147 have been considered in previous Congresses. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee reported S. 147 on May 16, 2005, and an amended version, S. 3064, was introduced on May 25, 2006. The Senate failed to proceed with consideration of S. 147 and S. 3064 on June 8, 2006. H.R. 309 was referred to the House Resources. The Senate failed to invoke cloture on a motion to consider S. 147 and S. 3064, effectively ending Senate consideration. H.R. 309 was referred to the House Resources Committee and has not been reported. The House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing on constitutional issues raised by H.R. 309."
