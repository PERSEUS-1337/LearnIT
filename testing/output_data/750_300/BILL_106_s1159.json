    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for all K-12 students. Physical education is essential for children's development, improving their health, self-esteem, and interpersonal relationships. It also helps in weight regulation, bone development, and promoting an active lifestyle. Physical education is crucial for children's development, improving self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, responsible behavior, and independence. Participation in high-quality daily physical education programs leads to better health and fitness. The rise in childhood obesity is linked to low activity levels, with obesity-related diseases costing the US economy over $100 billion annually. \"Low activity levels contribute to high obesity rates among children in the US, costing over $100 billion annually. Inactivity and poor diet lead to 300,000 deaths yearly. Physically fit adults have lower heart attack and stroke risks. Only 1 in 4 children get enough daily vigorous activity.\" Children's lack of physical activity is a significant factor in heart attacks and strokes. Less than 1 in 4 children engage in 20 minutes of vigorous activity daily. Recommendations include daily physical education for all students from kindergarten to grade 12. Twelve years after Congress passed a resolution encouraging physical education programs for all students in kindergarten through grade 12, little progress has been made. Every student should have the opportunity to participate in quality physical education to develop fitness, competence, and cognitive skills. Quality physical education programs aim to develop health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity for all students from kindergarten to grade 12, promoting healthy and active lifestyles. Quality physical education programs aim to develop health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity for all students from kindergarten to grade 12, promoting healthy and active lifestyles. SEC. 10999D. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Secretary can award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and teacher training. \"SEC. 10999E. APPLICATIONS; PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.\" Each local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary outlining a plan to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet specific requirements. These requirements include providing elementary, middle, and high school students with a minimum of 150 minutes of physical education curriculum. The curriculum for physical education programs must include 150 minutes per week of instruction for elementary, middle, and high school students, along with fitness education, assessment, and instruction in various motor skills. The physical education curriculum aims to help children improve their physical well-being through instruction in motor skills, cognitive concepts, social skills, and multicultural perspectives. The physical education curriculum focuses on promoting a healthy lifestyle, developing social and cooperative skills through physical activity, ensuring all children participate in appropriate physical activities, and teaching healthy eating habits. Teachers of physical education must have baccalaureate degrees. Teachers of physical education must have baccalaureate degrees as physical education specialists and receive professional development opportunities to stay updated on research and trends in the field. Extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC programs are not considered part of the assisted physical education curriculum. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural local educational agencies, as well as between agencies serving large and small student populations. Private school and home-schooled students are also included in the provisions. \"Private school and home-schooled students can participate in activities funded under this part, based on the number of students in the school district. A report is required for continued funding.\" \"Annual report required for continued funding of multiyear grants or contracts under this part to demonstrate progress towards program requirements. Report to Congress also mandated.\" The Secretary must submit a report to Congress by June 1, 2003, detailing the programs assisted under this part, their success in improving physical fitness, and recommendations for their continuation and improvement. Additionally, not more than 7 percent of grant funds can be used for administrative costs, and the federal share should supplement, not supplant, other funding. Federal share under this part may not exceed 90% of total project cost in the first year and 75% in subsequent years. Funds must supplement, not supplant, other available federal, state, and local funds for physical education activities. Authorization of appropriations is also included. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2000 to 2004 totaling $30,000,000, $70,000,000, and $100,000,000 respectively, to support physical education activities."
