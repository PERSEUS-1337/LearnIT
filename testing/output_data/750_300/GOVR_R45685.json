    "content": "Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides legal relief for victims of sexual abuse and harassment at educational institutions. The statute prohibits discrimination based on sex in programs receiving federal funding. The Supreme Court has ruled that schools can be held liable for damages if they respond indifferently to abuse or harassment by teachers. The Court has held that school districts can be liable for damages for a deliberately indifferent response to teacher or student sexual abuse or harassment under Title IX. Federal agencies like the Department of Education also enforce Title IX for instances of sexual harassment in educational institutions. Title IX is enforced through private rights of action against schools and by federal agencies that provide funding to educational programs. Compliance with Title IX is a condition for receiving federal funding in any education program, applying to federally-funded schools at all levels of education. Title IX, like other federal civil rights statutes, requires compliance with its antidiscrimination mandate to receive federal funding in education programs. It applies to federally-funded schools at all levels, including public school districts and institutions of higher education. When any part of a school district or institution receives federal funds, all operations are covered by Title IX, although the text does not explicitly mention sexual abuse or harassment. Title IX covers all operations of federally-funded schools, including public school districts and higher education institutions. While the text of Title IX does not mention sexual abuse or harassment explicitly, guidance documents from the Department of Education instruct schools on addressing allegations of sexual harassment. The Department of Education has issued guidance documents to schools on their responsibilities under Title IX regarding sexual harassment. Educational institutions have developed procedures to address allegations of sexual harassment and assault. Recently, ED proposed new regulations that would significantly change how schools respond to such allegations. The Department of Education recently issued new regulations that would change how schools respond to sexual harassment allegations. This report provides background on the legal landscape that informs the proposal, including federal courts' understanding of Title IX requirements and how federal agencies have enforced them. The report examines federal courts' interpretation of Title IX in cases where students sue educational institutions for sexual abuse or harassment. It also discusses how federal agencies, particularly the Department of Education, enforce Title IX through guidance on responding to such allegations. Additionally, it addresses constitutional challenges by students against public universities regarding due process rights in handling harassment claims. The report also analyzes the Department of Education's proposed regulations. The report discusses constitutional challenges by students against public universities regarding due process rights in handling harassment claims. It examines ED's proposed regulations and how they would impact schools' compliance with Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in education programs receiving federal funding. Title IX of 1972 prohibits sex-based discrimination in education programs receiving federal funding, but does not explicitly allow victims to sue for violations or address sexual harassment as a form of discrimination. Title IX does not provide for a private right of action for sex discrimination victims or explicitly prohibit sexual harassment. Federal courts have established the remedial scheme for victims seeking relief under Title IX. Federal courts have established the remedial scheme for victims seeking relief under Title IX through a private right of action for sexual harassment or abuse. The Supreme Court has interpreted Title IX to allow for a judicially implied private right of action and damages remedy against federally-funded educational institutions. The Court has also set the legal standard for liability under Title IX for sexual abuse or harassment. The Supreme Court has established a legal standard for liability under Title IX for sexual abuse or harassment, creating a \"high bar for plaintiffs to recover.\" This standard draws upon the \"deliberate indifference\" standard applied under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In a Title IX private right of action for damages, educational institutions are not strictly liable. In a Title IX private right of action for damages, educational institutions are not strictly liable for sexual harassment or abuse by teachers or principals. Liability depends on the institution's response to the conduct, not just the occurrence of the harassment or abuse. The recipient will only be liable if their response was severely deficient. Title IX liability is based on the recipient's response to actual knowledge of harassment or abuse, not just the occurrence. Liability requires a response of \"deliberate indifference.\" The private right of action under Title IX allows for legal remedies for victims of sex discrimination. The Court has interpreted Title IX to imply a private right of action for victims of sex discrimination, providing legal remedies for damages. Two Supreme Court decisions, Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District and Davis v. Monroe County, set out the requirements for establishing liability under Title IX for sexual abuse or harassment. The Supreme Court decisions Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District and Davis v. Monroe County established an institution's liability under Title IX for damages due to sexual abuse or harassment. Liability is based on the institution's \"deliberate indifference\" in responding to such conduct, not strict liability for a teacher's actions. The Supreme Court decisions Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District and Davis v. Monroe County established an institution's liability under Title IX for damages due to sexual abuse or harassment. Liability is based on the institution's response to \"actual\" knowledge of the discrimination being deliberately indifferent, not strict liability for a teacher's actions. The Supreme Court established in Gebser that a school is only liable under Title IX for sexual harassment if their response to known discrimination is deliberately indifferent, not for the misconduct itself. Liability is based on the institution's failure to act adequately in response to misconduct, regardless of the severity of the conduct. In Gebser, the Supreme Court established that an institution is only liable under Title IX for sexual harassment if their response to known discrimination is deliberately indifferent, regardless of the severity of the conduct. The Court relied on the statute's administrative enforcement provision to infer legislative intent regarding Title IX liability. The Court in Gebser relied on the statute's administrative enforcement provision to infer legislative intent regarding Title IX liability, noting that agencies can suspend or cut funds to a recipient for violating Title IX only after providing notice and an opportunity for voluntary compliance. The Court in Gebser determined that compliance with Title IX cannot be secured by voluntary means, requiring actual notice to an appropriate person for liability in a private right of action. Liability under Title IX arises when a school official responds with deliberate indifference to such notice. The Court found that liability under Title IX only occurs when a school official responds with deliberate indifference to actual notice of a violation. This standard is similar to the one found in case law under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 regarding claims of a municipality's failure to prevent violations of federal rights. The Court held that a school district cannot be held liable under Title IX for a teacher's sexual harassment of a student without actual notice and deliberate indifference, citing a high standard of deliberate indifference similar to case law under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The Supreme Court ruled that a school district cannot be held liable under Title IX for a teacher's sexual harassment of a student without actual notice and deliberate indifference, which requires more than just unreasonableness in responding to harassment. Under Davis, a recipient's response to harassment must be \"clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances\" to be considered deliberate indifference. The standard requires more than just unreasonableness in the response to sexual abuse or harassment, the recipient must be clearly unreasonable. Therefore, a funding recipient is not liable under Title IX if it responds in a manner that is not clearly unreasonable. Additionally, the Court's standard also requires other threshold showings from the plaintiff. A funding recipient is not liable under Title IX if it responds to sexual abuse or harassment \"in a manner that is not clearly unreasonable.\" The Court's standard requires a plaintiff to establish other threshold showings to prevail in a Title IX suit for damages, both before and after proving \"deliberate indifference.\" Before proving \"deliberate indifference,\" the plaintiff must show that an appropriate person at the funding recipient had actual knowledge of discrimination. Before proving \"deliberate indifference,\" a plaintiff must establish that an \"appropriate person\" at the funding recipient had \"actual knowledge of discrimination.\" This person should have the authority to address the discrimination and take corrective measures on behalf of the recipient. Failure to show this may result in the dismissal of a Title IX claim for damages related to sexual harassment or abuse. The Gebser standard defines an \"appropriate person\" as someone with the authority to address discrimination and implement corrective measures. There are disagreements among circuits regarding what constitutes \"actual\" notice and who qualifies as an \"appropriate person.\" Additionally, the Supreme Court's liability standard for student-to-student harassment requires a plaintiff to show that the funding recipient had \"substantial control\" over the harasser and the situation. The Supreme Court's liability standard for student-to-student harassment requires a plaintiff to show that the funding recipient had \"substantial control\" over the harasser and the situation, along with proving the severity and pervasiveness of the harassment. The Supreme Court's liability standard for student-to-student harassment requires a plaintiff to show that the funding recipient had \"substantial control\" over the harasser and the situation. The recipient may be liable for deliberate indifference if the harasser is under the school's disciplinary authority, emphasizing the recipient's authority to take remedial action against the harassment. The harassment must take place in a context subject to the school district's control. The Court in Davis emphasized the recipient's authority to take \"remedial action\" against harassment, requiring that the harassment must take place in a context subject to the school district's control. The plaintiff must show that the conduct is severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, undermining the victims' educational experience and denying equal access to resources and opportunities. The Court in Davis emphasized the severity of harassment, requiring that it must be severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, undermining victims' educational experience and denying equal access to resources and opportunities. The conduct's impact on the victim's education depends on various factors, including the ages of the individuals involved and the number of individuals. Additionally, evidence of a decline in grades can indicate a potential link between the harassment and the victim's education. The Court in Davis emphasized that harassment must be severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive to affect the victim's education. Evidence of a decline in grades can show a potential link between the harassment and education. Harassment under Title IX is actionable when it denies equal access to educational programs, but a single instance, even if severe, may not have a systemic effect. The Supreme Court's Gebser and Davis decisions establish that a school will be liable under Title IX for damages for sexual abuse or harassment only if it acted with \"deliberate indifference\" in its response to known discrimination. Deliberate indifference is considered an extremely high standard to meet. Lower federal courts have varied in their interpretations of the evidence required to prove a Title IX claim for damages related to sexual abuse or harassment of a student. Some courts have applied a \"hostile environment\" analysis similar to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act in cases of teacher-to-student harassment. Some courts interpret Gebser and Davis for Title IX claims of teacher-to-student harassment using a \"hostile environment\" analysis similar to Title VII. Other courts focus on elements like \"actual\" notice, \"appropriate person\" response, and \"deliberate indifference\" by the funding recipient. For student-to-student harassment claims, additional considerations apply. Federal courts of appeals vary in their interpretation of Title IX claims, particularly regarding the requirements for proving sexual harassment or assault between students. Key factors include the severity and pervasiveness of the harassment, the denial of equal access to resources, and the recipient's control over the harasser. Federal courts of appeals vary in their interpretation of Title IX claims, particularly regarding the evidence required to prove sexual harassment or assault between students. The plaintiff must show that the funding recipient had \"actual\" notice of the discrimination, not just that they should have known about it. Failure to satisfy any element may result in dismissal of a Title IX claim. Under Gebser, a plaintiff must show that the funding recipient had \"actual\" notice of discrimination, not just that they should have known about it. The standard questions what type of allegations reported to a school give rise to \"actual\" notice, such as knowledge of a substantial risk of abuse or specific allegations of harassment. If a school is notified of a perpetrator's previous acts of sexual harassment or abuse, it may constitute notice. Federal courts differ on questions of actual notice in cases of sexual harassment or abuse. Some courts differentiate between notice of a teacher's abuse versus notice of student harassment. The standard applied to evaluate actual notice determines if a claim can proceed. In cases of sexual harassment or abuse, federal courts vary on the standard for determining actual notice, which can impact whether a claim can proceed. In a specific case, the Eleventh Circuit found that complaints from two students about the same teacher were sufficient to alert the principal to the possibility of sexual assault on a third student. The Eleventh Circuit found that complaints from two students about the same teacher were sufficient to alert the principal to the possibility of sexual assault on a third student, emphasizing the similarity between the reports alleging multiple instances of sexual misconduct. The court held that these reports raised a triable issue regarding the principal's actual notice of a pattern of harassment. In Baynard v. Malone, the Fourth Circuit found that the school principal did not have \"actual\" notice of a sixth grade teacher sexually abusing a student, despite prior reports of molestation. The evidence showed that the principal had met with a former student who reported being sexually molested by the teacher before the plaintiff started sixth grade. Despite prior reports of molestation, the school principal did not have \"actual\" notice of a sixth-grade teacher sexually abusing a student. The evidence revealed that the principal had been warned about the teacher's behavior by a former student and another teacher, as well as witnessing concerning behavior with the plaintiff in the teacher's lap. The school principal was informed by another teacher and the school librarian about inappropriate behavior of a teacher with a student, but there was no evidence to prove that the principal was aware of the abuse. The court found the principal's behavior inappropriate but stated there was no evidence to prove the principal was aware of the student abuse. The Title IX claim was dismissed due to lack of actual notice of the abuse. Different courts have varying interpretations of what constitutes \"actual\" notice in such cases. Courts vary in defining \"actual\" notice for Title IX liability in cases of sexual abuse or harassment. The Supreme Court requires notice to be given to an official with authority to address discrimination. Federal appellate case law emphasizes the importance of notifying the appropriate person for Title IX liability. Courts require notice to be given to an official with authority to address discrimination for Title IX liability. Federal appellate case law focuses on determining if the individual had the ability to address misconduct or represented the funding recipient in a high enough capacity. In Title IX liability cases, federal courts struggle to define who qualifies as an \"appropriate person\" to address discrimination within a school setting, leading to varying interpretations among different courts. Some federal courts struggle to define who qualifies as an \"appropriate person\" to address discrimination in schools, with varying interpretations on whether a principal can take corrective action in cases of alleged discrimination. In a Title IX case alleging sexual abuse by a fourth grade teacher, the Fourth Circuit ruled that a school principal was not considered an \"appropriate person\" to initiate corrective measures due to lacking authority over teacher decisions. The court ruled that a principal supervising and evaluating teachers may not be considered an \"appropriate person\" in cases of sexual abuse or harassment. The principal lacked authority to hire, fire, transfer, or suspend teachers, and engaging directly in such misconduct would disqualify them as an \"appropriate person.\" In the San Antonio Independent School District case, the Fifth Circuit ruled that a school official who sexually abuses a student cannot be considered an \"appropriate person,\" even if they would typically be one. The case involved a vice principal who later became principal and sexually abused a student for several years. Despite having corrective authority to address harassment, the court found it unlikely that the official would report his own behavior. The Fifth Circuit ruled that a school official who sexually abuses a student cannot be considered an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX. The court found it unlikely that the official would report his own behavior, rejecting the argument that the abuse should be treated as an official action of the school district for liability purposes. The court concluded that allowing damage awards in such circumstances would not accomplish the goals of Title IX. The Fifth Circuit ruled that a school official who sexually abuses a student cannot be considered an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX for liability purposes. The court emphasized that allowing damage awards in such cases would not accomplish the goals of Title IX. Federal courts of appeals in the higher education context analyze whether university employees like college deans or athletics directors are \"appropriate persons\" for Title IX private right of action based on their ranking and responsibilities. In Title IX cases, the determination of who qualifies as an \"appropriate person\" for liability purposes is crucial. Court analyses focus on the individual's position in the university hierarchy, responsibilities related to handling harassment allegations, and authority to address misconduct. However, simply having evidence of these factors may not always be sufficient to establish someone as an \"appropriate person.\" For instance, in Ross v. University of Tulsa, campus security officers were deemed not to be appropriate persons for the university to have notice of on-campus sexual assault. In Ross v. University of Tulsa, the Tenth Circuit ruled that campus security officers were not considered \"appropriate persons\" for the university to have notice of on-campus sexual assault, despite their mandatory reporting and participation in investigations. The court in Ross v. University of Tulsa ruled that campus security officers were not considered \"appropriate persons\" for the university to have notice of on-campus sexual assault, despite their mandatory reporting and participation in investigations. The court also rejected the argument that officers' participation in investigations of campus violence made them \"appropriate persons.\" It is unlikely that a school's Title IX Coordinator will categorically constitute an \"appropriate person,\" as courts' analyses vary on who may be considered as such. The determination of an \"appropriate person\" under Title IX will depend on specific characteristics and evidence, as seen in court decisions like Gebser. A plaintiff must prove \"actual notice\" to an appropriate person and deliberate indifference in the response. Federal appellate courts have set a standard of acting \"clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances.\" To prove discrimination under Title IX, a plaintiff must show that the funding recipient acted with deliberate indifference in response, meaning their actions were clearly unreasonable given the circumstances. Courts require more than just a failure to respond or negligence. Liability is not avoided by simply attempting to remedy the harassment. The nature of the allegations, knowledge of the recipient, and actions taken are all considered in these analyses. In cases of Title IX discrimination, a school must address harassment to avoid liability for \"deliberate indifference.\" Courts analyze the nature of the allegations, the recipient's knowledge, and their response to determine if it was clearly unreasonable. Evidence of deliberate indifference includes a lack of response to actual notice of harassment or abuse. In cases of Title IX discrimination, liability for \"deliberate indifference\" arises when a recipient fails to respond to actual notice of sexual harassment or abuse. This can be seen in a lack of investigation or disciplinary actions despite repeated reports of harassment. Federal case law shows varying analyses on what constitutes a deficient response amounting to deliberate indifference. Federal case law reflects divergent analyses on whether a response constitutes deliberate indifference to sexual harassment or abuse. The Fifth Circuit ruled in Doe v. Dallas Independent School District that despite a deficient response, it did not meet the high bar for deliberate indifference. The Fifth Circuit ruled in a case involving a school district's response to sexual abuse allegations, finding that despite evidence of a deficient response, it did not amount to deliberate indifference. The plaintiffs alleged that a teacher had sexually abused male students over four years, but the school's actions were deemed insufficient, including failure to report to authorities and lack of monitoring or training for the teacher. The court found that despite evidence of a deficient response to sexual abuse allegations involving a teacher, the school's actions did not amount to deliberate indifference. The principal failed to report the allegation to Child Protective Services, did not monitor or train the teacher further, but did interview the student, speak with his mother, and warn the teacher about the consequences if the allegations were true. The court concluded that these actions were not inadequate in response to the student's allegation. The court found that despite evidence of a deficient response to sexual abuse allegations involving a teacher, the school's actions did not amount to deliberate indifference. The principal interviewed the student, spoke with his mother, and warned the teacher about the consequences if the allegations were true. The Eleventh Circuit highlighted serious deficiencies in the school's response to similar allegations, leading to a different legal conclusion. The court found that the school's response to sexual harassment complaints involving a teacher was deficient. Despite being aware of a possible pattern, the principal only obtained written statements and failed to take further action. The school's response was deemed not deliberately indifferent. The court criticized the school's response to sexual harassment complaints involving a teacher, noting that the principal failed to notify the investigative unit about the repeated allegations against the same teacher. The court found the school's actions inadequate and not reasonably responsive to the situation. The court criticized the school's response to sexual harassment complaints involving a teacher, noting that the principal failed to notify the investigative unit about the repeated allegations against the same teacher. The court found the school's actions inadequate and not reasonably responsive to the situation. The obtained statements from the complaining students and informed the unit of the sexual misconduct allegations, while omitting material details. Failure to institute corrective measures could constitute deliberate indifference. Some courts of appeals have addressed allegations of deliberate indifference not directly covered by previous court decisions. In Simpson v. University of Colorado, Boulder, the Tenth Circuit addressed allegations of deliberate indifference by the university in failing to provide adequate training or guidance despite an obvious need. The football program's staff selected players to host high school recruits, leading to allegations of sexual assault during a recruiting visit. The court highlighted evidence of prior sexual assaults during football recruitment and by football players, including a rape two months before the plaintiffs were assaulted. The university had been advised by the local district attorney to take action. The court emphasized prior sexual assaults during football recruitment and by players, including a rape of a female student by a university football player. The university was advised to make changes to its recruiting program, but the head coach resisted reforms. Player-hosts lacked guidance on appropriate behavior, as noted by the court. The court highlighted the lack of guidance for player-hosts on appropriate behavior, despite evidence of prior sexual assaults during recruiting visits. The head coach had knowledge of these incidents but did not make changes to the program, leading to a triable issue of deliberate negligence. The court found evidence of prior assaults during recruiting visits, lack of program changes to prevent future incidents, and an unsupervised player-host program, leading to a triable issue of deliberate indifference. Title IX enforcement involves fact-intensive determinations on deliberate indifference by funding recipients. Federal case law shows fact-intensive determinations on deliberate indifference regarding evidence needed to prove deliberate indifference by a funding recipient under Title IX. Title IX is enforced by federal agencies providing funding to educational programs, with termination or suspension of federal funds as the ultimate sanction for violations. In an administrative enforcement context, violation of Title IX can lead to termination or suspension of federal funds, rather than legal damages to a student. Federal agencies issue regulations and orders to enforce the statute and monitor compliance with Title IX. Two agencies have prominent roles in enforcing Title IX. The Secretary of Education (ED) is responsible for enforcing Title IX regulations for educational programs that receive federal assistance, playing a lead role in ensuring compliance with the statute. The Department of Education enforces Title IX regulations for educational programs receiving federal assistance, coordinating with the Attorney General for implementation and enforcement across the executive branch. The Civil Rights Division and OCR collaborate in enforcing Title IX, with OCR having primary responsibility for enforcement against recipients. The Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division and OCR collaborate with the Attorney General to enforce Title IX regulations for educational institutions receiving federal assistance. OCR has primary responsibility for enforcing the statute directly against recipients through complaint investigations and compliance reviews. ED has regulations implementing Title IX for all levels of educational institutions that receive federal assistance, prohibiting exclusion or denial of benefits. Title IX regulations apply to educational institutions at all levels receiving federal assistance, prohibiting sex-based discrimination. Schools must designate a Title IX Coordinator and establish grievance procedures for prompt resolution of complaints. Title IX regulations require educational institutions to designate a Title IX Coordinator and establish grievance procedures for resolving complaints of sex-based discrimination. OCR enforces Title IX through periodic reviews, investigations of complaints, and seeking informal resolution for violations found. OCR enforces Title IX by ensuring recipients of federal funds comply with requirements and investigating complaints of violations. If violations are found, informal resolution through a resolution agreement is sought, with the possibility of more formal enforcement measures if needed. Title IX and ED regulations do not directly address sexual harassment, but OCR has issued guidance documents interpreting Title IX in the administrative context. The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights enforces Title IX by ensuring compliance with federal funding requirements and investigating complaints. They may seek informal resolution through a resolution agreement or more formal enforcement measures if violations are found. Title IX and ED regulations do not directly address sexual harassment, but OCR has issued guidance documents interpreting Title IX in the administrative context, which includes defining responsibilities for educational institutions regarding sexual harassment allegations. The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights enforces Title IX by ensuring compliance with federal funding requirements and investigating complaints. They may seek informal resolution through a resolution agreement or more formal enforcement measures if violations are found. Title IX and ED regulations do not directly address sexual harassment, but OCR has issued guidance documents interpreting Title IX in the administrative context, which includes defining responsibilities for educational institutions regarding sexual harassment allegations. The analysis for assessing a school's Title IX liability for harassment differs from Supreme Court case law on private rights of action for damages for sexual abuse or harassment. ED applies a constructive notice requirement for a school's Title IX responsibility to respond, while the Supreme Court requires \"actual notice\" to \"an appropriate person\" in suits for damages. ED has set baseline standards for schools to comply with Title IX, while the Supreme Court only finds liability for a school's response if it is \"clearly unreasonable.\" The Supreme Court has set standards for school liability under Title IX, requiring a \"clearly unreasonable\" response to result in liability. In contrast, the Department of Education holds schools responsible for sexual harassment under Title IX if a teacher commits misconduct within their employment scope. OCR's 1997 guidance document states that sexual harassment of students by school employees, students, or third parties is prohibited by Title IX. In 1997, OCR released a guidance document stating that sexual harassment of students by school employees, students, or third parties is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. The guidance outlined two types of sexual harassment: quid pro quo harassment and hostile environment harassment. The 1997 guidance document by OCR stated that sexual harassment of students by school employees, students, or third parties is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX. It outlined two types of sexual harassment: quid pro quo harassment and hostile environment harassment, which can limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from an education program. The 1997 Guidance explained liability for quid pro quo and hostile environment harassment by school employees. It also addressed liability for sexual harassment by other students or third parties creating a hostile environment. A school may be liable for harassment by employees if they act with apparent authority or are aided in carrying out the harassment due to their position. In the case of sexual harassment by students or third parties, a school could be liable if a hostile environment exists in its programs or activities, if the school knew or should have known of the harassment, and if the school fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. Title IX does not hold schools responsible for the actions of students but does make them responsible for their own discrimination by failing to address harassment once they are aware of it. The 1997 OCR Guidance holds schools accountable for failing to address harassment once they are aware of it. The Supreme Court's 1998 Gebser ruling established liability for school districts only when they have actual knowledge of harassment allegations by an appropriate person. In 1998, the Supreme Court ruled in Gebser that a school district is liable for harassment by a teacher only if it has actual knowledge of allegations and responds with deliberate indifference. In Davis the following year, the Court added that a plaintiff suing for damages for sexual harassment by a student must show the conduct was severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive. In addition to actual knowledge and deliberate indifference, a plaintiff suing for damages for sexual harassment by a student must show the conduct was \"severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\" to deny equal access to educational opportunities. The Court in Gebser distinguished between actions leading to Title IX liability for damages and administrative requirements imposed by federal agencies. Agencies have the authority to enforce requirements that fulfill Title IX's mandate. Title IX liability for damages in a private right of action and administrative requirements imposed by federal agencies in enforcing the statute. Agencies can enforce requirements that fulfill Title IX's mandate, even if they do not define discrimination under the statute. This allows agencies to require compliance and rescind funding for violations, even if they may not lead to liability in a private suit for damages. The Supreme Court decisions set the standard for liability in Title IX damages suits alleging sexual harassment. The Department of Education (ED) issued guidance reaffirming its position on school responsibilities under Title IX, including notice and vicarious liability. The liability standard imposed by the Supreme Court for Title IX sexual harassment is emphasized in ED's guidance documents. The Department of Education (ED) issued guidance on school responsibilities under Title IX, emphasizing the liability standard for sexual harassment. The 2001 OCR Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance document addresses the distinct standards for Title IX violations in damages suits compared to administrative enforcement. The 2001 OCR Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance document reaffirmed the standards for Title IX violations in damages suits, distinct from administrative enforcement, applying to all federally funded educational institutions. The OCR guidance on Title IX regulations applies to all federally funded educational institutions, including universities. Schools must have grievance procedures for resolving complaints of sexual harassment promptly and equitably. Failure to do so constitutes a violation of Title IX. When sexual harassment occurs, institutions must take prompt and effective action to end the harassment, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects. The OCR guidance on Title IX regulations requires educational institutions to promptly address and prevent sexual harassment to comply with Title IX. The 1997 and 2001 documents provide guidance on taking effective action to end harassment and prevent its recurrence. The 1997 and 2001 guidance documents from the ED explain how educational institutions should address and prevent sexual harassment to comply with Title IX regulations. The 2001 Guidance defines sexual harassment as \"unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature\" but moves away from specific labels, focusing on whether the harassment is severe enough to warrant action. The 2001 Guidance on sexual harassment under Title IX emphasizes that the key issue is whether the harassment denies or limits a student's participation in the school's program based on sex. It outlines two main types of harassment: quid pro quo and hostile environment. The 2001 Guidance on sexual harassment under Title IX outlines two main types of harassment: quid pro quo and hostile environment. Quid pro quo harassment involves a teacher or employee conditioning a benefit on a student's submission to unwelcome sexual conduct, while hostile environment harassment creates an environment that limits or denies a student's ability to participate in the school's program based on sex. Hostile environment harassment under Title IX involves conduct that limits or denies a student's ability to benefit from or participate in a school's program based on sex. This type of harassment is generally student-on-student and does not require a position of authority. Teachers and employees can also create a hostile environment. Hostile environment harassment under Title IX involves conduct that limits or denies a student's ability to benefit from or participate in a school's program based on sex. Student-on-student harassment is considered hostile environment harassment, while teachers and employees may also create a hostile environment. OCR evaluates all relevant circumstances to determine if harassment has occurred, including whether the conduct was welcome. The extent of a school's responsibility to address harassment by a teacher or employee depends on the context in which it occurs. The 2001 Guidance clarifies that a school's responsibility to address harassment by teachers or employees depends on whether the conduct limits a student's ability to benefit from a school program. If harassment occurs within the context of their job responsibilities, the school must take action to stop the discriminatory conduct. In cases of harassment by teachers or employees, a school is responsible for addressing the behavior that limits a student's ability to benefit from a school program, regardless of whether the school has notice of the behavior. Sexual harassment within the scope of an employee's job responsibilities can vary, with quid pro quo harassment clearly falling within this scope. In cases of sexual harassment, whether it occurs within an employee's job responsibilities depends on various factors. For quid pro quo harassment, it clearly falls within the scope of job responsibilities. The 2001 Guidance states that even if harassment is not within job responsibilities, it can still create a hostile environment if serious enough. Once a school is aware of the behavior, it must take action to stop and prevent the harassment. The 2001 Guidance states that harassment, even if not within job responsibilities, can create a hostile environment. Schools must take prompt and effective action to stop and prevent harassment once they are aware of it. Schools must take prompt and effective action to stop and prevent harassment once they are aware of it. If a school fails to address a hostile environment, it is in violation of Title IX and responsible for ending the harassment, preventing its recurrence, and remedying the effects for the student. In cases of harassment by a teacher or employee, schools are responsible even without notice. For sexual harassment by employees, students, or third parties, schools are deemed to have notice if a responsible employee knew or should have known about the harassment. A responsible employee is one with the authority to address harassment or report it to school officials. A school is in violation of Title IX if it knows or should know of a hostile environment due to sexual harassment and fails to take immediate corrective action. An employee with the authority to address harassment or report it to school officials is considered a responsible employee. A school is in violation of Title IX if it knows or reasonably should know of a hostile environment and fails to take immediate and effective corrective action, as explained in the 2001 Guidance. Immediate and appropriate steps should be taken to investigate and end any harassment, eliminate a hostile environment, and prevent future occurrences. The school must take effective steps to end harassment, eliminate a hostile environment, and prevent future occurrences. Prompt investigation is required for reports of harassment, regardless of formal complaints. Factors determine if a school should investigate harassment learned through other means. If allegations are confirmed, appropriate steps must be taken to resolve the situation. The 2001 Guidance emphasizes the need for schools to promptly investigate harassment reports and take appropriate steps to resolve the situation. Informal mechanisms may be used if agreed upon by both parties, but certain procedures like mediation are not suitable for cases like alleged sexual assault. Title IX rights must be interpreted consistently. The 2001 Guidance emphasizes the need for schools to promptly investigate harassment reports and take appropriate steps to resolve the situation. Informal mechanisms may be used if agreed upon by both parties, but certain procedures like mediation are not suitable for cases like alleged sexual assault. Title IX rights must be interpreted consistently, ensuring due process rights do not unnecessarily delay protections provided by Title IX to the complainant. In 2011, OCR issued a Dear Colleague Letter focusing on obligations under Title IX for schools addressing peer-to-peer harassment. In 2011, OCR issued a Dear Colleague Letter supplementing its 2001 Guidance on Title IX protections for complainants, focusing on peer-to-peer harassment and defining sexual harassment as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, including sexual violence. Sexual harassment, including sexual violence, creates a hostile environment in schools. Title IX requires immediate action to address and prevent such harassment. Title IX mandates schools to promptly address student-on-student harassment creating a hostile environment, even if it occurs off-campus. Schools must follow established procedures when handling complaints to prevent recurrence and mitigate effects on students. The Letter emphasized that schools must address off-campus harassment promptly and follow procedures for complaints. It clarified that criminal investigations do not exempt schools from conducting Title IX investigations into sexual harassment allegations. The Letter emphasized that schools must promptly address off-campus harassment and conduct Title IX investigations into sexual harassment allegations, regardless of ongoing criminal investigations. It instructed schools to not delay their own investigations and to take immediate steps to protect students during criminal investigations. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter emphasized the importance of promptly resuming and completing Title IX investigations after police fact-finding. It outlined key elements of grievance procedures for resolving sexual harassment complaints, including the use of a preponderance of evidence standard. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter emphasized the importance of promptly resuming and completing Title IX investigations after police fact-finding. It highlighted the need for a preponderance of evidence standard in school grievance procedures for sexual harassment complaints, contrasting with the previous \"clear and convincing\" standard. The 2011 Dear Colleague Letter emphasized the need for a preponderance of evidence standard in school grievance procedures for sexual harassment complaints, contrasting with the previous \"clear and convincing\" standard. The Letter also discouraged personal cross-examination in hearings and required schools to allow both parties to appeal findings or remedies. In response to schools' requests for compliance guidance, ED issued a 2014 Q&A document. The 2014 Q&A document provided specific instructions to schools on their obligations under Title IX regarding student-on-student sexual violence allegations. It clarified that schools must allow both parties to appeal findings or remedies. The 2014 Q&A guidance document clarified educational institutions' obligations under Title IX regarding student-on-student sexual violence. It emphasized the need for immediate investigation and appropriate action when sexual violence is suspected, highlighting that failure to address such cases promptly can create a hostile environment violating Title IX. Title IX requires schools to promptly address sexual violence allegations, protect complainants, and ensure their safety through interim steps before completing an investigation. The 2014 Q&A guidance document detailed the requirements of Title IX in creating a hostile-free environment and preventing recurrence of sexual violence. Title IX mandates schools to protect complainants and ensure their safety through interim steps upon receiving an allegation of sexual violence. The 2014 Q&A outlined the responsibilities of a school's Title IX Coordinator, the requirements for written grievance procedures, and the designation of responsible employees who must report allegations to the Coordinator. The 2014 Q&A outlined the elements required in a school's grievance procedures for sexual violence complaints and the responsibilities of responsible employees to report allegations to the Title IX Coordinator. It emphasized the need for thorough investigations and additional remedies beyond just disciplinary sanctions to address hostile environments and prevent recurrence. The 2014 Q&A emphasized the need for thorough investigations and additional remedies beyond disciplinary sanctions to address hostile environments and prevent recurrence of sexual violence on school campuses. It also highlighted that Title IX investigations do not require the same procedural protections and legal standards as criminal proceedings, even if a criminal investigation is ongoing. In Title IX investigations, schools must conduct their own investigation of student-on-student sexual violence, even if a criminal investigation is ongoing. The conclusion of a criminal investigation without charges does not affect a school's Title IX obligations. Schools are not required to conduct hearings for sexual violence allegations, and if they do, they cannot require the complainant to attend. OCR discourages schools from allowing parties to personally cross-examine each other as it may be traumatic or intimidating. In 2014, OCR discouraged schools from allowing parties to personally cross-examine each other in sexual violence cases, suggesting questions be submitted to a third party for screening. Schools developed procedures to comply with OCR guidance and increased oversight between 2011 and 2016. Between 2011 and 2016, schools implemented various procedures to ensure compliance with Title IX in response to guidance from the Department of Education. These procedures varied across educational institutions for investigating allegations of sexual harassment. Title IX allows ED to enforce sex-based discrimination rules, but public universities have due process protections. Students challenged disciplinary procedures in courts as unconstitutional. In the public university context, students facing disciplinary sanctions have challenged the Title IX procedures in state and federal courts as unconstitutional, arguing violations of the Due Process Clause. The Clause requires states to follow specific procedures when depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to observe certain procedures when depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property. It protects against the deprivation of certain \"property interests\" without due process, which are not created by the Constitution but arise from an independent source like state or federal law. To have a protected property interest in a government-created benefit, one must show a \"legitimate claim of misconduct.\" Property interests protected by the Due Process Clause arise from an independent source like state or federal law. To have a protected property interest in a government-created benefit, one must show a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\" originating from existing rules or understandings. When a state deprives an individual of liberty, due process must be afforded. Due process may be implicated when a person's reputation or integrity is at stake due to government actions. When a state deprives an individual of liberty, due process must be afforded, especially when a person's reputation or integrity is at stake due to government actions. Courts require state action altering legal status to constitute a deprivation of liberty, and the procedures required can vary. The Supreme Court in Matthews v. Eldridge outlined three factors to consider when deciding what process is due: the private interest affected, the risk of erroneous action, and the government's interest. The Supreme Court in Matthews v. Eldridge outlined three factors to consider when deciding what process is due before depriving individuals of a protected interest: the private interest affected, the risk of erroneous action, and the government's interest. Individuals with a protected interest are entitled to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before the state may deprive them of that interest. The Supreme Court in Matthews v. Eldridge emphasized that due process requires a \"meaningful opportunity to be heard\" before depriving individuals of a protected interest. The severity of the deprivation is a key factor in determining the necessary procedural protections, with stronger private interests requiring more formal procedures. In Matthews v. Eldridge, the severity of deprivation is crucial in determining required procedures. Stronger private interests necessitate more formal procedures. Goss v. Lopez focused on procedural due process in student discipline, ruling that public school students have a legitimate entitlement to education protected by due process. The Court ruled that public school students have a legitimate entitlement to education protected by due process. Students facing suspension must be given notice and a hearing, with more formal procedures required for longer suspensions or expulsions. Public universities must comply with the Due Process Clause as state actors. The Supreme Court clarified that public universities must adhere to constitutional standards when suspending or expelling students, while private universities are not bound by the same requirements. Students of public universities are assumed to have a constitutionally protectable property right in their enrollment, as ruled by federal courts of appeals. Federal courts have ruled that students of public universities have a constitutionally protectable property right in their enrollment, which includes liberty and/or property interests in their education. Due process requires public schools to provide students with notice of charges, evidence, and the opportunity to present their side to an unbiased decisionmaker. Federal courts have held that due process requires public schools to provide students with notice of charges, evidence, and the opportunity to present their side to an unbiased decisionmaker. Public universities have developed procedures to comply with OCR's guidance on responding to allegations of sexual harassment. Recent judicial rulings have addressed the constitutionality of disciplinary proceedings in cases of sexual misconduct, with courts issuing decisions on due process violations in Title IX investigations. Recent notable judicial rulings have addressed due process violations in Title IX investigations related to sexual misconduct. The rulings focus on claims such as inadequate notice of charges, lack of opportunity to confront witnesses, presence of biased decisionmakers, and unfair review processes during rehearing of allegations at public universities. Some judicial rulings addressed due process violations in Title IX investigations related to sexual misconduct. Challenges included lack of opportunity to confront witnesses, biased decisionmakers, and unfair review processes at public universities. Students accused of sexual misconduct claimed inadequate notice of charges. One type of legal challenge raised by students accused of sexual misconduct is the failure of public universities to adequately notify them of the charges, which can lead to a viable due process claim. Failure to provide timely notice of charges and a meaningful opportunity to prepare for a disciplinary hearing can lead to a viable due process claim. For example, a student accused of sexual misconduct was suspended for three years without being properly notified of the allegations, which the court ruled could be a due process violation. The student was suspended from the university for three years without proper notice of the sexual misconduct allegation, leading to a potential due process violation. Another case involved an accused student not being adequately informed of the charges against him, resulting in expulsion for misconduct related to incidents not initially mentioned. The school failed to provide proper notice of the charges against the student, leading to his expulsion for sexual misconduct related to incidents not initially mentioned. This lack of information hindered the student's ability to defend himself, resulting in a violation of his due process rights. The court found that the school violated the student's due process rights by not providing proper notice of the charges and withholding evidence in a disciplinary decision related to suspected sexual assault. The court ruled that the university violated the student's due process rights by withholding evidence in a disciplinary decision. The investigator failed to provide the report to the defendant, leading to a due process violation. Students have raised concerns about lack of cross-examination opportunities in disciplinary hearings. Courts have often rejected claims of denial of due process in school disciplinary hearings, noting that students' rights are not the same as criminal defendants. However, courts may entertain claims when students are denied the opportunity to challenge witness credibility on critical facts. Courts have often denied due process challenges in university adjudicatory proceedings, stating that students' rights differ from criminal defendants. However, courts may consider claims if students are unable to challenge witness credibility on crucial facts. Courts have often denied due process challenges in university adjudicatory proceedings, noting that the Due Process Clause does not guarantee the right to cross-examination in school disciplinary proceedings. In recent cases involving sexual harassment allegations, students challenged proceedings where accused students could only submit written questions to a panel chair, not directly to the complainant. Despite this, a due process challenge to the proceedings was rejected by the reviewing district court. The reviewing district court rejected a due process challenge to adjudicatory proceedings regarding sexual assault allegations. Similarly, the Sixth Circuit denied a due process challenge to a university's disciplinary hearing on sexual assault, where students could only submit written questions to the panel chair. The circuit court allowed students to submit written questions but not follow-up questions during disciplinary proceedings. The court found that the limited cross-examination satisfied the requirement for credibility issues, outweighing the burden on the school. The Fifth Circuit also rejected a due process challenge where students claimed they were unable to effectively cross-examine witnesses. The Fifth Circuit rejected a due process challenge to a university's disciplinary proceedings where students argued they were denied effective cross-examination. The court noted the decision was based on videos and a photo, not testimonial evidence. Credibility determinations have been crucial in due process challenges, with courts ruling in favor when necessary. The Sixth Circuit ruled in favor of a due process challenge where a university failed to provide cross-examination in a disciplinary hearing, leading to a suspension based solely on hearsay. The court emphasized the importance of allowing the accused to question their accuser in such proceedings. The court ruled in favor of a due process challenge where a university suspended a student based solely on hearsay without allowing cross-examination. The court emphasized the importance of assessing the demeanor of both the accused and the accuser in such cases to ensure due process. The court emphasized the need for a live hearing to assess the demeanor of the accused and accuser in cases where credibility is at issue, ensuring due process. The court emphasized the importance of a live hearing to assess credibility in cases of sexual misconduct allegations, ruling that a university's procedures without a hearing violated the accused student's right to due process. The court ruled that the university violated the accused student's right to due process by not allowing cross-examination in cases where credibility is at issue. The Sixth Circuit ruled that a university violated a student's due process rights by not allowing cross-examination in cases where credibility is at issue. The university's appeals board reversed a finding of sexual misconduct based on the alleged victim's account without giving the accused student a chance to cross-examine witnesses. The Sixth Circuit ruled that universities must allow cross-examination in cases involving credibility issues to uphold due process. Some students claim they were denied the chance to present exculpatory evidence, with courts evaluating such claims on a case-by-case basis. For example, a student alleged he couldn't present physical evidence in a sexual assault disciplinary hearing. In a lawsuit against a university, a student claimed he was denied the opportunity to present evidence at a sexual assault hearing, raising due process concerns. Students in disciplinary proceedings for sexual harassment have challenged biased decision-makers. Courts generally assume school panels are fair. Students in disciplinary proceedings for sexual harassment have challenged biased decision-makers, alleging that a decisionmaker was biased against them. Courts generally assume school panels are fair, but a plaintiff must provide evidence to overcome this presumption, such as showing statements or a pattern of bias. For example, a Fifth Circuit panel rejected a due process claim in a university disciplinary hearing for sexual assault due to a lack of evidence showing bias. The Fifth Circuit panel rejected a due process claim alleging bias in a university disciplinary hearing for sexual assault. The challengers failed to show how the integrity of the proceedings was undermined, as the investigator relied on photo and video evidence to render findings to the panel. The court rejected a due process claim of bias in a university disciplinary hearing for sexual assault. The investigator used photo and video evidence, and a university attorney advised the panel to draw their own conclusions. Evidence of bias in decisionmakers' behavior may lead to a due process challenge. The Sixth Circuit recently held that a student's due process claim was valid in a university disciplinary hearing for alleged sexual assault. One panel member acted as investigator, prosecutor, and judge, showing bias by making remarks to reduce the defendant's credibility. The court found bias in a university disciplinary hearing for alleged sexual assault, where a panel member acted as investigator, prosecutor, and judge. The member's remarks to reduce the defendant's credibility showed lack of impartiality. Claims of bias based on institutional pressures, like sexual assault training for university officials, have also been addressed in courts. Courts have addressed claims of bias in university disciplinary hearings, including cases where staff received unbalanced sexual assault training. One court rejected a due process claim, stating that raising awareness of sexual assault was a valid goal, despite concerns of bias against accused students. The court rejected the plaintiffs' claim of bias against accused students in university disciplinary hearings, stating that the belief of railroading students to appease the Department of Education was unsupported by evidence. Another court, however, allowed a due process claim by an expelled student alleging biased investigation and training materials for the panel deciding his case. The district court rejected a motion to dismiss a due process claim by an expelled student alleging biased investigation and training materials for the panel deciding his case. The court found that there may have been a due process violation as the panel may have been trained to ignore deficiencies in the investigation, potentially tipping the scales against the accused student. The court concluded that there may have been a due process violation due to alleged deficiencies in the investigation and official report. Federal district court cases have addressed allegations of unfair review processes for rehearing appeals in university disciplinary proceedings. In one case, a student was cleared of sexual assault but faced a new hearing because the university couldn't prove its case. In a district court case, a student cleared of sexual assault faced a new hearing ordered by the university. The court deemed this unfair and ruled in favor of the student, stating the allegations survived the university's motion to dismiss. Another case involved a suspended student challenging the validity of school procedures after being initially found not responsible for sexual misconduct but later deemed guilty after an appeal by the complainant. The school's actions at the administrative appeal stage were questioned. The suspended student challenged the school's procedures after being initially found not responsible for sexual misconduct but later determined guilty after an appeal. The school failed to provide sufficient notice, details of new accusations, names of appeal board members, notice of the meeting, and the student was not allowed to attend. The student was accused of assaulting and was not given proper notice or the opportunity to attend the appeal board's meeting. The appeals board reversed the initial determination without explanation or live testimony. The federal district court ruled that the school failed to provide a meaningful hearing. The school failed to provide the student with a meaningful hearing, leading to a federal court ruling against the university in a case where a student was expelled for sexual assault despite being found not responsible initially. The individual presiding over the appeal conducted off-the-record meetings with the accuser, leading to the student not receiving a fair defense. The presiding individual in the appeal conducted off-the-record meetings with the accuser, leading to the student being expelled without a fair defense. The court ruled that this procedural violation, along with a lack of notice of the allegations, constituted a due process violation. In September 2017, OCR withdrew the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter and 2014. In September 2017, OCR withdrew the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter and 2014 Questions and Answers document, citing procedural inadequacies and lack of notice of allegations as a due process violation. ED announced it would start the rulemaking process to clarify schools' responsibilities under Title IX, relying on the 2001 Guidance in the meantime. A new Question and Answer document was issued to address sexual misconduct during this period. The ED announced it would continue to rely on the 2001 Guidance for Title IX while issuing a new Question and Answer document on addressing sexual misconduct. Schools may resolve complaints through mediation and allow appeals by the party found guilty of misconduct. A notice of proposed rulemaking in 2018 could change schools' responsibilities in responding to sexual harassment allegations. The ED issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in 2018 that could significantly change schools' responses to allegations of sexual harassment under Title IX. The proposal aims to narrow the definition of sexual harassment, require \"actual notice\" of harassment, only consider deliberate indifference as a violation, and impose new procedural requirements. The proposed regulation aims to redefine sexual harassment under Title IX, requiring \"actual notice\" of harassment and only considering deliberate indifference as a violation. It also imposes new procedural requirements reflecting concern for due process in investigations. The proposed regulation redefines sexual harassment under Title IX, including quid pro quo, hostile environment, and sexual assault. It establishes a higher threshold for hostile environment harassment compared to past definitions. The proposed regulations under Title IX would establish a higher threshold for hostile environment harassment compared to past definitions, redefining sexual harassment to align with the Supreme Court's 1999 Davis decision. The proposed regulations under Title IX would establish a higher threshold for hostile environment harassment by redefining sexual harassment to align with the Supreme Court's 1999 Davis decision, focusing on conduct that effectively denies equal access to education programs based on sex. The proposed regulations under Title IX would redefine hostile environment harassment as conduct that is severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, effectively denying equal access to education programs. This differs from past practice by removing the \"constructive notice\" trigger for school responsibilities in cases of harassment. The proposed regulations under Title IX would establish that a school has a duty to respond to allegations of sexual harassment only when it has \"actual knowledge,\" defined as notice of harassment to a school's Title IX Coordinator or official with authority to institute corrective measures. Respondeat superior or constructive notice will not be used to impute knowledge to a school. The proposed regulations under Title IX require schools to respond to sexual harassment allegations only when there is \"actual knowledge,\" defined as notice to the Title IX Coordinator or an official with authority to take corrective action. The regulations reject imputing knowledge based on respondeat superior or constructive notice. The threshold for triggering a school's obligations aligns with the standards set by the Supreme Court in Gebser and Davis. The proposed regulations under Title IX require schools to respond to sexual harassment allegations only when there is \"actual knowledge,\" defined as notice to the Title IX Coordinator or an official with authority to take corrective action. The regulations align the threshold for triggering a school's obligations with the standards set by the Supreme Court in Gebser and Davis, compelling schools to respond only to sexual harassment within their \"education program or activity.\" The proposed regulations under Title IX require schools to respond to sexual harassment allegations only when there is \"actual knowledge,\" defined as notice to the Title IX Coordinator or an official with authority to take corrective action. This contrasts with past ED guidance which required schools to respond to harassment that occurs within their education program or activity. The proposed regulations only require a school to respond in a manner that is not \"deliberately indifferent\" to sexual harassment. The proposed regulations under Title IX only require a school to respond to sexual harassment allegations if there is \"actual knowledge\" and not be \"deliberately indifferent.\" Deliberate indifference is defined as a response that is clearly unreasonable in light of the known circumstances. The proposal outlines situations where a school is provided a safe harbor from a finding of deliberate indifference. The proposal outlines three situations where a school is provided a safe harbor from a finding of deliberate indifference under Title IX regulations. The first situation is when a formal Title IX complaint is made, outlining grievance procedures that schools must follow. The second situation is when a school has actual knowledge of harassment due to multiple complainants, requiring the Title IX Coordinator to file a complaint. The proposal provides safe harbor from deliberate indifference under Title IX regulations in three situations. The first is when a formal complaint is made, outlining grievance procedures for schools to follow. The second is when a school has actual knowledge of harassment from multiple complainants, requiring the Title IX Coordinator to file a complaint. Additionally, in higher education institutions without a formal complaint, offering supportive measures to the complainant can prevent a finding of deliberate indifference. The proposed regulations under Title IX provide safe harbor from deliberate indifference in three situations: when a formal complaint is made, when a school has actual knowledge of harassment, and when supportive measures are offered to the complainant in higher education institutions without a formal complaint. Deliberate indifference is avoided if these requirements are followed. The proposed regulations under Title IX outline requirements for schools to respond to sexual harassment, including not being deliberately indifferent. Schools must take action if they have actual knowledge of harassment, including potentially removing the accused individual on an emergency basis after a risk analysis. Accused individuals must be given notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision. The proposed regulations under Title IX require schools to conduct a risk analysis before removing an individual due to an immediate threat. Accused individuals must be provided with notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision, ensuring due process protections during the investigation. The proposed regulations under Title IX require schools to provide students with due process protections during the fact-finding process and determination of culpability for sexual harassment allegations. Schools must investigate formal complaints, but if the alleged conduct does not constitute sexual harassment or did not occur within a school's program or activity, the complaint must be dismissed. Upon receipt of a formal Title IX complaint, schools must provide written notice to relevant parties of the allegations and available grievance procedures. A school must provide written notice of sexual harassment allegations, including grievance procedures and sufficient details for a response. Grievance procedures must treat complainants and respondents equitably, providing remedies for complainants and due process protections for respondents before imposing sanctions. The proposal requires schools to provide remedies for complainants and due process protections for respondents in cases of sexual harassment. It also mandates an objective evaluation of evidence and prohibits credibility determinations based on one's status. The proposed procedures for handling cases of sexual harassment under Title IX require an objective evaluation of evidence, unbiased individuals in the investigation process, a presumption of innocence for respondents, and details on possible sanctions, remedies, standard of evidence, appeals, and supportive measures. The proposed regulations for handling cases of sexual harassment under Title IX require schools to place the burden of proof on themselves, allow equal opportunity for both parties to present evidence, and provide supportive measures. The proposed regulations for handling cases of sexual harassment under Title IX require schools to provide equal opportunity for both parties to present evidence and witnesses, allow parties to have their choice of advisor, provide written notice of hearing details, and conduct a live hearing where parties can ask each other and witnesses relevant questions. The proposed regulations for handling cases of sexual harassment under Title IX require institutions of higher education to provide a live hearing where parties can ask each other and witnesses relevant questions, including cross-examination by the party's advisor. Schools must allow for cross-examination via technology if requested, and decisionmakers cannot rely on statements not submitted to cross-examination. Both parties must have an equal opportunity to review evidence directly related to the allegations. The proposed regulations for handling cases of sexual harassment under Title IX require a live hearing where parties can ask each other and witnesses relevant questions, including cross-examination by the party's advisor. Decisionmakers must not rely on statements not submitted to cross-examination, and both parties must have an equal opportunity to review evidence directly related to the allegations. These requirements depart from past guidance by requiring a quasi-judicial proceeding for institutions of higher education. The proposed regulations for handling cases of sexual harassment under Title IX depart from past guidance by requiring a live hearing with cross-examination for institutions of higher education. Decisionmakers must not be the investigator or Title IX Coordinator, and schools can use either a preponderance of evidence. The new regulations for handling sexual harassment cases under Title IX require a live hearing with cross-examination, prohibit the use of a single investigator as the decisionmaker, and allow schools to choose between a preponderance of evidence or clear and convincing standard. Schools must use the same standard of evidence for complaints against students, employees, and faculty, and may choose to allow appeals of decisions. The new regulations for handling sexual harassment cases under Title IX require a live hearing with cross-examination, prohibit the use of a single investigator as the decisionmaker, and allow schools to choose between a preponderance of evidence or clear and convincing standard. Schools must use the same standard of evidence for complaints against students, employees, and faculty, and may choose to allow appeals of decisions. Additionally, schools may facilitate an informal resolution process with written consent from both parties before reaching a final determination. The antidiscrimination mandate of Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs, but does not specifically address sexual abuse, harassment, or assault. Federal courts have determined relief for individual victims in the absence of statutory guidance. Federal courts have largely determined relief for individual victims of sexual abuse or harassment under Title IX, despite the statute's silence on the issue. The Supreme Court created a remedial scheme for a private right of action, speculating on how Congress would have addressed the issue if there had been an express provision in the statute. Federal agencies have issued guidelines on responsibilities due to the sparse statutory language. The Court noted that interpreting Title IX involves speculation due to Congress's silence on the issue. Federal agencies have issued guidelines on educational institutions' responsibilities under Title IX. Congress has the discretion to clarify the standard for private suits and administrative enforcement. This could include defining specific conduct that constitutes a violation of the statute regarding sexual abuse or harassment. Congress has the discretion to clarify the standard for private suits and administrative enforcement under Title IX, including defining specific conduct for sexual abuse or harassment violations. Amendments could address liability differences in various educational settings and between teachers and students. Congress could modify legal standards for private suits and administrative enforcement under Title IX, including defining specific conduct for sexual abuse or harassment violations. This could involve distinguishing between harassment by teachers and students, amending liability differences in educational settings, and directing federal agencies to alter their enforcement of the statute."
