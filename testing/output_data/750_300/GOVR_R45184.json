Factors contributing to this decrease include reduced teen sexual activity and increased use of contraceptives. The influence of any single factor is not fully known. The decline in the teen birth rate is attributed to reduced teen sexual activity and increased use of contraceptives. Other factors, such as social and economic trends, may also play a role. Congress remains interested in the issue due to its high social and economic costs. Disparities in teen birth rates persist among different racial and ethnic groups and across states. Disparities in teen birth rates persist among racial and ethnic subgroups and states, with high social and economic costs. The teen birth rate refers to live births per 1,000 teen girls aged 15-19, while the teen pregnancy rate includes pregnancies per 1,000 teen girls aged 15-19, including live births, abortions, and fetal losses. This report accompanies CRS Report R45183, Teen Pregnancy: Federal Prevention Programs, discussing Congress's support for preventing teen pregnancy. The teen birth rate is the number of live births per 1,000 teen girls aged 15-19, while the teen pregnancy rate includes pregnancies per 1,000 teen girls aged 15-19, encompassing live births, abortions, and fetal losses. Birth data cover nearly all births in the US, while pregnancy data are estimates based on various reporting systems and surveys. The CDC and Guttmacher Institute publish these rates annually, typically a year or two after the data is collected. The CDC and Guttmacher Institute publish teen pregnancy rates annually, typically a year or two after birth data is reported. In 2018, there were approximately 3.8 million births in the US, with 4.7% to teenagers aged 15-19. The CDC tracks birth rates by age and other characteristics of birth mothers. In 2018, there were approximately 3.8 million births in the United States, with 4.7% to teenagers aged 15-19. The U.S. teen birth rate declined by 72% from 1991 to 2018, dropping from 61.8 to 17.4. The teen birth rate in the United States declined by 72% from 1991 to 2018, with a significant drop in recent years. In 2018, the rate reached a historical low of 17.4, marking a substantial decrease from previous decades. The CDC began tracking subgroup data for teens in the 1960s, showing higher birth rates for older teens compared to younger teens. In 2018, birth rates for 15- to 17-year-olds and 18- to 19-year-olds were the lowest on record. Repeat teen births have also declined significantly, with a nearly 54% decrease from 2004 to 2015. In 2018, birth rates for 15- to 17-year-olds and 18- to 19-year-olds were the lowest on record. Repeat teen births declined by nearly 54% from 2004 to 2015, with the highest prevalence among Hispanic youth. Teen mothers have been less likely to be married in recent years, with the birth rate for unmarried teens aged 15 to 19 dropping from 31.0 per 1,000 in 2010 to 16.0 per 1,000 in 2018. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by race and ethnicity, with Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens having double the rate of non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander teens. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by race and ethnicity, with Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens having double the rate of non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander teens. The teen birth rate by race and Hispanic origin decreased for all groups from 1991 to 2018, with a slight increase in 2007. From 2007 to 2018, teen birth rates decreased significantly for all racial and ethnic groups. The rates fell by 55% for non-Hispanic white teens, 40% for non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens, 58% for non-Hispanic black teens, 73% for non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander teens, and 65% for Hispanic teens. While non-Hispanic black and Hispanic teens had a greater decline in birth rates compared to white teens, their rates still decreased significantly. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by state and territory, with Massachusetts having the lowest rate at 7.2 and Arkansas the highest at 30.4. A map shows rates for 50 states, the District of Columbia, and three territories. Eighteen states had rates below 15 per 1,000 teens aged 15 to 19. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by state and territory. Eighteen states had rates below 15 per 1,000 teens aged 15 to 19, while ten states had the highest rates of 25 or higher. Rates for the territories ranged from 19.3 in Puerto Rico to 34.4 in Guam. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by state and territory. Ten states had the highest rates (25 or higher): Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia. The rates for the territories ranged from 19.3 in Puerto Rico to 34.4 in Guam. Teen birth rates have decreased in each state or territory by between 19% and 67% from 2007 to 2018. Rates in rural areas remain higher than in urban areas, and the U.S. teen birth rate is higher than that of most other industrialized countries. The U.S. teen birth rate has declined over time but remains higher than most other industrialized countries. Economic conditions and income inequality may contribute to the high teen birth rate in the United States. Research suggests that contraceptive use among teens may also play a role. Research suggests that economic conditions and income inequality within and between countries may contribute to the high teen birth rate in the United States. The use of contraceptives among teens appears to be greater in other developed countries compared to the United States. Multiple trends have driven down U.S. teen pregnancy and birth rates, primarily due to improved contraceptive use over the 1990s through 2007. Research indicates that the decline in teen pregnancy rates from the 1990s through 2007 was primarily due to improved contraceptive use, including an increase in condom use, the use of multiple contraception methods, and a decrease in foregoing contraception. The risk of pregnancy also decreased among younger teens aged 15 to 17 due to decreased sexual activity. More recent declines in teen pregnancy rates have been attributed to the increasing use of contraceptives among sexually active teens from 2007 through 2014. The risk of teen pregnancy decreased among younger teens aged 15 to 17 due to decreased sexual activity. Recent declines in teen pregnancy rates have also been attributed to the increasing use of contraceptives among sexually active teens from 2007 through 2014. Economic and social factors may influence teen behaviors regarding abstinence or contraceptive use. Broad economic and social variables may influence teen behaviors, such as abstaining from sex or using contraceptives. Factors like expanded educational opportunities for women and improvements in contraceptive technology drive behavioral changes. Observers suggest that the long-term decline in teen birth rates may be linked to the recession that began in 2007, as teenagers become more cautious during economic downturns. The long-term decrease in teen birth rates is attributed to factors like economic downturns and increased knowledge about sex and birth control through social media and the internet. The recession that began in 2007 may have made teenagers more cautious, but the decline in teen births continued even after the recession. The decline in teen birth rates in the 1990s is attributed to factors like social media and internet use, with some suggesting that shows like 16 and Pregnant influenced teens to use contraceptives. Teen pregnancy prevention programs may also have played a role in the decline. Teen birth rates declined even after the peak of the show 16 and Pregnant. Observers suggest that teen pregnancy prevention programs, supported by federal funding, may have contributed to the decrease in teen birth rates. Teen pregnancy has significant costs for families and society, with teenage parents facing lower education levels and higher poverty rates. Teenage parents have lower education levels and higher poverty rates, with nearly one-third of teen girls dropping out of high school due to pregnancy or parenthood. About 7 out of 10 teen mothers living independently are below the poverty level, and over 60% receive public benefits within the first year of their child's birth. This lack of education reduces their economic self-sufficiency and increases the likelihood of teenage pregnancy. Teen parents face economic challenges due to lower education levels and poverty rates, which can also contribute to the increased likelihood of teenage pregnancy. Teen mothers often come from disadvantaged backgrounds, with parents who have lower education levels and are more likely to receive public welfare benefits. Teen parents often come from disadvantaged backgrounds, with parents who have lower education levels and are more likely to receive public welfare benefits. Teen sexual activity can increase the risk of STIs, leading to long-term health issues. Adolescents aged 15 to 19 have high rates of STIs. Teen childbearing can also negatively impact the offspring of teen parents, with children of teenage mothers having poorer outcomes. Teen childbearing has negative impacts on the offspring of teen parents, leading to poorer outcomes such as chronic medical conditions, lower school readiness scores, poor academic performance, early childbirth for females, and incarceration for males. Additionally, it has societal implications, with one study estimating cost savings to public programs by avoiding unintended pregnancies. One study estimated cost savings to public programs by avoiding unintended teen pregnancies, with a total savings of $4.4 billion from 1991 to 2015. This analysis considered savings to Medicaid for labor and delivery, postpartum care, and infant care. The analysis estimated a total savings of $4.4 billion from 1991 to 2015 due to decreased teen fertility rates. This includes cost savings to Medicaid for labor and delivery, postpartum care, and infant care, as well as benefits from programs like TANF, SNAP, and WIC. Further research on the impacts of reduced teenage pregnancy and childbearing is needed."
