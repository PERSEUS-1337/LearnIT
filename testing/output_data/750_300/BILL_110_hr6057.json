Congress finds that Americans cherish healthy oceans and wildlife, feel a strong moral responsibility to protect marine ecosystems, including the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas in Alaska, which provide habitat for a variety of wildlife species. These ecosystems and the wildlife they support are vital. The Beaufort and Chukchi Seas in Alaska are home to a variety of wildlife, including endangered bowhead whales, beluga whales, polar bears, threatened eiders, walrus, seals, and fish. These ecosystems are crucial for the survival of Alaska Native peoples and are undergoing significant changes due to climate change. The Arctic is experiencing significant changes due to climate change, impacting vital sea ice habitats for species like polar bears, walrus, and seals. In 2007, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing polar bears as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act due to their reliance on sea ice for hunting seals. The polar bear relies on sea ice to hunt seals, its main food source. The Department of the Interior missed a deadline to decide on Endangered Species Act protections for polar bears in 2008. Additionally, they proceeded with oil and gas leasing in the Chukchi Sea Lease Sale 193 area. On February 6, 2008, the Department of the Interior approved oil and gas leasing in the Chukchi Sea Lease Sale 193 area, a polar bear habitat spanning 29.4 million acres offshore Alaska. In April 2008, a court ruled that a decision on listing polar bears under the Endangered Species Act must be made by May 15, 2008. The United States Geological Survey projected that future sea ice changes could lead to a significant decline in the polar bear population by the middle of the 21st century, with potential extirpation in Alaska. The agency noted that current models may underestimate the decline in Arctic sea ice, suggesting a more severe impact on polar bears than previously thought. The United States Geological Survey projected a significant decline in the polar bear population in Alaska due to future sea ice changes. The assessment of future polar bear status may be conservative as current models underestimate the decline in Arctic sea ice. Global warming is the major threat to polar bears, but potential oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas poses additional risks to marine life. There is currently no effective means to recover spilled oil in the harsh environment of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. The Chukchi Seas pose additional risks to polar bears and marine life in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas due to potential oil and gas development. There is currently no effective means to recover spilled oil in this harsh environment, especially during periods of solid and broken ice. The Minerals Management Service's leasing plan includes offering millions of acres in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, overlapping with vital polar bear habitat. The Minerals Management Service warns of significant risks to polar bears and marine life from potential oil spills in the Chukchi Sea, impacting whales and walruses as well. The Minerals Management Service warns of significant risks to polar bears, whales, and walruses from potential oil spills in the Chukchi Sea. Onshore industrial development activities supporting offshore oil and gas development can also harm important habitats and disturb denning polar bears and other wildlife. Tribal governments oppose offshore oil and gas development in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas due to threats to subsistence resources, public health, and cultural survival. Prohibition on leasing in Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act prohibits leasing in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas until missing information on marine and coastal ecosystems is identified by the National Research Council. The National Research Council must identify missing information on marine ecosystems in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea before leasing can occur. This information should focus on the impact of climate change on living marine resources. The National Research Council must identify missing information on marine ecosystems in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea related to climate change impacts on oil and gas activities. The National Research Council must assess the impacts of oil and gas activities on plant and animal species, marine environments, and Alaskan Native communities, including ongoing environmental and cultural studies. The National Research Council evaluates the impacts of oil and gas activities on plant and animal species, marine environments, and Alaskan Native communities, including ongoing and completed environmental, public health, and cultural studies. A report identifying missing information and evaluating the adequacy of studies is submitted to Congress. The National Research Council evaluates missing information and ongoing studies related to the impacts of oil and gas activities on plant and animal species, marine environments, and Alaskan Native communities. Recommendations for additional research are made if necessary, especially concerning the endangered status of polar bears. The polar bear is listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act, and critical habitat is designated. The Secretary performs an oil spill response gap analysis for proposed and existing arctic oil. The Secretary conducts an oil spill response gap analysis for proposed and existing arctic oil operations, setting a standard for lessees to ensure 85% of spilled oil can be contained. The standard set for lessees requires at least 85% of spilled oil to be mechanically recovered and removed from the environment within 30 days, regardless of ice conditions or season. The 85 percent recovery standard must be achieved before issuing leases or approving exploration and production plans. Oil spill response gap for each lease must ensure 85 percent oil recovery in any ice condition or season. The response gap for activities under each lease ensures 85 percent oil recovery in any ice condition or season, implements procedures to close areas to oil and gas activity, and establishes requirements for oil spill prevention systems. The Secretary establishes requirements for installing, operating, and maintaining oil spill prevention systems to improve safety and minimize spill risks. The National Research Council report ensures that oil and gas exploration in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea Planning Areas does not harm wildlife or subsistence activities, with identified mitigation measures in place. The curr_chunk discusses the identification of mitigation measures to avoid risks and establish their efficacy in response to oil spills. It defines terms like 'response gap' and 'response gap analysis' related to spill response systems. The curr_chunk defines 'response gap analysis' as calculating response operating limits of spill response systems for environmental factors and assessing local response capabilities and oil spill contingency plans. The curr_chunk involves assessing conditions that could limit a response in a specific location, considering local response capabilities, oil spill contingency plans, and the cumulative impact of various factors on system limits. The curr_chunk involves assessing factors that may limit achieving the oil spill recovery standard, considering frequency, duration, and timing of occurrence using environmental and climate data. The curr_chunk involves quantifying the percentage of time local conditions exceed spill response system limits to achieve the oil spill recovery standard."
