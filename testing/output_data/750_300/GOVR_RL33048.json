    "content": "Since September 11, 2001, Congress and government agencies have been focused on federal regulations and programs related to hazardous chemicals security to prevent terrorist attacks. The goal is to maintain the availability of these chemicals for commercial use while reducing the risk of exploitation by terrorists in various transportation sectors. Congress is reviewing federal policies related to marine transportation of hazardous chemical cargo to establish or increase penalties for criminal or terrorist activities around ports and marine vessels. In response to the evolving security environment, Congress is considering federal policies regarding hazardous chemical cargo transportation by sea. Legislation such as H.R. 2651 and S. 1052 aim to enhance penalties for criminal or terrorist activities around ports and vessels, as well as improve general port security. This report offers an overview of hazardous chemical marine transportation in the United States, highlighting the associated risks. Congress is likely to seek a broader understanding of hazardous chemical marine shipments and efforts to secure them. This report provides an overview of hazardous chemicals marine transportation in the United States, focusing on the risks in the homeland security context, federal statistics on shipments, and relevant maritime security regulations. It raises security policy issues. The report summarizes federal statistics on hazardous chemical marine shipments in U.S. waters, including shipment volumes and port locations. It discusses relevant U.S. maritime security regulations and raises security policy issues associated with these shipments, such as risk uncertainties and security resources. The report concludes with a discussion on marine chemicals security as part of the nation's overall chemical security strategy, focusing on a limited set of acutely hazardous chemical cargoes. This report focuses on marine shipments of acutely hazardous chemical cargoes that could pose a catastrophic hazard to the general public. It does not address other maritime security hazards like petroleum products or biological agents. The report specifically looks at threats from chemical releases during marine transport, excluding attacks targeting economic activity or the environment. The report focuses on threats to the general public from chemical releases during marine transport, highlighting the potential dangers of hazardous chemical cargo being targeted by terrorists due to their toxicity and combustibility. The sensitive nature of the topic and legal restrictions limit the detailed statistics provided in the report. Marine shipments of hazardous chemical cargo are potential terrorist targets due to their toxicity and combustibility, posing a serious threat to human life and infrastructure. Protecting these shipments is crucial for U.S. homeland security strategy. The protection of hazardous chemical shipments passing through U.S. waterways and ports is vital for homeland security, as they are potential terrorist targets. While no marine vessel carrying hazardous chemicals has been used in a terrorist attack on civilians, accidents involving such shipments have shown their impact on nearby communities. Foreign terrorists have targeted other types of marine vessels overseas, and intelligence suggests they may target hazardous chemical shipments as well. Accidents involving hazardous chemical shipments in the U.S. and abroad have shown their potential impact on nearby communities. Intelligence indicates that terrorists may have the interest and capability to execute attacks on hazardous chemical shipping in the United States. Major accidents involving these shipments are rare but have resulted in some of the deadliest industrial incidents ever recorded, such as the 1917 explosion of the Mont-Blanc in Halifax, which killed over 1,900 people and injured over 4,000. Major accidents involving hazardous chemical shipments are rare but have resulted in some of the deadliest industrial incidents ever recorded. For example, the 1917 explosion of the Mont-Blanc in Halifax killed over 1,900 people and seriously injured over 4,000 others. The 1947 explosion of two cargo ships carrying ammonium nitrate and sulfur in Texas City, Texas killed nearly 600 people and injured another 3,500. Improved safety practices and vessel construction have prevented similar disasters in the past 60 years. Incidents involving chemical marine shipments have caused evacuations of coastal populations in recent years. Examples include a 1985 fire on the Ariadne in Somalia, a 1987 accident on the Cason near Spain, and a 1999 fire on the Multitank Ascania off the coast of Scotland. These incidents did not result in serious casualties. In recent years, incidents involving chemical marine shipments have led to evacuations of coastal populations. Examples include a 1987 accident on the Cason near Spain and a 1999 fire on the Multitank Ascania off the coast of Scotland. While no serious casualties occurred, emergency responders were highly concerned about public safety. During the 1990s, international combatants and domestic terrorists attempted to release chemicals from land-based manufacturing and storage facilities in foreign war zones like Croatia. Attacks targeted plants producing various hazardous chemicals near population centers. In the United States, criminals also tried to release chemicals during the late 1990s. In the late 1990s, criminals attempted to release chemicals from plants producing pesticides and a pharmaceutical factory using hazardous chemicals near population centers in the United States. Terrorists have targeted marine vessels, including a foiled Al-Qaeda plot in June 2002 and the successful attack on the oil tanker Limburg in October 2002. In June 2002, Moroccan authorities foiled an Al-Qaeda plot to attack U.S. and British warships, and possibly commercial vessels, in the Straits of Gibraltar. In October 2002, the oil tanker Limburg was successfully attacked off the Yemeni coast by a bomb-laden fishing boat. Foreign governments have expressed concerns about terrorist groups commandeering hazardous chemical vessels and crashing them into ports. The Department of Homeland Security in the United States is consistently concerned about the security of chemical infrastructure, including chemical tanker ships. The Department of Homeland Security in the United States is concerned about the security of chemical infrastructure, including chemical tanker ships. The Homeland Security Council has included terrorist attacks on ships carrying hazardous chemical cargoes in U.S. ports as a hazard scenario for national preparedness standards. The President's National Strategy highlights the challenge of protecting high consequence cargo in the port system. The DHS is concerned about the security of hazardous marine cargo, specifically LNG tankers, which are considered potential terrorist targets. Risks associated with LNG shipments are real and can never be entirely eliminated. Sandia National Laboratories identified LNG tankers as vulnerable to terrorist attacks. The risks associated with LNG shipments are real and can never be entirely eliminated. A 2004 report by Sandia National Laboratories considered potential terrorist attacks on LNG tankers as credible and possible, identifying various vulnerabilities to attacks. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 directs federal homeland security activities to focus on terrorist attacks that could cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties comparable to those from the use of a weapon of mass destruction. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) focuses on terrorist attacks with catastrophic health effects or mass casualties comparable to those from a weapon of mass destruction. Hazardous chemical cargo on commercial marine vessels can pose a catastrophic hazard to the public if accidentally released or combusted, leading to poisoning, asphyxiation, chemical burns, or thermal burns. Numerous federal standards identify potentially hazardous chemicals. The Department of Transportation (DOT) regulates hazardous materials transportation under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975. Various federal standards identify potentially hazardous chemicals that could pose risks such as poisoning, asphyxiation, chemical burns, or thermal burns to the public. The act empowers the Secretary of Transportation to designate certain materials as \"hazardous.\" The Department of Transportation (DOT) regulates hazardous materials transportation under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975. The act empowers the Secretary of Transportation to designate materials as \"hazardous\" based on potential risks to health, safety, and property during transportation. The DOT classifies hazardous materials in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.101, grouping them by type of hazard but not necessarily by relative degree. The DOT classifies hazardous materials in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.101, grouping them by type of hazard but not necessarily by relative degree. Additionally, the DOT requires shippers of certain \"highly hazardous\" cargo to develop security plans in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.8. Appendix 1 outlines the DOT's regulations for shippers of \"highly hazardous\" cargo, including radioactive materials, explosives, poisonous materials, bulk hazardous liquids or gases, bulk hazardous solids, packaged hazardous materials, CDC-regulated agents, and materials requiring placarding. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels carrying hazardous cargo, including bulk liquids or gases, bulk solids, packaged materials, CDC-regulated agents, and placarded materials. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels carrying hazardous cargo, including bulk liquids or gases, bulk solids, packaged materials, CDC-regulated agents, and placarded materials. Coast Guard regulations identify hazardous cargo in various sections of the federal code, including special requirements for vessels carrying certain hazardous materials. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels carrying hazardous cargo, including bulk liquids or gases, bulk solids, packaged materials, CDC-regulated agents, and placarded materials. Special requirements for vessels carrying certain hazardous materials are prescribed in 46 C.F.R., which includes bulk solid hazardous materials, bulk liquid hazardous materials in barges, bulk liquid, liquified gas, or compressed gas hazardous materials carried by ship, and regulations for incompatible chemicals in parcel tankers or container ships. Additionally, hazardous marine cargoes are identified through regulation of waterfront facilities handling these cargoes. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels carrying hazardous cargo, including bulk liquids or gases, bulk solids, packaged materials, CDC-regulated agents, and placarded materials. Hazardous marine cargoes are identified through regulation of waterfront facilities handling these cargoes. Coast Guard regulations list hundreds of different hazardous materials, but do not rank them by degree of hazard. EPA regulates stationary facilities handling potentially hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act. The EPA regulates stationary facilities handling hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act. Congress passed P.L. 101-549 in 1990, amending the CAA to require facilities with specified quantities of hazardous substances to file risk management plans (RMPs). These plans summarize the potential threat from large releases and include off-site consequence analysis for worst-case accidents. The Clean Air Act Amendments require facilities with specified quantities of hazardous substances to file risk management plans (RMPs). These plans must include off-site consequence analysis for worst-case accidents and measures to prevent releases and mitigate damage. Hazardous substances include listed chemicals like chlorine and ammonia, as well as others designated by the EPA based on health and environmental risks. The Clean Air Act Amendments directed the EPA to designate chemicals posing risks based on health and environmental criteria. The EPA listed acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, and volatile liquids. High explosives were removed from the list in 1998, and flammable substances used as fuel were excluded in 2000. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous materials was amended in 2000 to exclude flammable substances used as fuel. Most hazardous materials on DOT and Coast Guard lists do not pose a catastrophic health hazard to the public due to limited quantities or physical properties. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous materials excludes flammable substances used as fuel and focuses on chemicals with the greatest potential consequences to the general public. These chemicals are considered among the most hazardous on land and may pose similar risks if transported on water. This report uses the EPA/RMP chemicals for marine cargo hazard analysis. The report uses EPA/RMP chemicals for marine cargo hazard analysis, which are among the most hazardous on land. The EPA/RMP list aligns with DOT and Coast Guard hazardous materials lists, with exceptions for radioactive materials and explosives. Army Corps of Engineers is also mentioned. The report utilizes EPA/RMP chemicals for marine cargo hazard analysis, aligning with DOT and Coast Guard lists. Exceptions include radioactive materials and explosives, which account for less than 0.3% of U.S. hazardous marine cargo. Excluding these classes is unlikely to impact policy conclusions. EPA/RMP chemicals are broadly classified as acutely toxic or flammable. Ammonia is an acutely toxic and potentially explosive chemical used in various industries, including fertilizer manufacturing and livestock feed production. Ammonia is a toxic gas used in fertilizer manufacturing and livestock feed production. It can quickly reach harmful concentrations in the air, causing skin and respiratory irritation. Methane, on the other hand, is a heating fuel and industrial feedstock with no inherent toxicity. Methane is used as a heating fuel and industrial feedstock. It is not inherently toxic but can cause asphyxiation in high vapor concentrations and may be explosive in confined spaces. Methyloxirane is used in manufacturing polyurethane foam, solvents, and other industrial products. Methane is flammable and explosive when mixed with air in confined spaces. Methyloxirane is a toxic liquid used in manufacturing various industrial products, causing irritation to eyes, skin, and respiratory tract upon exposure. It reacts explosively with certain substances. An uncontrolled release of chemicals on the EPA/RMP list can have varying effects on exposed populations. Vapors are highly flammable and react explosively with certain substances. Uncontrolled release of chemicals on the EPA/RMP list can have varying effects on exposed populations. EPA considers all RMP chemicals above threshold quantities to be hazardous to the public, warranting special regulatory treatment. The EPA considers all RMP chemicals above threshold quantities hazardous to the public, warranting special regulatory treatment. The list of hazardous chemicals was developed for land facilities, but their health hazards may differ if released over water. Certain chemicals dissolve in water. The EPA/RMP list of hazardous chemicals was developed for facilities on land, but the health hazards may differ if released over water. Some chemicals dissolve or sink in water, reducing the hazard in a marine incident. Others evaporate quickly or create a larger hazard zone in a marine release compared to a land release. Some chemicals dissolve or sink in water, reducing the hazard in a marine incident. Others evaporate quickly or create a larger hazard zone in a marine release compared to a land release. Further research is needed to understand the relative marine hazards of specific chemicals. The Army Corps of Engineers maintains statistics of marine commerce in U.S. waters, which can be used to estimate marine shipping volumes of EPA/RMP chemicals. Further research is needed to understand the marine hazards of specific chemicals. The Army Corps of Engineers maintains statistics on marine commerce in U.S. waters, which can help estimate the shipping volumes of EPA/RMP chemicals. In 2003, over 48 million tons of these chemicals passed through U.S. waters. In 2003, over 48 million tons of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals were transported through U.S. waters, accounting for 2% of total waterborne cargo tonnage. This data is based on the Army Corps of Engineers' statistics on marine commerce. The hazardous materials on the EPA/RMP list are included primarily because their chemical properties make them hazardous to human health. Evaluating potential public impacts of terrorist marine cargo hazards should consider both size and number of shipments, as well as the overall volume of hazardous materials in a shipment. In 2003, over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waterways, with the total number of shipments and average cargo tons per shipment summarized in Figure 1. The volume of hazardous materials in a marine shipment is crucial in evaluating potential public impacts of a terrorist attack, as a larger number of shipments could increase the overall terrorist risk. In 2003, over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waterways. The EPA regulations specify minimum threshold quantities for risk planning between 500 and 20,000. The data in Figure 1 show the total number of shipments and average cargo tons per shipment in 2003 for these hazardous chemicals. In 2003, marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals varied in volume, with average shipment volumes generally exceeding the 20,000 pound threshold. EPA regulations set minimum threshold quantities for risk planning between 500 and 20,000 pounds. The dashed line in Figure 1 represents the upper threshold of 20,000 pounds, above which off-site consequence plans are required for facilities on land. The average waterborne shipment volume of hazardous chemicals in Figure 1 exceeds the EPA/RMP 20,000 pound threshold, requiring off-site risk management plans. Each category of chemicals was typically shipped hundreds to thousands of times in 2003, with no clear distinction between \"low frequency\" and \"high frequency\" hazardous cargoes. Various marine vessels transport hazardous cargo in bulk. In 2003, hazardous chemicals were shipped between several hundred and several thousand times. Different types of marine vessels transport hazardous cargo in bulk, each with distinct characteristics based on the cargoes they carry. Cargo vessel characteristics are crucial for security, affecting vulnerability to accidents or attacks. EPA/RMP hazardous cargoes make up over 67% of shipments. Cargo vessel characteristics are crucial for security, determining vulnerability to accidents or attacks. In 2003, over 67% of EPA/RMP hazardous marine cargo was shipped in tankers or liquid chemical barges. Container ships, dry cargo barges, and other vessels carried the remaining 4%. Liquefied gas tankers are oceangoing ships designed to carry various types of liquefied gas cargo such as butane, propane, LNG, butadiene, and ammonia, all chemicals on the EPA/RMP list. Liquefied gas tankers carry various types of liquefied gas cargoes like butane, propane, LNG, butadiene, and ammonia, all chemicals on the EPA/RMP list. The tankers have large onboard tanks that are pressurized, refrigerated, and insulated to meet different cargo requirements. International shipping codes set strict standards for their construction and operation, ensuring the tanks are robust and resistant to impact damage. LNG tankers have robust cargo tanks built to withstand high pressures or low temperatures. They are double-hulled, providing greater structural integrity than most other ships, making them highly resistant to grounding and collision damage. LNG tankers have strong outer hull structures, providing high structural integrity against grounding and collision damage. They carry only LNG, unlike other liquefied gas tankers that may carry multiple cargoes, creating unique multi-chemical hazards. LNG tankers have capacities ranging from 25,000 m3 to 147,000 m3, with plans for new construction of 200,000 m3 capacity. (A cargo capacity of 200,000 m3 is equivalent to approximately 82,000 tons of LNG.) LNG tankers have capacities ranging from 25,000 m3 to 147,000 m3, with plans for new construction of 200,000 m3 capacity. These tankers are among the largest cargo vessels in the world. Chemical parcel tankers are versatile vessels designed to carry a wide range of liquid and chemical cargoes, including hazardous chemicals. They can carry 10 to 60 separate cargo tanks and have a total cargo capacity ranging from 3,000 to 50,000 tons. Chemical parcel tankers are versatile vessels designed to carry a wide range of liquid and chemical cargoes, including hazardous chemicals. They typically have 10 to 60 separate cargo tanks and a total cargo capacity ranging from 3,000 to 50,000 tons. These tankers are governed by international construction standards. Chemical parcel tankers, like gas carriers, adhere to international construction standards with cargo tanks lined with stainless steel or specialized coatings. They have double bottoms or hulls to prevent contact between incompatible cargoes and can carry multiple hazardous chemicals simultaneously. Liquid chemical barges are shallow draft vessels designed to carry bulk liquid chemicals primarily in coastal regions and through inland waterways. These barges have multiple separate cargo tanks lined with stainless steel or special coatings and range in size from 700 tons to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity. Larger barges transporting hazardous chemicals are typically double-hulled. Liquid chemical barges are similar to parcel tankers, with multiple separate cargo tanks lined with stainless steel or special coatings. They range in size from 700 to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity. Larger barges transporting hazardous chemicals are typically double-hulled and self-propelled, while smaller ones may rely on tugboats for movement. Unpowered chemical barges on inland waterways are approximately 52 to 54 feet wide and up to 300 feet long, traveling in groups of two to eight barges per towboat. Liquid chemical barges on inland waterways are typically 52 to 54 feet wide and up to 300 feet long, traveling in groups of two to eight barges per towboat. These barges may be refrigerated, with insulated cargo tanks capable of carrying 1,250 to 1,500 tons of ammonia, propylene, or other refrigerated chemical products. Pressurized cargo tanks are also available for pressurized liquid cargoes. Liquid chemical barges on inland waterways are typically 52 to 54 feet wide and up to 300 feet long, with insulated cargo tanks capable of carrying 1,250 to 1,500 tons of ammonia, propylene, or other refrigerated chemical products. Pressurized cargo tanks are also available for pressurized liquid cargoes. Hazardous chemicals may be transported on conventional container ships in various ways. Large quantities of hazardous chemicals may be present in container ships at any time, which must be shipped in designated cargo areas. For example, the Jolly Rubino was carrying containers of vinyl acetate and other toxic chemicals when it caught fire off South Africa in 2002. The Jolly Rubino was reported to be carrying hazardous chemicals, including vinyl acetate and other toxic chemicals, when it caught fire off South Africa in 2002. Hazardous chemicals must be shipped in designated cargo areas aboard vessels, including container ships, general cargo ships, container barges, ferries, and other vessels. The public hazards associated with these chemicals on marine vessels are proportional to volume, and comparisons can be made with volumes in other modes of transportation and stationary storage facilities on land. Comparing volumes of hazardous chemicals on marine vessels, rail tank cars, and highway tanker trucks is informative. Hazardous cargo may be moved by all three modes sequentially. Rail tank cars can carry 50 to 90 tons, while containerized tanks on flatbed railcars can carry up to 70 tons per tank. Rail tank cars have a cargo capacity of 50 to 90 tons, while containerized tank cars on flatbed railcars can carry up to 70 tons per tank. Highway tanker trucks also transport hazardous cargoes, with a standard capacity ranging from 15 to 30 tons. Multiple tank cars can be carried simultaneously in rail shipments. EPA/RMP hazardous cargoes like anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, and LPG are commonly transported by highway tanker trucks. Table 2 summarizes the typical range of cargo tank capacity for marine, rail, and highway tankers that transport EPA/RMP chemicals such as anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, and LPG. Marine cargo tank capacity generally exceeds the capacity of a single rail or highway tanker truck by one or more orders of magnitude. Multiple tanks are usually found on liquefied gas tankers, chemical parcel tankers, and liquid cargo barges. Marine cargo tank capacity generally exceeds that of rail or highway tanker trucks by a significant margin. Comparing actual volumes shipped across different modes is challenging due to partial cargoes and multiple shipments involved. Many marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous materials are larger than individual rail or highway shipments. Based on data from Figure 1 and Table 2, marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous materials are often larger than land shipments. Facilities required to file risk management plans under the Clean Air Act must report their chemical storage volumes, which can be used to estimate the quantity of chemicals across all facilities. Facilities under the Clean Air Act must report chemical storage volumes for EPA/RMP chemicals, which are used to estimate quantities across all facilities. Comparing marine and land storage volumes for nine EPA/RMP chemicals shows marine shipments are often larger. Facilities report storage volumes for EPA/RMP chemicals under the Clean Air Act. Comparing marine and land storage volumes for nine chemicals shows marine shipments are typically larger. The chemicals include toxic and flammable substances like acrylonitrile, anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, ethylene, methyloxirane, oxirane, propene, sulfurdioxide, and vinyl chloride. The comparison results are summarized in Table 3. Table 3 summarizes the comparison between marine and land storage volumes of nine EPA/RMP chemicals. The average marine shipments for chemicals shipped in higher volumes were generally larger than the volumes stored at chemical plants. This reflects the practice of shipping higher volume cargo in larger vessels. The largest marine shipments were significantly larger. The average marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals were generally larger than volumes stored at chemical plants, reflecting the practice of using larger vessels for higher volume cargo. Marine shipments either start or end at U.S. ports, where hazardous cargo may be temporarily stored and transferred to rail or truck tankers. Port facilities serve as transportation hubs for hazardous cargo, either for temporary storage and transfer to rail or truck tankers, or for direct use in industrial processes. Some port facilities also produce hazardous cargo. Total marine shipments of EPA/RMP chemicals vary significantly from port to port, as do shipments of specific chemicals. Security hazards may be related to both the volume and specific type of chemicals being transported. Facilities in some ports handle more EPA/RMP chemicals than others, leading to significant variations in total marine shipments across ports. Examining the concentration of hazardous marine shipments in U.S. ports can help assess security risks. There are over 360 commercial ports in the U.S. with around 3,200 cargo and passenger handling facilities. In 2003, 113 ports shipped EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals, with the top 30 ports handling about 95% of these shipments. In the United States, there are over 360 commercial ports with around 3,200 cargo and passenger handling facilities. In 2003, 113 ports shipped EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals, with the top 30 ports handling about 95% of these shipments. The top 30 ports are listed in Table 4, along with the hazardous marine cargo categories shipped through each port. Additional hazardous cargoes may also be shipped in large volumes through a given port. In 2003, 22 EPA/RMP chemicals were shipped through the port of Baton Rouge in quantities exceeding 2,500 tons. Volumes of hazardous marine cargo in different ports are not related. Security concerns exist for all 83 ports handling EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals, not just the top 30 ports. An attack on a hazardous cargo vessel can have serious public consequences. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals in 83 ports may pose security concerns similar to those in the top 30 ports. Attacks on hazardous cargo vessels can have serious public consequences. The top 30 hazardous chemical ports are mainly in the Gulf of Mexico, with over half in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi. All ports except Huntington, WV, are coastal. No Great Lakes ports are included in the list. The top 30 hazardous chemical ports are mainly in the Gulf of Mexico region, with most located in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi. These ports handle a mix of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals, with LPG and ammonia being the most frequently shipped. LPG is a highly flammable gas, while ammonia is a toxic gas. The top 30 hazardous chemical ports in the Gulf of Mexico region mainly handle LPG and ammonia, which are flammable and toxic gases, respectively. The ports are listed in Table 4 based on EPA/RMP hazardous cargo volumes, with other key factors affecting terrorism risk in U.S. ports. The list of ports in Table 4 is based on EPA/RMP hazardous cargo volumes, but other key factors affecting terrorism risk in U.S. ports include DOT hazardous cargo shipments, non-chemical cargo shipping hazards, marine passenger traffic, hazardous materials sites, proximity to populations, port configuration, threat intelligence, and vulnerability assessments considered by the Department of Homeland Security in its Port Security Grant Program. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) considers various factors in its Port Security Grant Program, providing security enhancement grants to U.S. ports. For the FY2005 program, 66 ports were eligible to apply for grants based on a risk-based formula. The Coast Guard leads federal efforts in promoting U.S. maritime security. The Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for U.S. maritime security, overseeing vessel and port security. They track, board, and inspect commercial ships entering U.S. waters. A senior officer in each port ensures security and safety of vessels, waterways, and shore facilities. The Coast Guard has a special focus on ships carrying hazardous cargo. The Coast Guard oversees the security and safety of vessels, waterways, and shore facilities in each port. They have a special concern for ships carrying hazardous cargo and have regulations in place for their construction, operation, and cargo transfer. Compliance with these safety regulations can help mitigate damage from incidents like terrorist attacks. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has expanded maritime security regulations to distinguish between safety measures for accidents and security measures for terrorism. Compliance with safety regulations can help minimize damage from terrorist attacks by reducing cargo releases. The Coast Guard has expanded maritime security regulations post-9/11 to differentiate between safety and security measures. Area maritime security committees assess port vulnerabilities and create plans to address them, evaluating susceptibility to terrorist activities and potential use as weapons. The Coast Guard, along with area maritime security committees, assess port vulnerabilities and create plans to address them, focusing on marine targets' susceptibility to terrorist activities and potential use as weapons. These plans also detail how federal, state, and local resources will be deployed to prevent terrorist attacks, including key marine assets and other vital port infrastructure. The Coast Guard, under jurisdiction, assesses port vulnerabilities and key marine assets for security. They have used these assessments to enhance security and develop maritime security standards under the MTSA. The Coast Guard also played a leading role in creating the ISPS Code for safe ship and port operations. The ISPS Code, established by the International Maritime Organization, sets standards for safe ship and port operations. It requires ships and certain port facilities worldwide to create security plans approved by their national government, outlining security measures for different threat levels. Ships and ports must have security plans for three threat levels (normal, medium, high), designate a security officer, deploy security equipment, monitor access, and ensure security communications. Coast Guard reviewed and approved plans for over 9,000 vessels by July 1, 2004, and conducted on-site inspections six months later. The Coast Guard reviewed and approved security plans for over 9,000 vessels by July 1, 2004, and conducted on-site inspections six months later. They also completed security assessments of the nation's 55 strategic ports and took specific measures to prevent terrorist attacks on hazardous chemicals vessels. The Coast Guard has evaluated vulnerabilities of marine tankers to different types of attacks and is assessing inland barges carrying dangerous cargoes for blast consequences. They require U.S. bound vessels and barges carrying hazardous materials to comply with security measures. The Coast Guard is assessing inland barges carrying dangerous cargoes for blast consequences and requires vessels to report information before arrival. They determine security risks and may board vessels to ensure secure transit. The Coast Guard assesses potential security risks posed by vessels entering U.S. waters and takes actions to ensure secure transit, including boarding vessels and posting armed sea-marshals. Ships carrying hazardous cargo may be escorted by Coast Guard patrol boats in a moving security zone while transiting a harbor and while moored at a terminal. Vessels carrying hazardous cargo may also be required to provide roving patrols on deck and at the terminal. The Coast Guard enforces security measures for vessels carrying hazardous cargo in harbors, including patrol boats and roving patrols. Non-commercial traffic may be banned in high threat areas, and Maritime Safety and Security Teams can be deployed when needed. The Coast Guard aims to improve maritime domain awareness to distinguish suspicious activities. The Coast Guard enforces security measures for vessels carrying hazardous cargo in harbors, including patrol boats and roving patrols. Security Teams nationwide can perform security operations at any port area when needed. Vessels calling at U.S. ports are required to have AIS transponders for tracking movement. The Coast Guard has installed AIS receivers at ten port areas and plans to install them at all remaining U.S. ports. The Coast Guard is developing joint harbor operations centers (JHOCs) in U.S. harbors to track and monitor vessel traffic using various equipment such as AIS, radar, voice communications, closed-circuit television, and intelligence databases. The Coast Guard is establishing Joint Harbor Operations Centers (JHOCs) equipped with various tracking equipment to monitor vessel traffic in harbors. They will also collaborate with federal security agencies and local law enforcement to coordinate responses to threats. Additionally, the Coast Guard is engaging the public through its \"Waterways Watch\" program to report suspicious activities and working on enhancing security credentials for mariners and landside workers in partnership with the Transportation Security Administration. The Coast Guard is working with the public to identify and report suspicious activity. They are also developing more secure credentials for mariners and landside workers in partnership with the Transportation Security Administration. NOAA maintains hazardous material emergency response capabilities. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) maintains hazardous material emergency response capabilities, including the CAMEO program, which provides response recommendations for over 6,000 chemicals and an electronic mapping program for first responders and emergency planners. The CAMEO program, developed by NOAA and EPA, provides response recommendations for over 6,000 chemicals and predicts the movement of chemical gases in the atmosphere. NOAA has also linked its air dispersion models to support emergency planners and first responders, conducting risk assessments on hazardous chemicals stored or shipped through U.S. ports. NOAA, along with the DHS, coordinates federal chemicals emergency response through the Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center, providing custom products for dispersion modeling predictions. Industry groups are also promoting security for hazardous marine cargo. The Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center offers custom products for all-hazards dispersion modeling predictions and assessments. Industry groups support the security of hazardous marine cargo, with input from the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) for evaluating hazardous materials regulations. CTAC formed a Subcommittee on Hazardous Cargo Transportation Security in October 2002 to assess vulnerability and promote industry security awareness. The American Waterways Operators created a model vessel security plan to prevent terrorist attacks on the inland waterway system. The American Waterways Operators, in collaboration with the Coast Guard and Army Corps of Engineers, developed a vessel security plan to prevent terrorist attacks on the inland waterway system. The plan includes a list of high consequence cargoes. The Chemical Distribution Institute inspects and issues audit reports on chemical and LPG tankers, tank storage terminals, and container ships carrying hazardous cargo. The Chemical Distribution Institute (CDI) inspects and issues audit reports on chemical and LPG tankers, tank storage terminals, and container ships carrying hazardous cargo. The American Chemistry Council has also issued transportation security guidelines for the chemical industry. Securing hazardous chemicals against terrorist attacks is a priority in U.S. homeland security policy, especially for maritime security of chemical cargo. The maritime security of chemical cargo is a priority in U.S. homeland security policy. Despite new measures since 9/11, policy issues related to hazardous marine cargo still need Congressional attention. Key concerns include risk uncertainty, resource availability, and security effectiveness in addressing terrorism risks. The concerns surrounding hazardous marine cargo include risk uncertainty, resource availability, and security effectiveness in addressing terrorism risks. Significant uncertainties exist in threat, vulnerability, and consequence factors related to terrorism risk. Debate exists regarding the threat posed by terrorists targeting ships in U.S. waters, with some experts believing public concern is overstated and should not impede maritime trade. Some experts believe public concern about terrorist threats to hazardous chemical shipping is overstated and should not hinder maritime trade, while others argue that terrorists have the desire and capability to attack such shipping. The uncertainty of threat intelligence and the evolving goals of attackers make the basis of these conclusions questionable. The uncertainty of threat intelligence and evolving goals of attackers raise questions about conclusions regarding terrorist threats to hazardous chemical shipping. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission notes the difficulty in estimating the probability of a terrorist attack due to historical inexperience. Vulnerability and consequence analysis of marine chemical hazards also face uncertainties, with the Coast Guard conducting security assessments and plans for vessels under the MTSA and ISPS codes. NOAA collaborates with the Coast Guard to assess hazardous chemical risks in the U.S. Some analysts suggest that the potential vulnerabilities and consequences of a terrorist attack on hazardous marine cargo vessels are not well understood, despite Coast Guard activities. Public controversy over terrorist risks to LNG shipping stems from conflicting studies by government and private sector groups. Recent public controversy surrounds terrorist risks to LNG shipping due to conflicting vulnerability and consequence studies from various government and private sector groups. Limited public information is available on the physical vulnerabilities of marine vessels to terrorist attacks, despite incidents like the Cole and Limburg attacks highlighting these vulnerabilities. Additionally, while there is research on accidental hazardous chemical releases, little is known about the vulnerabilities of marine vessels to such attacks. Vessel vulnerability assessments and security plans are crucial for U.S. maritime security strategy, but may be limited for hazardous chemicals carriers if operators lack a full understanding of vulnerability and consequence, especially for attacks affecting the general public. The U.S. maritime security strategy relies on vessel vulnerability assessments and security plans, especially for hazardous chemicals carriers. Federal officials may struggle to determine the precise risk of terror attacks on marine cargoes, but reducing risk uncertainty can help prioritize security activities. The Coast Guard can enhance port security by receiving timely intelligence information, while security experts can further reduce risk uncertainty through research and analysis of vessels. The Coast Guard can improve port security by receiving timely intelligence information. Security experts can reduce risk uncertainty through research and analysis of vessel vulnerabilities and chemical attack consequences. Standard models and methodologies, such as those used by NOAA and EPA, can be beneficial for security analysis. A federal role may be important to ensure methodological consistency across chemicals. The federal role in security analysis for hazardous marine cargo is important to ensure consistency across chemicals, vessel types, and locations. Concerns about costs and resource diversion have been raised by policy makers, but Coast Guard officials note that maritime security expenditures are part of their general mission to protect the nation's waters and coasts. According to Coast Guard officials, maritime security expenditures are not all incremental, as they are part of the general mission to protect the nation's waters and coasts. However, resources dedicated to securing marine shipments of hazardous cargo could be used for other missions such as boating safety, search and rescue, and drug interdiction. A Government Accountability Office study found that security activities increased from 4% to 34% of the Coast Guard's total annual resource hours in the two years following 9/11. President Bush requested $8.1 billion for the Coast Guard in FY2006, with $2.2 billion allocated for port, waterway, and coastal security, a 6% increase from the previous year. Hazardous marine cargo security is funded from the general maritime security budget, with an additional $11 million requested in the FY2006 budget. The Coast Guard's FY2006 budget includes a $11 million increase in general maritime security funding for new response boats and crew. Additionally, $5.7 million is allocated for a nationwide vessel monitoring system and $87.4 million for increased aircraft surveillance of vessels. State and local agencies are also requesting more resources. The Coast Guard's FY2006 budget includes funding for response boats, security zones, and vessel monitoring. State and local agencies are seeking more funding to offset costs of hazardous marine cargo security, particularly for LNG tankers which may cost up to $80,000 to secure per shipment. This could force agencies to divert resources from other public services. The cost of securing LNG shipments can reach up to $80,000 each time, with state and local agencies bearing a significant portion of these expenses. Federal officials recommend that new LNG terminal operators cover additional maritime security costs. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandates cost-sharing for LNG tanker security, but the ambiguity in accounting for security costs and reliance on uncertain federal funding sources like DHS port security grants pose challenges. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandates cost-sharing for LNG tanker security, but ambiguity in accounting and reliance on uncertain federal funding pose challenges. Some government officials express concern over LNG security costs, while some companies resist paying more for public security, citing taxes already paid. Others are willing to pay for \"excess\" security if it exceeds normal levels. Some companies resist paying more for public security, citing taxes already paid. Others are willing to pay for \"excess\" security only if it exceeds normal levels. New security technology and changing threat assessments may help lower hazardous marine cargo security costs in the future. New security technology and changing threat assessments may help lower hazardous marine cargo security costs in the future. The Coast Guard has security measures in place to protect hazardous chemicals shipping, but the effectiveness of these measures is still questioned. Some doubt if the Coast Guard efficiently deploys its security resources. The effectiveness of security measures for hazardous chemicals shipping by the Coast Guard is still questioned. Some doubt if resources are efficiently deployed, and there is a lack of performance measures to assess progress in enhancing maritime security. The effectiveness of security measures for hazardous chemicals shipping by the Coast Guard is still questioned, with a lack of performance measures to assess progress in enhancing maritime security. Concerns exist regarding whether Coast Guard security activities adequately address terrorism risks within ports based on quantitative risk analysis. The Coast Guard's security measures for hazardous chemicals shipping are questioned for their effectiveness in addressing terrorism risks within ports. There are uncertainties about whether the level of security provided for hazardous chemical vessels reflects their relative risk. Some question if Coast Guard security for hazardous chemical vessels appropriately reflects their relative risk and if similar chemical shipments receive different levels of protection from port to port. This variability could lead to excessive security in some ports and inadequate security in others. Similar chemical shipments posing terrorism hazards receive different levels of protection from port to port, leading to potential security disparities. Congress may need to assess the effectiveness of Coast Guard's security activities for hazardous marine cargoes. Emergency response to marine chemical attacks is also a concern among security analysts. Emergency response to marine chemical attacks is a concern among security analysts, with potential for high casualties that could overwhelm emergency agencies and medical facilities. Emergency response to marine chemical attacks near densely populated areas poses a significant risk of overwhelming emergency agencies and medical facilities. Toxic chemicals could complicate response efforts, requiring specialized treatment for poisoning and burns. Salvage of a damaged vessel in such an attack may be challenging due to chemical hazards and limitations among U.S. marine salvage companies. It may be prudent for authorities near affected waterways to prepare for potential hazardous cargo terrorism risks. The potential challenges of salvaging a vessel after a chemical attack include the hazardous cargo terrorism risk and limitations among U.S. marine salvage companies. Emergency and medical authorities near affected waterways should develop specific measures to deal with chemical releases, with possible support from federal or private sector funding or expertise. The Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness Fund and the DHS could provide assistance to communities lacking emergency response capabilities. Potential funding sources like the DOT's Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness Fund and the DHS's Homeland Security Grant Program could support communities lacking emergency response capabilities for marine chemical incidents. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides a legislative model for emergency response plans for coastal LNG terminals and tankers. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals are significant in volume. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 offers a legislative model for emergency response plans for coastal LNG terminals and tankers. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals are comparable in volume to those stored at large chemical plants and are often larger than rail or highway tankers. These shipments pass through populated areas and major U.S. ports, making them potential terrorist targets. Marine shipments of hazardous chemicals pass near populated areas and major U.S. ports, making them potential terrorist targets. The Coast Guard, under the MTSA, has authority over the security of hazardous marine shipping and is evolving its security activities to improve maritime security. The Coast Guard has authority over the security of hazardous marine shipping under the MTSA, evolving its security activities to improve maritime security. Congressional policymakers may question terrorism risk uncertainty and the resources needed to secure hazardous chemical cargo. Congressional policymakers may analyze the resources and security measures in place for hazardous chemical cargo, including evaluating emergency response capabilities of coastal communities. They may also assess how U.S. hazardous chemicals marine security fits into the nation's overall strategy to protect the public. Congress may evaluate the resources and security measures for hazardous chemical cargo, including emergency response capabilities of coastal communities. Balancing chemicals security resources across marine vessels, rail and highway tankers, and chemical facilities is a policy challenge. The report highlights the challenge of balancing chemical security resources across different sectors like marine transportation, land transportation, and chemical facilities due to varying homeland security authorities and regulations. Limited vulnerability and consequence information, especially for marine transportation, makes it difficult to compare terrorism risks for the same chemical hazard across sectors. This lack of comprehensive perspective on hazardous chemical risks hinders security analysts in identifying which chemical assets to protect and how to protect them effectively.

The Army Corps of Engineers collects marine commerce statistics to plan and manage projects. Domestic and foreign commerce data is maintained separately. The Army Corps of Engineers collects marine commerce statistics through its Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center (WCSC) to plan and manage projects. Separate databases track domestic and foreign vessel trips, tonnages, and commodities for U.S. ports and waterways. Vessel types include dry cargo ships, tankers, barges, fishing vessels, towboats, tugboats, crew boats, and supply boats to offshore locations. The Army Corps of Engineers collects marine commerce statistics through its Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center (WCSC) to plan and manage projects. Vessel types include dry cargo ships, tankers, barges, fishing vessels, towboats, tugboats, crew boats, and supply boats to offshore locations. Vessels remaining idle during a monthly reporting period are also reported. Vessel operators must report domestic waterborne commercial movements to the ACE. The ACE waterborne commerce databases were not developed to support chemical-specific analysis but may be used for that purpose with limitations and caveats. The ACE waterborne commerce databases, while not designed for chemical-specific analysis, can still provide estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics with limitations. CRS believes these estimates are sufficiently accurate for inclusion in the report, but they should be viewed strictly as estimates with key caveats. Cargo classification in the ACE databases identifies cargos using specific criteria. The ACE databases use standardized commodity codes to identify cargos, but these codes may not always correspond accurately to individual hazardous chemicals listed in the EPA/RMP. Inconsistencies arise from commodity aggregation. The ACE databases use standardized commodity codes that do not consistently correspond to individual hazardous chemicals listed in the EPA/RMP. Inconsistencies arise from commodity aggregation or differences in definition. CRS has attempted to correct these inconsistencies by comparing WCSC and UN codes and consulting with classification experts. For example, LNG and LPG are classified under the same 5-digit code in the WCSC system, but CRS was able to separate the volumes using LNG trade data from the Department of Energy. The ACE databases use standardized commodity codes that may not align with individual hazardous chemicals listed in the EPA/RMP. CRS corrected inconsistencies by consulting with classification experts and comparing WCSC and UN codes. For instance, LNG and LPG were initially classified under the same code, but CRS separated the volumes using LNG trade data. Shipments of EPA/RMP chemicals may be included in totals for similar chemicals. Cargo vessels may load or unload partial cargoes at multiple locations during a single shipment. The ACE data report movement of cargo at loading and unloading points, but errors in data classification and processing may occur due to the database's size. The ACE databases contain millions of records, and new queries may lead to data quality issues. The ACE databases contain millions of records with potential errors in data classification and processing. CRS identified inconsistencies in ACE estimates, which were corrected, but there may still be unnoticed data quality-related errors. The databases provide detailed commercial information about private companies. The ACE waterborne commerce databases contain detailed commercial information about private companies, with summary estimates of chemicals shipping data. Individual shipment, vessel, and operator data is considered privileged information not for public release."
