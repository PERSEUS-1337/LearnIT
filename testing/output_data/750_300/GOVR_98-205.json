Congress also passes a national defense authorization bill annually, which addresses defense programs in detail. Congress annually passes a national defense authorization bill that addresses defense programs in detail, along with defense-related appropriations. The authorization bill and appropriations bills are closely related, with differences usually concerning only a few programs. Congressional debate on major defense policy and funding issues primarily occurs during action on the authorization bill. This report tracks congressional action on both measures.

The conference agreements on the defense authorization and appropriations bills resolved major issues, including relations with China. The conference agreements on the FY1999 defense appropriations bills addressed major issues, including relations with China. The House and Senate debated provisions on satellite and missile technology exports to China, with contentious amendments dropped during floor debate. China-related provisions were a significant focus in the authorization process. During the Senate debate on the authorization bill, contentious China-related amendments by Senator Hutchinson were dropped. The authorization conference agreed to remove language banning satellite exports to China but included provisions transferring technology export review to the State Department, requiring congressional notification for satellite sales to China, and prohibiting certain exports. The conference agreement on the defense appropriations bill includes provisions to transfer technology export review to the State Department, require congressional notification for satellite sales to China, and prohibit certain exports. This agreement also includes a measure to prohibit the transfer of port facilities near San Diego to a Chinese shipping company. The conference agreement on the defense appropriations bill includes provisions to transfer technology export review to the State Department, require congressional notification for satellite sales to China, and prohibit certain exports.

It also prohibits the transfer of port facilities near San Diego to COSCO and doing business with Chinese Army-owned companies. The agreement does not include measures to deny visas to individuals involved in genital mutilation, but includes a prohibition on DOD doing business with Chinese Army-owned companies and a report on the security situation in the Taiwan Strait. Neither the House nor the Senate authorization bills approved new rounds of military base closures. The Senate approved an amendment to make it more difficult for the Defense Department to realign military bases without a congressionally established base closure process, which was dropped in the conference agreement. The conference agreement dropped an amendment by Senators Inhofe and Dorgan that would have made it harder for the Defense Department to realign military bases without a congressionally established base closure process. The House-passed bill required separation of men and women in basic training, while the Senate-passed bill prohibited new policies for separation until further review. The Senate rejected a proposal to separate men and women in basic training, opting to continue current integrated training practices with additional steps for separate sleeping quarters. This decision differed from the House-passed bill, which mandated gender separation in basic training. The Senate endorsed a substitute allowing current integrated training practices to continue with additional steps for separate sleeping quarters, a major issue in the House-Senate authorization conference. The conference adopted the Senate language but included a \"sense of the House\" statement urging separate training units. The House authorization included a measure for commanders to display \"exemplary behavior,\" which was included in the conference agreement as a \"sense of the House\" statement. The House and Senate addressed social issues in the authorization bill, including a requirement for commanders to display exemplary behavior. The ban on abortions in military medical facilities was upheld. The House also included a measure to prohibit the Department of Energy from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial reactors, potentially requiring new facilities for tritium production in South Carolina. The bill included a measure to prohibit the Department of Energy from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial reactors, potentially requiring new facilities for tritium production in South Carolina. The Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost $3 billion over forty years to buy tritium from commercial sources and $10 billion from new facilities. The Senate-passed authorization bill allowed DOE to choose the long-term option, with the conference agreement allowing DOE to make the choice but prohibiting implementation for a year for Congress to review. The authorization bill allows DOE to choose the long-term option for tritium production, but implementation is prohibited for a year for Congress to review. The House rejected eliminating floors on active duty end-strength levels, while the Senate and appropriations bills agreed to reductions. The authorization conference report supports the Administration's request. The House-passed authorization bill provided a 3.6% pay raise for military. The House and Senate versions of the appropriations bill agreed to the Administration's proposed reductions in end-strength. The Senate approved an amendment to increase the military pay raise to 3.6%, offset by a reduction in R&D funds. The Senate approved an amendment to increase the military pay raise to 3.6% by reducing R&D funds. Senators Stevens and Inouye cosponsored the amendment. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements provide the 3.6% raise. The Administration requested $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency funding. The Senate-passed defense appropriations bill included the requested funding. The Administration requested $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency funding not subject to the cap on defense spending. The Senate approved the funding, while the House did not. The SASC report approved the amount as emergency appropriations. The House included a provision to cap Bosnia spending at $1.9 billion, with an additional $100 million allowed for protecting U.S. troops, which the Administration objected to. The House-passed authorization bill included a provision to cap Bosnia spending at $1.9 billion, with an additional $100 million allowed for protecting U.S. troops. Both houses rejected measures to withdraw U.S. troops by a specific date, but the Senate version encouraged the President to establish conditions for a drawdown of forces in Bosnia. The authorization conference agreement specifically authorizes $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia. The Senate version of the authorization bill included a provision encouraging the President to establish conditions for a drawdown of forces in Bosnia. The authorization conference agreement authorizes $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, with the possibility of larger expenditures if certified necessary for U.S. national security. The appropriations conference agreement did not include emergency funding for Bosnia, but it was later provided in a supplemental appropriations measure in the FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill. Contentious weapons issues were minimal compared to previous years. The conference agreement did not include emergency funding for Bosnia, but it was later provided in a supplemental appropriations measure in the FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill. Weapons priorities were less contentious this year, with the authorization and appropriations conference agreements providing funds for 7 C-130J aircraft, 6 more than requested. The House and Senate appropriations bills reduced funding for the THAAD system. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements provide funds for 7 aircraft, 6 more than requested. Funding for the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system was reduced in both House and Senate appropriations bills. The program is to be restructured with cuts of $294 million in the authorization agreement and $376 million in the appropriations agreement. Funding for another Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system was reduced or eliminated in the Senate bills. The authorization conference agreement cuts $294 million and the appropriations conference agreement cuts $376 million in funding for the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. Funding for the Medium Extended-Range Air Defense System (MEADS) is also reduced, with the authorization conference agreement cutting funding from $44 million to $24 million and the appropriations conference agreement providing just $10 million. The Senate bills also reduced or eliminated funding for MEADS. The funding for the Medium Extended-Range Air Defense System (MEADS) is reduced from $44 million to $24 million in the authorization conference agreement, with only $10 million provided in the appropriations conference agreement. The Senate bills also cut funding for the Airborne Laser (ABL) program and increased funding for Space-Based Laser (SBL) R&D, despite objections from the Administration. Funding for new aircraft carrier development was also reduced in both House and Senate appropriations bills. The appropriations conference agreement provides funding for ABL and new aircraft carrier development, with $110 million allocated in the authorization conference agreement and $105 million in the appropriations conference agreement. The Navy plans to use some of the money for progressive changes in the current carrier design. Additionally, advance procurement funds are included for a new LHD-8 amphibious ship. The conference agreement provides $110 million for ABL and new aircraft carrier development. Advance procurement funds are allocated for a new LHD-8 amphibious ship, with $50 million in the authorization agreement and $45 million in the appropriations agreement. Funding for 30 F-18s and one F-16 was approved, despite objections from the Administration. The House and Senate disagreed on aircraft procurement, with the authorization conference funding 30 F-18s and one F-16. The Administration objected to certain testing requirements for F-22 aircraft and cuts in other areas to finance increases in programs. The authorization conference agreement includes restrictions that can be waived. The authorization conference agreement includes restrictions that can be waived, with some cuts in certain programs to finance increases in Department of Energy weapons programs. Long-term weapons issues seem to have been resolved this year, with the battle over B-2 bomber procurement and the design competition in the New Attack Submarine program coming to an end. Military health care provisions are also addressed in the House and Senate authorization bills. The House National Security Committee did not renew its fight for a design competition in the New Attack Submarine program. Both House and Senate authorization bills took steps to ensure military retirees have access to healthcare. Pilot projects were approved to test alternative approaches, including allowing retirees to join the FEHBP. The House approved a floor amendment to establish a test plan for military retirees to join the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP). Pilot projects were included in the authorization conference to test FEHBP, use the DOD TRICARE program as a supplement for Medicare, and provide retirees access to TRICARE pharmacy benefits. Budget constraints, the results of last year's Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), ongoing battles over social issues, and other matters contributed to a broad agenda in this year's defense debate. Key discussions included military healthcare access for retirees. In this year's defense debate, key matters of discussion included military base closures, Bosnia funding, technology export controls, efficiency measures, military readiness, long-term funding for defense modernization, personnel levels, National Guard and Reserve funding, major weapons programs, and ballistic missile defense. In the defense debate, key issues included long-term funding for defense modernization, military personnel levels, National Guard and Reserve funding, major weapons programs, social issues like sexual harassment, and military health care policy. Budget constraints from the 1997 agreement affected the FY1999 defense budget discussions. Budget constraints from the 1997 agreement impacted the FY1999 defense budget discussions, leading to a \"zero-sum game\" in Congress where any additions or reductions had to be offset by cuts in other defense programs. This marked a departure from previous years' experiences in defense budgeting. The 1997 budget constraints led to a \"zero-sum game\" in Congress for the FY1999 defense budget, where any additions or reductions had to be offset by cuts in other defense programs. Congress ultimately provided an additional $8.3 billion for defense programs in the omnibus appropriations bill. The omnibus appropriations bill included an additional $8.3 billion for defense programs, leading to potential conflicts between Congress and the Administration over defense priorities. Senior Administration officials tried to avoid confrontations by meeting Congress halfway on ongoing congressional interest programs, such as fully funding national missile defense development. Senior Administration officials tried to avoid conflicts by meeting Congress halfway on ongoing congressional interest programs, fully funding national missile defense development, requesting more money for National Guard and Reserve equipment, identifying and funding all defense health program costs, and moving funding for the next Nimitz-class aircraft carrier forward to FY2001. Contentious debates over defense budget priorities did not materialize in House and Senate actions on FY1999 defense bills. In FY1999, the defense budget debate did not result in major conflicts in Congress. Additional funding was allocated for unrequested weapons programs, with a notable $1 billion for ballistic missile defense. The Quadrennial Defense Review from the previous year also influenced the congressional defense discussions. The omnibus appropriations bill mostly avoided contentious weapons programs, except for adding $1 billion for ballistic missile defense. The congressional defense debate in FY1999 was influenced by the Quadrennial Defense Review, Defense Reform Initiative report, and National Defense Panel report from the previous year. The Defense Reform Initiative report and National Defense Panel report in 1997 reassessed U.S. defense policy, proposing efficiency measures and highlighting ongoing themes for discussion in Congress. The Quadrennial Defense Review proposed a revised defense strategy and measures to reduce pressures on the force. The QDR proposed a revised defense strategy, reaffirmed the need for U.S. forces to prevail in two major theater wars, and identified key elements of the \"revolution in military affairs.\" It emphasized efficiency to save money for weapons modernization and endorsed military base closures. The National Defense Panel report supported much of the QDR's focus. The QDR and Defense Reform Initiative emphasized efficiency to save money for weapons modernization and endorsed military base closures. The National Defense Panel report supported the QDR's focus on shaping the international security environment and efficiency measures, but also called for a greater emphasis on homeland defense and preparing for future threats. It suggested less focus on preparing for two major theater wars and more on future readiness, advocating for increased spending on experimental force exercises and new capabilities. The National Defense Panel recommended shifting focus from preparing for two major theater wars to preparing for future threats, calling for increased spending on experimental force exercises and new technology. It also supported two more rounds of military base closures to save money for defense modernization programs. The Defense Department proposed two more rounds of military base closures to save money for defense modernization programs. Congress was initially unreceptive but Secretary Cohen made it a top priority. The Defense Department released a report on base closures as required by the FY1998 Defense Authorization Act. The Defense Department proposed two new base closure rounds in 2001 and 2005 to save money for defense modernization programs. A report reaffirmed earlier estimates of annual savings from previous closure rounds, projecting $2.8 billion in savings from future closures to fund weapons programs. Future base closure rounds, as large as previous ones, are projected to save $2.8 billion annually. This money is crucial for upcoming weapons programs. Resistance in Congress stems from objections to actions taken after the 1995 base closure round. The White House proposed privatizing instead of closing Air Force maintenance facilities in California and Texas. The Closure Commission recommended closing two Air Force aircraft depot maintenance facilities in California and Texas, but the White House developed a plan to \"privatize in place\" instead. Private contractors now bid for contracts at these facilities, leading to competition and better prices. However, many Members of Congress believe this plan politicized the base closure process. Last year, the defense authorization bill was delayed due to this issue. The Administration argues that privatizing in place has led to competition and better prices for contracts. However, many Members of Congress believe this politicized the base closure process, leading to disputes and complaints about encouraging private companies to bid on contracts. Secretary Cohen and other officials faced criticism in congressional hearings for eroding support for further base privatization. Secretary Cohen and other officials faced criticism in congressional hearings regarding a White House request for the Defense Department to encourage a private company to bid on a contract at the Sacramento facility. Cohen suggested that Congress could prohibit privatization in place in future base closure legislation and advocated for more base closures to be approved in order to prepare for the long-term defense plan. Cohen argues for more base closures to be approved by Congress to prepare for the long-term defense plan. Congressional action on additional base closures was not agreed upon in the FY1999 defense authorization. In a critical measure of support for base closures, the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) voted against a proposal for another base closure round in 2001. An amendment by Senator Inhofe was approved by the Senate, making it more difficult for the Department of Defense (DOD) to realign facilities without a congressionally established base closure process. Senator Inhofe predicted that Congress would approve another base closure round in 2001. However, the Inhofe amendment was ultimately dropped by the authorization conference. Congress will approve another base closure round in 2001. The Administration sent requests to Congress for funding military operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf. The requests totaled $3.7 billion for FY1998 and FY1999. The Administration requested $3.7 billion from Congress for military operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf, with $1.9 billion for extending the mission in Bosnia through FY1999. Funding for Bosnia was ultimately provided in the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328) as \"emergency\" appropriations. The Administration requested additional funding for Bosnia and other military operations to be designated as \"emergency\" appropriations in the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328). This proposal was contentious as it would raise caps on defense discretionary spending without the need for offsetting cuts in other defense programs. Congress had previously insisted on including anticipated costs of ongoing military operations in regular defense appropriations measures. The Administration proposed additional funding for Bosnia and other military operations to be designated as \"emergency\" appropriations in the omnibus appropriations bill. Congress had previously required including anticipated costs of ongoing military operations in regular defense appropriations. The FY1998 and FY1999 supplemental funding broke this precedent, with the Administration arguing that Bosnia costs were not assumed in defense plans at the time of the 1997 budget agreement. If Congress did not agree to designate the Bosnia funding as emergency appropriations, costs would have to be offset by cuts in other defense programs. The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency appropriations, while the House National Security Committee (HNSC) did not specifically address emergency funding for Bosnia but set a cap of $1.9 billion. The House rejected a motion to cut off funds for operations in Bosnia without prior congressional approval after approving $270.5 billion for national defense as emergency appropriations. On May 21, the full House rejected a motion by Representative Barney Frank to recommit the authorization bill to committee with instructions to report a revised bill that would cut off funds for operations in Bosnia after Dec. 31, 1998 without prior congressional approval. The House-passed defense appropriations bill also did not include emergency funding for Bosnia. On June 24, the Senate approved an amendment to the authorization bill by Senator Thurmond urging the President to reduce the U.S. troop level in Bosnia, but rejected an amendment by Senator Bob Smith to cut off funds unless Congress approves the deployment. Senators Byrd and Hutchison did not offer their amendment to require the U.S. troop presence in. On July 30, the Senate added an amendment proposed by Senator Stevens to the defense appropriations bill to provide $1.9 billion as emergency appropriations. The House-passed appropriations bill included a provision to prohibit expenditures on offensive military action without advance approval. The House-passed appropriations bill included a provision to prohibit expenditures on offensive military action without advance congressional approval. The Senate voted to table a similar amendment. The White House threatened a veto if the provision was included. The authorization conference agreement approved $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia. The House threatened a veto if the Skaggs provision was included in the appropriations bill. The authorization conference agreement approved $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, contingent on presidential certification for national security. The appropriations conference agreement did not include emergency funding for Bosnia, leaving it for future consideration. The Skaggs amendment was dropped. Emergency funding of $1.9 billion for Bosnia was provided in the FY1999 Omnibus appropriations bill. The Skaggs amendment for emergency funding in Bosnia was dropped in the appropriations conference agreement. $1.9 billion emergency funding for Bosnia was provided in the FY1999 Omnibus appropriations bill. Congressional focus shifted to relations with China, technology exports controls, and trade sanctions legislation in response to allegations of assistance provided by Loral Space Corporation to China and nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. Loral Space Corporation assisted China in improving missile launch technology, prompting Congressional action to restrict technology exports to China and other countries. Amendments were made to limit export of missile and satellite technology, subject satellite exports to licensing requirements, and transfer responsibility for reviewing technology exports to China from Commerce Department to State Department. The House-passed bill included measures to restrict technology exports to China, subject satellite exports to licensing requirements, transfer responsibility for reviewing technology exports to the State Department, and allow Congress to review nuclear technology exports. The White House strongly objected to these measures, which also included a provision to prohibit the transfer of facilities at Long Beach naval shipyard to a Chinese shipping company. The House-passed bill included measures to restrict technology exports to China and prohibit the transfer of facilities at Long Beach naval shipyard to a Chinese shipping company. In the Senate, various amendments related to China policy were proposed, including trade sanctions and technology exports. Senator Hutchinson's China-related amendments were not tabled, leading to a delay in the debate on China policy. Senator Stevens postponed floor action on the defense appropriations bill due to concerns about contentious amendments. Senator Hutchinson planned to offer amendments on China policy during the defense appropriations bill debate, but Senator Stevens delayed floor action due to concerns about contentious amendments. Ultimately, the Senate passed a measure requiring the State Department to deny visas to foreign officials involved in forced abortions, sterilization, or genital mutilation. Hutchinson offered a revised amendment on the defense appropriations bill, requiring the State Department to deny visas to foreign officials involved in forced abortions, sterilization, or genital mutilation. The authorization conference agreement includes provisions shifting technology export review to the State Department from Commerce, requiring advanced congressional notification for satellite sales to China, and prohibiting missile equipment exports. The conference agreement includes provisions shifting technology export review to the State Department from Commerce, requiring advanced congressional notification for satellite sales to China, and prohibiting missile equipment exports. It also includes a ban on transferring port facilities COSCO. The conference agreement includes efficiency measures such as reducing staff in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and pursuing public-private competitions for additional activities. The Defense Department is implementing efficiency measures by reducing staff in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and pursuing public-private competitions for additional activities currently carried out by civilian DOD employees. Congress is debating whether these cuts are substantial or just on paper, and if different requirements will be imposed. The Defense Department is reducing staff in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and considering privatization measures for civilian DOD activities. Congress is debating the extent of these cuts and potential requirements for deeper reductions in overhead personnel. The House has pushed for significant cuts in acquisition personnel, while the Senate and Administration have sought to moderate these measures. The House has pushed for deep cuts in acquisition personnel, while the Senate and Administration aim to soften these measures. The House resists opening weapons maintenance to private competition. HNSC urged the Defense Department to not waive cuts in acquisition personnel and imposed a $500 million funding cut. The House has pushed for deep cuts in acquisition personnel, while the Senate and Administration aim to soften these measures. The House resists opening weapons maintenance to private competition. HNSC imposed an across-the-board cut of $500 million in funding for consultants and criticized DOD for not complying with reporting requirements on management headquarters personnel. The White House objected to the cut in consulting funds and several measures in the House-passed authorization bill. The authorization conference agreement includes a measure to withhold 10% of funds for the Office of the Secretary of Defense unless DOD meets all statutory requirements to cut headquarters staffs. The authorization conference agreement includes measures to withhold funds for the Office of the Secretary of Defense unless DOD meets statutory requirements to cut staff, reduce acquisition personnel, consultants, and Assistant Secretary of Defense positions. Military readiness has been a focus in congressional hearings due to reported problems. Many Members of Congress have raised concerns about military readiness, citing various problems such as shortages of spare parts, lowered recruitment standards, and declining retention rates for pilots. These issues are seen as signs of a looming readiness crisis caused by inadequate funding and the Clinton Administration's frequent deployment of U.S. forces overseas. The Air Force and Navy are experiencing a significant drop in pilot retention rates, leading to concerns about a readiness crisis. Some attribute this to insufficient defense funding and the Clinton Administration's extensive deployment of forces abroad. While officials acknowledge some issues, they deny an overall readiness crisis, stating that early deploying units remain fully prepared. They argue that anecdotal evidence does not accurately reflect the overall state of the military. Overall, officials deny an overall readiness crisis in the Air Force and Navy, stating that early deploying units are fully prepared. They acknowledge some issues with pilot retention, attributed to airline hiring and demands of operations abroad, but efforts are being made to address these problems. Anecdotal evidence is said to not accurately reflect the state of the force, with ongoing efforts to fix issues like Air Force engine spares shortages. Officials have made changes to planning models to address shortages in engine spares. Efforts are underway to improve pilot retention, including higher reenlistment bonuses and limiting deployments. Army recruiting is meeting quality goals, but concerns have been raised about personnel recruitment and retention. Senior military officers expressed growing concerns about readiness during a meeting with the President on September 15. Officials have expressed concerns about personnel recruitment and retention, with senior military officers urging higher defense spending. The Joint Chiefs testified about military readiness, highlighting a need for over $17 billion annually in additional defense spending. Congressional action included restructuring operation and maintenance. The Joint Chiefs testified about military readiness, identifying a need for over $17 billion annually in additional defense spending. Congressional action included restructuring operation and maintenance funding to address shortfalls of up to $135 billion over five years. Additional funds were allocated for readiness-related accounts. The Senate approved amendments on the defense appropriations bill, requiring reports on food stamp use by military families and addressing readiness erosion due to budget cuts and expanded missions. More funding was allocated for recruiting, troop benefits, and flight duty pay. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes $1.3 billion for enhanced military readiness, addressing declining budgets and expanded missions. It also provides more funding for recruiting, troop benefits, and flight duty pay, emphasizing quality of life measures like day care centers and housing. However, changes to military retirement benefits were not included in the bill. Long-term funding for defense modernization remains a concern. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes $1.3 billion for enhanced military readiness, but does not address changes to military retirement benefits. Long-term funding for defense modernization is still a concern, with funding being reallocated from weapons procurement to operation and maintenance accounts. In FY1999, Defense Department funding for weapons procurement has been reallocated to operation and maintenance accounts due to readiness concerns. The requested procurement funding is close to last year's level, with adjustments made following the Quadrennial Defense Review. The Administration requested emergency appropriations for FY1999 Bosnia costs, bypassing the cap on overall defense spending. The Administration's goal is to increase procurement funding to $60 billion per year by FY2001, but achieving this without increasing overall defense spending is challenging. Senior defense officials admit that historical trends suggest procurement spending would likely decline if the budget had to absorb Bosnia costs. The Administration plans to reach the target by implementing base closure and other measures. The Administration aims to increase procurement funding to $60 billion per year by FY2001. Senior defense officials acknowledge the challenge of achieving this goal without increasing overall defense spending. Efforts to reach the target include base closure and efficiency savings, but factors like maintenance costs, quality of life requirements, and health care cost growth could delay reaching the target. Under Secretary of Defense Jacques Gansler stated that reaching the $60 billion procurement target is becoming more difficult. Congressional action does not include substantial increases in modernization funding, with only $1 billion allocated for BMD programs in the omnibus appropriations bill. The QDR mandated a reduction of 37,000 active duty personnel and 55,000 reserve positions by 2003. The omnibus appropriations bill provides $1 billion for BMD programs, but no other funds for weapons modernization. The QDR mandated a cut of 37,000 active duty personnel and 55,000 reserve positions through 2003, with some resistance in Congress to proposed personnel cuts due to concerns about strain on active duty forces. Many in Congress oppose proposed personnel cuts, citing strain on active duty forces from contingency operations and forward presence abroad. The Army faces shortages in certain skills, relying on reservists for major conflicts but drawing personnel from other units for smaller-scale operations, exacerbating shortages elsewhere. The Administration requested a reduction in active duty end-strength by over 35,000 from the authorized FY1998 level and about 24,000 from the actual FY1998 level. Congress must agree to eliminate statutory floors to carry out the reductions. Some Members of Congress are hesitant to do so. Congressional action: The Administration requested a reduction in active duty end-strength by more than 35,000 from the authorized FY1998 level and about 24,000 from the actual FY1998 level. HNSC rejected the request to repeal statutory floors on end-strength, reducing authorized end-strength by 11,000 fewer positions than requested due to concerns of troops being overworked. SASC approved the end-strength reductions and repeal of statutory floors. House and Senate versions of the defense appropriations bill assumed the cuts in end-strength for FY1999. The Administration requested a reduction in active duty end-strength, with concerns of troops being overworked. SASC approved the end-strength reductions and repeal of statutory floors. The House and Senate versions of the defense appropriations bill assumed the cuts in end-strength for FY1999. In the wake of the QDR, a dispute between the active Army and the Army National Guard over the role of ARNG combat units emerged. The Guard believes active Army leaders have not given them an appropriate role in war plans. The Army National Guard (ARNG) is in a dispute with the active Army over the role of ARNG combat units. The Guard feels they have not been given a proper role in war plans. Congress approved special advisors for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs from the Guard and Reserve. The Defense Department has requested more funding for Guard and reserve weapons procurement. The Army Chief of Staff is working to resolve the ongoing dispute with ARNG leaders. The Defense Department has requested more funding for Guard and reserve weapons procurement, while the Army Chief of Staff is working to resolve disputes with ARNG leaders. Congress has added substantial amounts for equipment earmarked for National Guard and Reserve forces. Congress has added substantial amounts for equipment earmarked for National Guard and Reserve forces, including disputes over major weapons programs such as Missile defense programs for National Missile Defense (NMD) and Theater Missile Defense (TMD). Missile Defense (NMD) is designed to protect the United States from long-range missile attacks, while Theater Missile Defense (TMD) programs aim to protect deployed U.S. forces and allies from short or intermediate-range missile threats. The Administration has increased funding for NMD programs post-QDR, with less contentious funding levels. Policy disputes persist, with the Administration pursuing NMD technology development while deferring deployment decisions to potentially preserve the 1972 ABM Treaty. The Administration is pursuing NMD technology development while deferring deployment decisions to potentially preserve the 1972 ABM Treaty. Missile defense advocates in Congress believe threats to the United States warrant early deployment of a nationwide defense, and disputes over TMD systems continue. Key issues involve THAAD, Navy Theater-Wide, and MEADS systems. Disputes over TMD systems, including THAAD, Navy Theater-Wide, and MEADS, continue this year. THAAD development has been delayed due to test failures, and procurement of the Navy system is also being postponed. MEADS is a cooperative program with European allies to enhance air/missile defense for deployed troops. Congressional provisions for nationwide defense deployment have caused delays in the past. MEADS is a cooperative program with European allies to improve air/missile defense for troops. Congressional actions have caused delays in nationwide defense deployment. Senate Armed Services Committee reported S. 1873, calling for nationwide defense deployment as soon as feasible. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported S. 1873, \"The American Missile Protection Act of 1998,\" calling for nationwide defense deployment. Congress approved additional funding for TMD programs in FY1998. The House approved additional funding for TMD programs in FY1998, including $147 million in H.R. 2786 and $179 million in H.R. 3579. The Senate reduced funding for the THAAD program after its fifth test failure. The Senate approved an amendment to trim $253.9 million from the THAAD program due to test failures, leading to a restructuring of the program with a second contractor competing with Lockheed-Martin. Funding was shifted from engineering development to technology development. On May 21, the full House approved a committee amendment to restructure the THAAD program, requiring DOD to select a second contractor to compete with Lockheed-Martin and shifting $142.7 million from engineering development to technology development. SASC also cut MEADS funding from $43 to $10 million and required DOD to study alternatives. Additionally, SASC was critical of the Air Force Advanced Airborne Laser program, cutting funding by $97 million and increasing funding for Space-Based Laser R&D by $94 million. The Senate appropriations bill cut $57 million. The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) was critical of the Air Force Advanced Airborne Laser (ABL) program, cutting funding by $97 million. They also increased funding for Space-Based Laser R&D by $94 million. Additionally, SASC added $10 million to the TMD budget for boost phase intercept technology. Congressional defense committees endorsed accelerated development of the Navy Theater Wide TMD system as an alternative to THAAD, with budget additions ranging from $70 million to $150 million. The authorization conference cut THAAD by $294 million. The defense committees have endorsed accelerated development of the Navy Theater Wide TMD system with budget additions ranging from $70 million to $150 million. The authorization conference cut THAAD by $294 million and reduced MEADS funding. The agreement follows Senate increases in the Space Based Laser program and cuts the Airborne Laser funding. The appropriations conference agreement further cuts THAAD, MEADS, and the Airborne Laser funding. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes additional funding of $1 billion for missile defense, with no specific allocation of the funds indicated. Some Members of Congress have proposed procurement of 9 more B-2 bombers in addition to the 21 already financed, with the House generally supporting more bombers and the Senate opposed. Annual compromise has been to provide enough money to keep production lines available and to study the issue. Some Members of Congress proposed procurement of 9 additional B-2 bombers, but an independent commission study recommended against it due to cost. No defense bills this year allocate funds for more B-2 bombers, potentially ending the battle. HNSC added funds for B-2 upgrades, while SAC reduced the request. Three new fighter aircraft programs are in development. The defense bills for this year do not include funding for more B-2 bombers, potentially ending the battle over their procurement. Three new fighter aircraft programs are in various stages of development and production, including the Navy F/A-18E/F, the Air Force F-22, and the Joint Strike Fighter program. Funding has been requested for these programs in FY1999. The FY1999 defense bills do not include funding for more B-2 bombers, potentially ending the procurement battle. The Navy F/A-18E/F, Air Force F-22, and Joint Strike Fighter programs are in development. DOD requested funding for these programs, with some Members of Congress questioning the affordability of all three. Congressional action reduced F/A-18E/F procurement but made no other major changes to tactical aircraft programs. The Senate reduced F/A-18E/F procurement but made no other changes to major tactical aircraft programs. There is a requirement for the F-22 to complete 10% of planned flight tests before the next round of procurement is released. The Senate rejected an amendment for 601 hours of flight testing before procurement. The authorization conference included funds for 30 F-18s. The Senate rejected a Bumpers amendment for 601 hours of flight testing before procurement. The authorization conference included funds for 30 F-18s and allows a flight test requirement for the F-22 to be waived. Congress has added substantial amounts to shipbuilding programs in recent years to avoid gaps in production and ensure shipyards have enough work. Congress has added substantial amounts to shipbuilding programs in recent years to avoid gaps in production and ensure shipyards have enough work. One major issue concerns the procurement of the CVN-77, the last planned Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. DOD has moved up planned procurement of CVN-77 to the FY2001 budget, an alternative to Newport News Shipbuilding's proposed accelerated plan from last year. The Navy has moved up the planned procurement of CVN-77 to the FY2001 budget, avoiding a big bill in FY1999 and FY2000. Newport News Shipbuilding had proposed the \"Smart Buy\" approach to save the Navy $600 million on the ship's price. Another issue is the development of the next generation DD-21 destroyer by Ingalls Shipbuilding Company and Bath Iron Works. The Navy's new DOD plan will not save as much as $600 million on the ship's price, but it avoids a big bill in FY1999 and FY2000. Ingalls Shipbuilding Company and Bath Iron Works have agreed to team up for the development of the next generation DD-21 destroyer, with the Navy now reaching agreements with the ship builders and combat system integrators for competition in combat systems and design. The Navy has reached agreements with ship builders and combat system integrators to form two teams to pursue competition in combat systems and design. Plans for a new-design aircraft carrier, known as the \"CVX,\" have been abandoned in favor of incremental improvements in the next three Nimitz-class carriers. Congressional approval of the Administration's shipbuilding program remains largely intact. The Navy has abandoned plans for the \"CVX\" new-design aircraft carrier in favor of incremental improvements to the next three Nimitz-class carriers. Congressional approval of the Administration's shipbuilding program, including funding for a new Attack Submarine (NSSN), has been largely supported, with additional funding for a new LHD-7 class amphibious ship. Newport News Shipbuilding and General Dynamics Electric Boat Division are designing different versions of the submarine. SASC and SAC supported the shipbuilding request, adding $50 million for advance procurement of a new LHD-7 class amphibious ship. The Navy decided not to pursue a \"clean-sheet\" design for the CVX aircraft carrier. The Navy has decided not to pursue a \"clean-sheet\" design for the CVX aircraft carrier, leading to a debate on how to allocate funding for carrier R&D. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction in funding for CVX R&D and an increase for CVN-77 upgrades. Additionally, they cut funding for CVX feasibility studies and recommended an increase for establishing a new program element. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $130 million reduction in funding for CVX R&D and a $50 million increase for CVN-77. They also cut $35.7 million for CVX feasibility studies and recommended a $5 million increase for a red team study. The House Appropriations bill cut funding for CVX by $100 million, while the authorization conference agreement provides $110 million for CVX R&D and the appropriations conference agreement provides $105 million. The authorization conference agreement allocates $110 million for CVX R&D, while the appropriations conference agreement provides $105 million. Congress has previously supported continued procurement of F-16 aircraft to maintain production lines and meet Air Force needs. Funding for Joint Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) aircraft is also a concern, with a recommendation to reduce planned procurement from 19 to 13. The House authorization added $66 million for 2 F-16s and advance procurement funds for 2 additional JSTARS aircraft. Additional funds were allocated for National Guard and Reserve equipment, including $300 million in a defense-wide account and specific weapons programs. The House appropriations bill provided funds for 8 C-130 cargo aircraft of various types, including $60 million for two F-16s, advance procurement money for JSTARS, $120 million for Guard and Reserve equipment, and $461 million for 8 C-130s. SASC provided $72 million for advance procurement or termination costs for JSTARS, pending a DOD report on its plans for the program and alternatives. The House appropriations bill provided funds for 8 C-130 cargo aircraft, advance procurement money for JSTARS, $120 million for Guard and Reserve equipment, and $461 million for 8 C-130s. SASC allocated $72 million for JSTARS pending a DOD report, funded 4 additional C-130s, and added $60 million for Guard and Reserve procurement. SAC funded 3 more C-130s and provided $247 million for miscellaneous Guard and Reserve procurement. Rep. Obey proposed eliminating funds for 4 C-130s to restore F/A-18E/F procurement. Rep. Obey proposed eliminating funds for 4 C-130s in the HAC markup to restore F/A-18E/F procurement and upgrade existing C-130s. He criticized the increase in C-130J funding, stating it came at the expense of more valuable programs. The authorization conference agreement allocated funds for 7 C-130s, 1 F-16, advance procurement for JSTARS, and $60 million for Guard and Reserve equipment. The authorization conference agreement provides funds for 7 C-130s, 1 F-16, advance procurement for JSTARS, and $60 million for Guard and Reserve equipment. The appropriations conference agreement follows suit on C-130s, provides $36 million for JSTARS advance procurement, and allocates $140 million in a separate Guard and Reserve procurement account. The National Defense Panel criticized planned procurement of weapons that may not be effective against future threats. The National Defense Panel recommended reducing or terminating \"legacy\" programs and pursuing leap-ahead technologies for future threats. This includes lighter, more deployable land equipment, longer-range fighter aircraft, and ships with lower radar visibility. Specific programs criticized include the Army M1A2 tank upgrade, Crusader artillery, Comanche helicopter, Navy and Air Force F/A-18E/F, and F-22 programs. The National Defense Panel recommended reducing or terminating legacy programs and pursuing more easily deployable equipment for land forces, longer-range fighter aircraft, and ships with lower radar visibility. The Panel criticized various military programs, including the Army M1A2 tank upgrade, Crusader artillery, Comanche helicopter, Navy and Air Force F/A-18E/F, and F-22 programs. Congressional action included approving a measure for a Quadrennial Defense Review at the beginning of each new administration and ordering a review of the Army's Crusader artillery program. The SASC approved a measure for a Quadrennial Defense Review at the start of each new administration, preceded by strategy recommendations from a National Defense Panel. They also criticized the Army's Crusader artillery program and ordered a review in light of the Panel's argument. The authorization conference agreement requires a report on Crusader, while social issues like sexual harassment and gender-integrated training are debated in annual defense funding bills. This year's focus has been on sexual harassment cases in the Army and gender-integrated training. The main focus of discussion this year has been on the outcome of sexual harassment cases in the Army and gender-integrated training in the services. Last year, separate commissions were established by the Administration and Congress to review gender-integrated training, with recommendations made to improve recruitment and training, including providing separate units and barracks for men and women during basic training. The Kassebaum Baker commission made recommendations to improve recruitment and training, including separate units and barracks for men and women during basic training. The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services disagreed with the recommendation for greater gender separation. Secretary of Defense Cohen left the decision to each service. The DACOWITS disagreed with the Kassebaum Baker commission's recommendation for greater gender separation in training. Secretary of Defense Cohen left it to each service to decide on changes, with no services altering their policies yet. Congressional action included a provision for separate units and barracks for men and women in basic training, but no floor amendments were made to reverse this requirement. The HNSC version of the authorization bill included a provision for separate units and barracks for men and women in basic training. The House did not make any floor amendments to reverse this requirement. In contrast, SASC prohibited any changes until a congressionally-mandated commission reports. Senator Brownback proposed an amendment to insert the House language, but the Senate approved a substitute allowing current practices. The House and Senate were in disagreement on gender-integrated training. The Senate approved a Snowe substitute on June 24, allowing current unit training practices to continue but requiring separation of sleeping quarters for men and women in basic training. The authorization conference agreement also included a provision for separate training and a requirement for the Secretary of Defense and the President to display exemplary conduct. The authorization conference agreement allows current unit training practices to continue but requires separation of sleeping quarters for men and women in basic training. It also includes a \"sense of the House\" statement urging separate training and holding senior officials to exemplary standards. Defense health care issues, including the effectiveness of the Tricare program for defense dependents and health care benefits for military retirees, are under evaluation by Congress. Congress is evaluating the effectiveness of the Tricare program for defense dependents and health care benefits for military retirees. A demonstration program known as Medicare subvention was established to test alternative means of providing healthcare to retirees. HNSC and SASC took steps to ensure military retirees will continue to have access to health care at defense facilities. Congressional action was taken by HNSC and SASC to ensure that military retirees have access to healthcare at defense facilities. Demonstration projects were established to test alternative ways of providing healthcare to retirees, including allowing them to enroll in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP), providing Tricare benefits as a supplement to Medicare, and offering Tricare pharmacy benefits. The agreement includes three major demonstrations for providing continued healthcare to retirees: allowing enrollment in FEHBP, providing Tricare benefits as a supplement to Medicare, and offering Tricare pharmacy benefits. Defense appropriations bills have earmarked funds for medical research and development, including bone marrow transplants and cancer research. The Senate set aside $250 million for medical R&D earmarks in the defense appropriations bill. The Senate version of the defense appropriations bill allocated $250 million for medical R&D earmarks, with the Defense Department determining priorities. The full committee specified that funding for breast cancer and prostate cancer research should not be reduced below FY1998 levels. The House bill included separate amounts for various medical earmarks, while the appropriations conference agreement provided earmarked funds for programs like breast cancer and prostate cancer research. The appropriations conference agreement provides separate earmarked funds for medical programs, including breast cancer and prostate cancer research. The Defense Department faces potential computer problems due to Year 2000 issues. The House Appropriations Committee added $1.6 billion in emergency appropriations for defense. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $1.6 billion in emergency funding to help the Defense Department and the Treasury Department fix their computers for the Year 2000 issue. Despite criticism, the funding was approved, but the House Republican caucus later decided not to provide additional money for the \"Y2K\" problem as emergency appropriations. The House Republican caucus decided not to provide emergency funding for the \"Y2K\" problem, removing $1.6 billion in emergency funding from the defense appropriations bill. The issue was left to be addressed in a separate supplemental appropriations bill. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill provides $1.1 billion for the Defense Department for Y2K conversion. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill provides $1.1 billion for the Defense Department for Y2K conversion, with additional funding for other agencies. The defense authorization bill includes funding for Department of Energy weapons activities and Department of Defense activities, while DOE funding is allocated in a separate bill. Tritium production is a key issue in the defense authorization bill. The defense appropriations bill does not fund DOE, all DOE funding is in the energy and water development appropriations bill. A key issue in the defense authorization bill is tritium production for DOE nuclear weapons programs. The House-passed authorization bill includes a measure to prohibit DOE from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial reactors, requiring new facilities in South Carolina at an estimated cost of $3 billion. The Defense of Energy (DOE) may have to build new facilities in South Carolina to produce tritium for nuclear weapons, costing $3 billion over 40 years from commercial sources or $10 billion from new facilities. The Senate-passed bill allows DOE to choose the option, but implementation is delayed for a year for Congress to review. Senator Kyl was involved in the authorization conference. The conference agreement allows DOE to choose a long-term option for tritium production but delays implementation for Congress to review. Senator Kyl has objected to this provision, believing it is urgent for DOE to pursue a new tritium source. The Senate approved S.Con.Res. 86 (Domenici) and the House approved H.Con.Res. 284 (Kasich), setting forth the congressional budget for fiscal years 1998-2003.

Emergency funding from H.R. 4328 is not included. Congressional actions on defense-related appropriations and authorizations for FY1999 are detailed in Table 6. Final Congressional action on FY1999 Defense Appropriations Bill by Title shows budget authority in billions of dollars, with differences in account structure compared to authorization figures. Defense Health funding is allocated differently in authorization and appropriations bills. Sources: H.Rept. 105-532, S.Rept. 105-189, H.Rept. 105-736, H.Rept. 105-591, S.Rept. 105-200, H.Rept. 105-746. The annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of the Department of Defense (DOD) and other purposes, with funding in Operation and Maintenance and Defense Health allocated differently in authorization and appropriations bills. Total budget authority in billions of dollars is shown by Title in the final Congressional action on National Defense. Sources: H.Rept. 105-591; S.Rept. 105-200; H.Rept. 105-746. The annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of the Department of Defense (DOD) and other purposes, including military construction, energy and water development, and VA-HUD-independent agencies appropriations. The defense appropriations bill funds military activities of the Department of Defense (DOD), military family housing, atomic energy defense activities, civil defense activities, national security-related activities of the FBI, and some defense-related activities of the Coast Guard. The defense appropriations bill funds military activities of the Department of Defense (DOD), military family housing, atomic energy defense activities, civil defense activities, national security-related activities of the FBI, and some defense-related activities of the Coast Guard. The defense appropriations bill is the largest of the defense-related appropriations measures. The national defense budget function also includes mandatory funding, with a relatively small negative amount reflecting receipts from sales of items to the public. The mandatory funding for defense is a relatively small negative amount, mainly reflecting receipts from sales of items to the public. The Administration's defense budget request for FY1999 and projected defense budgets through FY2002 reflect the White House-congressional budget agreement finalized in June 1997. The recent House figures did not report national defense funding. The Administration's defense budget request for FY1999 and projected budgets through FY2002 show slow growth in defense budget authority, essentially flat when adjusted for inflation. This marks the end of a period of declining defense spending since the mid-1980s, with budget authority for national defense almost 38% below the FY1985 level by FY2003. The defense budget has steadily declined since the mid-1980s, with cuts achieved by reducing military force size and slowing weapons modernization. The Quadrennial Defense Review outlines plans for this. The defense budget cuts in recent years have mainly reduced military force size and slowed weapons modernization. The Quadrennial Defense Review plans to decrease active duty end-strength from 2.2 million in FY1987 to 1.36 million by FY2003, a 36% reduction. Funding for weapons acquisition has also decreased significantly, with proposed procurement funding 65% below FY1985 levels. The FY1999 budget requests $48.7 billion for weapons procurement and $36.1 billion for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E), which is significantly lower than previous levels. The Quadrennial Defense Review aims to increase procurement funding by reducing defense civilian personnel levels. The Administration projects $61.3 billion for procurement by FY2001, contingent on achieving certain goals. The Administration aims to increase procurement funding to $61.3 billion by FY2001 through reducing defense civilian personnel levels and controlling operation and maintenance expenses. Congress has consistently added to the defense budget request in the past three years. Congress has consistently added substantial amounts to the annual defense budget request in the past three years. However, due to last year's budget agreement, Congress has no room to add to the FY1999 request. Table C2 shows congressional additions to the request in recent years. Congressional additions to the Administration's national defense budget requests for FY1996-98 were significant, with adjustments made due to supplemental appropriations, rescissions, and technical changes. Sources include Department of Defense, Congressional Budget Office, and Office of Management and Budget. The current estimate for all years is from the Office of Management and Budget's \"Historical Tables: Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1999, Feb. 1998.\" Adjustments are made due to supplemental appropriations, rescissions, and technical changes, with significant technical adjustments in contract authority for Defense Working Capital Funds.
