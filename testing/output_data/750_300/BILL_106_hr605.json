Additionally, it includes provisions for the recall of retired judges. The \"Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Act of 1999\" allows the Court to recall retired judges for further service in accordance with Section 7257 of title 38, United States Code. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Act of 1999 allows retired judges to be recalled for further service by providing an irrevocable notice to the chief judge or clerk of the Court. A retired judge is defined as someone who retires from the Court under specific sections of the law, and a recall-eligible retired judge is one who has given such notice. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Act of 1999 allows retired judges to be recalled for further service by providing an irrevocable notice to the chief judge or clerk of the Court. A recall-eligible retired judge is defined as a retired judge who has given such notice, and the chief judge may recall them for a period not exceeding 90 days as needed. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Act of 1999 allows retired judges to be recalled for further service by providing an irrevocable notice to the chief judge or clerk of the Court. A recall-eligible retired judge may be recalled for up to 90 days per calendar year with their consent, not exceeding a total of 180 days. If a recall-eligible retired judge is recalled but declines to serve (except due to disability), they will be removed from recall status. A disabled recall-eligible retired judge unable to serve further will also be removed from recall status. A recall-eligible retired judge who becomes permanently disabled and unable to serve further will be removed from recall status. A recalled retired judge can exercise all powers and duties of an active judge. The pay of a recall-eligible retired judge is specified in the relevant section. A retired judge recalled under this section can exercise all powers and duties of an active judge. The pay for a recalled judge varies based on retirement status and is specified in the relevant section. The judge serving in recall status receives pay at the rate of an active judge, minus their annuity under chapter 83 or 84 of title 5. Retired judges recalled under this section have the same powers and duties as active judges. The section allows retired judges under chapter 83 or 84 of title 5 to serve as reemployed annuitants. SEC. 4 amends Section 7296(b) of title 38, United States Code, to only credit years of service as a judge of the Court for calculating an individual's service. Fractional parts of a year less than 183 days are disregarded, while 183 days or more are credited as a full year. SEC. 5 addresses judges' retired pay. The retired pay of a recall-eligible retired judge under section 7257 of title 38, United States Code, shall be the pay of a judge of the court. The retired pay of a judge removed from recall status due to disability shall be the pay of a judge of the court. If a judge did not provide notice of availability for service in a recalled status at retirement, their retired pay will be based on their rate of pay at retirement. If a judge was recall-eligible and removed from recall status, their retired pay will be based on the pay of a judge of the court. The retired pay of a judge removed from recall status due to disability shall be the pay of a judge of the court. If a judge was recall-eligible and removed from recall status, their retired pay will be based on the pay of a judge at the time of removal from recall status. Cost-of-living adjustments provided by law in annuities under civil service retirement laws shall apply to retired pay. Cost-of-Living Adjustments: A cost-of-living adjustment in retired pay applies only to retired pay computed under specific conditions. If the adjustment would exceed the annual rate of pay for a retired chief judge, it may be adjusted accordingly. Cost-of-Living Adjustments: If a cost-of-living adjustment would result in retired pay exceeding the annual rate of pay for a retired chief judge, the adjustment can only be made to equal that annual rate of pay. For retired judges other than chief judges, adjustments are limited to prevent exceeding the annual rate of pay for judges of the court. Cost-of-Living Adjustments: For retired judges (excluding chief judges), adjustments are limited to prevent their retired pay from exceeding the annual rate of pay for judges of the court.
