    "content": "The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was established in 1967 under the U.S. Department of Transportation to investigate civil aviation accidents and other transportation accidents. In 1974, the Independent Safety Board Act made NTSB independent of DOT, allowing unbiased investigations and safety recommendations. The NTSB's main role is determining accident causes. The NTSB, an independent agency, conducts unbiased investigations and makes safety recommendations without conflicts of interest. It determines accident causes, recommends safety improvements, assists victims' families in disasters, and serves as a board of appeals for transportation regulatory actions. The agency lacks authority to enforce its recommendations or regulate. The NTSB is an independent agency that conducts unbiased investigations, makes safety recommendations, and serves as a board of appeals for transportation regulatory actions. It does not have the authority to enforce its recommendations or regulate safety practices in the transportation sector. The agency consists of a five-member board and approximately 420 staff, with three-quarters located at its Washington, DC headquarters and four regional offices in Ashburn, VA. The NTSB consists of a five-member board and approximately 420 staff, with three-quarters located at its Washington, DC headquarters and four regional offices in Ashburn, VA; Denver, CO; Federal Way, WA; and Anchorage, AK. The NTSB also has a training center in Ashburn, VA. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 requires the agency to maintain at least one full-time employee in every state located more than 1,000 miles from the nearest regional office for initial investigative response to accidents. This impacts Hawaii directly. The NTSB Reauthorization Act of 2006 mandates the NTSB to have at least one full-time employee in states over 1,000 miles from a regional office for accident response. This affects Hawaii, where the NTSB does not have a field office. Currently, the NTSB has one aviation safety investigator in Hawaii, and regional staff are dispersed in 25 states. Board members serve five-year terms and can continue beyond their terms until replaced. The NTSB regional staff is dispersed in 25 states, with Safety Board members serving five-year terms and potentially continuing beyond until replacements are appointed. Board members must have technical qualifications and knowledge of transportation safety issues. Investigative and support staff are organized by transportation mode, with research and engineering supporting all modal offices. The NTSB has separate offices for each transportation mode, with research and engineering supporting all modal offices. It also serves as a court of appeals for airmen and mariners facing administrative actions by the FAA or Coast Guard, with cases initially adjudicated by the NTSB's Office of Administrative Law Judges. Additionally, the NTSB has an Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications responsible for tracking correspondence and actions related to safety recommendations. The NTSB's Office of Safety Recommendations and Communications coordinates communications with Congress, transportation stakeholders, and the public regarding Board actions and transportation safety advocacy. They track correspondence and actions taken in response to safety recommendations for transportation-related accidents. The NTSB investigates transportation-related accidents involving civil aircraft, public aircraft, highway and railroad grade crossing accidents, railroad accidents with passenger trains, pipeline accidents, and major marine casualties. The NTSB investigates transportation accidents involving property or environmental damage, loss of life, major marine casualties, and other catastrophic incidents. They rely on expertise from various sources to assist in investigations. The NTSB relies on manufacturers, transportation providers, and regulatory agencies to assist in investigations through the \"party process,\" where qualified technical personnel are assigned to work with NTSB investigators. Safeguards are in place to prevent external entities from influencing NTSB findings and conclusions. The NTSB works with manufacturers, transportation providers, and regulatory agencies in investigations through the \"party process.\" Safeguards are in place to prevent external influence on NTSB findings. Interested parties can provide technical expertise and submit analyses, but NTSB bases conclusions strictly on its own staff's analysis. Formal procedures allow parties to petition for reconsideration of investigative findings after the final report is adopted. The NTSB allows parties to petition for reconsideration of investigative findings after the final report is adopted. Parties can be sanctioned or lose their status if they do not comply with rules. The Safety Board must meet in public on most matters related to accident investigations. The NTSB, governed by the Government in the Sunshine Act, must meet publicly for accident investigations. Financial disclosures are required for board members and staff to prevent conflicts of interest. Despite safeguards, outside influence could impact the NTSB's impartiality and credibility. Balancing unique data from parties with maintaining impartiality is crucial. The NTSB faces challenges in maintaining impartiality and credibility during accident investigations, balancing unique data from involved parties while preventing outside influence. Evaluating competing perspectives can prolong investigations. The NTSB participates in complex and contentious accident investigations, following international aviation investigation standards. They may assist in foreign investigations involving U.S.-manufactured aircraft, even without a vested interest. The NTSB may assist in foreign aviation accident investigations involving U.S.-manufactured aircraft, even without a vested interest. They may be reimbursed for costs by outside entities such as foreign governments. Prior to legislative changes, only reimbursements related to NTSB Academy activities were credited as offsetting collections. The NTSB has also recovered costs from foreign aviation accident investigations through DOT's Safe Skies for Africa program. The NTSB has recovered costs from foreign aviation accident investigations through DOT's Safe Skies for Africa program, ranging from $1 million to $2.4 million annually between FY2012 and FY2015. They issue safety recommendations to effect change in transportation safety regulations and practices. The NTSB issues safety recommendations to regulators, operators, and users of transportation systems to improve safety. Since 1967, over 14,300 recommendations have been made, with 82% leading to safety improvements. The NTSB does not have direct authority to change regulations but influences change through recommendations. Since 1967, the NTSB has issued over 14,300 safety recommendations across transportation modes. About 82% of these recommendations have led to safety improvements. DOT agencies must respond within 90 days, but there is no requirement to adopt NTSB recommendations. The NTSB advocates for transportation safety through its recommendations. The NTSB issues safety recommendations, but agencies are not required to adopt them. The NTSB advocates for safety improvements, but implementation can be delayed due to various factors. The NTSB does not consider cost when developing recommendations. The NTSB issues safety recommendations without considering cost. They highlight key safety improvements on a \"Most Wanted\" list, focusing on reducing fatigue-related accidents, improving rail transit safety oversight, promoting collision avoidance technologies in vehicles, and enhancing occupant protection on highways. The NTSB issues safety recommendations on a \"Most Wanted\" list, focusing on reducing fatigue-related accidents, improving rail transit safety oversight, promoting collision avoidance technologies, enhancing occupant protection, minimizing operator distractions, preventing loss of control in flight, promoting rail safety initiatives, ending substance impairment, and requiring operators to be medically fit for duty. The NTSB issues safety recommendations on a \"Most Wanted\" list, focusing on various transportation safety improvements, including promoting rail safety initiatives, ending substance impairment, and requiring operators to be medically fit for duty. These recommendations influence regulatory agendas and congressional decision-making. The NTSB's safety recommendations and advocacy programs have influenced transportation agencies and congressional decision-making, leading to legislation and regulations for various safety measures in transportation, such as positive train control systems, airline pilot fatigue reduction, distracted driving laws, helicopter air ambulance safety standards, and pipeline safety improvements. For example, the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 drew on NTSB investigations and recommendations. The FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016 implemented safety standards for helicopter air ambulances and pipeline safety. Provisions include a deadline for an airline pilot records database and modifications to pilot training to ensure proficiency in monitoring automated systems. The NTSB raised concerns about pilot training to verify skills in monitoring automated systems and controlling flightpath without autopilot. FAA directed to assess mental health screening recommendations for pilots. International focus on pilot mental health after 2015 suicide incident. Section 2103 of the act directs FAA to assess recommendations by the Pilot Fitness Aviation Rulemaking Committee on mental health screening for pilots. The NTSB had previously raised concerns about pilot mental health following past aviation incidents. Section 2105 mandates FAA to evaluate and update standards for crash-resistant helicopter fuel systems. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 included provisions to increase pipeline safety. Section 2105 mandates FAA to evaluate and update standards for crash-resistant helicopter fuel systems, in response to a NTSB safety recommendation. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 included provisions to enhance pipeline safety, such as increasing federal inspectors, requiring automatic shutoff valves, verifying operating pressure, raising penalties for violations, and reviewing diluted bitumen pipeline regulations. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 aimed to improve gas transmission pipeline safety, increase penalties for violations, and review diluted bitumen pipeline regulations. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 mandated positive train control on railroads to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher error. Positive train control is a communication and signaling system identified by the NTSB to prevent incidents caused by operator or dispatcher error, reducing incidents due to excessive speed, conflicting train movements, and engineer failure to obey signals. NTSB also aims to minimize operator distractions that cause transportation accidents. Congress established a distracted driving incentive grant program. The NTSB lists minimizing operator distractions as a key safety improvement. Congress established a distracted driving grant program in 2012 to encourage states to prohibit texting and cell-phone use for drivers under 18. Only one state qualified for a grant in FY2014 and FY2015. In FY2014 and FY2015, only one state qualified for a distracted driving grant program that encouraged states to prohibit texting and cell-phone use for drivers under 18. A provision in the FAST Act in December 2015 removed the requirement for increased fines for repeat offenders, allowing more states to qualify for grants. The status of agency actions on transportation safety mandates is of interest. The NTSB funding includes a base authorization, emergency fund, and supplemental appropriations for large investigations like TWA flight 800. Agency actions on transportation safety mandates are of interest during NTSB reauthorization proceedings. The NTSB has an emergency fund for unforeseen accident costs and large investigations like TWA flight 800. The fund has a $2 million maintenance balance with authorization to increase up to $4 million, but has not been used in over a decade. The NTSB has an emergency fund with a $4 million authorized limit that has not been used in over a decade. The GAO evaluates the NTSB's operations and activities related to various management aspects. The NTSB has been responsive to GAO findings and fully implemented recommendations from 2006 to 2008. In 2012, all 21 recommendations were effectively implemented. In 2013, improvements were noted but further efforts were needed in training center utilization and safety recommendation close-out processes. In 2013, GAO revisited NTSB management and operational practices, finding improvements were made but further efforts were needed in training center utilization, safety recommendation close-out processes, interagency communications, financial management, and workforce diversity management. GAO recommended developing a specific strategy for maximizing the utility of the NTSB's cost accounting system. Current issues may include staffing adequacy in proposed legislation reauthorizing the NTSB. The NTSB is advised to develop a strategy to maximize the utility of its cost accounting system. Current issues include staffing resources, management of the NTSB Academy, recoverability of vehicle recorders in accidents, privacy of data collected, and potential alternative uses of recorder data. Legislation on railroad safety is also being considered. The NTSB is addressing staffing resources, management of the NTSB Academy, recoverability of vehicle recorders, privacy of data collected, and potential alternative uses of recorder data. Legislation on railroad safety is also being considered, with a focus on NTSB funding and resources for railroad accident investigations. Staffing has increased by 12% over the past decade, below the requested 22% increase in FY2008. The NTSB has increased staffing by roughly 12% over the past decade, below the requested 22% increase in FY2008. Despite this, limited resources have led to extended accident investigations and the failure to investigate some pipeline and railroad accidents. The NTSB has cited limited resources as a factor in extended accident investigations and failure to investigate some pipeline and railroad accidents, especially fatal grade crossing and trespasser accidents. Congress may debate the need for additional staffing to meet statutory requirements for investigating all fatal railroad accidents. Congress may debate the need for additional staffing at the NTSB to investigate all fatal railroad accidents and address potential staffing shortages due to retirements and emerging skill gaps. The NTSB has raised concerns about recruiting and retaining field investigators, specialists in critical science and engineering fields, and professionals with unique operational experience in transportation modes. The NTSB faces staffing challenges in its Office of Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials. The National Transportation Safety Board Amendments Act of 2000 granted the NTSB authority to enter agreements for facilities, technical services, and training in accident investigation theory and practice. The Transportation Safety Board Amendments Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-424) authorized the NTSB to enter agreements for facilities and training. A 20-year contract was awarded to George Washington University for a training site in Ashburn, VA. Despite efforts to achieve financial self-sufficiency, the NTSB Training Center has not been successful. The NTSB Training Center, established in August 2003, has struggled to achieve financial self-sufficiency despite efforts mandated by P.L. 109-443. The center's main purpose is to train NTSB staff and industry personnel for accident investigations and victim assistance. It also serves as a venue for transportation safety forums and meetings. The NTSB Training Center, established in 2003, aims to assist in accident investigations and victim support. Despite efforts to increase revenue through training and safety-related meetings, the center has struggled to cover costs. The NTSB has turned to leasing out space for non-transportation purposes but still faces financial challenges. The NTSB Training Center, established in 2003, aims to assist in accident investigations and victim support. Despite efforts to increase revenue through training and safety-related meetings, the center has struggled to cover costs. The NTSB leases out space for non-transportation purposes but has not fully recovered training center costs. A 2006 GAO study highlighted financial challenges and violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act in lease negotiations. The NTSB violated the Anti-Deficiency Act by negotiating an operating lease instead of a capital lease for the NTSB Academy facility without obtaining budget authority for the full term. Possible remedies include obtaining a deficiency appropriation, renegotiating the lease, terminating it, or obligating lease payments annually. GAO suggested vacating the space as a cost-effective strategy, but the benefits of the facility were not fully considered. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) suggested possible remedies for the NTSB Academy facility lease violation, including renegotiating the lease, terminating it, or obligating lease payments annually. GAO noted that vacating the space could be cost-effective, but the benefits of the facility were not fully considered. Congressional oversight and legislation may be needed to address the specific issue of maintaining the training center. GAO found that the NTSB had improved classroom utilization at the training center. The NTSB training center has improved its utilization and lease revenue, resulting in better cost recovery. The annual operating deficit has decreased from $6.3 million in FY2004 to $2 million-$2.5 million in FY2013-FY2015. However, the facility still does not cover all operating costs. Congressional oversight and possible legislation may be necessary to address this issue. The NTSB training center has seen improvements in utilization and lease revenue, reducing the annual operating deficit from $6.3 million in FY2004 to $2 million-$2.5 million in FY2013-FY2015. However, the facility still does not cover all operating costs. Congressional oversight may be needed to address this issue. Data recorders are crucial investigative tools in aviation, but there are concerns about prompt recovery after accidents. Data and voice recorders are vital tools in aviation investigations since the 1960s. Two main issues exist: prompt recovery of accident recorders, especially from submerged aircraft, and concerns about privacy and public disclosures of recorder data. Recent challenges in recovering recorders include the Air France flight 447 crash in 2009. The recovery of flight recorders from recent accidents has been challenging. Air France flight 447 and EgyptAir flight 804 both experienced delays in retrieving their recorders, with Malaysia Airlines flight 370 still missing. The NTSB issued aviation safety recommendations in January 2015. Malaysia Airlines flight 370 remains missing after disappearing during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. The NTSB issued aviation safety recommendations in January 2015 urging for improved data transmission capabilities for overwater flights. The NTSB recommended improved data transmission capabilities for overwater flights, including location and flight data recorders with essential parameters, protections against disabling devices, and cockpit image recorders. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 would require certain large passenger aircraft to have continuous tracking technology. The Safe Aviation and Flight Emergency Tracking Act of 2015 (H.R. 753) would mandate FAA regulations for large passenger aircraft to have continuous tracking technology, including automatic deployable flight recorders. The sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo vessel El Faro in 2015 raised concerns about recovering maritime voyage data recorders. The sinking of the U.S.-flag cargo vessel El Faro in October 2015 raised concerns about recovering maritime voyage data recorders, which are required for certain passenger and large cargo vessels under SOLAS regulations. The vessel's data recorder was recovered 10 months after the accident at a depth of 15,000 feet. According to SOLAS regulations, certain passenger and large cargo vessels must carry voyage data recorders, which can be retrievable fixed-mount units or float-free units. New regulations require new ships to have both types of recorders, capturing additional parameters and data for longer periods. Existing ships with older recorders are not required to upgrade. The NTSB has not specified recommendations for maritime voyage data recorder recovery or survivability. Concerns over data recovery may lead to congressional interest in aiding investigators with data retrieval from sunken vessels. Event recorders are aiding accident investigations in various transportation modes. Interest in potential options to assist investigators in recovering data from vessels lost in deep water, including event recorders used in accident investigations across different transportation modes. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 aims to restrict access to data recorded by event data recorders in passenger vehicles to protect privacy. The Driver Privacy Act of 2015 (S. 766) aims to restrict access to data from event data recorders in passenger vehicles to protect privacy, allowing access only with owner's consent or authorized by a court or investigative authority. The bill aims to restrict access to data from event data recorders in passenger vehicles for specific purposes such as vehicle diagnostics, emergency medical response, and traffic safety research, with limitations on disclosing personally identifiable information. The bill aims to restrict access to data from event data recorders in passenger vehicles for specific purposes while requiring the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to study and regulate the appropriate data capture time for investigating motor vehicle crashes. The NTSB has highlighted the need for improved railroad accident investigations and safety measures following recent incidents. Increased interest in railroad accident investigations and safety recommendations have been prompted by incidents such as derailments of freight trains carrying flammable fuels. The NTSB lacks resources to investigate all required railroad accidents, leading to proposed appropriations of $6.3 million in FY2016 to $6.6 million in FY2018 for railroad accident investigations. The Comprehensive Transportation and Consumer Protection Act of 2015 (S. 1732) authorizes appropriations to the NTSB for railroad accident investigations, with funding increasing from $6.3 million in FY2016 to $6.6 million in FY2019. The bill addresses NTSB safety recommendations, requires plans for positive train control systems, and allows for grants to implement these plans. Additionally, it directs a study on the effectiveness of these systems in reducing highway-rail grade crossing accidents."
