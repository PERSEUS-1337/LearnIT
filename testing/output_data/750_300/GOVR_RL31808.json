    "content": "President Bush signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, which included the Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill. The total funding agreed upon was $89.8 billion, with an additional $1.1 billion allocated for transportation and election reform projects. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 included $1.1 billion for transportation and election reform projects in Division H. Congress passed a continuing resolution for FY2004 funding, extending it to January 31, 2004. The Senate passed its version of the FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill with a recommended $91.0 billion, $5.1 billion more than the Administration requested. The Senate passed its version of the FY2004 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill with a recommended $91.0 billion, $5.1 billion more than the Administration requested. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 2989, providing $85.8 billion, including additional funding for highways and the deletion of grants-in-aid to airports. The Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriation bill provides $85.8 billion, with key differences including $4.4 billion in highway funding and the deletion of $3.4 billion for airport grants. This change was due to a point of order against funding administrative expenses from contract authority. Beginning in FY2004, appropriations for the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Treasury are being considered together. Starting in FY2004, appropriations for the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Treasury are being considered together in a single appropriations bill. This change was a result of the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the reorganization of subcommittee structures in the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security led to the consolidation of subcommittees in the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, resulting in a single appropriations bill for the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Treasury. Additionally, agencies such as the United States Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Customs Service, and United States Secret Service were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was established, leading to the transfer of various agencies from the Department of Transportation and the Department of the Treasury to DHS. Budget numbers were adjusted for comparison, and the House and Senate divided their appropriation bills differently. The House and Senate divided their appropriation bills differently, with the House having six titles and the Senate having five titles. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution included a 0.65% across-the-board rescission for the Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury. The FY2003 figures in this report reflect the rescission. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution included a 0.65% across-the-board rescission for the Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury. The Administration's FY2004 budget request for these departments was $85.9 billion, $740 million below the final FY2003-enacted figure. The FY2004 budget request for the Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury was $85.9 billion, $740 million lower than the FY2003-enacted figure. Funding allocation details can be found in Table 2. The FY2004 budget request for the Department of Transportation and Department of the Treasury was $85.9 billion, $740 million lower than the FY2003-enacted figure. The Senate divides the budget differently from the House, putting the Postal Service into the \"Related Agencies\" Title. During House deliberations on H.R. 2989, funding for two programs was removed due to disputes over the way funds were provided: FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program ($3.425 billion) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement program ($47 million). This reduced total transportation funding in the bill from $58.4 billion to $54.9 billion, and total funding in the bill dropped from $89.3 billion to $85.8 billion. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 reduced transportation funding by $3.425 billion for FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program and $47 million for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement program. Total funding in the bill decreased from $89.3 billion to $85.8 billion. Table 3 shows Funding Trends for Transportation/Treasury Appropriations from FY1999 to FY2004. Figures have been adjusted for comparison purposes, including subtracting certain agencies and adding others. Source: United States House of Representatives, Committee on Appropriations. The Transportation/Treasury appropriations funding trends from FY1999 to FY2004 have been adjusted for comparison by subtracting and adding various agencies. The Transportation/Treasury appropriations funding trends from FY1999 to FY2004 have been adjusted for comparison by subtracting and adding various agencies. The Law Enforcement Training Center and related agencies' appropriations for FY1999-FY2003 were adjusted. FY2001 and FY2003 figures include across-the-board rescissions. The Administration's FY2004 budget proposed a DOT budget of $54.3 billion, 2.6% below FY2003's enacted level. The Administration's FY2004 budget proposed a DOT budget of $54.3 billion, 2.6% below FY2003's enacted level. The budget request aligned with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century and the Wendell Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act of the 21st Century, with some proposed changes to the highway and transit funding structure. The Administration's FY2004 budget proposed a DOT budget of $54.3 billion, 2.6% below FY2003's enacted level. The request included changes to the highway and transit funding structure in line with the Administration's reauthorization proposal. Figures from an FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill Conference Report Budget Authority table were used for the appropriations. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations bill Conference Report Budget Authority table provided by the House Committee on Appropriations showed discrepancies in totals due to differing treatment of offsets. Figures may vary slightly from the text due to supplemental appropriations, rescissions, and other funding actions. Funding for two programs was struck during House deliberations on H.R. 2989. During House deliberations on H.R. 2989, funding for two programs was struck due to disputes over the way funds were being provided: FAA's Grants-in-Aid to Airports program ($3.425 billion) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Border Enforcement program ($47 million). This reduced total transportation funding in the bill by those amounts, with the possibility of restoration in conference. The curr_chunk discusses the reduction in transportation funding for various programs, including the Essential Air Service program and the Appalachian Development Highway System. The total FY2004 funding would be $102 million for the Essential Air Service program. Additionally, Congress provided an additional $111.5 million for grants to states for motor carrier safety. The FY2004 funding for various transportation programs was reduced, with $102 million allocated for the Essential Air Service program. Additionally, Congress provided an extra $111.5 million for motor carrier safety grants to states. NHTSA's FY2004 request included $100 million transferred from FHWA, resulting in a difference of $131 million in budgetary resources compared to FY2003. The FY2004 funding for transportation programs was reduced, with $102 million for Essential Air Service and $111.5 million for motor carrier safety grants. NHTSA's budgetary resources for FY2004 differed by $131 million from FY2003 due to a $100 million transfer from FHWA. Amtrak's $100 million loan repayment was postponed in FY2003 and again in FY2004. RSPA's total resources for FY2003 were $119 million, and for FY2004, $132 million, excluding $14 million in permanent appropriations. Rescissions of unobligated contract authority from previous years were subtracted from the total. The total resources for RSPA for FY2003 were $119 million and for FY2004 were $132 million. Rescissions of unobligated contract authority from previous years were subtracted from the total. The FAA was provided with $13.93 billion in FY2004, excluding an across-the-board rescission. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 provides the FAA with $13.93 billion in funding, a $440 million increase from FY2003. The majority of the increased funding would be used for Operations & Maintenance. The funding for the FAA in FY2004 differs slightly from the amounts proposed in legislative bills. The majority of the increased funding would be used for Operations & Maintenance expenses, with no major new initiatives. The FAA funding mainly comes from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, with O&M funding using a mix of trust fund and Treasury general fund monies. In FY2002, a Treasury general fund contribution of $1.1 billion was provided for O&M funding. The FAA funding in FY2004 saw an increase in Treasury general fund contributions for Operations & Maintenance expenses. The Administration proposed $3.3 billion for FY2003, which was ultimately agreed upon at $3.4 billion. For FY2004, the House Appropriations Committee initially suggested $1.5 billion from general funds. The FAA funding for FY2004 saw an increase in Treasury general fund contributions, with the House and Senate ultimately agreeing on $3.4 billion. The FY2004 Act raised the general fund contribution to $4.5 billion, a significant increase from the initial proposal of $1.5 billion. This funding split has been a key aspect of the annual FAA budget debate. The FY2004 Act increased the general fund contribution to $4.5 billion, a significant rise from the initial proposal of $1.5 billion. This funding split has been a crucial part of the annual FAA budget debate. Additionally, $7.5 billion was allocated for FY2004 Operations and Maintenance spending, a notable increase from the previous year's level. The FY2004 Act increased funding for FAA personnel salaries, air traffic control system costs, and safety-related activities. The Facilities and Equipment budget saw a slight decrease to $2.91 billion, aligning with proposed spending cuts. The FY2004 Act reduced funding for Facilities and Equipment (F&E) to $2.91 billion, in line with proposed spending cuts. A Senate proposal to transfer $100 million of F&E funds to the Airport Improvement Program was dropped. Unobligated F&E funds of $30 million are subject to rescission. F&E funding is primarily used for capital investment in air traffic control and safety, with no significant new spending initiatives in P.L. 108-199. The FY2004 Act reduced F&E funding to $2.91 billion, with no significant new initiatives in P.L. 108-199. RE&D received $119.4 million, below FY2003 levels. EAS program is funded through user fees collected from overflights of US territory. The EAS program, funded through user fees from overflights of US territory, received $102 million in FY2003, below the authorized $50 million annual funding level. Additional funding was sourced from other sources to support the program, which continues to have strong congressional backing. The EAS program received $102 million in FY2003 from user fees and other sources. In FY2004, $102 million was allocated, with $50 million from regular authorization and $52 million from the aviation trust fund. The Act does not rely on the overflight fee as its main funding source and precludes funding for a pilot cost-sharing program included in FAA reauthorization legislation. The FY2004 Act allocates $102 million for the EAS program, rejecting calls to reduce its size and requiring local contributions. It also excludes a provision for improved program coordination and funding reporting from communities receiving EAS assistance. The FY2004 Act allocates $102 million for the EAS program, requiring local contributions at each airport. The House provision for improved program coordination and funding reporting from communities receiving EAS assistance is excluded. The Airport Improvement Program provides grants for airport development and planning, with the FY2004 budget proposal requesting $3.4 billion for AIP. The House-reported bill recommends $3.425 billion for AIP, including $20 million for the Small Community Air Service Program. The House-reported bill recommended $3.425 billion for AIP, $25 million above the Administration's proposal. It also recommended $20 million in AIP funds for the Small Community Air Service Program. The House-passed bill, H.R. 2989, contained no funding for AIP, while the Senate-passed bill provided $3.5 billion for AIP. The AIP provision was removed from the House-passed bill, H.R. 2989, resulting in no funding for AIP. The Senate-passed bill, H.R. 2989 as amended by S. 1589, allocated $3.5 billion for AIP, with $100 million transferred from the F&E account. Priority was given to projects at 241 airports, and AIP grants could not be used for installing bulk explosive detection systems. The report language for AIP discretionary grants prioritized projects at 241 airports and prohibited using grants for installing bulk explosive detection systems. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 provided $3.4 billion for AIP, excluding a $100 million transfer from the F&E account. Prohibitions included replacing baggage conveyor systems and reconfiguring terminal baggage areas for bulk explosive detection systems. The Senate-passed bill prohibits using AIP grants for certain airport improvements and implementing a ten-city Essential Air Service program. The conference report lists nearly 150 airports for projects totaling just under $258 million. The FHWA budget provides funding for Federal-Aid Highway projects. The conference report (H.Rept. 108-401) identifies nearly 150 airports for projects totaling just under $258 million in funding for the Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP) under the FHWA budget. The President's FY2004 request for FHWA was $30.2 billion, a decrease of $2.2 billion from the previous year. The proposed obligation limitation was set at $29.3 billion, lower than the enacted amount for FY2003. The President's FY2004 request for FHWA was $30.2 billion, a decrease of $2.2 billion from the previous year. The proposed obligation limitation was set at $29.3 billion, significantly less than the enacted amount for FY2003. Funding for exempt programs was set at $931 million, up $38 million from FY2003. The budget proposed some changes reflecting the Administration's surface transportation reauthorization proposal, including a new $1.0 billion Infrastructure Performance and Maintenance initiative. The President's FY2004 request for FHWA was $30.2 billion, with a proposed $1.0 billion Infrastructure Performance and Maintenance initiative. Funds would be distributed for \"ready-to-go\" projects addressing congestion and infrastructure conditions, with states required to commit funds within six months. Revenues from the 2.5 cents-per-gallon excise tax would be redirected. The House-passed FY2004 Appropriations bill (H.R. 2989; H.Rept.108-243) allocated $34.6 billion for FHWA, $2.2 billion more than FY2003. Funds needed to be committed by states within six months, with reallocation if not done. Revenues from the 2.5 cents-per-gallon excise tax on gasohol would be redirected to the highway trust fund, adding $600 million in FY2004. Legislation would be required for this change. The House-passed FY2004 Appropriations bill (H.R. 2989; H.Rept.108-243) allocated $34.6 billion for FHWA, $2.2 billion more than FY2003. Legislation would be required for redirecting revenues from the gasohol excise tax to the highway trust fund, adding $600 million in FY2004. The House bill set the obligation limitation at $33.4 billion, with heavily earmarked federal-aid highway discretionary programs. The Senate-passed FY2004 bill also included significant funding for FHWA. The Senate-passed FY2004 appropriations bill provided $34.8 billion for FHWA, with $931 million for exempt obligations. The discretionary programs were heavily earmarked, and the obligation limitation was set at $33.8 billion, $500 million above the House bill. The Senate's FY2004 appropriations bill allocated $34.7 billion for FHWA, with $931 million for exempt obligations. The discretionary programs were heavily earmarked, and the obligation limitation was set roughly $500 million above the House bill. Additionally, $175 million was directed for surface transportation projects. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 allocated $34.7 billion for FHWA, slightly higher than the House total and slightly lower than the Senate total. This represents an increase of over 6% from FY2003. The discretionary programs were heavily earmarked, following the trend from previous appropriations bills. The FY2004 conference agreement heavily earmarked all discretionary programs under FHWA control, including Interstate Discretionary, Bridge Discretionary, Ferry Boats, TCSP, National Corridor Planning, and CORBOR. This was a departure from traditional practice in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 earmarked funds for various programs under FHWA control, including TCSP and CORBOR. In a departure from traditional practice, funds were also earmarked for core formula programs that were previously under state control. Section 115 of Division F in the Conference Report earmarked over $1 billion of unobligated core program funds. Section 115 of Division F in the Conference Report earmarks over $1 billion of unobligated core program funds for projects eligible under state's distributed core program funds or STP funds distribution. The federal share for earmarked projects is 100%, a departure from past practice of 80% or 90%. The federal share for earmarked projects is 100%, a departure from past practice of 80% or 90%. Nearly $300 million unobligated core formula funds are allocated for interagency transfers and project earmarks, with a majority going to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the National Highway Traffic. The act allocates nearly $300 million unobligated core formula funds for interagency transfers and project earmarks. Most of the funds go to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Additionally, funds are provided for construction of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House and for Amber Alert grants. There is also an additional $150 million for the Appalachian Development Highway System, with a 100% federal share. The act provides $150 million for the Appalachian Development Highway System, with $75 million earmarked. It also adds 65 miles to the system. The TEA-21 Funding Framework is extended until February 29, 2004, with new authorizing legislation expected to retain similar provisions. The TEA-21 Funding Framework is extended until February 29, 2004, with existing programs operating on extensions. Any new legislation is expected to maintain current program funding. Highway programs within FHWA are mostly continued from previous legislation. The TEA-21 Funding Framework extended existing highway and transit programs from the ISTEA legislation. FHWA oversees various federal-aid highway programs like NHS, IM, STP, BRR, and CMAQ, which receive annual apportionment by formula. The TEA-21 Funding Framework extended existing highway and transit programs like NHS, IM, STP, BRR, and CMAQ, which receive annual apportionment by formula. In addition to these programs, there is a separate category of highway funding that includes minimum guarantee funding and emergency relief, which are not subject to annual obligation limitations. The TEA-21 Funding Framework extended existing highway and transit programs like NHS, IM, STP, BRR, and CMAQ, which receive annual apportionment by formula. In addition, there is annual authorization of minimum guarantee funding ($639 million per fiscal year) and emergency relief ($100 million per fiscal year) that are not subject to obligation limitations. The \"allocated\" programs, under the direct control of FHWA or other governmental entities, include the Federal Lands Highway Program, High Priority Projects, Appalachian Development Highway System roads, National Corridor Planning, Border Infrastructure Program, and other small programs. The FMCSA, created in 2000 under the MCSIA, enforces regulations for interstate commercial truck and bus operations. It also administers various programs related to motor carrier safety. FMCSA enforces federal motor carrier safety regulations for interstate commercial truck and bus operations, administers grants and programs for truck and bus safety activities, conducts inspections of Mexican-domiciled commercial drivers and vehicles entering the United States, advances Intelligent Transportation Systems, and reviews carriers transporting property and passengers. Funding for FMCSA activities comes from the federal Highway Trust Fund.

Funding for FMCSA comes from the federal Highway Trust Fund, with an FY2004 budget request of $447 million, a 43% increase from the previous year. The FY2004 Administration requested $447 million for the FMCSA, a 43% increase from the previous year. The conference committee allocated $366 million for administrative expenses and motor carrier safety grants. Additional funding of $111.5 million was provided for other FMCSA programs and activities under the FHWA miscellaneous appropriation. The conference agreement allocated $190 million for motor carrier safety grants and information systems, along with an additional $111.5 million for various other FMCSA programs and activities. The budget for FMCSA's administrative and operations expenses in FY2004 was $176 million, which includes funds for research, technology, and regulatory development. Activities funded include enforcement to reduce unsafe carriers and drivers. The House, Senate, and conferees agreed on funding of $176 million for FMCSA activities, including enforcement, outreach, and establishment of a medical review board. Core expenses supported by these funds include rent, administrative infrastructure, personnel compensation, and outreach efforts. The FMCSA activities supported by funds include personnel compensation, outreach efforts, advancing truck and bus standards, and establishing a medical review board. The FY2004 budget request varied between $190 million and $237 million. The FY2004 budget for FMCSA activities was between $190 million and $237 million. These funds support agency information systems and grants for the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program, which helps states enforce commercial vehicle safety regulations. The FY2004 budget for FMCSA activities includes funding for the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) to help states enforce commercial vehicle safety regulations. MCSAP grants cover up to 80% of state truck and bus safety program costs, with additional funding for roadside inspections and border inspection stations. The conference agreement allocates $170 million for MCSAP and $20 million for information systems and safety initiatives. The FY2004 conference agreement includes $170 million for MCSAP, $20 million for information systems and safety initiatives, and an additional $111.5 million for FHWA miscellaneous initiatives such as southern border inspection facilities, operations grants, and CDL improvement grants. NHTSA funding supports behavioral and vehicle programs to improve traffic safety. NHTSA funding of $665 million supports programs to improve traffic safety by reducing impaired driving, increasing occupant protection, improving police traffic services, enhancing emergency medical responses, ensuring compliance with safety regulations, and addressing emerging vehicle safety issues. Grants are also provided to states for highway traffic safety programs. The Administration requested $665 million for NHTSA in FY2004, an increase of $231 million from FY2003. $447 million was designated for various highway traffic safety programs. The Administration requested $665 million for NHTSA in FY2004, with $447 million allocated for traffic safety incentive grants to states and $218 million for NHTSA's operations and research activities to reduce highway fatalities and prevent injuries. Funding was also designated for research and analysis on crash statistics and vehicle performance. The Administration's request for NHTSA in FY2004 included $218 million for operations and research activities to reduce highway fatalities and prevent injuries. This funding covered research, highway safety programs, safety assurance, and safety performance standards. The House, Senate, and conference agreement recommended funding amounts for NHTSA and FRA in FY2004. NHTSA would receive $451.1 million, with $225 million for highway traffic safety grants and $222.5 million for operations and research. FRA's funding would be $1.455 billion, with the Administration requesting $1.09 billion and the Senate agreeing to $1.57 billion. The Administration requested $1.09 billion for FRA funding in FY2004, with the House agreeing to $1.09 billion and the Senate agreeing to $1.57 billion. P.L. 108-199 provides $1.455 billion for FRA, with most of the funding allocated to Amtrak. Additionally, the Administration requested $900 million for Amtrak, with the final amount provided being $1.225 billion. $131 million was requested for railroad safety and operations, which is an increase from the previous year. In FY2003, the House, Senate, and P.L. 108-199 provided funding for Amtrak, railroad safety and operations, research and development, and high-speed rail projects as requested by the Administration. The President requested $35 million for development, $6 million more than FY2003 funding. The House agreed to $28 million, the Senate to $34 million; P.L. 108-199 provides $34 million. For next generation high-speed rail, the President requested $23 million, $7 million less than last year; the House agreed to $28 million; the Senate to $29 million. Conferees agreed on $37 million. The FRA budget debate focuses on Amtrak, agency safety activities, Next Generation High-Speed Rail, and state funding for high-speed rail initiatives. The FRA budget for FY2004 includes funding for Amtrak, agency safety activities, Next Generation High-Speed Rail, and state funding for high-speed rail initiatives. The FRA is the primary federal agency promoting and regulating railroad safety, with a proposed $131.2 million for safety programs, a 13% increase from the previous year. The Administration proposes $131.2 million in FY2004 for FRA's safety program, a 13% increase from the previous year. The funds are used for salaries, travel, training expenses, and information systems monitoring safety performance. The House and Senate approved around $130.8 million for these activities. The conference agreement approved $130.8 million for FRA's safety program, mainly for salaries, travel, training expenses, and information systems monitoring. The funds support goals of reducing rail accidents, grade-crossing accidents, and hazardous materials incidents. Funding authority for the program expired in FY1998, but FRA continues using existing authorities and funds. The railroad safety program's funding authority expired in FY1998, and since 1994, there have been no agreements on funding for regulatory and safety compliance activities. A reauthorization statute could impact budgets after FY2004, with the FRA conducting research to improve railroad safety. The FRA conducts research and development on various topics to improve railroad safety, including employee fatigue and train movement technologies. The FY2003 DOT appropriation provided $29.1 million for the R&D program. The appropriations committees historically allocate FRA's R&D funds among safety research categories. FY2003 had $29.1 million, FY2004 requested $35 million. House approved $28.2 million, Senate approved $34.2 million, and conferees recommend $34 million for Next Generation High-Speed Rail R&D program. The Senate Committee recommended $34.2 million for the Next Generation High-Speed Rail R&D program, while the conferees suggest $34 million. This program focuses on high-speed train control systems, track technology, corridor planning, grade crossing hazard mitigation, and high-speed non-electric locomotives. The Administration requested $23.2 million for FY2004, which is $7.05 million less than the previous year's appropriation. The House agreed to $28.3 million, with a difference due to support for establishing compliance of diesel multiple units with FRA regulations. The House agreed to $28.3 million, while the Senate agreed to $29.3 million. The difference was due to the Senate's support for additional high-speed corridor planning and maglev projects. P.L. 108-199 ultimately provided $37.4 million by combining different projects from both House and Senate bills and adding new projects. The President requested $900 million for Amtrak for FY2004, which was $150 million below Amtrak's FY2003 appropriation and $900 million less than what Amtrak had requested. Amtrak stated it could not survive on $900 million for FY2004, a sentiment supported by the DOT Inspector General. The House agreed to the $900 million funding, in line with the Administration's request. The House agreed to $900 million for Amtrak in FY2004, similar to the Administration's request. The Senate approved $1.346 billion for Amtrak, extending the requirement for long-distance routes to be funded through the grant request process. P.L. 108-199 provides $1.225 billion and postpones repayment of a $100 million loan from DOT. The Senate agreed to $1.346 billion for Amtrak in FY2004, extending the requirement for long-distance routes to be funded through grant requests. P.L. 108-199 provides $1.225 billion, postpones repayment of a $100 million loan from DOT, and directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a procedure for competitive bidding on state-supported routes currently operated by Amtrak. The Secretary of Transportation is directed to establish a competitive bidding procedure for state-supported routes currently operated by Amtrak. States can contract with non-Amtrak operators, with the option to use Amtrak's equipment and services if needed. If terms cannot be agreed upon, the Secretary has the power to compel Amtrak to provide necessary equipment and services. Starting in FY2003, Congress began specifying Amtrak's appropriation in legislation. The Secretary of Transportation can compel Amtrak to provide equipment, facilities, and services as per set terms. Congress directed Amtrak's FY2003 appropriation to go through the Secretary of Transportation, reducing Amtrak's discretion with federal funding. Amtrak was required to submit a 5-year business plan to Congress in April 2003. In FY2003, Congress imposed requirements on Amtrak, including submitting a 5-year business plan requesting $1.6 billion annually for maintenance needs. Amtrak's authorization expired in FY2002, but two bills aim to reauthorize it without changes to the rail network. The plan did not propose expansion of the existing rail network. Two bills have passed out of committee to reauthorize Amtrak: H.R. 2572 authorizes $2 billion annually for three years, and S. 1978 includes an amendment for $2 billion annually for six years. Several bills aim to change federal passenger rail policy. The Administration has submitted a plan for restructuring Amtrak. The surface transportation safety bill, S. 1978, includes an amendment authorizing $2 billion annually for Amtrak for six years. Various bills have been introduced to change federal passenger rail policy, with different plans for restructuring Amtrak and passenger rail service. Sen. Hutchinson's plan (S. 1505) would give the federal government more responsibility for planning and implementing passenger rail service, authorizing $2 billion annually for 6 years for Amtrak operations. Sen. Hollings and others have proposed a plan (S. 1961) authorizing $2 billion annually for 6 years for Amtrak operations and $30 billion in bonds for capital improvements to the nation's rail network. This plan aims to give the federal government more responsibility for passenger rail service. The proposed plan (S. 1961) would allocate $2 billion annually for 6 years for Amtrak operations and authorize $30 billion in bonds for rail network improvements. President Bush's FY2004 budget request for FTA was $7.226 billion, with proposed changes to FTA's program structure. The House and Senate agreed to similar funding levels. The FTA's budget for FY2004 was reduced to $7.179 billion after a 0.65% rescission. The House agreed to $7.231 billion, the Senate to $7.305 billion, and P.L. 108-199 provided $7.309 billion. The proposed changes to FTA's program structure were not reflected in the appropriations due to the Administration's reauthorization proposal not being approved. For more information on FTA's programs and funding structure, refer to CRS Report RL31854, Transit Program Reauthorization in the 108th Congress. The FTA's budget for FY2004 was reduced to $7.179 billion after a 0.65% rescission. The appropriations do not reflect proposed changes to FTA's program structure. Figures from an FY2004 Transportation-Treasury Appropriations billConference Report Budget Authority table show FTA Appropriation for FY2003-FY2004. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 includes a 0.59% rescission not reflected in the figures. MARAD's mission is to promote the development of the U.S. merchant marine and administer programs benefiting U.S. vessel owners, shipyards, and crews. The President requested $219 million for FY2004.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 includes a 4.1% pay increase for federal white collar employees under the General Schedule, retroactive to January 1, 2004. This increase incorporates a 2% adjustment and is based on changes in private sector salaries reflected in the Employment Cost Index. Employees under the General Schedule receive annual pay adjustments based on changes in private sector salaries reflected in the Employment Cost Index. The pay adjustment for January 2003 was 3.1%, with a full increase of 4.1% under Section 637, Division J, P.L. 108-7. The President signed an Executive Order in December 2002 establishing salary schedules for federal civilian personnel effective January 2003.

In January 2004, the President's budget proposed a federal civilian pay increase of 2.0%. In January 2003, a 4.1% pay increase for federal civilian personnel was established, with an additional 1% applied to locality-based comparability payments. In January 2004, the President proposed a 2.0% pay increase, with a plan for a 1.5% increase in basic pay and a 0.5% increase in locality pay. Congress had not finalized legislation for other rates, so the President's plan went into effect. In January 2004, the President's plan for a 4.1% pay increase for federal civilian employees was effective. Legislation was pending to establish rates for military pay increases in parity with civilian pay. The pay provision is part of the pending Consolidated Appropriations, 2004. The 4.1% pay increase for federal civilian employees, split between basic and locality pay, is part of the pending Consolidated Appropriations, 2004. The Office of Personnel Management states that 2.7% will go towards basic pay and 1.4% for locality-based payments. Adjustments for the Washington, DC area will be 4.41% under the overall 4.1% adjustment. The Federal Wage System (FWS) compensates federal blue-collar workers based on local wage rates. Congress has limited adjustments in over 130 wage areas, with the pending 4.1% pay increase split between basic and locality pay. Adjustments for the Washington, DC area will be 4.41% under the overall increase. The Federal Wage System adjusts wage rates in over 130 areas based on labor costs and compensation in the private sector. Congress limits adjustments to prevent FWS wages from exceeding General Schedule salaries in high-cost areas. Lower cost area wages can increase based on surveys, but high-cost area wages are capped. In high-cost areas, some FWS wages may exceed General Schedule salaries, but will be capped. P.L. 107-117 extended the Monroney Amendment to Department of Defense personnel.

The Senate voted to table an amendment denying pay increase to Members of Congress. Pay adjustments for federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges, are based on ECI calculations, with a 2.2% adjustment in January 2004. However, the adjustment is limited to 1.5% due to the General Schedule base pay adjustment. In January 2004, a pay adjustment of 2.2% was proposed for federal officials, including Members of Congress and judges. However, due to limitations set by the General Schedule base pay adjustment, the maximum rate of adjustment was temporarily set at 1.5%.

The Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA) provides workers' compensation benefits for Federal employees injured on the job. The direct costs of these benefits are reimbursed via transfers from each Federal agency's budget to the Labor Department, which administers the program. The Administration has proposed changes in FECA to charge administrative costs in the same manner as benefit costs. The Administration proposed changes in FECA to charge administrative costs to each employing agency, aiming to make agencies bear the full cost of employees' claims and improve workplace safety. The administrative surcharge would be around 3.5% of benefit costs. The administrative surcharge for FECA would be around 3.5% of benefit costs, with most of it paid by the U.S. Postal Service and the Defense Department. The Administration reiterated its support for competitive sourcing in H.R. 2989. The Administration supported competitive sourcing in H.R. 2989 and objected to an amendment that could hinder it. The President's advisers would recommend a veto if the bill included a prohibition on funding for public-private competitions. The Office of Management and Budget successfully altered competitive sourcing provisions in H.R. 2989, which had been inserted into the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004. Competitive sourcing is part of the President's Management Agenda and applies to commercial activities of federal executive agencies. OMB has implemented initiatives to promote competitive sourcing since February 2001. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has implemented initiatives to promote competitive sourcing since February 2001, including revising OMB Circular A-76. Circular A-76 provides policy and guidance for public-private competitions, with the competitive sourcing provisions found in Section 647 of H.R. 2673 (P.L. 108-199). Section 647(a) applies to departments and agencies funded by the Departments of Transportation and Treasury, and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill of 2004. Section 647 of H.R. 2673 (P.L. 108-199), Division F, Title VI, requires agencies funded by the Departments of Transportation and Treasury to develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO) in competitions involving more than 10 federal employees. This condition aims to facilitate the preparation of a competitive in-house cost estimate but may increase the time needed to complete the MEO. Section 647 of H.R. 2673 requires agencies to develop a plan for a most efficient organization (MEO) in competitions involving more than 10 federal employees. This may increase the time needed to complete the MEO and consider the conversion differential in streamlined competitions. Section 647(a) of H.R. 2673 requires consideration of the conversion differential in streamlined competitions, which is more stringent than Circular A-76. This would direct the competitive sourcing official to assess how the conversion differential impacts the contractor's cost. Section 647(a) of H.R. 2673 requires the competitive sourcing official to evaluate how the conversion differential affects the contractor's cost. The official must determine if contractor performance is less costly to the agency by $10 million or 10% of government personnel costs, whichever is less. The criteria for comparing costs is unspecified. The competitive sourcing official must evaluate how the conversion differential affects the contractor's cost, comparing it to the agency's personnel costs. The criteria for determining cost effectiveness is unspecified, raising questions about how performance decisions are made in streamlined and standard competitions. The Circular A-76 requires agencies to add the conversion differential to the cost of non-incumbent's performance in standard competitions. Section 647(b) mandates executive agencies to submit annual reports to Congress on competitive sourcing activities. Section 647(b) of Circular A-76 requires executive agencies to submit annual reports to Congress on competitive sourcing activities. Reports must include completed competitions, ongoing competitions, costs, savings, projected FTEs for the next fiscal year, and decision-making processes. The agency reports required by Circular A-76 provide details on competitive sourcing activities, including costs, savings, projected FTEs, and decision-making processes. However, the absence of a standardized methodology for collecting this information may limit its usefulness. The absence of a standardized methodology for collecting required information could detract from its usefulness in informing OMB policy and agency decisions. Agency heads are not required to limit the performance period in a letter of obligation to an MEO to five years or less under Section 647(c). This provision allows for less frequent recompetitions of MEOs as required by Circular A-76. The provision under Section 647(c) allows agencies to issue letters of obligation to MEOs for performance periods longer than five years, potentially reducing the frequency of recompetitions as required by Circular A-76. This could lead to different treatment for government agencies and private sector sources in public-private competitions. Allowing agencies to write letters of obligation with performance periods longer than five years could help mitigate recruitment and retention issues among federal government employees. Section 647(d) permits agency heads to use funds for monitoring the performance of activities after public-private competitions. Section 647(d) allows agency heads to use funds for monitoring activities post public-private competitions, supporting oversight and decision-making. This provision could enhance agency competitions by funding information collection and analysis. Section 647(e) prohibits moving work previously done by federal government employees in the US to contractors outside the country, potentially impacting contractors' ability to bid competitively. This provision aims to retain jobs within the US. The provision in the FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill aims to prevent funds from being used to enforce restrictions on travel or travel-related transactions, potentially impacting contractors' ability to bid competitively. This provision could help retain jobs in the United States and benefit employers by keeping their workforce close to their facilities. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill aimed to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions, impacting contractors' competitiveness. The provisions were dropped in the final Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, which also removed two Cuba-related provisions. The FY2004 Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill, incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, dropped two Cuba provisions related to remittances and educational exchanges. The White House threatened to veto any legislation weakening economic sanctions against Cuba. U.S. policy towards Cuba has focused on isolating the Communist government since the 1960s. The final version of the bill weakened sanctions against Cuba, prompting the President's advisors to recommend a veto. US policy towards Cuba has aimed to isolate the Communist government since the 1960s through economic sanctions and prohibitions on financial transactions. Sanctions on Cuba were strengthened by congressional initiatives in 1992 and 1996 with the passage of the Cuban Democracy Act and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act. These sanctions, including restrictions on financial transactions and travel, are governed by the Cuban Assets Control Regulations. Recent debates in Congress have focused on lifting or easing these sanctions. The 108th Congress has introduced initiatives to lift or ease Cuba sanctions, with differing opinions on how to achieve the objective of promoting democracy and human rights on the island. Some advocate for maximum pressure on the Cuban government, while others suggest lifting certain sanctions to help the Cuban people. There are also calls for swift normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations by lifting the embargo. Some advocate maximum pressure on the Cuban government until reforms are enacted, others argue for lifting some U.S. sanctions believed to be hurting the Cuban people, and still others call for swift normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations by lifting the embargo. House-approved H.R. 2929 had provisions to prevent funds from enforcing travel and remittance restrictions, as well as eliminating the travel category of people-to-people educational exchanges. Restrictions on travel to Cuba have been a contentious issue in U.S. efforts to isolate the country. H.Amdt. 375 (Flake) aimed to prevent funds from enforcing travel restrictions, which have effectively resulted in a ban on travel to Cuba due to financial transaction restrictions. Certain travelers can still visit Cuba under a general license. The U.S. embargo regulations have not banned travel to Cuba, but restrictions on financial transactions have effectively created a travel ban. Certain categories of travelers, such as government officials, journalists, and athletes, can visit Cuba under a general license without needing special permission from OFAC. Other travelers engaging in educational, religious, or professional activities may be eligible for specific licenses. Supporters of the Flake amendment argue that U.S. policy towards Cuba restricts the rights of Americans to travel there, while opponents believe enforcing the travel ban is necessary. Opponents of the amendment argued that not enforcing the travel restrictions to Cuba would provide the Cuban government with tourist receipts while it suppresses democracy activists. H.Amdt. 377 (Delahunt) aimed to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on remittances. In March 2003, OFAC amended Cuba travel regulations to allow travelers to carry up to $3,000 in remittances, with a $300 limit per quarter for Cuban households. The Delahunt amendment, approved by a vote of 222-196, aimed to prevent funds from enforcing restrictions on remittances. Supporters argued for unlimited financial support for Cuban Americans to send to their families in Cuba. The Delahunt amendment, approved by a vote of 246-173, aimed to lift the cap on remittances for Cuban Americans sending money to their families in Cuba. Opponents argued that allowing unlimited remittances could result in more money going to the Cuban regime through government-owned dollar stores with inflated prices. H.Amdt. 382 (Davis) would have prevented the elimination of the travel category for people-to-people educational exchanges. In March 2003, OFAC tightened Cuba travel regulations, prohibiting certain types of educational travel, including people-to-people exchanges unrelated to academic coursework. Some groups supported the restriction, viewing it as a way to prevent unrestricted travel, while others criticized the decision, arguing that it limited ordinary people's ability to travel and exchange with counterparts in Cuba. Some supported restrictions on educational exchanges to prevent unrestricted travel, while others criticized limits on ordinary people's ability to travel and exchange with counterparts in Cuba. Senate approved S.Amdt. 1900 (Dorgan) to prevent funds for enforcing Cuba travel restrictions. The Senate provision, similar to the House version, aimed to prevent funds from enforcing Cuba travel restrictions. The Dorgan amendment, defeated in a vote, specified that the provision would take effect one day after the bill's enactment. Cuba's human rights crackdown in 2003 influenced legislative proposals to ease U.S. sanctions on Cuba. The provision to ease U.S. sanctions on Cuba would take effect one day after the bill's enactment. The impact of Cuba's human rights crackdown in 2003 led to less support for legislative proposals, such as the House-approved Cuba amendments to H.R. 2989. The Flake amendment to H.R. 2989 was approved by a vote of 227-188, compared to a similar amendment in the FY2003 Treasury Department appropriations bill which was approved by a vote of 262-167.

The current aviation authorizing legislation includes ARAA, ATSA, BRR, BTS, CG, CMAQ, DOT, EAS, F&E, FAA, FAHP, and FAIR21. The curr_chunk provides a list of abbreviations related to various transportation programs and agencies, including FHWA, DOT, FAA, FRA, FTA, and HTF. Abbreviations related to transportation programs and agencies include FTA, Hazmat, HPP, HTF, IM, ITS, MCSAP, New Starts, NHS, NHTSA, NMCSA, O&M, OIG, and OST. Abbreviations related to transportation programs and agencies include FTA, Hazmat, HPP, HTF, IM, ITS, MCSAP, New Starts, NHS, NHTSA, NMCSA, O&M, OIG, OST, RABA, RD&T, RE&D, RSPA, SCASD, STB, STP, TCSP, and TEA-21. The FAA, RSPA, SCASD, STB, STP, TCSP, TEA-21, TIFIA, and TSA are all part of transportation programs and agencies. Transportation is function 400 in the annual unified congressional budget and is considered part of the discretionary budget. Funding for the DOT budget comes from various sources. The Department of Transportation (DOT) budget is funded primarily through transportation trust funds, including the highway trust fund, airport and airway trust fund, and inland waterways trust fund. These funds are derived from specific excise and other taxes. The highway trust fund, airport and airway trust fund, and inland waterways trust fund are accounts that derive funding from specific taxes. In FY2002, trust funds accounted for over two-thirds of federal transportation spending, with highway and transit funding being the largest component of DOT appropriations. Highway and transit programs are funded through contract authority linked to the highway trust fund, which is significant for budgeting purposes. Most highway and transit programs are funded through contract authority linked to the highway trust fund, providing authorized funds at the beginning of each fiscal year without the need for new budget authority. This system allows obligations to be made without appropriations legislation, although appropriations are required for future outlays. Transportation appropriators face a unique budgeting challenge compared to other federal programs. During the 105th and 106th Congresses, major legislation changed the relationships between transportation trust funds and the federal budget, with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) linking annual spending for highway programs. During the 105th and 106th Congresses, major legislation changed the relationships between transportation trust funds and the federal budget. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) linked annual spending for highway programs directly to revenue collections for the highway trust fund, creating a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs. Funding guarantees were established to make it difficult for funding levels to be altered. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century created a \"firewall\" around highway and transit spending programs by establishing funding guarantees that make it difficult to alter funding levels. Additional highway funds can be provided annually through Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) funds accruing to the trust fund from increased revenues. However, for FY2003, the RABA adjustment could have led to a significant and unexpected drop in highway funding availability if left intact during the appropriations process. TEA-21 changed the role of appropriations committees in determining annual spending levels for highway and transit programs by establishing funding guarantees and adjusting obligations through RABA computations. This adjustment could have caused a significant drop in highway funding availability for FY2003 if left intact during the appropriations process. TEA-21 altered the appropriations committees' role in setting annual spending levels for highway and transit programs by establishing funding guarantees and adjusting obligations through RABA computations. The FY2000 appropriations act saw some attempts by appropriators to regain discretion over highway spending, redistributing funds among programs and adding significant spending projects. The FY2001 appropriations act continued to limit the committees' ability to change spending levels for specific core programs or projects. In FY2000, appropriators took steps to regain discretion over highway spending by redistributing funds and adding significant projects. FY2001 saw funds added for earmarked projects and redirection of funding between programs. FY2002 continued this trend with major redistributions of RABA funds and transfers to other agencies. The FY2002 Act saw major redistributions of RABA funds and transfers to agencies not eligible for RABA funding under TEA-21. The FAIR21 provides a guarantee for FAA program spending, different from TEA-21, relying on two point-of-order rules. The FAIR21 guarantee for FAA program spending is different from TEA-21, relying on two point-of-order rules. Supporters believe it requires significant new spending on aviation programs, with spending growing in FY2001 and FY2002. However, the guarantees are seen as weaker than those in TEA-21, as Congress can waive points-of-order during legislation consideration. Enactment of TEA-21 and FAIR21 gives transportation appropriators control over spending for TSA, Coast Guard, Federal Railroad Administration, and smaller DOT agencies. Agencies worry about funding in constrained budget years due to confusing budgeting lexicon. Transportation budgeting involves a complex lexicon of budget authority and contract authority, with contract authority providing funding for trust fund-financed programs like the federal-aid highway program. Changes in transportation budget spending were previously achieved through a combination of budget/contract authority changes and limitations on obligations. Prior to TEA-21, changes in transportation budget spending were achieved through a combination of budget/contract authority changes and limitations on obligations to control outlays in line with congressional budget agreements. Contract authority, as specified in Title 23 U.S.C., provides funding for trust fund-financed programs like the federal-aid highway program, allowing authorized funds to be automatically available to states at the beginning of each fiscal year. TEA-21 amended Title 23 U.S.C. to authorize funds automatically at the beginning of each fiscal year for highway and transit programs. This limited the role of appropriations in funding projects, as states pay upfront and receive federal reimbursements. The TEA-21 Act amended Title 23 U.S.C. to authorize funds automatically for highway and transit programs, reducing the role of appropriations. States pay upfront for projects and receive federal reimbursements later. Trust fund balances may appear high due to funds set aside for future commitments. Trust fund balances remain high as funds are set aside for future commitments in both the highway and transit accounts. These commitments include payments for current projects and outstanding obligations for future projects. Unobligated amounts are also dedicated to projects but have not been assigned yet. In the current fiscal year, funds are set aside for future commitments in highway and transit accounts. There are unobligated amounts dedicated to projects not yet assigned. Apportionments distribute funds to states for formula-driven programs, while allocated funds are distributed administratively to programs under federal control. Funds distributed to states for formula-driven programs, such as the national highway system (NHS), are apportioned funds. Allocated funds are distributed administratively to programs under federal control, like the federal lands highway program. These terms provide a frame of reference for highway program recipients, separate from the federal budget process."
