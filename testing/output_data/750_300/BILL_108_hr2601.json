    "content": "The \"Public Domain Enhancement Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. The findings section of the Act is also included. The Congress finds that the copyright clause in the United States Constitution grants the power to promote the progress of science and arts by securing exclusive rights to authors for limited times, providing an economic incentive for creating and disseminating ideas. Copyright provides authors with an economic incentive to create new works and promotes society's interest in the free flow of ideas, information, and commerce. The limited copyright term ensures that the public will not be permanently deprived of the fruits of an artist's labor. \"The copyright term is limited to prevent permanent deprivation of the fruits of an artist's labor. Both commercial and noncommercial creators rely on a healthy public domain for economic value and availability of works.\" Some rely on public domain for economic value and availability of works, while others use it for educational and cultural purposes. Media sources like the World Wide Web also benefit from the freedom of public domain. Current law grants copyright protection to works published as early as 1923, but the majority of older works are no longer commercially available. Only 2 percent of works between 55 and 75 years old retain commercial value. Schools, museums, and libraries use public domain works for educational and cultural purposes, while media sources like the World Wide Web benefit from the freedom of public domain content. Under current law, abandoned works published as early as 1923 are no longer commercially available. Only 2 percent of works between 55 and 75 years old retain commercial value. This prevents entities from utilizing and preserving these abandoned works. Abandoned works published as early as 1923 will not enter the public domain for many years, hindering their utilization and preservation. This contradicts the original intent of the copyright system and deprives the public of valuable historical and educational resources. The copyright system hinders the public domain access to abandoned works, contrary to the original intent of the Constitution and Copyright Act. A mechanism is needed for abandoned American copyrights to enter the public domain. SEC. 3. MAINTENANCE FEE FOR PUBLISHED UNITED STATES WORKS.
