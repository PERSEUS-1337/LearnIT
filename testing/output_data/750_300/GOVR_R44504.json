    "content": "Under the OCSLA, the DOI must create five-year programs for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters, balancing energy supply and environmental protection. The BOEM leads this process, which involves multiple drafts for public review and comment. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) develops a five-year program for oil and gas lease sales in U.S. waters, which involves examining all available leasing areas, narrowing down selections based on economic and environmental analysis, and submitting the final program to the President and Congress for approval. The process is guided by the National Environmental Policy Act. The Secretary of the Interior submits each program for oil and gas lease sales to the President and Congress for a 60-day review period. The planning process includes a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which examines potential environmental impacts and considers alternatives. Public comments from stakeholders are addressed in both the PEIS and the five-year program itself. The Administration cannot revise a finalized oil and gas exploration program without restarting the development process. Scheduled sales could be canceled during implementation based on environmental review requirements. BOEM released the final version of its oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022, approving 11 lease sales on the OCS, with 10 in the Gulf of Mexico region and 1 in the Alaska region. The final program for oil and gas leasing in 2017-2022 was approved on January 17, 2017, with 11 lease sales scheduled on the OCS, including 10 in the Gulf of Mexico region and 1 in the Alaska region. Some proposed sales in earlier versions were not included in the final program. Congress plays an active role in the planning process due to the potential impact on the economy and environment. The leasing decisions in BOEM's five-year programs may impact the economy and environment of coastal states and the nation. Congress is actively involved in the planning process, although they do not have approval authority. Members of Congress can influence the program by submitting public comments and evaluating it in oversight hearings. Members of Congress can influence the BOEM's five-year offshore oil and gas leasing programs by submitting public comments, evaluating the program in oversight hearings, and introducing legislation to set or alter program terms. The 114th Congress pursued these avenues of influence for the proposed program for 2017-2022. The report discusses the history, legal framework, development process, and analysis of the program. The report discusses the history, legal framework, development process, and analysis of BOEM's five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022. Congress plays a role in oversight and legislation related to the program. In 1953, laws were enacted addressing jurisdiction and rights off the coasts of the United States. The Submerged Lands Act and the OCSLA defined jurisdiction and rights off the coasts of the United States, including regulation of oil and gas exploration. Coastal states are generally entitled to an area extending 3 geographical miles from their coasts. The OCSLA defines the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) as submerged lands under US jurisdiction for expedited resource development while maintaining environmental safeguards and national needs. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 added new provisions to the OCSLA, including Section 18, which mandates the creation and maintenance of an OCS leasing program to achieve national energy goals while also providing for environmental protection and competitive bidding. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 added Section 18, requiring an OCS leasing program to meet national energy needs for a five-year period. This program includes lease auctions and has guided OCS oil and gas exploration since 1980. The OCS oil and gas exploration framework, established in 1980, has been influenced by various legislative actions. The Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 aimed to incentivize deepwater exploration by providing royalty relief. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 directed leasing in specific Gulf regions for exploration and production. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 directed leasing in specific Gulf regions for oil and gas exploration, provided relief from royalty payments, and established revenue-sharing mechanisms with Gulf states and the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Congressional actions in 2008 removed barriers to leasing in certain OCS regions, shaping subsequent five-year programs. Congressional actions in 2008 removed barriers to leasing in certain OCS regions, shaping subsequent five-year programs. The statutory framework governing BOEM's development of a five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program includes the OCSLA, NEPA, and the Coastal Zone Management Act. Section 18 of the OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and periodically revise an oil and gas leasing program. Section 18 of the OCSLA mandates the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and periodically revise an oil and gas leasing program to meet national energy needs for the five-year period following its approval or reapproval, considering economic, social, and environmental values of the OCS resources. Section 18 of the OCSLA directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage the OCS in a way that considers economic, social, and environmental values, including the impact of oil and gas exploration on marine, coastal, and human environments. This includes scheduling exploration and production based on various factors such as geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics, as well as environmental and natural resource considerations of different regions. The OCSLA directs the Secretary of the Interior to manage offshore oil and gas exploration based on various factors, including geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics, environmental considerations, and the interests of oil and gas producers. Leasing must also ensure fair market value for lands leased. The OCSLA requires the Secretary of the Interior to manage offshore oil and gas exploration, ensuring fair market value for leased lands. The five-year program must balance production, include estimates on appropriations and staffing needs, and meet consultation requirements. The Secretary of the Interior must consult with various federal agencies and state governors when preparing a proposed offshore oil and gas exploration program. The program must be submitted to the governors of affected states for comments at least 60 days before publication in the Federal Register. The Secretary must consult with federal agencies and state governors when preparing an offshore oil and gas exploration program. The program must be submitted to governors for comments at least 60 days before publication in the Federal Register. Additionally, the Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission can submit comments on competition effects. The proposed program must also be submitted to Congress and the President at least 60 days before approval, with explanations for any rejected recommendations. The Secretary must submit the proposed offshore oil and gas exploration program to Congress and the President at least 60 days before approval, along with explanations for any rejected recommendations. The Secretary is then authorized to approve a final five-year program, with the ability to revise it at any time through a mandated review process. The Secretary of the Interior approves a final five-year offshore oil and gas exploration program, which can be revised at any time through a mandated review process. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) carries out the responsibilities under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) for the program. BOEM's preparation of the program includes consultation requirements such as requesting input from governors of affected states on laws, goals, and policies to consider. Regulations also outline requirements for publication of the proposed program. BOEM requests input from governors of affected states on laws, goals, and policies for the five-year program. Regulations require publication of the proposed program in the Federal Register. NEPA and CZMA are federal statutes that influence the program's formation, with NEPA mandating environmental impact statements for major federal actions. The formation of the program is influenced by federal statutes like NEPA and CZMA. NEPA requires detailed environmental impact statements for major federal actions, determining if an action significantly affects the environment. If an action is deemed major without an environmental assessment, the agency proceeds to prepare the environmental impact statement. The NEPA requires detailed environmental impact statements for major federal actions to determine their significant effects on the environment. If an action is considered major without an environmental assessment, the agency prepares an environmental impact statement. BOEM's five-year programs assume significance on the environment and thus prepare a programmatic EIS concurrently with the program. States under the CZMA are encouraged to enact coastal regulations. BOEM prepares a programmatic EIS (PEIS) alongside the five-year program to assess its impact on the environment. States under the CZMA are encouraged to enact coastal zone management plans for habitat and resource protection, with approved programs eligible for federal assistance. State coastal zone management programs approved by the Secretary of Commerce can receive federal assistance. These programs designate conservation measures, permissible land and water uses, and address water pollution sources. The CZMA requires federal compliance with state programs, and BOEM regulations consider affected coastal state management programs in leasing program development. The BOEM regulations governing the five-year program require consideration of state coastal zone management programs. BOEM requests information on the relationship between a state's program and OCS oil and gas activity from governors and the Secretary of Commerce. The development of a five-year program involves multiple drafts for review and comment over two to three years. The development of a five-year leasing program by BOEM involves multiple drafts for review and comment over two to three years. The program is submitted to state governors, federal agencies, Congress, and the President for consultation. Each step of the process includes public comment and environmental review. Individual lease sales and companies' exploration and development also undergo environmental review and public comment. The development of a five-year leasing program by BOEM involves multiple drafts for review and comment over two to three years. Each step of the process includes public comment and environmental review. Individual lease sales and companies' exploration and development also undergo environmental review and public comment. The successive drafts represent a winnowing process from the initial proposed program to actual oil and gas production in an individual well. The development of a five-year leasing program by BOEM involves multiple drafts for review and comment over two to three years. Each step includes public comment and environmental review, leading to a winnowing process from the initial proposed program to the final plan. The successive drafts focus on analyzing available planning areas for oil and gas leasing, with only selected areas undergoing further analysis and environmental review in each version of the plan. The proposed program (PP) undergoes targeted analysis, with potential removal of proposed sales but no addition of new sales. The final plan may also remove proposed sales but cannot add new sales without restarting the process and conducting new environmental reviews. The process begins with a Request for Information (RFI) published in the Federal Register by BOEM to gather input from interested parties. The process of developing a new five-year program for oil and gas leasing begins with a Request for Information (RFI) published by BOEM in the Federal Register to gather input from interested parties. The RFI for the 2017-2022 leasing program was published on June 16, 2014, and received over half a million comments. The RFI for the 2017-2022 leasing program was published on June 16, 2014, and received over half a million comments. BOEM then publishes a draft proposed program (DPP) based on analysis and public comments, which is the first step towards the final program. The DPP is a key document in the process of lease sales for the next five years on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). It includes a preliminary list of areas proposed for leasing and a schedule for the sales. BOEM published the DPP for 2017-2022 on January 29, 2015, and received over 1 million comments. Additionally, a notice of intent (NOI) for a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS) is issued for the proposed lease areas to gather public input. After receiving over 1 million comments on the DPP, BOEM published a proposed program for the five-year period, taking into account public feedback. A notice of intent for a programmatic environmental impact statement was also issued for the proposed lease areas. BOEM refines proposed OCS oil and gas lease sales locations and timing in the Proposed Program for 2017-2022. The program is submitted to Congress, state governors, and federal agencies for review, with a draft PEIS analyzing identified leasing areas. The BOEM published the Proposed Program for 2017-2022 on March 15, 2016, with a comment period closing on June 16, 2016. A draft PEIS analyzing OCS areas for leasing was included. The final document, the Proposed Final Program, is based on analysis of OCSLA factors and public comments, announced in the Federal Register and submitted to the President and Congress for a minimum 60-day review period. The Proposed Final Program (PFP) for 2017-2022, based on analysis of OCSLA factors and public comments, is announced in the Federal Register and submitted to the President and Congress for a 60-day review period. Congress does not have an approval role, but legislation could be introduced during this period. The final PEIS analyzing proposed leasing areas is also released to the President and Congress along with the PFP. BOEM published the PFP for 2017-2022 along with a final PEIS on November 18, 2016. The final PEIS is submitted to the President and Congress. The Secretary of the Interior may approve the PFP at least 60 days after submission, and a record of decision is published. Former Secretary Sally Jewell approved the final program on January 17. The Secretary of the Interior may approve the PFP, which becomes final and is published in a record of decision. Former Secretary Sally Jewell approved the final program for 2017-2022 on January 17, 2017. Since 1980, eight five-year programs have been submitted to Congress and have taken effect after a 60-day review period. The 2012-2017 five-year program was submitted by the Obama Administration under Secretary Ken Salazar, reflecting policies post-Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The program aligns with offshore oil and gas leasing policies of different administrations, incorporating input from various stakeholders. The 2012-2017 five-year program was submitted to Congress under former Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, reflecting Obama Administration policies on offshore energy development post-Deepwater Horizon oil spill. It included 15 proposed lease sales, with 11 lease sales held by late November 2016. The 2007-2012 five-year program for offshore energy development was prepared by the George W. Bush Administration and later revised by the Obama Administration. It included a schedule of lease sales, with 11 sales held by late November 2016. The 2007-2012 offshore energy development program began in July 2007 with 21 sales, later revised to 16 sales in 2010 by the Obama Administration. Eleven sales were conducted before the program expired in June 2012. The 2002-2007 OCS oil and gas leasing plan, proposed under Secretary Gale Norton, consisted of 20 lease sales. The OCS oil and gas leasing plan submitted to Congress in 2002 under Secretary Gale Norton included 20 lease sales, with 15 held before the program expired in June 2007. The 1997-2002 program, proposed under Secretary Bruce Babbitt, listed 16 sales, with 12 held before the program expired in June 2002. The submission to Congress in 2002 under Secretary Gale Norton included 20 lease sales, with 15 held before the program expired in June 2007. The 1992-1997 program presented under Secretary Manuel Lujan listed 16 sales, with 12 held before the program expired in June 2002. The 1987-1992 program presented under Secretary Donald Hodel had a schedule of 18 sales, with 12 held before the program expired in June 1997. The 1987-1992 program, presented under former Secretary of the Interior Donald Hodel, reflected Reagan Administration policies on energy production. The program included a schedule of 18 sales, with 12 sales held before the program expired in June 1997. The 1980-1982 oil and gas leasing program was presented to Congress in 1982 under former Secretary of the Interior James Watt, aligning with Reagan Administration's energy policies. It included 41 sales, with 23 held before the program expired in June 1987. The original proposal was prepared in October 1978 and presented to Congress in April 1980 under former Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus, taking effect in June 1980. The 1980-1982 oil and gas leasing program, aligned with President Carter's \"Energy Message,\" was presented to Congress in April 1980 under former Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus. The program included 36 sales, with 12 held, and was succeeded by the 1982-1987 program. Prior to 1980, almost 30 years of federal government lease sales took place, conveying over 3,000 tracts. In November 2016, BOEM released the final version of its offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022. The final offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 released by BOEM schedules 11 lease sales in specific regions of the OCS, including the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. The program identifies four OCS regions and a total of 26 planning areas. The final offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2017-2022 by BOEM schedules lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions. U.S. offshore crude oil production accounted for 16% of total production in FY2015, a decline from FY2010. Offshore production in FY2015 accounted for 16% of U.S. total crude oil production, down from 31% in FY2010. Offshore natural gas production also declined, accounting for 4% of total production in FY2015 compared to 9.5% in FY2010. The surge in total U.S. crude oil and natural gas production between FY2010 and FY2015 was driven by increased production of shale gas and shale oil in unconventional onshore formations. This rise in production has helped reduce imports, particularly from OPEC countries. The onshore shale oil plays have lower production costs. The increased U.S. oil production from onshore shale oil plays like Marcellus, Bakken, Permian Basin, and Eagle Ford has reduced imports from OPEC countries. As of November 1, 2016, there were 917 producing offshore oil and natural gas leases on 4.5 million acres of the OCS, with the majority located in the Central Gulf of Mexico. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) anticipates lower domestic investment in oil and gas projects over the 2015-2020 period. Estimates by the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) of bonus bid revenues from offshore leasing in the next five fiscal years are much lower than for previous five-year periods. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) anticipates lower bonus bid revenues from offshore leasing in the next five fiscal years, with estimates decreasing from $1 billion annually for FY2015-FY2019 to around $500 million annually for FY2017-FY2021. The Office of Management and Budget's crude oil price estimates have also decreased from $80-$90 per barrel to $50-$60 per barrel in recent years. The estimated bonus bid revenues for FY2017-FY2021 are around $500 million annually. The Office of Management and Budget's crude oil price estimates have decreased to $50-$60 per barrel. Despite the impact of low oil prices on new investment, offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to reach record levels of 1.91 mbd in 2017. The EIA predicts record offshore crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico in 2017, reaching 1.91 mbd due to new deepwater projects. BOEM emphasizes the importance of energy diversification and new production from other OCS regions to meet the country's energy needs. Oil and gas exploration and production involve stages with increasing data certainty about volume. Oil and gas exploration and production involve stages with increasing data certainty about volume. Prior to drilling wells, estimated volumes of oil and gas are termed undiscovered resources. When oil or gas is discovered, the volumes are measured within pools or fields via well penetration or other technology, and are called reserves. Reserves are reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission by the owners of the wells. The volumes of oil and gas reserves in U.S. OCS areas are reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reserves have been reported in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico, California coast, and Alaska OCS, totaling 4.3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 16 Tcf of dry gas. No reserves have been reported along the Atlantic OCS due to no discoveries. The U.S. OCS has 4.3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 16 Tcf of dry gas, mainly in the Central and Western Gulf of Mexico. BOEM estimates 89.9 billion barrels of oil and 327.5 Tcf of natural gas as undiscovered resources, with the Gulf of Mexico holding the majority. Alaska has a small portion of these resources. The Gulf of Mexico holds the majority of undiscovered oil and natural gas resources in the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), with Alaska also having a small portion. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) must consider resource potential, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts when preparing OCS leasing programs. Some areas of the OCS were not available for leasing in the 2017-2022 program due to presidential withdrawals. Some portions of the U.S. OCS were unavailable for leasing in the 2017-2022 program due to presidential withdrawals, congressional moratoriums, or protected status. This included areas in the Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico. Areas in the Eastern and Central Gulf of Mexico, Alaska Withdrawal Areas, and certain ocean areas in the Alaska region were unavailable for leasing in the 2017-2022 program due to various restrictions and withdrawals. In the Alaska region, certain ocean areas were withdrawn from the 2017-2022 leasing program, including the North Aleutian Basin, Hanna Shoal in the Chukchi Sea, and the Barrow and Kaktovik whaling areas in the Beaufort Sea. National marine sanctuaries and monuments in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico are also off-limits for future oil and gas leasing activities. National marine monuments in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico, established by U.S. Presidents, are withdrawn from future oil and gas leasing activities. President Obama made additional withdrawals in the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean under the OCSLA. The withdrawals include areas in the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, North Bering Sea, and certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean associated with major canyons and canyon complexes. The President's December 2016 withdrawals included areas in the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, North Bering Sea, and certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean associated with major canyons. These withdrawals did not impact the 2017-2022 leasing program but will affect future leasing considerations. BOEM's leasing strategy evaluates each U.S. ocean region separately for leasing criteria. The President's withdrawals in December 2016 included areas in the Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, North Bering Sea, and certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean. These withdrawals will impact future leasing considerations. BOEM's leasing strategy evaluates each U.S. ocean region separately based on various criteria for leasing. The final program includes 11 lease sales across different regions. The final offshore oil and gas leasing program by BOEM includes 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, with no sales scheduled for the Atlantic and Pacific regions. Previous proposals for an Atlantic lease sale and two Alaska lease sales were not included in the program. The final offshore oil and gas leasing program by BOEM includes 11 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska regions, with no sales scheduled for the Atlantic and Pacific regions. BOEM stated that the program makes almost half of the undiscovered oil and gas resources available for leasing on the U.S. OCS, with the Gulf of Mexico being the most mature region, accounting for 97% of all U.S. offshore oil and gas production. The Gulf region contains the most abundant oil and gas resources, with 97% of U.S. offshore production. Lease sales in the region are supported by Gulf states like Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama. The region includes three BOEM planning areas: Western Gulf, Central Gulf, and Eastern Gulf, with most lease sales scheduled there. For the 2017-2022 program, BOEM has consolidated lease sales in the Gulf region, including the Western Gulf, Central Gulf, and Eastern Gulf areas. The Eastern Gulf and a portion of the Central Gulf are closed to leasing due to congressional moratorium. This change aims to offer all available lease blocks in the Gulf in each sale. BOEM has consolidated lease sales in the Gulf region for the 2017-2022 program, offering all available lease blocks in each sale. This change provides greater flexibility to industry and fewer lease sales overall compared to previous programs. The 2017-2022 program schedules fewer lease sales in the Gulf region compared to previous programs, with all available blocks offered at each sale. Some Members of Congress raised concerns about the decrease in lease sales during hearings. BOEM attributed the lower number of lease sales to the consolidation of area-specific sales in the Gulf, offering all available blocks at each sale. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region has increased due to the shrinking summer polar ice, allowing for a longer drilling season, and estimates of substantial undiscovered resources in Arctic waters. Interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas in the Alaska region has grown due to the shrinking summer polar ice and estimates of substantial undiscovered resources in Arctic waters. Challenges such as severe weather, perennial sea ice, and lack of infrastructure continue to pose obstacles to new exploration. The Beaufort and Chukchi Seas are the only areas with existing federal leases, with the Beaufort Sea having producing wells in federal waters. Stakeholders, including the State of Alaska, are involved in the exploration efforts. The Beaufort and Chukchi Seas are the only areas with existing federal leases for offshore oil and gas activities in the Alaska region. Some stakeholders, including the State of Alaska and some Members of Congress, support expanding drilling, while others, including environmental groups and different Members of Congress, oppose it due to concerns about oil spills and climate change. The Obama Administration has shown support for offshore oil and gas exploration in the Arctic while emphasizing safety measures. The Obama Administration supported offshore oil and gas drilling in the Arctic, but also implemented safety regulations to prevent oil spills. Lease sales in the Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Cook Inlet were included in the 2012-2017 program, but sales for the Chukchi and Beaufort Sea were canceled in 2016 and 2017 due to market conditions and low industry interest. BOEM canceled Chukchi and Beaufort Sea lease sales for 2016 and 2017 due to market conditions and low industry interest. The final program only included a sale for Cook Inlet, removing sales for the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. BOEM considered factors like significant hydrocarbon resources in those areas. BOEM canceled Chukchi and Beaufort Sea lease sales for 2016 and 2017 due to market conditions and low industry interest. The final program only included a sale for Cook Inlet, removing sales for the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. BOEM considered factors like significant hydrocarbon resources in those areas, but ultimately decided against the sales due to various reasons including existing leases, Arctic ecosystem concerns, industry interest, market conditions, and domestic energy sources. BOEM noted a decline in industry interest in Arctic OCS leases, with a 90% decrease in active leases between February and November 2016. This was attributed to low oil prices and Shell's unsuccessful drilling in the Chukchi Sea in 2015. The agency cited market conditions, existing leases, and sufficient domestic energy sources as reasons for the lack of interest in Arctic exploration and development. BOEM reported a significant drop in active Arctic OCS leases from February to November 2016, mainly due to low oil prices and Shell's failed drilling in the Chukchi Sea. The agency noted industry disinterest in Arctic exploration, citing market conditions and abundant domestic energy sources. They suggested that future interest in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas may increase post-2017-2022. BOEM concluded that the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas may see increased interest in the years after 2017-2022. President Obama withdrew parts of the Arctic OCS from future leasing, but these areas do not affect BOEM's planned Alaska lease sale. The final program for 2017-2022 excludes a lease sale in the Atlantic region. The final program for 2017-2022 excludes a lease sale in the Atlantic region, which was proposed in the DPP version of the program. Congressional bans and presidential moratoria have limited oil and gas activity in the Atlantic region for the past 30 years. The Atlantic region's limited oil and gas activity in the past 30 years was influenced by congressional bans and presidential moratoria. Changes in legislation and administrative withdrawals allowed for potential lease sales in the Atlantic, but as of December 2016, no sales have occurred. Certain parts of the Atlantic are once again under presidential moratorium. The Atlantic region's limited oil and gas activity in the past 30 years was influenced by congressional bans and presidential moratoria. Changes in legislation and administrative withdrawals allowed for potential lease sales in the Atlantic, but as of December 2016, no sales have occurred. Certain parts of the Atlantic are once again under presidential moratorium, although other areas in the region would be available for leasing. BOEM analyzed various factors for the Atlantic region under the 2017-2022 program, including resource potential, infrastructure needs, ecological and safety concerns, and competing uses of the areas. BOEM analyzed factors for the Atlantic region under the 2017-2022 program, including resource potential, infrastructure needs, ecological concerns, and competing uses. Initially, a lease sale was planned for 2021 but was later removed in the PP due to various reasons given by BOEM. After initial analysis, BOEM planned a lease sale in the Mid- and South Atlantic planning areas for 2021 but later removed it due to strong local opposition, conflicts with other ocean uses, current market dynamics, and feedback from affected states. Conflicts with existing activities like tourism, fishing, shipping, and military uses were cited as reasons for the removal. BOEM decided not to hold an Atlantic lease sale in the 2017-2022 period due to conflicts with existing ocean uses, such as tourism, fishing, shipping, and military activities. The agency noted that the Atlantic lacks a history of offshore mineral production, leading to concerns about drilling among competing ocean users. Additionally, BOEM considered the broader U.S. energy situation as a factor in its decision. The Atlantic has little history of offshore mineral production, raising concerns about drilling among competing ocean users. BOEM decided not to hold an Atlantic lease sale in the 2017-2022 period, citing conflicts with existing ocean uses and the broader U.S. energy situation. The agency stated that domestic oil and gas production will remain strong without additional production from the Atlantic region. No federal oil and gas lease sales have been scheduled for the Pacific region in the 2017-2022 program. Oil and gas production will remain strong without additional production from a potential lease sale in the Atlantic. No federal oil and gas lease sales have been held for the Pacific region since 1984, despite some active leases with production in Southern California. The Pacific region, like the Atlantic, faced leasing moratoria for the past 30 years, which were lifted in FY2009. However, the governors of California, Oregon, and Washington still oppose offshore oil and gas leasing in the region. Congress has the power to influence this decision. The Pacific region has faced leasing moratoria for the past 30 years, which were lifted in FY2009. However, the governors of California, Oregon, and Washington still oppose offshore oil and gas leasing in the region. Congress can influence the Administration's development of a five-year program through various means such as submitting public comments, conducting oversight hearings, or introducing legislation to set or alter program terms. Members of Congress can influence the Administration's development of a five-year program by submitting public comments, conducting oversight hearings, or introducing legislation to set or alter program terms. The 114th Congress pursued these actions for the 2017-2022 program, and the 115th Congress may also address it through legislation or choose not to intervene. Congress reviews each five-year program under the OCSLA, but direct approval is not required for implementation. The 114th Congress influenced the 2017-2022 program through public comments and legislation. Members of Congress, state governors, agencies, and the public can submit comments on draft programs. BOEM received comments from Members on the initial request for information, the DPP, and the PP. For the 2017-2022 program, BOEM received comments from Members of Congress on the initial request for information, the DPP, and the PP. Some comments opposed certain regions in the program, while others supported lease sales or sought an expansion of lease areas. The comments also addressed issues like seismic testing in the Atlantic. BOEM considers these public comments when developing successive drafts of the program. BOEM considers public comments, including those from Members of Congress, when developing drafts of a five-year oil and gas leasing program. The program may be revised based on feedback, and oversight hearings by the House or Senate help inform legislative decision-making. After BOEM releases a draft of a five-year oil and gas leasing program, oversight hearings by the House or Senate are held to evaluate it. These hearings inform legislative decision-making and provide an opportunity for feedback from Members of Congress. Members and witnesses discuss issues such as the number of lease sales, leasing in the Atlantic and Arctic, and seismic surveying in the Atlantic. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on the draft five-year oil and gas leasing program on April 15, 2015. Discussions included the number of lease sales proposed, leasing in the Atlantic and Arctic, and seismic surveying in the Atlantic. Another hearing on the program's proposed changes took place on May 19, 2016, focusing on targeted lease sales in Alaska and the removal of the Atlantic lease sale from the program.
