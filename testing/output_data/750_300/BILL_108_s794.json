    "content": "The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" may be cited as the Act. It includes phased increases in fuel economy standards. The \"Automobile Fuel Efficiency Improvements Act of 2003\" mandates phased increases in fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles, with minimum standards set for different model years. For example, after model year 1984 and before model year 2006, the standard is 25 miles per gallon. The fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles are mandated to increase over different model years. For example, after model year 2014, the standard shall be 40 miles per gallon. The section is amended to increase the standard for fuel economy in passenger automobiles. This includes removing certain language and reorganizing paragraphs. The section is amended to increase the fuel economy standard for non-passenger automobiles by reorganizing paragraphs and removing specific language. The fuel economy standard for non-passenger automobiles is increased based on model years, starting at 17 miles per gallon for model years after 1984 and reaching 27.5 miles per gallon for model years after 2014. The fuel economy standard for non-passenger automobiles increases based on model years, starting at 17 miles per gallon for model years after 1984 and reaching 27.5 miles per gallon for model years after 2014. After model year 2008 and before model year 2012, the standard is 21.5 miles per gallon, after model year 2011 and before model year 2015 it is 24.5 miles per gallon, and after model year 2014 it is 27.5 miles per gallon. If the Secretary does not increase the standard within 24 months after the latest increase, there are provisions for review. If the Secretary does not increase the fuel economy standard within 24 months after the latest increase, a report must be submitted to Congress explaining the reasons for not increasing the standard. The report is due within 90 days after the 24-month period expires. SEC. 3. INCREASED INCLUSIVENESS OF DEFINITIONS OF AUTOMOBILE AND PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE. The definition of \"Automobile\" in section 32901(a) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to increase the weight limit to 12,000 pounds and the fuel economy standard to 14,000 pounds. The weight limit for passenger automobiles is increased to 14,000 pounds, and the fuel economy standard is also set at 14,000 pounds. The definition of a passenger automobile is an automobile with a gross vehicle weight of 12,000 pounds or less designed for transporting persons, excluding vehicles with load carrying devices attached or seating capacity exceeding 12 persons. The definition of a passenger automobile excludes vehicles with load carrying devices, seating capacity exceeding 12 persons, or cargo areas extending beyond the frame. The definition of a passenger automobile excludes vehicles with load carrying devices, seating capacity exceeding 12 persons, or cargo areas extending beyond the frame. The amendments made by this section apply to automobiles manufactured for model years after the enactment of this Act. SEC. 4. CIVIL PENALTIES. Increased Penalty for Violations of Fuel Economy Standards under section 32912 of title 49, United States Code, is amended to increase the penalty amount to $10 annually, effective on October 1 of each year. The penalty amount for violations of fuel economy standards under section 32912 of title 49, United States Code, is increased to $10 annually, with adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index published by the Department of Labor. The penalty for violations of fuel economy standards is increased to $10 annually, adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index. The term 'price index' refers to the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers. Amendments to the section include redesignating subparagraphs and applying changes to automobiles manufactured after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5. ACCURATE FUEL ECONOMY TESTING. Biennial Report on Testing Quality: The Secretary of Transportation must submit a report to Congress every odd-numbered year on the quality of automobile fuel economy testing for all available technologies. The report to Congress will assess the accuracy of fuel economy testing for automobiles and discuss planned changes in testing methodology. The report to Congress will assess the accuracy of fuel economy testing for automobiles and discuss planned changes in testing methodology, including the effects on accuracy. The Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will consult on the preparation of the biennial report. The first biennial report on testing quality under section 32920 of title 49, United States Code, will be submitted to Congress in 2005. The Secretary of Transportation will conduct a study to improve the process for measuring automobile fuel economy accuracy. The National Transportation Systems Center will conduct a study to determine the most accurate automobile fuel economy testing process for highway, urban, and combined use. The National Transportation Systems Center will conduct a study to determine the most accurate automobile fuel economy testing process for different categories of automobile use and compare it with the current testing process under title 49, United States Code. A report must be submitted within two years. The National Transportation Systems Center will conduct a study to determine the most accurate automobile fuel economy testing process for different categories of automobile use and compare it with the current process under title 49, United States Code. A report must be submitted to Congress within two years, including determinations and comparisons made during the study. The report to Congress will include determinations and comparisons made under the new automobile fuel economy testing process, along with an estimate of the average adjustment to fuel economy ratings. The Act requires a revision of the automobile fuel economy testing procedure to closely align ratings with the most accurate process determined. This revision must be completed within 180 days after the report to Congress, which includes determinations and comparisons under the new testing process. The Act mandates a revised testing procedure for accurately measuring automobile fuel economy within 180 days of the report to Congress. The Act mandates a revised testing procedure for accurately measuring the actual automobile fuel economy of each model of automobile manufactured after model year 2006. The testing procedure shall be based on the process identified in the report. The Act mandates a revised testing procedure for measuring actual automobile fuel economy for cars manufactured after model year 2006. The procedure is based on a report's testing process. The Secretary of Transportation must adjust average fuel economy standards for cars made after 2006. The Secretary of Transportation must adjust average fuel economy standards for automobiles manufactured after model year 2006 to account for improved accuracy in fuel economy calculation resulting from the revised testing procedure mandated by the Act. The Secretary of Transportation must ensure that the revised testing procedure improves accuracy in calculating automobile fuel economy. The average fuel economy standards must be as stringent as those under section 32902 of title 49, United States Code, if the testing procedure had not been revised. Standards for executive agency automobiles are outlined in Section 6. Section 32917 of title 49, United States Code is amended to set fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger automobiles. The amendment sets fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles. The amendment establishes fleet average fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles in a fiscal year. The amendment sets fuel economy standards for non-passenger and passenger automobiles in a fiscal year, with a minimum number of exceptionally fuel-efficient vehicles required by regulations. The amendment requires regulations for executive agencies to have at least 20% of passenger automobiles with a fuel economy rating at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard for the model year. Beginning in fiscal year 2009, executive agencies must have at least 10,000 vehicles with a fuel economy rating at least 5 miles per gallon higher than the average standard for the model year."
