The \"MANIFEST for Human Spaceflight Act of 2016\" reaffirms Congress's goal for NASA to expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit with international partners. Congress also makes findings in line with previous legislation. The \"MANIFEST for Human Spaceflight Act of 2016\" reaffirms Congress's goal for NASA to expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit with international partners. Congress makes findings based on a review by the National Academy of Sciences on human space flight goals and direction. The Committee on Human Spaceflight, comprised of leaders from various sectors, concluded that there are multiple compelling reasons for human space exploration, including economic benefits, national security, and inspiring students. Their findings were published in a 2014 report titled \"Pathways to Exploration: Rationales and Approaches for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration.\" Spaceflight concluded that various rationales make a compelling case for human space exploration, including economic benefits, national security, inspiring citizens, scientific discovery, human survival, and a shared destiny. The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended Mars as the long-term goal and suggested NASA define sustainable steps for mission planning. The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended NASA define sustainable steps for mission planning to achieve the long-term goal of placing humans on Mars. The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended NASA define sustainable steps for mission planning to achieve the long-term goal of placing humans on Mars. SEC. 3. HUMAN EXPLORATION STRATEGY. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010 is amended to include human exploration of Mars, with a focus on extending human presence to the surface of Mars. NASA is tasked with defining sustainable steps for mission planning to achieve this goal. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is directed to establish a strategy for human exploration of Mars, focusing on extending human presence to the surface through a series of sustainable missions. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is directed to establish a strategy for human exploration of Mars, focusing on extending human presence to the surface through a series of sustainable missions in cis-lunar space. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is directed to establish a strategy for human exploration of Mars, focusing on extending human presence to the surface through sustainable missions in cis-lunar space. The strategy should include the utility of an expanded human presence in cis-lunar space for enabling missions to various destinations, economic, scientific, and technological advances. The strategy for human exploration of Mars includes extending human presence to the surface through sustainable missions in cis-lunar space, focusing on economic, scientific, and technological advances, collaboration with international partners, private industry, and other Federal agencies, and utilizing the International Space Station for support. The opportunities provided by the International Space Station (ISS) support high priority scientific research and technological developments for expanding human presence in cis-lunar space and beyond, including exploration mission architectures for the Orion crew capsule and Space Launch System. The curr_chunk discusses a range of exploration mission architectures for the Orion crew capsule and Space Launch System, comparing them based on factors like cost effectiveness, schedule resiliency, safety, sustainability, and opportunities for international collaboration. The curr_chunk highlights the importance of certain architectures and approaches in enabling new markets and opportunities for US private industry, promoting scientific discovery and technological excellence, sustaining US competitiveness and leadership, and addressing critical national security considerations. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need for flexible architectures and approaches to adapt to evolving technologies, partners, priorities, and budget constraints. It also includes measures for ensuring crew health and safety, such as setting standards for radiation exposure limits and necessary countermeasures. The curr_chunk outlines crew health and safety measures, including radiation exposure limits, countermeasures, urgent medical care, and crew training needs for space missions. The curr_chunk provides details on crew training needs, prioritizing missions, and assessing recommendations for space missions. The curr_chunk includes an assessment of recommendations for space missions and technical information for identifying potential stakeholders or partners. The Administrator will arrange for the National Academy of Sciences to independently review and comment on each interim report regarding the strategy, including technical information for identifying potential stakeholders or partners. The National Academy of Sciences will review and comment on each interim report on the strategy, identifying agreed-upon matters, concerns, and making further recommendations. The National Academy of Sciences will review and comment on interim reports, addressing concerns and making recommendations as appropriate, ensuring timely compliance with requirements. The Administrator must ensure timely review and comment on interim reports to comply with requirements and incorporate National Academy of Sciences' comments into the final report. Deadlines for interim reports must be met within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Administrator must submit interim reports every five years to the National Academy of Sciences for independent review. Final reports must be submitted within one year of the Act's enactment. The Administrator must submit final reports to Congress on the strategy required by paragraph (1), incorporating the National Academy of Sciences' response to the most recent interim report."
