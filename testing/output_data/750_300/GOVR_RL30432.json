    "content": "The EPA believes there should be a higher rate of NSR permits for new or expanded facilities. The CAA requires preconstruction review and permits for major modifications or new sources of air pollution. States with EPA-approved SIPs must obtain regulatory approval from the state agency for new construction or modifications to ensure compliance with NAAQS. The applicant must demonstrate that the project will not violate NAAQS to receive a \"Permit to Construct.\" The New Source Review (NSR) process requires regulatory approval from the state agency to construct or modify sources to ensure compliance with NAAQS and PSD regulations. The applicant must show that the project will not violate NAAQS or exceed pollution limits, triggering NSR for sources emitting over 100 tons annually. The New Source Review (NSR) process, under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) regulations, is triggered for new sources emitting 100 tons annually of any criteria air pollutant or causing a significant increase in emissions. Sources subject to PSD must install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for compliance. The New Source Review (NSR) process applies to sources emitting 100 tons annually of any criteria air pollutant or causing a significant increase in emissions. Sources covered by PSD must install Best Available Control Technology (BACT) determined on a case-by-case basis. If subject to non-attainment provisions, sources must install Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) and obtain applicable offsets. Both BACT and LAER must be at least as stringent as federal standards. The New Source Review (NSR) process requires sources to install Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) and obtain offsets in non-attainment areas. Few preconstruction permits have been issued to coal-fired power plants under NSR. Current U.S. coal-fired electric generating capacity has remained steady at 300,000 MW for the last decade. The lack of permits for coal-fired power plants is not surprising given the steady capacity of 300,000 MW in the US over the last decade. Emissions trends show NOx levels have remained constant, while SO2 emissions have decreased. Emissions trends for electric utilities show a static situation for coal-fired capacity. SO2 emissions significantly dropped in 1995 due to the acid rain control program under the 1990 CAA Amendments. Phase 1 units emitted about 10 million tons of SO2 in 1990. The EPA required a 30% reduction in emissions from baseline levels specified in the title. Phase 1 units emitted 10 million tons of SO2 in 1990, reduced to 5.3 million tons in 1995. NOx provisions also reduced emissions by 0.4 million tons in 1996. However, some reductions were offset by increases in emissions from other plants. The reductions achieved under title IV were partially offset by increases in emissions from other plants. While title IV led to a 4.7 million ton reduction in SO2 by 1995, overall emissions only decreased by about 3.6 million tons. Similarly, a 0.4 million ton reduction in NOx by 1996 was offset by an overall reduction of only about 0.1 million tons. This slippage is not surprising as phase 1 does not cover all coal-fired facilities. Despite reductions achieved under title IV, there was a slight increase in NOx emissions by 1996, with only a 0.1 million ton reduction overall. The ongoing operation of existing coal-fired facilities has led to an increase in coal-fired electricity generation and coal consumption over the past decade, despite the lack of new plant construction. Despite the lack of new plant construction, coal-fired electricity generation and coal consumption have continued to increase over the past decade. This growth is attributed to utilities optimizing the performance of existing coal-fired facilities, which have not decreased in efficiency despite their increasing age. This suggests a fundamental change in the economics of plant maintenance over the past decade. Utilization of coal-fired capacity has increased over the past decade, with no decrease in efficiency. This suggests a shift in the economics of plant maintenance, raising questions about whether maintenance efforts represent routine maintenance or major modifications under the CAA. The debate revolves around whether maintenance efforts on existing coal-fired facilities should be classified as \"routine maintenance\" or \"major modifications\" under the CAA. This distinction determines whether pollution control equipment needs to be installed. The issue is becoming more critical as the electric utility industry focuses more on plant economics. Many utilities are avoiding the term \"life extension\" for their spending. The restructuring of the electric utility industry is leading to a focus on plant economics, triggering the need for new controls. Many utilities are avoiding the term \"life extension\" for spending on old power plants due to the 1970 Clean Air Act, which exempts pre-1971 plants from emissions restrictions. This issue is expected to intensify in the future. The 1970 Clean Air Act requires power plants built after August 1971 to restrict emissions of pollutants like sulfur dioxide. Plants constructed before 1971 are exempt, but can lose this exemption if they are modified in a major way. Regulatory activities are ongoing regarding electricity generation and air quality. Currently, there is significant regulatory activity related to electricity generation and air quality, including the Ozone Transport Rule, Section 126 Petitions, Regional Haze Rule, new NAAQS for Fine Particulates, revised Ozone NAAQS, NSPS for NOx for electric utilities, initiatives by the Ozone Transport Commission, and legislative initiatives. NSR enforcement is seen as a crucial tool for enforcing existing laws and regulations. NSR enforcement is a key tool for enforcing existing laws and regulations related to electricity generation and air quality. The Department of Justice/EPA lawsuits under NSR are separate from regulatory activities and aim to enforce laws, not create new ones. EPA has clarified that NSR enforcement is not linked to the regulatory initiatives mentioned earlier. The enforcement actions stem from an examination of coal-fired utilities starting in late 1996. The EPA's enforcement action under NSR is not connected to regulatory development. It stems from an examination of coal-fired utilities starting in late 1996. NSR allows EPA to impose penalties and require affected sources to install the latest pollution control technology, such as flue-gas desulfurization for SO2 emissions. The EPA can require affected sources violating NSR to install the latest pollution control technology, such as flue-gas desulfurization for SO2 emissions. This could involve installing scrubbers on coal-fired utility boilers to meet percentage reduction requirements. Additionally, new NOx NSPS for utility boilers may require the installation of selective catalytic reduction units to reduce emissions by 70-90%. The EPA could require existing boilers to install SCR units to reduce emissions by 70-90%. This could lead to substantial reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions, equivalent to taking 26 million cars off the road. Administrator Browner stated that controlling sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plants could lead to an 85 to 95 percent reduction in these pollutants, equivalent to removing 26 million cars from the road and reducing acid rain by 15 percent. The focus on NSR reflects the belief that aging coal-fired plants will continue operating under electric utility restructuring, which is a cost-effective alternative to building new capacity. The operation of aging coal-fired plants is a future trend under electric utility restructuring. Extending the life of existing coal-fired capacity is cost-effective. The competitive generating market could further encourage renovating existing coal-fired capacity. Mitigating environmental effects could be done by requiring BACT through NSR. EPA is taking legal actions against utilities for maintenance activities approved for decades. The EPA is taking legal actions against utilities for maintenance activities approved for decades, including requiring Best Available Control Technology (BACT) through New Source Review (NSR) to mitigate environmental effects of extending the life of existing coal-fired plants. Enforcement of NSR on existing coal-fired facilities has been a challenge for almost two decades. The EPA faced challenges in enforcing NSR on existing coal-fired facilities due to budget constraints and difficulties in defining a major modification. The term \"modification\" was first used in the 1970 CAA Amendments, with the Act defining it as any physical change that increases air pollutant emissions. The CAA defined \"modification\" as any physical or operational change that increases air pollutant emissions. EPA regulations further specified it as any change resulting in an increase in the maximum hourly emission rate of controlled air pollutants. The EPA regulations defined \"modification\" as any change increasing the maximum hourly emission rate of controlled air pollutants. NSR in 1977 shifted focus to compliance with NAAQS and PSD, defining \"significant\" emission increases in tons per year emitted by major sources. The EPA regulations in 1977 shifted focus to compliance with NAAQS and PSD, defining \"significant\" emission increases in tons per year emitted by major sources. Facilities exceeding the 40-ton threshold for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are subject to NSR, but enforcing these thresholds has proven challenging. EPA's NSPS program thresholds do not constrain utilities' life extension efforts, which mainly improve generating unit availability and reliability. Most life extension efforts by utilities under EPA's NSPS program do not face practical constraints. These efforts focus on improving availability and reliability of generating units without significantly increasing emissions. However, the NSR review may be triggered by an increase in pollutant output due to life extension activities, raising questions on how to measure this change. Life extension projects can increase emissions due to a tonnage increase in pollutant output, leading to questions on how to measure the change. EPA enforced NSR against facilities undergoing life extension efforts in the late 1980s, ruling that increased emissions post-project compared to pre-project levels triggered NSR. In 1988, the EPA ruled that a life extension project by Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO) triggered NSR due to potential increased emissions. EPA later modified the emissions trigger for electric utilities in 1992 to compare actual emissions before and after modifications. The NSR regulations for utility plants determine emissions applicability by comparing actual emissions before and after modifications. Actual emissions are based on a 2-year average prior to the change, while future actual emissions consider projected rates and utilization. EPA excludes maintenance, repair, and replacement from the definition of modification under NSR. Utilities have responded to EPA's inquiries regarding their life extension activities. Utilities have adjusted their life extension efforts to align with routine maintenance schedules, as defined by NSR regulations. The term \"life extension\" has been replaced in professional literature with terms like capital improvement and performance improvement. Utilities have integrated life extension efforts into routine maintenance schedules, replacing the term with terms like capital improvement and performance improvement. The distinction between \"modification\" and \"routine maintenance\" is blurred by this approach. The Justice Department's lawsuits aim to enforce the Clean Air Act's New Source Review requirements regarding coal-fired capacity construction and modifications by investor-owned utilities. The term \"rehabilitation program\" blurs the line between modification and routine maintenance, with no early resolution expected. EPA has issued a \"Compliance Order\" regarding modifications by the Tennessee Valley Authority of its coal-fired power plants that should have triggered new source reviews. Tables 3, 4, and 5 list facilities cited for violating NSR requirements and types of rehabilitations considered modifications by EPA for NSR. The Justice Department/EPA has cited facilities for violating NSR requirements and seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties. The complaints may be modified or new ones issued as investigations progress, with penalties of up to $25,000 per day of violation. The complaints against investor-owned facilities seek injunctive relief and civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day of violation. The relief includes compliance with CAA requirements, installing BACT for past NSR violations, applying for permits, and auditing operations for NSR compliance. EPA's compliance order for TVA requires developing a schedule for meeting all applicable requirements and auditing coal-fired power plants for NSR compliance. The EPA's compliance order for TVA requires developing a schedule for meeting all applicable requirements affecting specified facilities, auditing coal-fired power plants for NSR compliance, and retiring SO2 allowances equal to any reductions resulting from compliance. The industry's response focuses on an exemption for \"routine maintenance\" under NSR regulations. The industry's response to EPA's enforcement action focuses on an exemption for \"routine maintenance\" under NSR regulations, arguing that EPA has not objected to utilities engaging in these activities in the past. Industry is challenging EPA's enforcement action, claiming that activities triggering NSR were well-publicized and necessary for plant operation. They argue that these activities are akin to routine maintenance and should not be considered major modifications under NSR criteria. The industry challenges EPA's enforcement action, arguing that routine maintenance activities should not trigger major modifications under NSR criteria. Emissions must not exceed the cap, as unused allowances will be emitted elsewhere. Applying NSR to sources under the cap will result in higher costs and pollution shifting to other sources. EPA Administrator emphasizes the importance of controlling sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plants. The EPA Administrator announces that controlling sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plants could lead to an 85 to 95 percent reduction in these pollutants, resulting in a reduction of 1.87 million tons of SO2 emissions and 0.63 million tons of NOx emissions. This would more than compensate for the erosion in original reductions under title IV. The EPA's NSR action could lead to substantial emission reductions, with cuts in SO2 emissions by 50% more than the slippage and NOx emissions by double the slippage. Further reductions may be achieved as utilities implement BACT or retire offending facilities. The complexity of the CAA may impact the actual reduction achieved under NSR. The Clean Air Act (CAA) is a complex legislation that could impact emission reductions achieved under the EPA's NSR action. Title IV of the CAA sets limits on SO2 emissions from utilities to 8.9 million tons, with interim reductions required in 1995 and enforced through tonnage limitations and emission offset requirements. Title IV of the Clean Air Act sets limits on SO2 emissions from utilities to 8.9 million tons, with interim reductions required in 1995. The cap is enforced through tonnage limitations at individual existing utility plants and an emission offset requirement for new facilities. Emissions are capped based on a specified rate times historical fuel consumption levels, and an allowance system was created to regulate emissions. Allowances are a limited authorization to emit SO2, allocated to existing facilities by the EPA. The 1990 CAA Amendments program established a comprehensive emissions allowance system for SO2 emissions, with allowances issued by the EPA to existing facilities. Allowances can be used at the allocated plant, traded, or banked for future use. The program has achieved 100% compliance but does not integrate well with the 1977 CAA Amendments NSR program. The 1990 CAA Amendments program established an emissions allowance system for SO2 emissions, allowing trading or banking for future use or sale. It has achieved 100% compliance but does not integrate well with the 1977 CAA Amendments NSR program. The NSR focuses on modifications at existing facilities and installation of BACT, while Title IV is a program to reduce aggregate SO2 emissions by permitting utilities considerable flexibility. Compliance with the cap is the determining criterion for Title IV. The NSR program focuses on ensuring compliance with individual plant standards through the installation of BACT, while Title IV aims to reduce aggregate SO2 emissions by allowing utilities flexibility in compliance strategies. The current SO2 NSPS sets a reduction requirement of 70%-90%, but existing coal-fired facilities under Title IV have less stringent requirements that can be met with low-sulfur coal. Installing BACT under NSR may result in \"overcontrol\" of SO2 emissions. The NSR program focuses on ensuring compliance with individual plant standards through the installation of BACT, while Title IV aims to reduce aggregate SO2 emissions with less stringent requirements for existing coal-fired facilities. Installing BACT under NSR may lead to \"overcontrol\" of SO2 emissions, resulting in excess allowances available for sale or banking. This could potentially render any reductions achieved through NSR enforcement moot if the affected plant sells its SO2 reduction to another facility not covered by NSR. Title IV could render NSR enforcement ineffective if a plant sells its SO2 reduction to a facility not covered by NSR. There is no provision in Title IV for adjusting allowance allocations due to NSR enforcement. Congress would need to change the law or utilities would have to voluntarily surrender excess allowances from NSR actions to avoid this \"allowance trap.\" The interaction of NSR and NOx reduction is complex. The NOx NSPS historically lagged behind technology development until the new standard in 1998. The standard set in 1979 could be met with simple combustion. The NOx NSPS for coal-fired facilities was not reflective of cutting-edge technology until the new standard set in 1998, which was challenged in court. The 1979 standard could be met with simple combustion modifications or low-NOx burners, but did not require advanced pollution control devices like selective catalytic reduction. In 1998, EPA set a new NOx NSPS for coal-fired facilities at 0.15 lb. of NOx per million Btu, aligning with available technology. The new standard was challenged in court, leading to the D.C. Court of Appeals vacating it for modified utility boilers in September 1999. This means the NSPS for modified sources reverts to the 1979 standard until EPA proposes a revised NSPS, creating uncertainty for determining BACT or LAER for modified coal-fired sources. The NSPS for modified coal-fired sources reverts to the 1979 standard, creating uncertainty for determining BACT or LAER. The interaction of NSR and title IV adds to the confusion. The 1998 NSPS reduces emissions substantially, as suggested by the EPA. The NOx reduction program under title IV differs from the SO2 program and is based on emission rates for existing facilities to be achieved by 1995 or 2000. The rate limitation for most boilers under title IV is more stringent than the 1979 NOx NSPS. The rate limitation for most boilers under title IV is 0.45 to 0.5 lb. per million Btu, more stringent than the 1979 NOx NSPS. Existing coal-fired facilities have had emission controls since 1995, which are more stringent than the existing NSPS. It is difficult to project what BACT might be currently based on past data. The EPA is enforcing NSR requirements to reduce emissions, believing that some sources have been evading statutory requirements. However, it is challenging to predict the actual NOx reduction that would be achieved by EPA's NSR action at the current time. The EPA is utilizing existing authority to reduce emissions from sources that have been evading statutory requirements. There are concerns about whether this enforcement action will lead to actual emission reductions or just costly litigation. More efficient methods for ensuring declining emissions from existing sources have been developed since the NSR provisions were added to the Clean Air Act in 1977. The Clean Air Act introduced NSR provisions in 1977 to control emissions from existing sources, but more efficient methods have been developed since then. Title IV of the CAA, enacted in 1990, significantly reduced SO2 and NOx emissions from existing utility plants. The \"cap and trade\" program under title IV achieved 100% compliance and surpassed NSR in reducing emissions from coal-fired electric generating facilities. EPA's lawsuits imply NSR's compliance has been lacking. The \"cap and trade\" program under title IV of the Clean Air Act achieved 100% compliance in reducing emissions from coal-fired electric generating facilities, surpassing NSR's effectiveness. EPA's lawsuits suggest NSR's compliance has been near zero, while the title IV program began without significant delays. One alternative is to expand and build on the success of the cap and trade program to further reduce SO2 emissions from coal-fired powerplants. One alternative to reduce SO2 emissions from coal-fired powerplants is to lower the cap on emissions in title IV, which could achieve similar reductions as meeting the 1978 NSPS standards. This would provide utilities with some flexibility while still aiming to reduce emissions. Lowering the existing cap on emissions in title IV could achieve similar reductions as meeting the 1978 NSPS standards for new sources. Utilities would have flexibility in achieving these reductions, although they would receive credit for shutdowns not allowed under NSR enforcement. Implementing a new \"cap and trade\" program for NOx could eliminate uncertainties in the NSR enforcement debate, but would require new legislation. Implementing a new \"cap and trade\" program for NOx could eliminate uncertainties in the NSR enforcement debate and other EPA initiatives. EPA is urging states to consider a regional cap and trade program as part of its proposed Federal Implementation Plan. EPA is considering implementing a regionwide cap and trade program for NOx emissions as part of its proposed Federal Implementation Plan. This program would require cooperation between affected states or new EPA authority. Another alternative is to focus on SO2 and NOx emissions through other regulatory initiatives. The EPA is considering a regionwide cap and trade program for NOx emissions, which would require cooperation between states or new EPA authority. Other regulatory initiatives are also being pursued to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions, such as the OTR and Section 126 petitions, fine particulate NAAQS, and regional haze rule. However, these initiatives have long implementation schedules with few reductions before 2010. The EPA is considering regulations for reducing SO2 and NOx emissions, including a regionwide cap and trade program for NOx emissions. These initiatives have long implementation schedules with few reductions before 2010. Another alternative to NSR would be to control pollutants like mercury and carbon dioxide from coal-fired power plants, which could also reduce SO2 and NOx emissions. Initiating controls on pollutants from coal-fired power plants, such as mercury and carbon dioxide, could reduce emissions of SO2 and NOx. Regulation of mercury emissions has been slow due to EPA determination requirements. Controversy surrounds EPA's authority to regulate CO2 as an air pollutant under the CAA. The process to control Hg emissions from electric utility boilers has been slow. EPA's authority to regulate CO2 is controversial, and alternatives include voluntary initiatives, ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, or reforming NSR by defining \"modification\" based on plant age. For instance, a reform could classify any electric utility generating facility 40 years or older as a modification. One potential reform for NSR is to define \"modification\" based on plant age, not physical changes. This could simplify the NSR trigger by including all electric utility generating facilities 40 years or older. Another reform being considered by the EPA is the implementation of \"off-ramps\" such as the \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" to exclude existing units from NSR regulations. The EPA has been considering reforms to NSR for years, including proposed \"off-ramps\" like the \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" for existing units with state-of-the-art pollution control technology. Clean units are those with BACT or LAER installed in the last 10 years, allowing modifications that do not increase maximum hourly emissions. EPA is considering reforms to NSR, including a \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" for units with recent pollution control technology. However, the effectiveness of these alternatives is debatable due to the need for legislation and potential litigation outcomes. EPA is also exploring cap and trade as a solution. EPA is considering reforms to NSR, including a \"Clean Unit Exclusion\" for units with recent pollution control technology. The agency is embracing cap and trade programs for pollutants, arguing that NSR is duplicative and counterproductive on top of a cap. Replacing NSR with a cap would offer the same environmental protection at a lower cost and with greater benefits. The popular debate on NSR has focused on \"grandfathered\" powerplants, with some arguing for exemptions under the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended in 1977 and 1990, allows older coal-burning power plants to emit more pollution than new plants. Industry lobbyists argued that requiring expensive retrofits for older plants would be wasteful as they were expected to retire soon. However, many of these plants are still operational over 20 years later. The Clean Air Act of 1970 allows older coal-burning power plants to emit more pollution than new plants. Industry lobbyists argued against expensive retrofits for older plants, expecting them to retire soon. However, many of these plants, built in the 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s, are still operating without environmental controls. The term \"grandfathered powerplant\" is used to indicate if a plant is covered under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. The term \"grandfathered\" is used in the debate on emissions from existing power plants to indicate if a plant is covered under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. Section 111 requires the EPA to establish regulations for new sources, including power plants, to install the best emission reduction system. The New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) require major new sources to install the best system of continuous emission reduction for sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulate matter. \"Grandfathered\" refers to plants not subject to NSPS regulations because they were constructed before the effective dates. NSPS regulations for powerplants were first promulgated in 1971 and revised in 1979. The NSPS regulations for powerplants, first promulgated in 1971 and revised in 1979, require major new sources to install emission reduction systems for SO2, NOx, and particulate matter. \"Grandfathered\" plants, constructed before these regulations, must meet emission rate limits set by State Implementation Plans instead. Some pollutants like CO2 and Hg are not covered by NSPS for powerplants. The term \"grandfathered\" in the NSPS regulations for powerplants is ambiguous and potentially meaningless due to certain pollutants like carbon dioxide and mercury not being covered by the regulations. EPA is required to review the NSPS every eight years, leading to increased stringency for covered pollutants. This ambiguity arises as there is no set baseline for what powerplants are considered \"grandfathered.\" The NSPS regulations for powerplants are reviewed every eight years, leading to increased stringency for covered pollutants. The term \"grandfathered\" is ambiguous as there is no set baseline, making it unclear which powerplants fall under this category. Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments changed regulations for existing powerplants regarding SO2 and NOx emissions. Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments changed regulations for existing powerplants with respect to SO2 and NOx emissions. Some existing \"grandfathered\" powerplants were required to meet more stringent NOx standards than new powerplants in 1995. Similarly, in 2000, existing \"grandfathered\" coal-fired powerplants had to meet SO2 standards equivalent to or more stringent than the 1971 NSPS for SO2. Under phase 2 of title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, existing \"grandfathered\" coal-fired powerplants had to meet SO2 standards equivalent to or more stringent than the 1971 NSPS for SO2. The term \"grandfathered\" becomes meaningless in this context as the focus should be on fuel sources for NOx emissions and the title IV emissions cap for SO2 emissions. Age of the plant is not a relevant consideration. The focus of increasing NOx controls should be on coal-fired facilities, regardless of age. The title IV emissions cap is crucial when discussing \"grandfathered\" powerplants and SO2 emissions. Age was considered in allocating emission credits, but the key factor was whether the plant was operational, under construction, or planned at the time of enactment. NSPS for SO2 for new powerplants is somewhat irrelevant as they must offset their emissions under the cap without receiving emission credits. The NSPS for SO2 for new powerplants is effectively nil as they must offset their emissions under the cap without receiving emission credits. Shrinking the current cap on SO2 is suggested for reducing emissions from electric generating facilities. EPA favors a state-by-state emissions caps approach for addressing transported pollution programs in the Northeast. A cap on NOx emissions is a logical extension for reducing emissions from electric generating facilities, favored by the EPA for addressing transported pollution programs in the Northeast. The WEPCO decision sparked public debate and congressional oversight, similar to the DOJ/EPA actions on NSR. Interpretations of CAA provisions and the need for new legislation to address NSR issues are key points of contention. The suits depend on interpretations of CAA provisions, especially regarding modifications of existing sources. Many alternatives for addressing NSR issues would require new legislation amending the CAA to bring consistency and update the regulation of the electric utility industry's environmental impact."
