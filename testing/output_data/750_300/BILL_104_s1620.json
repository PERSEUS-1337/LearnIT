    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmental Dredge Disposal Act of 1996\" and pertains to dredged material disposal facilities. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is amended to include provisions for dredged material disposal facilities for Federal navigation projects. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 now includes provisions for the construction, operation, and maintenance of Federal navigation projects, including dredged material disposal facilities. The Federal share of project costs is limited to funds required for operation and maintenance. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 includes provisions for the construction, operation, and maintenance of Federal navigation projects, including dredged material disposal facilities. The Federal share of project costs is limited to funds required for operation and maintenance, with restrictions on using funds from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for construction. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 limits the Federal share of project costs to operation and maintenance expenses, with restrictions on using Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for construction. Funds for construction can only be used after the Secretary determines they are not needed for eligible operation and maintenance costs. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 restricts the Federal share of project costs to operation and maintenance expenses, with a maximum limit of $25,000,000 for any fiscal year. Eligible operation and maintenance costs include constructing dredged material disposal facilities. The Federal share of costs for constructing and maintaining dredged material disposal facilities for Federal navigation projects in harbors and inland harbors is included in eligible operation and maintenance expenses. The costs of operating and maintaining dredged material disposal facilities for Federal navigation projects, including environmental dredging and contaminated sediments mitigation, are eligible expenses. The Federal government covers costs for managing contaminated sediments in navigation channels and harbor areas to support maritime commerce. Preference is given to port areas for environmental remediation activities. The Secretary gives preference to port areas where harbor maintenance fees exceed Federal expenditures for projects eligible for reimbursement from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund when providing dredged material disposal facilities. The subsection applies to the provision of a dredged material disposal facility if a construction contract has not been awarded before the enactment date. It also includes the amendment of existing agreements. The subsection applies to navigation projects not awarded before the enactment date and requires the amendment of existing agreements between the Secretary and non-Federal interests. The subsection requires amending agreements between the Secretary and non-Federal interests for navigation projects not awarded before the enactment date, specifically regarding the Federal share of project costs for dredged material disposal facilities. Amendments must be applied prospectively. The cooperative agreement required for navigation projects must be amended prospectively. This subsection does not increase the non-Federal share of costs for dredged material disposal facilities."
