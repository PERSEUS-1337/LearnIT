President Ramos-Horta urged Timor to move on after the report. Concerns arose over government plans to withdraw funds from Timor's Petroleum Fund in 2009, as Timor seeks economic benefit from gas reserves in the Timor Sea despite political instability. In 2009, Timor planned to withdraw funds from the Petroleum Fund to gain economic benefit from gas reserves in the Timor Sea. However, political instability and the geography of the seabed make Timor less attractive than Darwin, Australia, for gas processing. China's involvement in Timor-Leste increased in 2009, offering assistance with construction and selling power plants and patrol boats. East Timor created the National Recovery Strategy Program in 2007 to address housing, community trust-building, security, and stability. The government of East Timor created the National Recovery Strategy Program in 2007, covering areas such as housing, community trust-building, security, social protection, and local socio-economic development. The approach to the return, resettlement, and reintegration options for IDPs is part of this framework, with the last of the IDP camps being closed in June 2009. East Timor will need support through 2009 to complete the decommissioning of the IDP camps and provide for returning persons. In June 2009, the last IDP camp was closed in East Timor, with the government needing support to complete decommissioning and aid returning persons. The Portuguese controlled East Timor from the 1640s until 1975 when Fretilin declared independence.

In a referendum supervised by the U.N. in East Timor on August 30, 1999, 78% of registered voters chose independence from Indonesia. This resulted in violent retaliation by pro-integrationist militias, leading to over 1,300 deaths and widespread destruction of infrastructure. In East Timor, 70% of economic infrastructure was destroyed by militias, leading to the deployment of a U.N.-authorized peacekeeping mission. Australia has played a leading role in U.N. operations and bilateral relations with East Timor since 1999. Jose Ramos-Horta is the president of Timor-Leste. Jose Ramos-Horta, the president of Timor-Leste, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 for his work promoting the cause of Timor-Leste.

The current unicameral national parliament of 65 members was elected in June 2007, growing out of an 88-member Constituent Assembly elected in August 2001. The Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste has a unicameral national parliament of 65 members, which was elected on June 30, 2007. The parliament originated from an 88-member Constituent Assembly elected in August 2001, which drafted a constitution for East Timor. East Timor formally became independent on May 20, 2002, after being under the administration of the United Nations. Fretilin is the party that led the resistance to Indonesian rule. The new constitution of East Timor established a parliamentary government with a popularly elected President. Xanana Gusmao led a coalition government formed after the 2007 parliamentary election, consisting of the Alliance of the Parliamentary Majority (APM) with four party members. After the 2007 parliamentary election, Xanana Gusmao formed a coalition government called the Alliance of the Parliamentary Majority (APM) with four party members.

In the 2002 East Timor Presidential election, independence leader Gusmao won decisively with 86% voter turnout. In 2006, events led to the reintroduction of foreign peacekeepers, including troops from Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, and Malaysia, deployed at the invitation of the East Timorese government. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1704 established the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT). The military contingent in East Timor, consisting of 1,100 troops, was deployed at the invitation of the government. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1704 established the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) with a civilian component, up to 1,608 police personnel, and up to 34 military liaison and staff officers. UNMIT's mission aimed to support the East Timorese government in consolidating stability, enhancing democratic governance, and facilitating political dialogue for national reconciliation. The source of the 2006 strife in East Timor can be traced to internal divisions. The 2006 strife in East Timor stemmed from divisions within the dominant Fretilin party during their struggle against the Indonesians. Some Fretilin elites went into exile while others, including Xanana Gusmao, stayed to fight in the military wing of Fretilin, Falintil, which he led. These divisions also affected the military and police forces, with most military members aligning with Gusmao. The divisions within Fretilin led to splits in the military and police forces in East Timor. Most military members supported Xanana Gusmao, leading to the creation of paramilitary units within the police. Recruitment processes further deepened the divisions, with Xanana loyalists joining the military and former Indonesian police officers hired into the new East Timor police force. Personal and institutional tensions persisted between the military and police, as highlighted in the International Crisis Group report. The divisions within Fretilin led to splits in the military and police forces in East Timor. Xanana loyalists were in the military, while over 300 former Indonesian police officers were hired into the new East Timor police force. Personal and institutional tensions between the president and ruling party, politicization of the police, lack of regulatory framework, and a small political elite with shared history contributed to the political turmoil of 2006. The dismissal of 591 military members by former Prime Minister Alkatiri in March 2006 triggered political turmoil in East Timor due to protests over conditions, pay, and alleged discrimination. The military was divided between eastern and western districts, leading to tensions within the political and security forces. In July 2006, police factions emerged in East Timor, with some officers joining rebels in the hills. The dismissal of protesting troops in March 2006 led to rioting, looting, and the fleeing of thousands from the capital. Former Prime Minister Alkatiri resigned in June amid accusations of forming \"hit squads.\" In April 2006, looting, deaths, and mass exodus of East Timorese from Dili occurred. Former Prime Minister Alkatiri resigned in June amid accusations of forming \"hit squads.\" Former Interior Minister Lobato was sentenced to seven years for authorizing weapons transfer to supporters. Minister Rogerio Lobato was sentenced to seven years imprisonment for authorizing the transfer of weapons to pro-Fretilin supporters and a Fretilin-linked hit squad. Lobato had a \"frosty\" relationship with Gusmao, bought large quantities of arms for the police, and established two paramilitary police units. Major Alfredo Reinado, a leader of violent protests in March 2006, escaped from prison with 50 supporters in August 2006. Australian forces failed to capture Reinado on March 11, 2007, despite an operation ordered by the East Timor government. Major Alfredo Reinado, with a support base from the west, escaped from prison in August 2006 along with 50 supporters. Despite an operation ordered by the East Timor government, Australian forces failed to capture Reinado on March 11, 2007. The decision to apprehend Reinado came after he convinced a border patrol unit to hand over their assault rifles on February 25, 2007. Reinado, though not a major political figure, had garnered significant support among young men resentful of foreign military presence in East Timor. Reinado, a minor political figure in East Timor, gained support among young men resentful of foreign military presence. Gang violence escalated due to high unemployment rates, leading to further deaths and displacement in Dili. Unemployment and underemployment in East Timor is as high as 70%, leading to gang violence and instability. The collapse of law and order after the 2006 clashes resulted in deaths, displacement of residents, and property destruction. The security situation affected livelihoods, with 100,000 people remaining displaced by February 2007. Gangs in Dili reportedly view Reinado positively. The security situation in East Timor since April 2006 caused instability and displacement of 100,000 people by February 2007. Many were in camps with poor sanitation and risk of disease. Flooding was also a concern in these camps. Poor sanitation and lack of access to potable water posed significant health risks for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in camps in East Timor. The camps were also at risk for flooding. These conditions were exacerbated by the overall poverty in East Timor, where over 40% of the population lived below the poverty line, leading to high child mortality rates due to lack of sanitation, infectious diseases, and malnutrition. Rice shortages and increasing food prices were additional concerns, along with deteriorating social structures and services at the community level. The high child mortality rate in East Timor is due to lack of sanitation, infectious diseases, and malnutrition. Rice shortages and food price increases are also concerns. Deteriorating social structures affect healthcare and education. Distribution of essentials and projects focus on IDPs, but needs are significant countrywide. Transitioning from humanitarian to development programs is challenging due to extreme poverty levels. In East Timor, distribution of basic essentials and projects focus on IDPs, but needs are significant countrywide. Transitioning from humanitarian to development programs is challenging due to extreme poverty levels. Funding increases during times of insecurity and displacement, with the UN providing emergency assistance and generating a Flash Appeal in 2006, contributing nearly $40 million. In 2006, the U.N. CERF provided emergency assistance and UNOCHA generated a Flash Appeal, raising nearly $40 million. In 2007, security incidents increased, leading to restrictions on humanitarian personnel movement and concerns about displacement and security. Some believe the violent demonstrations were more local gang-related incidents. Concerns about protection and security for displaced individuals and humanitarian organizations providing assistance arose due to violent demonstrations, possibly linked to local gang activity. Contingency planning was initiated by the National Disaster Management Office and Ministry of Labour and Community Reinsertion to address displacement caused by civil unrest. The international humanitarian aid community, including the U.N. peacekeeping operation, works alongside various organizations and donor governments to provide assistance. The international humanitarian aid community, including the U.N., international organizations, NGOs, and donor governments, provides assistance in East Timor. IDPs willing to return received recovery packages by April 2008, with the government decommissioning some IDP camps. The Ministry of Social Solidarity oversees the returns process with help from international organizations. In November 2008, around 10,400 families had received recovery packages and returned, leading to the closure of approximately 21 IDP camps. Transitional shelter sites were built to accommodate some displaced individuals. However, returning IDPs still face challenges such as limited access to food, water, and basic services, exacerbated by rising food prices and shortages of dietary staples. Limited access to food, water, and basic services remains a problem for returning IDPs, along with increasing food prices and shortages of dietary staples. The sustainability of returns is affected by unsettled land disputes, damaged homes, and fear of violence in home villages, making reintegration into original communities challenging. The reintegration of IDPs into their original communities has been challenging due to unsettled land disputes, damaged homes, and fear of violence. Despite no major incidents of violence during recent returns, sustaining returns and developing durable solutions are key priorities highlighted by U.N. Representative Walter Kalin in December 2008. The formal mission of UNOCHA ended in the same month, but a national staff member continues their work. In December 2008, U.N. Representative Walter Kalin visited East Timor and emphasized the importance of sustaining returns and developing durable solutions. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) ended its formal mission in December 2008, but a national staff member continues to work with a small humanitarian team within UNMIT.

The curr_chunk discusses the evolution of U.N. peace operations in East Timor since 1999, including the establishment of the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) and the preparation of a medium-term strategy for the country. The United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) was established in 1999 to organize a national referendum on East Timor's status. After violence erupted post-referendum, the Security Council authorized the establishment of INTERFET, a multinational force. Indonesia's parliament confirmed the results of the referendum on October 19, 1999. The United Nations Transitional Authority for East Timor (UNTAET) was established on October 25, 1999, to administer East Timor's transition to independence. INTERFET initially overlapped with UNTAET until military operations were integrated in February 2000. The U.N. conducted a multi-dimensional peacekeeping operation in East Timor to assist in its transition to independence. UNTAET's mandate included providing humanitarian aid, reconstruction assistance, establishing a functioning government, and aiding East Timorese who fled to Indonesia.

Training of the Border Patrol Unit progressed to the next phase involving interaction with the Indonesian Army, although some concerns about progress were raised. Hasegawa raised concerns about weaknesses in capacity building in justice and finance sectors, with 3,000 pending cases. Continued supervision for human rights activities and unresolved accountability issues were also highlighted. Mr. Hasegawa expressed concerns about the fragile situation in East Timor, with 3,000 pending cases and the need for continued supervision of human rights activities. Additional training for the BPF was also deemed necessary to prevent border incidents and maintain stability for the upcoming elections in 2007. Mr. Hasegawa described the situation in East Timor as \"fragile\" and emphasized the importance of maintaining stability and peace for the 2007 elections.

Concerns about East Timor's readiness for the U.N. departure were validated by events in 2006, highlighting the need for improved security services, judiciary, institutional transparency, and rule of law. The U.N.'s departure from East Timor in 2006 highlighted the need for improved security services, judiciary, institutional transparency, and rule of law. The U.S.'s relations with East Timor have been closely tied to its relations with Indonesia and concerns about past human rights abuses by the Indonesian military. Consideration of the terms of the U.N.'s current presence is necessary to prevent destabilization upon its next departure. The United States' relations with East Timor are linked to its relations with Indonesia and concerns about past human rights abuses. Congress has restricted military contact with Indonesia due to these concerns. East Timor is looking to move forward and have a productive relationship with Indonesia despite the past.
