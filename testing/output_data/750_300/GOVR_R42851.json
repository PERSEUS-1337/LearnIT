    "content": "The PACT Act requires remote retailers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to pay state and local taxes before delivering goods, challenged on grounds of violating the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota emphasized the need for a minimum connection between a state and the transaction being taxed. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires a definite link between a state and the person, property, or transaction it seeks to tax. Recent court cases granted preliminary injunctions against the PACT Act's requirement for remote retailers to pay state and local taxes before delivering goods. Recent court cases in New York and the District of Columbia granted preliminary injunctions against the PACT Act's requirement for remote retailers to pay state and local taxes, citing a violation of due process. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the injunction in Red Earth, while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will consider the injunction in Gordon. In Musser's Inc. v. United States, the federal district court in Pennsylvania rejected the due process argument. In Musser's Inc. v. United States, the federal district court in Pennsylvania rejected the due process argument regarding the PACT Act, stating it is a federal statute requiring compliance with state and local laws, not violating due process. The court found the Act similar to other federal statutes incorporating state law and determined the plaintiff had sufficient contacts with the jurisdictions where it shipped tobacco products. The PACT Act was found to be similar to other federal statutes incorporating state law, and the plaintiff was determined to have sufficient contacts with the jurisdictions where it shipped tobacco products. The Supreme Court emphasized that Congress cannot authorize violations of the Due Process Clause, indicating limitations on requiring remote retailers to pay taxes to jurisdictions without minimum contacts. The constitutionality of the PACT Act may depend on what constitutes minimum contacts for remote retailers, as Congress cannot authorize violations of the Due Process Clause. In Quill, the Supreme Court noted that minimum contacts depend on the degree to which the retailer has purposefully availed itself of an out-of-state jurisdiction. In the context of catalogue retailers, the Supreme Court emphasized that minimum contacts depend on the retailer's purposeful economic activities in the forum state. The tax paid must be related to the state's values, and the state must receive something in return. The PACT Act aimed to regulate remote retailers. The PACT Act aims to regulate remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco by ensuring they follow the same laws as brick and mortar retailers, increasing tax collection, discouraging smuggling, and reducing youth access to cheap tobacco products. The Act requires that taxes on remote sales be related to the state's values and that the state receives something in return. The PACT Act aims to regulate remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco by ensuring compliance with state laws, increasing tax collection, discouraging smuggling, and reducing youth access to cheap tobacco products. It deems interstate sales as intrastate sales, requiring delivery sellers to comply with all applicable state, local, tribal, and other laws, including excise taxes and licensing requirements. The PACT Act requires remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to comply with all state laws, including excise taxes, licensing requirements, and restrictions on sales to minors. Sellers must pay all applicable taxes and apply required stamps before delivery. The PACT Act mandates that remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco must pay all applicable taxes and apply required stamps before delivery, in accordance with state laws. State taxation of out-of-state businesses is governed by the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The PACT Act mandates that remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco must pay all applicable taxes and apply required stamps before delivery, in accordance with state laws. State taxation of out-of-state businesses is governed by the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Under these clauses, state taxes must not unduly burden or discriminate against interstate commerce, and taxes on foreign businesses must have a sufficient connection to the state and relate to the value received. The Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause are \"analytically distinct,\" with Congress able to authorize state activities that comply with the Commerce Clause but not the Due Process Clause. The remote retailers have challenged the PACT Act under the Due Process Clause. The remote retailers have challenged the PACT Act under the Due Process Clause, which may not authorize state activities violating the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court's opinion in Quill is relevant, where the Court considered the physical presence requirement for out-of-state businesses to collect taxes. The Supreme Court upheld the state's authority to collect use tax from out-of-state retailers, citing the Due Process Clause and the precedent set in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz. The Court emphasized that physical presence in the state is not necessary to establish minimum contacts for taxation purposes. The Court upheld Florida courts' jurisdiction over an out-of-state franchisee conducting business remotely in Florida, stating that physical presence in the state is not necessary to establish minimum contacts. Modern commercial transactions often occur across state lines through mail and wire communications, eliminating the need for physical presence in a state where business is conducted. The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that physical presence in a state is not necessary to establish personal jurisdiction if a commercial actor's efforts are directed towards residents of that state. In the case of Quill, the Court found that sending catalogues to North Dakota residents constituted purposeful direction of activities towards that state. In Quill, the Supreme Court ruled that sending catalogues to North Dakota residents established minimum contacts for personal jurisdiction. The key issue is whether the out-of-state business directed its activities at the taxing state and had fair warning of tax liability. In Red Earth, members of the Seneca Nation of Indians who own tobacco retail businesses sought to stop enforcement of the PACT Act's tax requirements, arguing it violates the Due Process Clause by subjecting them to state taxing jurisdiction without sufficient contacts. The plaintiffs in Red Earth challenged the PACT Act's tax requirements, arguing it violates the Due Process Clause by subjecting them to state taxing jurisdiction without sufficient contacts. The United States argued that maintaining websites and shipping goods into the taxing jurisdictions satisfied minimum contacts, but the district court disagreed. The plaintiffs in Red Earth challenged the PACT Act's tax requirements, arguing it violates the Due Process Clause by subjecting them to state taxing jurisdiction without sufficient contacts. The district court rejected the argument that maintaining a website provided minimum contacts, stating that not all plaintiffs have websites and that the websites are \"passive\" virtual catalogs without the ability to make purchases online. The court ruled that a passive website selling cigarettes and smokeless tobacco does not establish minimum contacts for tax requirements. The purchase cannot be completed online, as buyers must send a money order to the retailer. The court also rejected the argument that shipping into a state satisfies minimum contacts. The court determined that a passive website selling cigarettes and smokeless tobacco does not meet the minimum contacts requirement for tax obligations. It rejected the argument that shipping into a state satisfies this requirement, stating that a single sale may not be sufficient to subject a seller to a foreign jurisdiction. The court rejected the idea of a bright-line rule for foreign jurisdiction, stating that a single sale may not be enough to establish minimum contacts. Existing cases suggest that a single sale does not satisfy this requirement, as seen in previous rulings. The court emphasized that the Supreme Court decision in Quill was based on continuous and widespread business solicitation rather than a single sale. The court rejected a bright-line rule for foreign jurisdiction, stating that a single sale may not establish minimum contacts. The Supreme Court decision in Quill was based on continuous and widespread business solicitation rather than a single sale. Congress is expanding jurisdictional reach without considering Due Process constraints. Congress is broadening the jurisdictional reach of state and local laws regarding sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, potentially disregarding the constraints of the Due Process Clause. The PACT Act's constitutionality was challenged in court, with the district court granting a preliminary injunction and the government appealing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The issue at hand is whether Congress can legislate without violating constitutional due process. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the district court's preliminary injunction on the PACT Act, which requires a seller to collect state and local taxes based on making one delivery. The court questioned whether Congress can mandate a vendor to submit to any state's taxing jurisdiction with just one sale, without considering the vendor's level of contact with the state. The court upheld the preliminary injunction on the PACT Act, which requires a seller to collect state and local taxes based on one delivery. The Supreme Court has not definitively ruled on whether a single sale satisfies due process requirements. When the constitutional question is uncertain, a court should uphold the injunction and proceed to trial on the merits. The court upheld a preliminary injunction on the PACT Act, which requires sellers to collect state and local taxes based on one delivery. In Musser's case, the plaintiff, a tobacco retailer operating nationwide, sought an injunction on grounds of the Act's tax requirements. The court's decision was based on a close legal question, avoiding a definitive ruling on the merits at this preliminary stage. Musser's, a tobacco retailer operating nationwide, sought a preliminary injunction on the grounds of the PACT Act's tax requirements. The district court denied the injunction, disagreeing with the analysis in a previous case regarding state tax imposition. The court rejected the Red Earth district court's analysis of the PACT Act, stating that the tax-payment requirement is imposed by Congress, not by a state unilaterally. Congress has long required interstate businesses to comply with state and local laws in regulating interstate commerce. Congress has long required interstate businesses to comply with state and local laws in regulating interstate commerce, such as firearms, online pharmacies, farmers, and distributors of explosives. Federal requirements like these have been found not to offend due process, as Congress has the authority to mandate compliance with state and local laws for engaging in interstate commerce. The court's analysis may be seen as conflating Congress's jurisdiction under the Commerce Clause. The court's analysis concluded that interstate businesses are subject to Congress's legislative jurisdiction, allowing state regulation of interstate commerce. The plaintiff was found to have minimum contacts in all 50 states due to the interactive nature of its website. The court found that the plaintiff had minimum contacts in all 50 states because of its interactive website, using the sliding scale approach from Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc. to determine personal jurisdiction based on online business activities. When dealing with online interactions with residents of a foreign jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction is proper for knowing and repeated transmission of computer files. Passive websites that only provide information are not grounds for jurisdiction, while interactive websites allow for jurisdiction based on the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange. The exercise of personal jurisdiction for online interactions with residents of a foreign jurisdiction is determined by the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange on the website. In Musser's case, the court found that selling products over the Internet and conducting business in all 50 states through the website constituted purposeful availment of jurisdiction. The court found that selling products over the Internet and conducting business in all 50 states through a website constitutes purposeful availment of jurisdiction. Minimum contacts could be satisfied by a single sale transacted through an interactive website. Gordon, a member of the Seneca Nation of Indians, owns a store and telephone order business selling tobacco products. He sought a preliminary injunction against the PACT Act's requirement to pay state and local taxes for products sent to other jurisdictions, arguing it violates due process by not requiring minimum contacts. Initially, the district court denied Gordon's motion as untimely. The PACT Act's requirement for Gordon to pay state and local taxes for tobacco products sent to other jurisdictions was challenged on the grounds of violating due process. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's decision, stating that the motion was timely and raising concerns about Due Process violations when Congress authorizes state levies without minimum contacts. The Court of Appeals disagreed with the district court, stating that Due Process violations can occur when Congress authorizes state levies without minimum contacts. They emphasized that the Due Process and Commerce Clause aspects of the claims should be treated separately, and national legislation cannot violate principles of \"fair play and substantial justice.\" The question of whether national authorization can apply to excise taxes remains open. The Court of Appeals disagreed with the district court, stating that national legislation cannot violate Due Process principles of \"fair play and substantial justice.\" The question of whether national authorization can apply to excise taxes remains open. The government argued that Gordon only needed minimum contacts with the United States, not individual states, to comply with the PACT Act. They also claimed that each of Gordon's tobacco sales into a state satisfied minimum contacts with that state, citing Supreme Court cases to support their position. The court found that the PACT Act imposes a new duty on delivery sellers to ensure state and local taxes are paid, differentiating it from previous cases where interstate businesses were not subject to specific state jurisdictions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected the argument and remanded the case back to the district court. The court found that the PACT Act imposes a new duty on delivery sellers to ensure state and local taxes are paid. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected this argument, stating that Congress cannot authorize violations of the Due Process Clause. The court discussed the opinion in Musser's and concluded that the PACT Act cannot authorize violations of the Due Process Clause. The court reviewed the seminal due process cases and rejected the government's argument that each of Gordon's sales establishes minimum contacts. The court reviewed key due process cases like International Shoe Co. v. Washington and Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz to determine if Gordon's sales establish minimum contacts for personal jurisdiction. The court referenced Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz to determine that personal jurisdiction is proper when a defendant's actions create a substantial connection with the forum State. The court determined that personal jurisdiction is appropriate when the defendant's actions establish a significant connection with the forum State, as noted in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz. This connection can result from the defendant's deliberate engagement in activities within the State or the creation of ongoing obligations with residents of the forum. As a result, it is not unreasonable to require the defendant to participate in litigation in that forum, given that their activities are protected by the forum's laws. The district court emphasized that personal jurisdiction is appropriate when the defendant's actions create a substantial connection with the forum state, as established in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz. It was noted that a single act can support jurisdiction if it creates a significant connection with the forum, but acts with only a weak affiliation are not sufficient for foreseeable litigation in the forum. The foreseeability of being haled into court in the forum state is crucial for due process analysis, as explained in World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson. The court emphasized that personal jurisdiction is appropriate when the defendant's actions create a substantial connection with the forum state, as established in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz. It was noted that foreseeability of being haled into court in the forum state is crucial for due process analysis, as explained in World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson. The Supreme Court focused on foreseeability in due process analysis, providing predictability to the legal system for potential defendants. Additionally, the district court discussed Quill and its due process challenge. The district court discussed Quill's due process challenge, emphasizing the need for a definite link between a state and the person or transaction it seeks to tax. Quill's mail order business had minimum contacts with North Dakota, meeting the due process requirement. In Quill, the Court found that the mail order business had minimum contacts with North Dakota sufficient to meet the due process requirement. The district court found that the Quill standard was not met in Gordon. The district court in Gordon found that the Quill standard for minimum contacts was not met, stating that Gordon's business did not purposefully avail itself of the benefits of the economic market in the states where it sells products. The court also did not find a rational connection between the tax on Gordon's products and the values of the taxing State. The district court in Gordon did not find a rational connection between the tax on Gordon's products and the values of the taxing State, even if a single sale in a state could establish a \"minimum connection.\" The court emphasized that the state's taxing power should be related to the protection, opportunities, and benefits provided by the state to the taxpayer. The court in Gordon found that the PACT Act may violate due process as it does not satisfy due process with a single sale of cigarettes into a state. Congress authorized state taxation of out-of-state businesses under the Commerce Clause. The PACT Act allows state taxation of out-of-state businesses under the Commerce Clause, potentially violating the Due Process Clause if businesses lack minimum contacts with the state. Courts in Red Earth and Gordon analyzed the Act's constitutionality under the Due Process Clause, focusing on the issue of single cigarette sales satisfying due process. The PACT Act may not comply with the Due Process Clause as it allows state taxation of out-of-state businesses without minimum contacts. Courts have analyzed its constitutionality under the Due Process Clause, questioning if a single sale into a jurisdiction satisfies due process. The PACT Act may not comply with the Due Process Clause as it allows state taxation of out-of-state businesses without minimum contacts. Higher courts may find it unclear if a single sale into a jurisdiction meets the due process requirement of minimum contacts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit noted that this issue is a \"close question.\""
