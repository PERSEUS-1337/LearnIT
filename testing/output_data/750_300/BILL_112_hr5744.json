    "content": "The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" includes sections on short title, purposes, definitions, authorized projects, public review, administrative review, and species designations. The Act aims to prevent catastrophic wildfires. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" aims to expedite wildfire prevention projects on Federal lands, reduce threats to endangered species, and provide efficiency tools to streamline projects for wildfire prevention. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines terms like \"at-risk community\" and \"at-risk forest\" to address high wildfire risk on Federal lands. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines terms related to wildfire risk on Federal lands, including conditions that pose a threat to wildlife habitat and authorized wildfire prevention projects. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines terms related to wildfire risk on Federal lands, including authorized wildfire prevention projects for hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, restoration, and habitat protection. The \"Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012\" defines authorized wildfire prevention projects on Federal land for hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, restoration, and habitat protection, which may include activities like livestock grazing and timber harvest. Federal land includes National Forest System land. The term \"land\" in the Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention Act of 2012 refers to National Forest System land and public lands, excluding areas where vegetation removal is prohibited by Federal law. The term \"Secretary concerned\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System land and the Secretary of the Interior for public lands. The term \"threatened and endangered species habitat\" refers to Federal land where natural fire regimes are crucial for endangered or threatened species, as identified in species recovery plans. Wildfire is considered a threat to endangered or threatened species and their habitats as identified in species recovery plans or Federal Register notices. SEC. 4. AUTHORIZED WILDFIRE PREVENTION PROJECTS. The Secretary shall implement wildfire prevention projects in at-risk forests and endangered species habitat, focusing on reducing surface, ladder, and canopy fuels. Protection from catastrophic wildfires is a priority for endangered species habitat projects. The project aims to provide enhanced protection from wildfire for endangered species and their habitat, complying with guidelines from the species recovery plan. In at-risk forests, wildfire prevention projects focus on reducing surface, ladder, and canopy fuels. In at-risk forests, authorized wildfire prevention projects aim to move Federal land towards condition class I. Domestic livestock grazing can be used to reduce surface fuel loads and recover burned areas without utilization standards. Timber harvesting and thinning are also permitted in these projects. Authorized wildfire prevention projects can use domestic livestock grazing to reduce surface fuel loads and recover burned areas. Timber harvesting and thinning are allowed to prevent wildfires. Conducting these projects does not require the revision of land and resource management plans. (e) Relation to Land and Resource Management Plans and Land Use Plan.--No requirement for the Secretary concerned to revise or amend land and resource management plans for conducting wildfire prevention projects on National Forest System lands or public lands. (f) Consideration of Public Petitions.--Secretary concerned must review public petitions for designating Federal land as at-risk forest or threatened species habitat within 60 days. The Secretary must review public petitions for designating Federal land as at-risk forest or threatened species habitat within 60 days. SEC. 5. PUBLIC REVIEW AND ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS. The Secretary must publish a notice of proposed wildfire prevention projects in the Federal Register for public comment. Comments must be submitted within 30 days, and a final decision on the project must be made within 60 days after considering the feedback received. After publishing a notice for public comment on a proposed wildfire prevention project, the Secretary will designate the final project and publish a notice in the Federal Register. Only those who submitted comments on the proposed project can provide specific written feedback on the final designated project within 30 days of the notice publication. The Secretary will designate the final wildfire prevention project after public comment. Specific written feedback on the final project must be submitted within 30 days of the notice publication. The Secretary must comply with environmental laws and conduct interagency consultations for authorized projects. The Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and other laws must be followed for authorized wildfire prevention projects. Interagency cooperation is required for projects under the Endangered Species Act. Special rules apply to projects involving timber harvesting or grazing. Special rules apply to authorized wildfire prevention projects involving timber harvesting or grazing, requiring the Secretary to prepare an environmental assessment within 30 days of notice publication. Failure to meet the deadline deems the project compliant with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The authorized wildfire prevention project will be considered compliant with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 if the Secretary fails to meet the deadline for preparing an environmental assessment. For livestock grazing projects, the assessment is valid for a minimum of 10 years, and for timber harvest projects, it is valid for a minimum of 20 years. No requirement for alternatives is imposed by this section. Compliance with this section deems the environmental assessment valid for a minimum of 10 years for livestock grazing projects and 20 years for timber harvest projects. No requirement for alternatives is imposed. Compliance with this section satisfies various environmental regulations, including the National Environmental Policy Act, National Forest Management Act, Endangered Species Act, and Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW. Administrative review of authorized wildfire prevention projects follows the special process under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. Judicial review is conducted in accordance with the same Act. SEC. 7. THREATENED AND ENDANGERED SPECIES DESIGNATIONS. Before listing a species under the Endangered Species Act, the Secretary must research the impact on forest fuel loads. Recovery plans and habitat determinations must include wildfire risk assessment analysis."
