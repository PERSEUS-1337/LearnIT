FINDINGS.\" Congress finds the need to increase the number of high school graduates prepared for STEM education and emphasizes the importance of hands-on laboratory experience in science programs. The National Research Council emphasized the importance of laboratory experience in science programs, noting that the current quality of labs is poor for most students and there is a lack of consensus on how to define high school science laboratories. Schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities face challenges in providing quality lab experiences. The National Research Council found that schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students are less likely to have adequate laboratory facilities. The Government Accountability Office reported that schools with a majority minority student population often do not meet functional requirements for laboratory science. The National Research Council found that schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students are less likely to have adequate laboratory facilities. 40 percent of college students who left the science fields reported problems related to high school science preparation, including lack of laboratory experience and no introduction to theoretical or analytical modes of thought. It is in the national interest for the Federal Government to invest in research and demonstration projects to improve the teaching of laboratory science in high schools. The grant program aims to improve the teaching of laboratory science in high schools through research and demonstration projects. Section 8(8) of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to redesignate subparagraphs and insert a pilot program initiative for improving laboratory science teaching in high schools. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 is amended to include a pilot program called 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' to enhance laboratory facilities in high schools. The 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' program awards grants to partnerships to improve laboratories and provide instrumentation for enhancing math, science, engineering, and technology instruction at the secondary school level. Grants can be used for purchasing equipment and educational materials. The 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' program awards grants for the purchase, rental, or leasing of equipment, maintenance and improvement of laboratory facilities, professional development for teachers, and development of instructional programs integrating laboratory experience with classroom learning. The 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' program provides grants for equipment, maintenance, professional development, and hands-on laboratory experiences for teachers and school personnel. The 'Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science' program offers training in laboratory safety for school personnel and hands-on laboratory experiences to encourage interest in mathematics, science, engineering, and technology for individuals identified in the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act. The Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science program provides training in laboratory safety and hands-on experiences in STEM fields to individuals identified in the Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act, aiming to prepare them for postsecondary studies. Grants are awarded to partnerships for assessment of funded activities. The Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science program awards grants to partnerships that include higher education institutions, high-need local educational agencies, businesses, and nonprofit organizations for STEM training and hands-on experiences. The Partnerships for Access to Laboratory Science program awards grants to partnerships that include higher education institutions, high-need local educational agencies, businesses, and nonprofit organizations for STEM training and hands-on experiences. The program allows for a Federal share of up to 50 percent of the cost of activities carried out using grant funds. SEC. 3. REPORT. The Director of the National Science Foundation will evaluate pilot projects funded by the grant program to improve student performance in math, science, engineering, and technology. A report on the evaluation results will be submitted to specific Senate and House committees within 5 years of the Act's enactment, identifying best practices. The National Science Foundation will evaluate pilot projects funded by the grant program to improve student performance in math, science, engineering, and technology. A report on the evaluation results will be submitted to specific Senate and House committees within 5 years of the Act's enactment, identifying best practices and materials developed by grant awardees. Authorization of appropriations for the National Science Foundation under the Act and its amendments include $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for the following 3 years."
