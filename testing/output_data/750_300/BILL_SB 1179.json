    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 9002 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to define key terms related to public cemetery districts, such as \"active militia,\" \"armed services,\" \"board of trustees,\" and \"district.\" These definitions are in accordance with existing codes and statutes. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to public cemetery districts, including \"armed services,\" \"board of trustees,\" \"district,\" and \"domestic partner.\" These definitions align with existing codes and statutes. The curr_chunk defines \"domestic partner\" as adults in a committed relationship registered with the Secretary of State, and \"family member\" as various relatives. It also defines \"firefighter\" as per Section 1797.182. An interment right within a cemetery allows the owner to control the interment of human remains and the placement of memorial markers. It is a transferable property interest governed by specific regulations. An interment right allows control over human remains and memorial markers in compliance with cemetery regulations. Nonresident and peace officer definitions are provided, along with the concept of a principal county based on assessed property value. Chapter 5.5 (9069.10) of the Health and Safety Code outlines interment rights, specifying that disinterment of human remains requires consent from the cemetery district and specific family members in order of priority. Interment rights (9069.10) do not include the right for disinterment of human remains without consent from the cemetery district and specific family members. Chapter 5.5 also allows for the removal of remains within the same cemetery under certain circumstances (9069.15). The cemetery district must maintain a duplicate copy of an order for removal of remains, and keep a record including the date, name, age, cemetery, and plot of the removed remains. The cemetery district must keep a record of the date, name, age, cemetery, and plot of the removed remains. Additionally, information on reinterment or alternate disposition of the remains must be documented. The person making the removal of remains must provide a record of the alternate disposition if not reinterred, or the date of reinterment if reinterred at the cemetery. This record must be delivered to the cemetery district. An interment right grants a transferable property interest to the listed owner in the cemetery district records, with exceptions for written designations. The person removing remains must provide a complete record to the cemetery district. The owner of an interment right can designate others for interment in the plot and must designate a successor owner at the time of purchase. The use of a transferred interment right must comply with state and local laws and district policies. If the owner of an interment right dies without a valid disposition, the right passes according to intestate succession laws. If there are no heirs, the district follows abandonment procedures. When a public cemetery district transfers ownership rights based on an affidavit, they are not liable for any claims unless they had actual knowledge of false information provided. A successor owner of an interment right must sign an affidavit confirming their entitlement, efforts to find other claimants, and lack of opposition. Upon the sale of a plot in a cemetery, the district must notify the purchaser of interment rights and the rules governing succession of ownership. The successor owner must sign an affidavit confirming their entitlement and efforts to find other claimants. This act creates new crimes or infractions, eliminates existing ones, or changes penalties, without requiring reimbursement for costs incurred by local agencies or school districts. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by the state, as outlined in the Government Code."
