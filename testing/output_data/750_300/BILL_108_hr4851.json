Reduction of FICA rates through Personal Social Security Savings Program. Employee Contribution: The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to reduce the tax rate on employees for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance in years following a reduction year where the OASDI rate ratio exceeds 125 percent. The reduction year is defined as any year after the transition year where the OASDI rate ratio exceeds 125 percent. The reduction percentage is the excess of the OASDI rate ratio. The reduction percentage is calculated as the difference between the rate in effect for the reduction year and the rate that would result in an OASDI rate ratio of 125 percent. The reduction percentage for the year would have been 125 percent if the rate under subsection (a) and section 3111(a) had been applicable, and the rate under section 1401(a) were twice that rate. The OASDI rate ratio is the ratio of the combined balance in the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund for any calendar year. The OASDI rate ratio is the ratio of the combined balance in the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund to the amount paid from such Trust Funds during the calendar year for authorized purposes under the Social Security Act. The text chunk discusses limitations on reduction for employer contributions under the Social Security Act, ensuring that the tax rate imposed is not less than 4.95 percent. The text chunk addresses limitations on reducing employer contributions under the Social Security Act to prevent the tax rate from falling below 4.95 percent. It also introduces a new subsection for reducing the tax rate in subsequent years following a reduction year. The tax rate imposed under subsection (a) is reduced by the reduction percentage in years following a reduction year, as defined in section 3101(d). However, the rate cannot fall below 4.95 percent. In years following a reduction year, the tax rate under subsection (a) is reduced by the reduction percentage, but cannot go below 4.95 percent. In years following a reduction year, the tax rate under subsection (a) is reduced by the reduction percentage as defined in section 3101(d), with a limitation that it cannot go below 4.95 percent. The reduction percentage defined in section 3101(d) limits any reduction that would lower the tax rate under subsection (a) to less than 9.9 percent."
