    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 21107.8 of the Vehicle Code in California allows cities or counties to declare privately owned offstreet parking facilities open for public use, subject to certain regulations. If a city or county enacts an ordinance or resolution authorized by Section 21107.8 of the Vehicle Code in California, they may allow the operator of a privately owned offstreet parking facility to regulate unauthorized parking. The owner or operator of the facility must include instructions on contesting parking fee invoices if unauthorized parking is regulated. If a city or county authorizes the regulation of unauthorized parking in a privately owned offstreet parking facility, the owner or operator cannot submit parking fee invoices to the Department of Motor Vehicles to collect unpaid fees by withholding licenses or vehicle registrations. An ordinance or resolution does not apply to offstreet parking facilities unless a notice is posted at each entrance warning of public moving vehicle laws and potential parking invoice fees for violators. Parking receipts must also include language about potential parking invoice fees for violators. Section 22507.8 may be enforced without the need for an ordinance or resolution, as long as a parking receipt includes language about potential parking invoice fees for violators. A public hearing and written notice to the owner and operator of the offstreet parking facility are required before enacting any ordinance or resolution related to parking violations.

Cities or counties authorizing private parking regulation must include specific provisions in their ordinance or resolution.
