    "content": "In 1976, President Gerald Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) into law, authorizing the EPA to regulate toxic chemicals in U.S. commerce to prevent harm to human health or the environment. The EPA evaluates risks throughout the chemical life-cycle and has various regulatory options to address them. Congress has added five titles to TSCA and made amendments since its inception. Since its inception in 1976, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) has been amended and expanded by Congress to address specific chemical concerns. Various bills have been introduced since 2005 to revise the chemical evaluation process, but none have been enacted due to ongoing legislative debate. EPA has the authority to regulate the life-cycle of chemicals, from production to disposal, to address risks to human health and the environment. Since 2005, bills have been introduced to revise the chemical evaluation process under TSCA, but none have been enacted due to ongoing legislative debate. More chemicals have entered the U.S. market since TSCA's enactment in 1976, leading to increased studies on chemical risks and evolving scientific understanding. The current regulatory framework for chemicals in the U.S. is seen as insufficiently protective of the public and the environment. EPA's evaluation of risks is limited by available resources, leading to potential differences in chemical regulations among states. Manufacturers and processors argue that complying with different state regulations for the same chemical is inefficient due to interstate commerce. Proponents of state regulations believe states should be allowed to lead in trying alternative approaches to protect their citizens. This report tracks the legislative status in the 114th Congress of bills that would amend Title I of TSCA and discusses selected issues related to chemicals' movement through interstate commerce and state regulations. Non-governmental programs for labeling products as \"sustainable\" or \"non-toxic\" have also emerged as an alternative approach to regulation. In the 114th Congress, bills were introduced to amend Title I of TSCA, including the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (S. 697) referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. In the 114th Congress, bills were introduced to amend Title I of TSCA. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (S. 697) and the Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act (S. 725) were introduced and referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Senate EPW held a hearing on S. 697 and marked up an amendment for Senate floor consideration. Senate EPW filed the report for S. 697 on June 18, 2015. On April 28, 2015, Senate EPW marked up an amendment for S. 697, which was reported out of the committee for Senate floor consideration. On June 18, 2015, the report (S.Rept. 114-67) for S. 697 was filed. The House Committee on Energy and Commerce announced a discussion draft called the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015 on April 7, 2015. A hearing regarding the discussion draft was held on April 14, 2015. The House introduced the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, which was forwarded for full committee consideration after a subcommittee hearing and vote. H.R. 2576, based on the House discussion draft, was also introduced on May 26, 2015. The TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, H.R. 2576, was approved by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and passed by the House on a 398-1 vote. Key issues debated include the federal role in regulating chemical substances under Title I of TSCA. The House passed H.R. 2576, H.Rept. 114-176, on June 23, 2015, with a 398-1 vote. Key debated topics include prioritizing existing chemical substances for risk evaluation, EPA's regulatory threshold criteria, options for restricting chemicals, requiring new information development, and preemption of state laws on regulation. The report compares approaches among S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 in amending Title I of TSCA to address key issues such as restricting chemical substances, requiring new information development, preemption of state laws, and EPA resources for administration. The evaluation of risks for numerous chemicals in the marketplace is constrained by limited resources. The report compares approaches among S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 in amending Title I of TSCA to address key issues related to evaluating risks for chemicals in the marketplace. EPA has discretion in selecting which chemicals to evaluate under the current TSCA. The EPA has discretion in selecting which chemical substances to evaluate for risks, including those on the initial inventory reported under TSCA and those reported in premanufacture notices. Over 83,000 chemical substances are potentially subject to evaluation, with more than 1,200 identified in 2012 for further screening under EPA's TSCA Work Plan. In 2012, EPA identified over 1,200 substances for evaluation based on prioritization criteria. 90 substances were prioritized for risk evaluation, with 5 assessed and 3 found to present risks. Manufacturers must submit a PMN to EPA 90 days before manufacturing new chemicals under TSCA Section 5. EPA has assessed five out of 90 prioritized chemical substances, with three found to present risks. Under TSCA Section 5, manufacturers must submit a PMN to EPA 90 days before manufacturing new chemicals. EPA has received over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 PMN exemption applications from July 1979 to September 2010. S. 697 and S. 725 would direct EPA to prioritize existing chemicals. EPA has received over 36,000 PMNs and 13,000 PMN exemption applications from July 1979 to September 2010. S. 697 and S. 725 would direct EPA to prioritize existing chemical substances for evaluation of risks, while H.R. 2576 would evaluate chemicals based on specific criteria. EPA would have discretion to evaluate chemicals with potential unreasonable risks under intended conditions of use. S. 697 and S. 725 differ in factors and criteria. H.R. 2576, S. 697, and S. 725 propose different approaches for evaluating chemicals with potential risks. H.R. 2576 gives EPA discretion to assess chemicals based on identified hazards and exposures. S. 697 and S. 725 prioritize substances based on various factors and criteria, dividing them into active and inactive substances for evaluations and regulatory actions. The bills prioritize substances for evaluations based on various factors and allow manufacturers to request EPA to prioritize certain substances for evaluation upon payment of a fee. EPA would have discretion to grant only a limited number of requests under S. 697. S. 697 and H.R. 2576 propose a process for manufacturers to request EPA to prioritize substances for evaluation by paying a fee. EPA would have discretion to grant limited requests under S. 697, while H.R. 2576 requires evaluation for substances where costs are paid. S. 697 and S. 725 establish varying deadlines for evaluating substances and taking regulatory actions. EPA would prioritize substances based on factors and manufacturers' requests. S. 697 and S. 725 propose a prioritization process for evaluating chemical substances. EPA would designate at least 25 chemicals as high priority and begin safety assessments within five years. Safety assessments and determinations must be completed within three years after a chemical's designation. The EPA would be required to designate at least 25 chemicals as high priority and begin safety assessments within five years after enactment. Safety assessments must be completed within three years after designation, with a rule promulgated within two years after a negative safety determination. The procedures proposed by S. 725 are generally comparable to those under S. 697, with tighter deadlines and differing conditions. H.R. 2576 requires risk evaluations to be published within three years of a manufacturer's request or EPA finding of potential risk. EPA must initiate at least 10 risk evaluations per year, with no limit on manufacturer requests as long as they are paid for. H.R. 2576 mandates EPA to conduct a minimum of 10 risk evaluations annually, excluding manufacturer-requested evaluations, contingent on funding availability. S. 697 and S. 725 propose changes to TSCA Section 5 for reviewing new chemical substances and uses, while H.R. 2576 maintains the current process for EPA to assess risks of new chemicals. H.R. 2576 maintains the current process for EPA to evaluate risks of new chemicals. The Senate bills would require EPA to make a determination on regulatory action for new chemicals within 90 days of receiving a PMN. The Senate bills would require EPA to conduct an initial review and make a determination within 90 days of receiving a PMN for new chemicals. Once a new chemical is added to the TSCA Inventory, it would be subject to the same safety assessment procedures as existing chemicals. The current TSCA establishes a standard for regulating chemical substances based on the unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. This criterion is used for new and existing chemicals under Sections 5 and 6 of TSCA. Some argue that the regulatory threshold for restricting chemicals under TSCA is difficult for EPA to prove and open to interpretation. There is a recurring debate on amending the threshold to clarify criteria for determining regulatory control. The \"unreasonable risk\" standard in current TSCA is not clearly defined in statute. The \"unreasonable risk\" standard in current TSCA is open to interpretation and lacks a clear definition in statute. The Fifth Circuit's interpretation in Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA emphasized a multi-factor balancing test for evaluating risks under TSCA. The Fifth Circuit in Fittings v. EPA interpreted TSCA's \"unreasonable risk\" standard, emphasizing the need to consider costs and balance environmental, economic, and social impacts in regulatory actions. The court criticized EPA for overlooking costs in its asbestos ban. The Fifth Circuit ruled that EPA's asbestos ban did not consider costs adequately under the \"unreasonable risk\" standard in TSCA, questioning the $200-$300 million cost to save seven lives over thirteen years. The court emphasized the need to balance costs and benefits in regulatory actions. S. 697 would establish a statutory definition for the term \"safety standard\" that uses the regulatory threshold of \"unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment\" in current TSCA and adds qualifiers related to the conditions of use of a chemical substance. S. 697 would establish a regulatory threshold based on the \"conditions of use\" of a chemical substance to determine if it poses an unreasonable risk to health or the environment. It would also include \"potentially exposed or susceptible populations\" in risk evaluations and prohibit the consideration of \"cost and other nonrisk factors.\" S. 697 and S. 725 aim to establish safety standards for evaluating chemical risks, with a focus on prohibiting the consideration of cost and other non-risk factors. S. 725 specifically emphasizes ensuring no harm to human health or the environment without taking cost into account. H.R. 2576 does not define a \"safety standard\" but retains the regulatory threshold based on \"unreasonable risk\" in current TSCA. It adds requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process to determine risks, including assessing risks to potentially exposed populations. H.R. 2576 retains the regulatory threshold based on \"unreasonable risk\" in current TSCA but adds requirements for EPA's risk evaluation process, including assessing risks to potentially exposed populations and prohibiting consideration of costs or non-risk factors in decision-making. H.R. 2576 prohibits EPA from considering costs or non-risk factors when addressing unreasonable risks under TSCA Section 6(a). EPA must promulgate requirements to protect against risks using the least burdensome approach while considering certain factors. Section 6 of TSCA directs EPA to promulgate requirements to protect against unreasonable risks from substances, considering factors like costs and alternatives, ranging from bans to notifications. The EPA has the authority to impose varying levels of regulations, from bans to notifications, to protect against unreasonable risks from substances. In some cases, the requirement for the EPA to choose the least burdensome regulatory option has been challenged, as seen in the case of Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA where the Fifth Circuit questioned the total ban on asbestos without substantial evidence that it was the least burdensome alternative. This additional standard of the \"least burdensome\" requirement goes beyond the usual cost-benefit analysis that the EPA conducts. In practice, the \"least burdensome\" requirement imposes an additional standard on EPA beyond the cost-benefit analysis for chosen alternatives. The Fifth Circuit required EPA to show that each less burdensome requirement would not adequately protect against unreasonable risk. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 aim to eliminate the least burdensome regulatory option requirement. The Fifth Circuit required EPA to demonstrate that less burdensome requirements would not sufficiently protect against unreasonable risk. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 seek to remove the least burdensome regulatory option mandate. S. 697 and S. 725 would have EPA choose a necessary regulatory option for safety standards, considering costs and alternatives. H.R. 2576 would mandate EPA to create a rule that adequately protects against risks, including those to potentially exposed subpopulations. The bills S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 aim to change EPA regulations regarding chemical substances. H.R. 2576 would require EPA to create rules that protect against risks, including those to potentially exposed subpopulations, and consider cost-effectiveness. EPA would be authorized to exempt certain chemical substance uses under these bills. The bills S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 aim to change EPA regulations regarding chemical substances. They require rules to be cost-effective, with provisions for EPA to exempt certain uses if compliance is not feasible due to national security, economic disruption, or lack of safer alternatives. EPA can grant \"critical use exemptions\" under H.R. 2576. H.R. 2576 authorizes EPA to grant \"critical use exemptions\" for specific uses of a chemical substance if compliance is not cost-effective and if the use is critical or essential, or if it would disrupt the national economy, security, or infrastructure. EPA can only grant exemptions to reduce risk to the greatest extent feasible. EPA can grant critical use exemptions under H.R. 2576 for specific uses of a chemical if compliance is not cost-effective and if it would disrupt the national economy, security, or infrastructure. Exemptions are initially valid for five years and can be renewed if requirements are met. EPA relies on scientific information to evaluate risks and determine if they are unreasonable. EPA is authorized to require reporting and record keeping under Section 8 of TSCA. EPA can grant critical use exemptions under H.R. 2576 for specific uses of a chemical if compliance is not cost-effective and would disrupt the national economy, security, or infrastructure. To evaluate risks, EPA relies on scientific and technical information on chemical substances. Section 8 of TSCA authorizes EPA to require reporting and record keeping of existing information on chemicals. If risks are insufficiently known, Section 4 of TSCA mandates EPA to require manufacturers and processors to conduct testing to develop new information about the risks. Section 4 of TSCA mandates EPA to require testing for chemicals if they may pose risks or are produced in ways that could lead to environmental exposure or human health risks. EPA has mandated testing for over 200 chemical substances. The EPA has required additional testing for over 200 chemical substances to assess risks, but limits on its authority under TSCA have hindered its ability to gather necessary information on health and environmental effects of chemicals. EPA argues that finding a chemical substance may present an unreasonable risk is essential to require new information for risk assessment. The EPA argues that finding a chemical substance may pose an unreasonable risk, leading to the need for new information for risk assessment. This process can be time-consuming and costly for those involved. EPA's testing requirements under TSCA are based on production volume and exposure likelihood. The EPA may require new information for risk assessment, which can be time-consuming and costly. Senate bills S. 697 and S. 725 give EPA discretion to require testing, while H.R. 2576 still mandates certain findings for testing under TSCA. All three bills authorize EPA to require testing if necessary for risk evaluation. H.R. 2576 would require EPA to make specific findings for testing under TSCA, but also allows EPA to require testing if necessary for risk evaluation. The bills authorize EPA to mandate new information through rules, orders, or consent agreements, with a focus on minimizing animal testing. The discussion on TSCA amendments is influenced by various state chemical regulations. The TSCA amendment discussions involve provisions to minimize animal testing and address the long-standing issue of TSCA preemption in relation to state chemical regulations. Congress can preempt state action within a field entirely or permit it to varying degrees under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Congress can preempt state action within a field entirely or permit it to varying degrees under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Current TSCA preemption gives EPA a primary role in managing chemicals but allows states some ability to set their own requirements. States are generally preempted from managing risk from a chemical if EPA has taken similar action, with the option to apply for waivers. Section 18 of TSCA states that states are generally preempted from managing chemical risks if EPA has already taken action on a similar risk. However, states can apply for waivers and have exceptions to preemption for non-duplicative requirements. States can enforce federal requirements that are identical, regulate disposal, adopt chemical requirements from other federal laws, and prohibit chemical use within the state. In the context of TSCA amendments, advocates argue for broader federal preemption to establish a uniform national regulatory framework for chemicals, claiming it can offer adequate protection from chemical risks. They believe that without preemption, varying state regulations could lead to increased compliance costs and reduced economies of scale. Advocates argue for a uniform national regulatory framework for chemicals to provide protection from risks. They believe federal preemption is necessary to avoid conflicting state regulations, which can increase costs and disrupt interstate commerce. Opponents of preemption argue for states to have the flexibility to implement more stringent regulations to protect their citizens. S. 697 proposes changes to TSCA preemption. S. 697 proposes changes to TSCA preemption, allowing states to implement more stringent regulations to protect their citizens. The bill would modify EPA actions triggering preemption, scope of state laws preempted, and waiver provisions. States could act without preemption if EPA had not taken action on a chemical. S. 697 would modify EPA actions triggering preemption of states' chemical-specific requirements, the scope of state laws preempted, and waiver provisions. States would be prohibited from restricting chemicals found safe by EPA or listed as high priority for safety assessment. The bill would prevent states from imposing new restrictions on chemicals deemed safe by the EPA or listed as high priority for safety assessment. Preemption of state restrictions would depend on EPA's safety assessment findings for the chemical substance. The bill would restrict states from imposing new restrictions on chemicals deemed safe by the EPA or listed as high priority for safety assessment. Preemption of state restrictions would be based on EPA's safety assessment findings for the chemical substance. EPA's determination of the chemical substance's safety standard would determine if preemption continues or is lifted until the effective date of the EPA rule restricting the chemical substance. The bill would retain preemption exceptions provided by current TSCA, except for the exception allowing states to prohibit chemical use, which would be removed. States would be prohibited from imposing duplicative or more stringent requirements than federal regulations. The bill would refine TSCA's exception allowing states to enforce federal requirements, prohibiting states from imposing duplicative or more stringent penalties. New exceptions to preemption would be added, allowing states to establish or enforce some requirements under state environmental laws. Certain state actions taken before August 1, 2015, and past or future state actions under state laws in effect as of August 31, 2003, would not be preempted. S. 697 would add savings clauses clarifying that common law or statutory causes of action, private remedies, or evidentiary authorities of courts would not be affected by state actions under environmental laws. States could apply for waivers based on peer-reviewed science, which EPA would have to grant if requirements were met. States could apply for waivers based on concerns about a chemical supported by peer-reviewed science under S. 725, which would allow them to impose different regulations for chemicals without TSCA's preemption provisions. EPA would be required to grant waivers meeting statutory requirements, with automatic approval if no decision is made within 90 days or if deadlines are missed for safety determinations. S. 725 would eliminate TSCA's preemption provisions, allowing states to enforce different regulations for chemicals. H.R. 2576 would make smaller changes to preemption, allowing states to impose requirements if EPA has not taken action on a chemical. H.R. 2576 would maintain TSCA's preemption of state requirements for chemicals based on EPA risk management actions, with some adjustments to align preemption with the risk evaluation process under amended Section 6. State prohibitions on the use of chemicals would also be allowed. H.R. 2576 aligns preemption of state requirements for chemicals with EPA risk management actions, allowing state enforcement of identical requirements with penalties. H.R. 2576 aligns state requirements for chemicals with EPA regulations, allowing states to enforce identical requirements with penalties. TSCA mandates chemical companies to provide EPA with information on their chemicals, including structures, production volumes, and health effects. TSCA requires chemical manufacturers, processors, and distributors to submit information to EPA regarding their chemicals, including detailed structures, production volumes, and health data. Balancing public access to chemical information with protection of trade secrets is a key concern in amending TSCA. Section 14 prohibits disclosure of information exempt from FOIA as trade secrets. Section 14 of TSCA prohibits disclosure of information exempt from FOIA as trade secrets and commercial or financial information. Wrongful disclosure is a criminal act under TSCA, with CBI protection not applying to health and safety studies. EPA employees or contractors disclosing information is a criminal act. TSCA protects confidential business information (CBI) but allows disclosure if necessary to protect health or the environment. Chemical identities and other information have been protected as CBI by EPA. TSCA Section 14 allows disclosure of CBI if necessary to protect health or the environment. EPA must notify the submitter before disclosing CBI if it does not meet protection standards. Designating information as CBI is sufficient for protection. The EPA allows for the protection of confidential business information (CBI) by simply designating it as such, without the need for substantiation or EPA review. CBI protection is indefinite unless EPA determines otherwise. EPA has increased its scrutiny of confidentiality claims since 2010, especially regarding chemical identities in health and safety studies. Since 2010, EPA has increased review of confidentiality claims, especially regarding chemical identities in health and safety studies. The agency has initiated a \"CBI Declassification Challenge\" to encourage industry to voluntarily withdraw CBI claims and enhance public access to non-confidential information. The three proposed bills aim to maintain TSCA's framework for protecting information under the FOIA trade secrets exemption but would also allow EPA to disclose CBI in more situations, including in response to requests from state, local, or tribal entities. The three proposed bills aim to maintain TSCA's framework for protecting information under the FOIA trade secrets exemption but would also allow EPA to disclose CBI in more situations, including in response to requests from state, local, or tribal officials for enforcement purposes, certain federal or state professionals in response to an environmental release, or health care professionals for patient diagnoses or treatments. The Senate bills would make more extensive revisions and additions to Section 14 of TSCA than H.R. 2576, with detailed procedural requirements for information submitters and more review requirements for EPA. The Senate bills propose extensive revisions to Section 14 of TSCA, with detailed procedural requirements for information submitters and more review requirements for EPA. Certain categories of information would be presumed protected from disclosure, including specific chemical identity, while information on chemicals subject to a ban or phase-out rule would not be protected. In comparison, H.R. 2576 focuses on protecting the confidentiality of chemicals. The Senate bills propose revisions to Section 14 of TSCA, with procedural requirements for information submitters. H.R. 2576 focuses on protecting the confidentiality of chemicals' identities in health and safety studies, requiring substantiation of confidentiality claims. EPA would notify submitters before confidentiality claim expiration under H.R. 2576. H.R. 2576 limits substantiation requirements for confidentiality claims to those made after enactment and requires EPA to notify submitters before claim expiration. Congress faces the decision of funding EPA's TSCA activities through discretionary appropriations or establishing dedicated supplemental funding sources. Appropriations for Title I under TSCA were authorized through FY1983. Congress must decide whether to fund EPA's TSCA activities through discretionary appropriations or establish dedicated supplemental funding sources. Appropriations for Title I under TSCA were authorized through FY1983, and EPA can also assess fees on chemical manufacturers, importers, or processors. EPA's fee collection authority does not have a sunset date. Section 26(b) of TSCA authorizes EPA to assess fees on chemical manufacturers, importers, or processors without a sunset date. The fees are limited to a maximum of $2,500 for certain actions required under Section 5 of the statute. Small businesses are currently exempt from these fees. Section 26(b) of TSCA allows EPA to assess fees on manufacturers, importers, or processors for new chemical substances and significant new uses. Small businesses have a fee cap of $100. Fees collected are treated as miscellaneous receipts. Under TSCA, fees collected under Section 26(b) are treated as miscellaneous receipts and deposited into the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. The availability of these fees for EPA's use is subject to annual appropriations. S. 697 and S. 725 would repeal the expired authorization of appropriations under TSCA Section 29, while H.R. 2576 would not amend this section. All three bills would revise the authority to collect fees under TSCA Section 26(b). S. 697 and S. 725 would repeal the expired authorization of appropriations under TSCA Section 29, while H.R. 2576 would not amend this section. All three bills would revise the authority to collect fees under TSCA Section 26(b), with S. 697 authorizing the collection of fees for submissions of information to EPA, contingent on minimum discretionary appropriations. S. 697 would direct the agency to set fees at levels to provide a sustainable source of funds, capping the total amount collected at $18 million. EPA would deposit receipts from fees in a dedicated fund for evaluating submissions of information. The bill H.R. 2576 would authorize EPA to collect fees from manufacturers for risk evaluations of chemical substances, without specifying if the cap applies annually or indefinitely. Receipts would be deposited in a fund for evaluating submissions, with no fiscal year limitation. The bill removes the current limit on fees per notice submission. H.R. 2576 authorizes EPA to collect fees from manufacturers for risk evaluations of chemical substances without a specified cap. The bill eliminates the current limit on fees per notice submission and establishes a dedicated fund for fee receipts. EPA would collect fees that are sufficient to cover administrative costs under TSCA. S. 697, S. 725, and H.R. 2576 propose establishing a fund for EPA fee receipts without fiscal year limitation. They aim to collect fees from chemical manufacturers to cover administrative costs under TSCA, eliminating the current fee limit per notice submission. S. 725 does not establish a dedicated account for fee deposits under TSCA. Fees collected would go to the U.S. Treasury's General Fund. Funds would be subject to discretionary appropriations. Congressional Budget Office has cost estimates for S. 697 and H.R. 2576. The Congressional Budget Office has published cost estimates for S. 697 and H.R. 2576, detailing the potential budgetary impacts of the bills. The cost estimate for S. 697 is in S.Rept. 114-67, and for H.R. 2576 in H.Rept. 114-176, subject to discretionary appropriations."
