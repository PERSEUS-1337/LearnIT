Major corporations in lucrative sectors like mining, oil, and gas were allegedly owned by the military or senior officers. The Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (UMEHL) is reportedly owned by the Ministry of Defense and operated by the military. The Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (UMEHL or UMEH) and the Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) are conglomerates owned and operated by the Ministry of Defense in Burma. They own companies in various sectors, including two major banks. These corporate assets provide the military with independent revenue and control over the nation's economy. The Tatmadaw, through UMEHL and MEC, owns banks and corporate assets that give them independent revenue and economic control. The military's control over the economy stems from a history of civil war and the failure of the civilian government to suppress ethnic militias, leading to a military coup in 1962. The Tatmadaw, according to the 2008 Constitution, is tasked with safeguarding Burma's national integrity. The military justifies its role in preserving the country's form for the past 60 years, citing the failure of the civilian government to suppress ethnic militias as the reason for the 1962 military coup. The Union Government has proposed a three-step peace process to negotiate an end to the conflict.

The Union Government is pushing for negotiations within the framework of the 2008 Constitution, while major ethnic groups prefer equal talks without accepting the constitution's legitimacy. The major ethnic groups in Burma do not accept the legitimacy of the 2008 Constitution and prefer equal talks with the Union Government. The future of the constitution is crucial for national reconciliation. Many opposition parties and ethnic organizations did not participate in its drafting. The drafting and adoption of the 2008 Constitution in Burma is politically problematic, as many opposition parties and ethnic organizations did not participate in the process. The Constitution is seen as written by the military to protect its power, with limited public access to the text before a fraudulent national referendum in 2008. The parliamentary elections in 2010 under the Constitution were also considered neither free nor fair. The 2008 Constitution in Burma is widely viewed as fraudulent, with the parliamentary elections in 2010 also considered neither free nor fair.

Many ethnic organizations do not accept the 2008 Constitution and prefer direct negotiations with the Union Government and the Tatmadaw for changes in the national government and adoption of a new constitution. The opposition groups are willing to follow the constitution's amendment process but may find it too difficult to implement in a negotiated agreement. Chapter XII of the 2008 Constitution outlines the process for amending it. The 2008 Constitution outlines the process for amending it, which includes submitting a bill to the Union Parliament, obtaining support from at least 20% of members, and ultimately needing the support of 75% of members for adoption.

Congress may also examine specific issues related to U.S. policy towards Burma, including the Administration's implementation of existing laws. The Obama Administration is evaluating its approach to the Burmese military and ethnic groups. Congress may also consider specific issues related to U.S. policy towards Burma, such as the Administration's intentions with the Special Representative, administration of lists for sanctions, and submission of required reports. The Obama Administration is evaluating its approach to the Burmese military and ethnic groups. Congress may consider issues related to U.S. policy towards Burma, such as the appointment of a Special Representative for Burma as required by the 2008 JADE Act. The 2008 JADE Act requires the appointment of a Special Representative for Burma with the rank of ambassador, who cannot hold another executive branch position. Ambassador Derek J. Mitchell served in this role but stepped down after becoming U.S. Ambassador to Burma in 2012. Ambassador Derek J. Mitchell was confirmed as Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma in 2011, then became U.S. Ambassador to Burma in 2012. W.

Patrick Murphy's temporary appointment as Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma has exceeded the 210-day limit, prompting Congress to inquire about the Obama Administration's nomination intentions. The Obama Administration may be asked about its intentions regarding nominating a Special Representative for Burma. Criticism has been directed at the compilation of lists of Burmese individuals subject to sanctions under existing laws. The Obama Administration faces questions about nominating a Special Representative for Burma and compiling lists of Burmese individuals subject to sanctions under various laws, including the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008.

President Obama has waived some sanctions, but the authority to impose them remains. The current extension of the general import ban in Section 3(a) of the 2003 BFDA ends on July 25, 2013, with the possibility of resumed sanctions if the presidential waiver is removed. The State Department determined a waiver of the import ban was in the national interest. The 113th Congress may decide on extending the import ban given the current waiver. The 113th Congress may consider extending the import ban or altering U.S. policy towards Burma, including imposing sanctions or modifying conditions for sanction determination by the President. The 113th Congress may consider imposing or re-imposing sanctions on Burma, altering conditions for sanction determination by the President, providing guidance on U.S. policy towards Burma, and determining funding levels for assistance programs proposed by the Obama Administration. The 113th Congress will consider funding levels for assistance programs in Burma proposed by the Obama Administration, including aid for landmine victims, English language training, academic exchange programs, democracy, and governance. The USAID mission in Rangoon will be reopened with plans to expand staffing and operations. The Obama Administration plans to reopen the USAID mission in Rangoon for English language training, academic exchange programs, and democracy promotion in Burma. Additional federal funding will be needed, but budget constraints may affect the amount available due to sequestration and other factors. The Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, mandates a 5% reduction in annual funding for FY2013. Sequestration allows the Department of State and USAID to reprogram funds, but uncertainty over country allocations hinders post-sequestration calculations. The Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, mandates a 5% reduction in annual funding for FY2013. Sequestration allows the Department of State and USAID to reprogram funds, but uncertainty over country allocations hinders post-sequestration calculations for Burma. A rough estimate suggests reducing FY2012 estimates by 5% to determine funding levels. Once final FY2013 funding legislation is passed, the Department of State can calculate sequestration at the country level based on program allocations and reprogramming. Burma is expected to undergo significant political and economic changes. The Department of State determines country allocations and calculates sequestration based on program allocations. Burma is expected to undergo significant political and economic changes leading up to its 2015 parliamentary elections. U.S. policy may influence Burma's future choices.
