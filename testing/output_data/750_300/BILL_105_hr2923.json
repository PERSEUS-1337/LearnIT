    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1997\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2. The Act titled \"Early Hearing Loss Detection, Diagnosis, and Intervention Act of 1997\" aims to establish early detection networks for hearing loss in babies born in hospitals or outside, within the first 3 months of life. Universal newborn hearing screening programs should ensure that all babies, whether born in hospitals or outside, are screened for hearing loss before leaving the hospital or within the first 3 months of life. Diagnostic audiologic testing should be done promptly if needed, before the age of 6 months, to allow for timely treatment. Additionally, these screening programs should include a component for linking to diagnosis and early intervention services in the community. Universal newborn hearing screening programs should include a component for linking to diagnosis and early intervention services in the community. Public policy in early hearing detection, diagnosis, and intervention should be based on applied research and consultation with relevant sectors. Statewide early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks are essential for public policy in early hearing detection and intervention. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants to develop statewide networks for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for newborn hearing loss. This includes supporting newborn hearing programs in hospitals and monitoring the extent of hearing detection in birthing hospitals. The grants aim to develop statewide networks for early detection, diagnosis, and intervention for newborn hearing loss. This includes monitoring hearing detection in birthing hospitals and developing models for effective screening and referral to appropriate services. Data collected will be used for research and policy development. SEC. 4. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, DATA MANAGEMENT, AND APPLIED RESEARCH. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide grants for technical assistance to State agencies for infant hearing detection, diagnosis, and treatment. This includes data collection, standardized procedures for quality monitoring, and applied research. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide grants for technical assistance on data collection and management, standardized procedures for quality monitoring of infant hearing loss programs, cost-effectiveness studies, identification of causes and risk factors for congenital hearing loss, and effectiveness of early detection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will provide grants for technical assistance on data collection and management, standardized procedures for quality monitoring of infant hearing loss programs, cost-effectiveness studies, identification of causes and risk factors for congenital hearing loss, and effectiveness of early detection. Additionally, research aims to identify causes of hearing loss, assess early detection programs, and share data with monitoring programs for improved interventions. The National Institutes of Health will conduct research on new screening techniques and technology for hearing loss in children, including clinical trials and intervention efficacy studies. Sharing data with monitoring programs is aimed at identifying unknown causes of hearing loss. SEC. 5. COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION. In carrying out programs under this Act, the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Director of the National Institutes of Health shall collaborate with other Federal agencies, State and local agencies, consumer groups, individuals who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, their families, and qualified professional personnel proficient in deaf or hard-of-hearing. The curr_chunk discusses various stakeholders involved in serving individuals who are deaf and hard-of-hearing, including consumer groups, qualified professionals, health and education professionals, and third-party payers. The focus is on policy development related to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The curr_chunk discusses policy development coordination among key health agencies for early hearing detection, diagnosis, and intervention, involving federal and state levels, private sector, and consumer/professional organizations. The curr_chunk focuses on coordinating the establishment of early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks at the federal and state levels, involving key health agencies and data collection systems. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for statewide early detection, diagnosis, and intervention networks is set at $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $8,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and as needed for fiscal years 2001 through 2003. Additionally, $5,000,000 is authorized for technical assistance, data management, and applied research for fiscal year 1999, $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and as necessary for fiscal years 2001 through 2003. For section 4(a), $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1999, $7,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary funds for fiscal years 2001 through 2003. For section 4(b), $3,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1999, $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, and necessary funds for fiscal years 2001 through 2003."
