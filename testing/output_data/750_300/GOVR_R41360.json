    "content": "One of the most controversial issues in U.S. foreign assistance is the debate over restrictions on funding for abortion and family planning activities abroad. The key questions revolve around whether recipients of U.S. assistance perform abortions or engage in coercive practices with U.S. funds, and whether funding should be withheld from such entities. The impact of withholding funds on population growth, family planning, and reproductive health services in developing countries is also a point of contention among members of Congress. Members of Congress have debated the impact of withholding U.S. funds on population growth, family planning, and reproductive health services in developing countries, in connection with U.S. abortion policy controversies since Roe v. Wade. Legislation prohibiting abortion has been introduced in nearly every Congress. The Constitution protects a woman's right to choose abortion. Congressional opponents have introduced legislation to ban abortion and restrict federal funding for the procedure. The debate has expanded to include U.S. foreign assistance. The debate in Congress over federal funding of abortion has expanded to include U.S. foreign assistance. President Reagan implemented the \"Mexico City policy\" in 1984, which imposed restrictions on foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance. The \"Mexico City policy,\" implemented by President Reagan in 1984, required foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they would not promote abortion. This policy has been rescinded and reinstated by various Administrations, most recently by President Trump in 2017. The debate over federal funding of abortion has extended to U.S. foreign assistance during the 115th Congress. During the 115th Congress, there have been debates on abortion and family planning restrictions in State-Foreign Operations legislation. Some Members have proposed legislation to make the Mexico City policy permanent law. During the 115th Congress, debates have focused on abortion and family planning restrictions in State-Foreign Operations legislation. Some Members have proposed making the Mexico City policy permanent law, which addresses federal funding for abortion and family planning activities in foreign assistance. Congressional interest in this issue is expected to continue into the next session. This report examines legislative and executive branch policies restricting U.S. funding of abortion and family planning abroad. The restrictions are included in foreign aid authorizations and appropriations, affecting various types of foreign assistance. Some provisions are named after the lawmakers who introduced them. Legislation authorizing foreign aid, such as the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, establishes programs abroad that impact different types of foreign assistance. Provisions are named after lawmakers or subjects they address, like the \"Helms amendment\" or \"involuntary sterilization.\" The FAA divides foreign aid into various parts for development assistance. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) is the cornerstone of permanent foreign aid authorization law, divided into parts authorizing different types of foreign assistance. Congress has routinely amended the FAA since 1961 but has not comprehensively reauthorized most programs since 1985. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) has not been comprehensively reauthorized since 1985. Congress has routinely amended the FAA but subsequent authorization bills have often stalled due to debates on controversial issues or foreign policy disputes. Congress annually considers appropriations measures for foreign assistance accounts. In the absence of regular foreign aid authorizations, Congress annually considers appropriations for foreign assistance accounts, influencing aid distribution. Legislation often includes family planning or abortion-related restrictions. The links among requirements and restrictions are complex and not immediately apparent. The complex links among various abortion-related restrictions and requirements in foreign assistance legislation are not always immediately apparent. Some amendments, like the Helms and Biden provisions, may be added to emphasize certain legislation, while others clarify existing restrictions. The Leahy amendment, for example, defines the term \"motivate.\" The Leahy and Livingston amendments clarify and amend existing restrictions in foreign aid legislation. Enacted legislative restrictions on U.S. funding of abortion and requirements for voluntary family planning programs abroad are listed chronologically.

In 1985, Congress enacted a provision to fund family planning projects offering a range of services to counter a Reagan Administration policy. Senator Dennis DeConcini introduced an amendment to reduce reliance on abortion. The Reagan Administration policy, introduced by Senator Dennis DeConcini, restricts U.S. funding to overseas family planning projects that promote only \"natural\" methods like abstinence to reduce reliance on abortion in developing nations.

The United States has not contributed to UNFPA in 16 of the past 34 years due to executive branch determinations. The United States has not funded UNFPA for 16 out of the past 34 years due to concerns about its program in China violating the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The Obama Administration supported funding for UNFPA, emphasizing its commitment to international family planning and women's health. Currently, the United States is not providing funding to UNFPA.

The Secretary of State is required to submit a report on dollar-for-dollar withholding of funds to the committees on appropriations. The Secretary of State must report to the appropriations committees on dollar-for-dollar withholding of funds related to UNFPA's budget for a country program in China. If funds are allocated for such a program, the amount will be deducted from UNFPA's funding for the rest of the fiscal year. In 1986, an amendment was introduced to prevent the U.S. from discriminating against UNFPA. In 1986, Representative Bob Livingston introduced an amendment to prevent discrimination based on religious or conscientious beliefs in awarding grants for natural family planning under the Foreign Assistance Act. The Livingston amendment prohibits discrimination in awarding grants for natural family planning under the Foreign Assistance Act based on religious or conscientious beliefs. It requires that funded family planning projects offer a range of methods and services without discrimination against organizations supporting natural family planning methods. States must fund family planning projects that offer a variety of methods and services without discrimination, including natural family planning organizations that comply with the DeConcini amendment. This provision is included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act and applies to family planning assistance from any account under that act. The Leahy amendment, part of the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, clarifies the Helms amendment regarding funding restrictions on abortions for family planning.

The Tiahrt amendment, enacted in FY1999, directs family planning projects funded by the US to comply with specific requirements. It has been included in foreign operations appropriations every fiscal year since. The Tiahrt amendment directs US-funded family planning projects to comply with specific requirements, including not implementing quotas or numerical targets for births or family planning acceptors. The project funded by the Tiahrt amendment must not set quotas or numerical targets for births or family planning acceptors, and must not offer incentives or rewards for meeting such targets.

The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development must report any violations of the requirements to the Committees on Appropriations. Representative Tiahrt introduced the amendment in response to reports of violations by some governments. In response to reports of violations by some governments, Representative Tiahrt introduced an amendment to ensure that U.S. foreign assistance did not support forced sterilization practices. This was prompted by media and NGO reports of financial incentives being offered to meet sterilization quotas, leading to complications and even death among poor women in rural Peru. USAID issued a report on violations and corrective actions taken. The Tiahrt amendment was introduced to prevent U.S. foreign assistance from supporting forced sterilization practices due to reports of violations in Peru, Guatemala, and the Philippines. USAID issued guidance on implementing the amendment and reported violations, leading to an audit in 2007.

The Mexico City policy restricts U.S. family planning assistance to foreign NGOs involved in voluntary abortion activities. The Mexico City policy restricts U.S. family planning assistance to foreign NGOs engaged in voluntary abortion activities, implemented and reversed through executive branch actions split along party lines. The Trump Administration recently expanded the policy to include all global health assistance. The Mexico City policy, implemented and reversed through executive branch actions split along party lines, has been a controversial issue in U.S. foreign assistance. First issued by President Reagan in 1984, it restricts U.S. funds from being used for abortions as a method of family planning. The Mexico City policy, implemented in 1984 under President Reagan, restricted the use of U.S. funds for abortions as a method of family planning. Foreign NGOs receiving USAID grants could use their own funds for abortion-related activities, as long as they maintained separate accounts for U.S. money to comply with restrictions. The Mexico City policy, implemented in 1984 under President Reagan, restricted the use of U.S. funds for abortions as a method of family planning. Foreign NGOs receiving USAID grants could use their own funds for abortion-related activities, but had to maintain separate accounts for U.S. money to comply with restrictions. President George H. W. Bush and President George W. Bush both maintained and reinstated the policy, respectively. President Clinton rescinded the policy in 1993. The Mexico City policy, implemented in 1984 under President Reagan, restricted the use of U.S. funds for abortions as a method of family planning. President George H. W. Bush and President George W. Bush maintained and reinstated the policy, respectively. President Clinton rescinded the policy in 1993, but President George W. Bush expanded it in 2001 and 2003 to include all assistance for voluntary population planning furnished to foreign NGOs by the State Department, with exceptions for certain cases. President Bush expanded the Mexico City policy to include exceptions for cases of rape, incest, threats to the mother's life, and postabortion care. President Obama revoked this policy in 2009, citing it as hindering efforts for safe family planning programs. President Trump's actions in 2017 are not mentioned. In January 2009, President Obama criticized the broad conditions on grants and assistance awards for family planning programs in foreign nations. In January 2017, President Trump reinstated and expanded the Mexico City policy to include global health assistance, directing the implementation of these requirements across all departments and agencies. The Trump Administration expanded the Mexico City policy to include global health assistance, named \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" (PLGHA), to ensure U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. This policy applies to about $8.8 billion in funding for international health programs. The Trump Administration expanded the Mexico City policy to include global health assistance, named \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" (PLGHA), which applies to about $8.8 billion in funding for international health programs. PLGHA excludes assistance to governments, international organizations, and humanitarian aid. The Trump Administration expanded the Mexico City policy to include global health assistance under \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" (PLGHA), which excludes assistance to governments, international organizations, and humanitarian aid. PLGHA includes exemptions for rape, incest, conditions threatening the mother's life, and postabortion care. In May 2018, the Trump Administration published a review of PLGHA implementation based on U.S. government feedback. The Trump Administration expanded the Mexico City policy to include global health assistance under \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" (PLGHA), which excludes assistance to governments, international organizations, and humanitarian aid. In May 2018, a review of PLGHA implementation acknowledged challenges and identified recipients who refused to agree to the policy terms. The PLGHA policy for global health assistance is still being assessed for its benefits and challenges. Some recipients have refused to agree to the policy terms, and there are challenges in understanding its intent and implementation. The Department plans to conduct a further review by December 15, 2018. The USAID issued Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) on voluntary sterilization (VS) in September 1982 to ensure that funded services protect individuals' needs and rights. PD-3 outlines requirements for voluntary sterilization services. The U.S. government funds services to protect individuals' needs and rights, particularly in the case of voluntary sterilization (VS) procedures. Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) sets requirements for USAID-funded VS services, including the need for informed consent and access to alternative family planning methods. VS services funded by USAID must only be performed with voluntary informed consent at a treatment facility. Other family planning methods should be easily accessible at the same location to provide choice. No incentive payments are allowed to induce acceptance of sterilization, and the fee structure should not create financial incentives for sterilization over other contraceptives. Payments for sterilization services funded by USAID must not be used to incentivize acceptance of the procedure. The fee structure for sterilization and other contraceptives should not create financial incentives for choosing sterilization over other methods. Guidelines on payments to service acceptors, providers, and referral agents are provided in PD-3, with reasonable payments allowed for legitimate extra expenses related to sterilization. Reasonable payments for various individuals involved in voluntary sterilization services are allowed, based on country- and program-specific circumstances. This includes recompense for extra expenses such as transportation, food, medicines, lost wages, anesthesia, personal costs, and pre- and postoperative care. Per-case payments are permitted for service providers and referral agents. PD-3 applies to family planning assistance using USAID funds for voluntary sterilization activities, including U.S. NGOs, foreign NGOs, public international organizations, and governments. Referral agents may receive per-case payment for extra expenses incurred in informing or referring clients."
