    "content": "The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), regulates \"federal election activity,\" including voter registration drives, voter identification, get-out-the-vote drives, and public communications that refer to federal candidates. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) regulates \"federal election activity,\" including public communications that refer to federal candidates. This includes services by state or local party employees and the use of regulated federal funds for such activities. The FEC regulates federal election activity, including public communications to the general public. Candidate and party committees can only use regulated federal funds for such activities. Internet communications were initially exempt from federal campaign finance regulation. In 2002, the FEC exempted Internet communications from federal campaign finance regulation, leading to a lawsuit by Representatives Shays and Meehan against the FEC. They argued that not regulating Internet activities could allow circumvention of federal campaign finance law. The plaintiffs argued that the FEC's failure to regulate Internet activities could lead to circumvention of federal campaign finance laws. In 2004, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia agreed with the BCRA sponsors and overturned the FEC's regulations on political communications on the Internet. The court found that excluding Internet communications from the FEC rule defining \"public communication\" was inconsistent with Congress's intent in the BCRA. The court found that excluding Internet communications from the FEC rule defining \"public communication\" was inconsistent with Congress's intent in the BCRA. The FEC failed to provide legislative history to support this exclusion, leaving it to the FEC to determine what constitutes \"general public political advertising\" on the Internet. The court upheld the definition of \"generic campaign activity\" as a \"public communication\" but found that the FEC's 2002 NPRM did not give adequate notice to the public. The court left it to the FEC to determine what constitutes \"general public political advertising\" on the Internet. The court found that the FEC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) did not provide adequate notice to the public regarding the establishment of a definition. The court also ruled that Internet communications exempted from the definition of \"public communications\" could not be considered \"coordinated communications\" subject to FECA regulation. The court ruled that Internet communications exempted from the definition of \"public communications\" could not be considered \"coordinated communications\" subject to FECA regulation, contrary to prior FEC rules and Congress's intent. The case was remanded to the FEC for further action. The court ruled that Internet communications excluded from \"public communications\" could not be considered \"coordinated communications\" under FECA regulation, contrary to prior FEC rules and Congress's intent. The case was remanded to the FEC for further action in line with the court's decision. In response, the FEC published an NPRM seeking comments on amending the definition of \"public communication\" to include paid Internet advertisements. The FEC published an NPRM seeking comments on amending the definition of \"public communication\" to include paid Internet advertisements and related rules for political committees to properly finance and disclose their Internet communications. The FEC proposed rules to regulate Internet communications by political committees, aiming to ensure proper financing and disclosure without restricting individual citizens' freedom to speak online. After a public hearing and delay for congressional action, the FEC unanimously approved the new regulations in March 2006. In June 2005, a public hearing was held, and the FEC delayed Internet regulations pending congressional action. In March 2006, the FEC unanimously approved new regulations, citing the 2004 Shays v. FEC court decision. The regulations aim to exempt individual blogs from FECA regulation if not done for a fee. The FEC approved regulations in 2006 to exempt individual blogs from FECA regulation if not done for a fee, recognizing the importance of preventing corruption and promoting free speech on the Internet. The FEC proposed regulations to treat paid Internet advertising as a \"public communication\" but otherwise exclude all Internet communications from this definition, citing the importance of promoting free speech and preventing corruption online. The FEC proposed regulations to treat paid Internet advertising as a \"public communication,\" excluding all other Internet communications. The regulations apply when money is exchanged for campaign ads on another person's website, subjecting them to FECA limitations and reporting requirements. Key aspects include regulating paid Internet ads as \"public communications.\" Key aspects of FEC regulations include regulating paid Internet ads as \"public communications\" with no dollar threshold required, subjecting them to contribution limits, source restrictions, and disclosure requirements. Disclaimer requirements mandate statements of attribution on all political committee websites available to the public. The fees for paid Internet ads are subject to FECA contribution limits, source restrictions, and disclosure requirements. Disclaimers are required on political committee websites for public communications, including paid Internet ads advocating for or against federal candidates. Disclaimers are not needed for individual or group emails unless they are political committees sending more than 500 similar emails in a 30-day period. Payments to bloggers from candidates are required to be disclosed only on candidate disclosure statements; no such disclaimers are required on blog sites. Internet advertisements placed on another website for a fee and coordinated with a candidate or party committee are considered \"coordinated communications.\" \"Coordinated communications on blog sites, such as internet advertisements influencing federal elections, are considered in-kind contributions subject to FECA limits and disclosure requirements. Media exemption applies to news stories and editorials distributed through broadcasters and periodicals.\" The general exemption from FECA coverage of news stories, commentaries, and editorials distributed through broadcasters, newspapers, and periodicals also applies to communications distributed over the Internet. Individual or volunteer activity on the Internet, even if uncompensated and not coordinated with a campaign, is excluded from FECA regulation. During Congress's consideration of BCRA in 2001 and 2002, the topic of Internet communications was not addressed. An amendment to exempt Internet communications from FECA regulation was proposed but defeated. Several bills regarding Internet communications were proposed during the 109th Congress. During the 109th Congress, bills were proposed to exempt Internet communications from regulation under FECA. H.R. 1606, the Online Freedom of Speech Act, failed to pass with a 225-182 vote. During the 109th Congress, H.R. 1606, the Online Freedom of Speech Act, failed to pass with a 225-182 vote. The bill was later ordered reported favorably by the House Administration Committee but the vote was postponed pending FEC regulatory action. Additionally, concerns about FECA circumvention led to the introduction of two more bills: H.R. 4194 (Shays-Meehan) aimed to exclude Internet communications from regulation. During the 109th Congress, two bills were introduced in response to concerns about the Online Freedom of Speech Act potentially allowing FECA circumvention. H.R. 4194 (Shays-Meehan) aimed to regulate Internet communications, while H.R. 4900 (Allen-Bass) sought to exempt most individual online communications from FECA regulation. House floor action was influenced by new FEC regulations approved in 2006. During the 110th Congress, H.R. 894 (Price, NC) proposed extending disclaimer requirements to Internet communications, while H.R. 5699 (Hensarling) aimed to exempt certain online communications from FEC regulation. House floor action on these bills was postponed due to new FEC regulations. H.R. 894 (Price, NC) aimed to extend disclaimer requirements to Internet communications, while H.R. 5699 (Hensarling) sought to exempt uncompensated Internet services from FEC regulation. H.R. 5699 aimed to exempt blogs and Internet publications from FEC regulation, as long as they do not derive significant revenue from sources other than Internet activities."
