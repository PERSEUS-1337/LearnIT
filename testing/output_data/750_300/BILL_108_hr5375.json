OIOS audits revealed mismanagement in contracts for inspection services in Iraq. The United Nations contracted inspection services in Iraq were found to be inadequately managed, with staffing levels not met and overcharging of the United Nations. The OIOS audit found that the contractor did not adhere to certain provisions of the contract, including failing to maintain required staffing levels, overcharging the United Nations, engaging in unprofessional conduct, and reporting inaccurate figures for goods. The audit also highlighted the need for the United Nations Office of Iraq Programs to improve contract management and designate a manager in Iraq.
