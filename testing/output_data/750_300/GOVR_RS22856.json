    "content": "Most civilian federal employees are covered by either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). CSRS covers employees hired before 1984, while FERS covers those hired in 1984 or later. CSRS enrollees do not pay Social Security taxes or earn benefits, while FERS enrollees do. Both systems allow contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), but only FERS enrollees receive employer matching contributions. Employees enrolled in FERS receive employer matching contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) and are covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). These governmental plans are not subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which protects spouses and former spouses of participants in private-sector retirement plans. ERISA mandates protections for spouses and former spouses of private-sector retirement plan participants, including requiring a joint and survivor annuity as the default benefit, compliance with qualified domestic relations orders (QDROs) in dividing retirement benefits during divorce, obtaining spousal consent for beneficiary designations in defined contribution plans, and specifying default annuity forms in defined benefit plans. Retirement benefits for federal employees are governed by chapters 83 (CSRS) and 84 (FERS) of Title 5 of the United States Code, similar to ERISA protections for private-sector plans. Spousal consent is required for naming beneficiaries in defined contribution plans, with a joint and survivor annuity as the default form. Title 5 of the United States Code establishes rights for spouses of federal employees similar to ERISA for private-sector plans. Both require written consent for waiving survivor benefits, but differ on pension division in divorce. Under ERISA, a court can require a plan to start paying benefits to a former spouse when the plan participant reaches retirement age, regardless of whether the participant has retired. In contrast, Title 5 prohibits payment of any part of a federal employee's retirement annuity to a former spouse, even if awarded in a divorce decree. Under ERISA, a court can require a plan to start paying benefits to a former spouse at retirement age, regardless of retirement status. In contrast, Title 5 prohibits payment of a federal employee's retirement annuity to a former spouse until the employee has separated from federal service, is eligible for the annuity, and has applied for it. Another difference is in the designation of beneficiaries in defined contribution plans, where ERISA requires spousal consent to name a beneficiary other than the spouse. The difference between ERISA and Title 5 lies in the designation of beneficiaries in defined contribution plans. ERISA requires spousal consent to name a beneficiary other than the spouse, while federal regulations allow participants in the Thrift Savings Plan to name anyone as the beneficiary without spousal consent. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) allows participants in the Thrift Savings Plan to designate anyone as the beneficiary without spousal consent. A state court decree can award a former spouse of a federal employee a share of retirement annuity or survivor annuity, but only benefits specified in the court order will be paid. CSRS is generally exempt from state court proceedings, but Section 8345 of Title 5 allows for certain exceptions. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will pay only the benefits specified in a court order regarding a former spouse's share of a federal employee's CSRS retirement annuity. Section 8345 of Title 5 allows for this division of benefits, with OPM following the court's directions for payment. Only payments made after OPM receives the court order will be divided accordingly. OPM will divide the retired employee's monthly annuity as directed by a court order and pay the specified share to the former spouse. The division of benefits will only occur after OPM receives the court order, and the former spouse's right to receive a share of the annuity ends upon the retired employee's death. A former spouse of a retired federal employee, who has applied for an annuity, may receive a survivor annuity if the retiree elected it or if a court order specifies it. The survivor annuity is 55% of the single-life annuity. A former spouse of a deceased federal employee may receive a CSRS survivor annuity if the employee elected it or if a court order requires it. The survivor annuity is 55% of the retired worker's full annuity before any reductions. The annuity is funded by reducing the retired worker's annual pension by a certain percentage. The survivor annuity for a former spouse of a deceased federal employee is 55% of the worker's full annuity, with the sum of all survivor annuities not exceeding 55% of the single-life annuity. If a former spouse has been awarded the full survivor annuity, the current spouse is not entitled to it unless the former spouse has died or remarried before age 55. If a survivor annuity has been awarded to a former spouse through a court order, the employee's current spouse is not entitled to receive it unless the former spouse has died or remarried before age 55. The annuity paid to a former spouse of a federal employee ends upon their death or remarriage before age 55, except if the marriage lasted at least 30 years. If the remarriage ends in death, divorce, or annulment, the annuity restarts. An employee's survivor annuity to a former spouse can be modified before retirement or death. OPM will not honor a court order for a survivor annuity if the former spouse waived their rights. Before retirement or death, a court order awarding a survivor annuity to a former spouse of an employee may not be honored by OPM if the former spouse waived their right. If an employee opts for a refund of their retirement contributions upon separation from federal service, they forfeit the right to a CSRS annuity. State courts can block refund payments if a former spouse is entitled to a share of the annuity. FERS is generally exempt from state court proceedings, but a FERS retirement annuity can be divided between parties. OPM will divide a retired employee's monthly annuity as directed by a court order and pay the specified share to the former spouse. Only payments made after OPM receives the court order will be divided between the employee and former spouse. Court can block refund payments if former spouse is entitled to a share of the annuity. OPM will divide a retired employee's annuity as per a court order and pay the specified share to the former spouse. The former spouse's right to receive a share of the annuity ends upon the retiree's death. To receive a survivor annuity, the retiree must have elected it or a court order must specify it. A retired federal employee's share of retirement annuity terminates upon death. Former spouse can receive survivor annuity if retiree elected it or court order specifies. FERS allows federal employee to elect survivor annuity for former spouse. An annuity under FERS is 50% of retired worker's single-life annuity. A survivor annuity under FERS is awarded to a former spouse of a federal employee if the employee passes away. It is equal to 50% of the retiree's single-life annuity, funded by reducing the retiree's annuity amount by 10%. The former spouse is entitled to this annuity in return for the reduction. An employee can provide for only one FERS spouse survivor annuity. A survivor annuity under FERS is equal to 50% of the worker's full annuity before any reduction is applied. The total amount of FERS survivor annuities for a spouse and former spouses cannot exceed 50% of the annuitant's single-life annuity. If a former spouse has been awarded the full survivor annuity, the current spouse is not eligible unless the former spouse has died or remarried before age 55. The survivor annuity ends upon the death or remarriage of the spouse or former spouse before age 55. A survivor annuity terminates if the former spouse dies or remarries before age 55. An exception exists for remarriages lasting at least 30 years after January 1, 1995. If the remarriage ends, the annuity restarts. The employee's marriage lasting at least 30 years is an exception for FERS survivor annuity rules. If the remarriage ends in death, divorce, or annulment, the annuity restarts. Court orders for survivor annuities can only be modified before the employee retires or dies. OPM will not honor a court order if the former spouse waived their right to a survivor annuity. If an employee in FERS dies after 18 months but less than 10 years of service, their spouse is entitled to benefits. If a former spouse waived their right to a survivor annuity, OPM will not honor it. If an employee in FERS dies after 18 months but less than 10 years of service, their spouse is eligible for a lump-sum survivor benefit equal to half of the employee's annual basic pay plus a lump-sum payment. This benefit can be paid to a former spouse or divided between a current and former spouse according to a state court order. If the employee dies after 10 years of service, the surviving spouse or former spouse receives a lump sum and additional benefits. A lump-sum survivor benefit may be paid to a former spouse or divided between a current and former spouse, as per a state court order. If an employee dies after 10 years of service, the surviving spouse (or former spouse, per a court order) receives a lump sum and an annuity equal to 50% of the employee's earned annuity at the time of death. Refunding contributions forfeits the right to a FERS annuity, which can be blocked by a state court if a former spouse is entitled to a share of the retirement annuity. An employee can designate a beneficiary. An employee can designate a beneficiary for their TSP account balance by filing Form TSP-3 with the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. The Thrift Board does not recognize wills or other estate planning documents. Spouse consent is not required to designate a beneficiary. The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board does not recognize wills or estate planning documents. Spouse consent is not required to designate a beneficiary for a TSP account. However, a married FERS participant must obtain spousal consent for certain actions involving the TSP account. The TSP requires spousal consent for certain actions like taking a loan, receiving distributions, or withdrawing money. CSRS participants do not need spousal consent, but the spouse will be notified. Married FERS participants need spousal consent for a joint and survivor annuity with 50% survivor benefit. State court orders of divorce, annulment, or legal separation are recognized by the TSP. The TSP requires spousal consent for certain actions like taking a loan, receiving distributions, or withdrawing money. The TSP is authorized to recognize state court orders of divorce, annulment, or legal separation and property settlements. Federal employees enrolled in FERS participate in Social Security, and the former spouse of a worker may be eligible for a Social Security spouse's benefit at the age of 62 if certain conditions are met. Former spouses of federal employees enrolled in FERS may be eligible for Social Security benefits if certain conditions are met, such as being married for at least 10 years. Remarriage may affect the eligibility for benefits, with benefits terminating if the divorced spouse remarries before the age of 60. The divorced spouse of a worker insured by Social Security can receive widow or widower benefits if the couple were married at least 10 years. Survivor benefits terminate if the divorced spouse remarries before the age of 60 unless the later marriage ends, by death, divorce, or annulment. Remarriage does not affect Social Security survivor benefits being paid to the children of a deceased worker."
