The Corps develops, operates, and maintains infrastructure such as navigation channels, harbors, locks, and dams. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages the Inland Waterway System, covering 38 states and handling half of all inland waterway freight. The Corps funds maintenance and construction through appropriations and user fees, covering 100% of studies and operations and maintenance costs. New construction or major rehabilitation costs are shared with the commercial user industry. The Corps and commercial user industry share costs for Inland Waterway System maintenance and construction. Congress is considering future financing options due to insufficient revenue from fuel taxes. The current revenue source for inland waterway system investments is insufficient, leading to federal taxpayers covering more than half of the costs. Changes to the financing system are needed to address the ongoing shortfall and allow for more construction projects. The financing system for inland waterway construction projects needs changes to address the ongoing shortfall. Recent proposals suggest increasing fuel tax and federal share for costs. Commercial use of inland waterways dates back to before the nation's founding. The federal government supports inland waterway development for commerce, dating back before the nation's founding. Funding and support began in the early 1800s to benefit commerce, despite decreased reliance due to improvements in rail and highway transportation. In 1824, the Supreme Court granted the United States authority over interstate commerce, leading to federal funding and support for waterways to benefit commerce. While rail and highway transportation have reduced reliance on inland waterways, they still play a significant role in the nation's transportation network, accounting for 4%-5% of total commercial tonnage shipped annually. Inland waterways account for 4%-5% of total commercial tonnage shipped annually, serving as a vital transportation route for specific commodities like grain, oilseed, coal, petroleum, chemicals, and metals. Inland waterways are a key transport route for specific commodities like grain, oilseed, coal, petroleum, chemicals, and metals. While overall freight tonnage has increased, traffic on inland waterways has remained relatively flat over the last 20 years. Overall, while overall freight tonnage for all modes of domestic shipping has increased at a rate of 1.2% from 1997 to 2007, traffic on inland waterways has remained flat over the last 20 years. The Department of Transportation predicts that overall freight tonnage will double in the next 25 years, with inland waterway traffic growing at a slower rate compared to rail and highway shipping. The system of fuel-taxed inland and intracoastal waterways is illustrated in Figure 1, and inland waterway tonnage relative to other modes of freight transit is shown in Figure 2. The federal government invests in inland waterways due to their value to the nation, with investments dating back to the early 1800s. The majority of tonnage on inland waterways, around 90%, is transported through the Mississippi and Ohio River System via bulk shipping on barges. The federal government has historically invested in inland waterways, particularly in the Mississippi and Ohio River System, due to their value to the nation. Legislation in the 1970s and 1980s introduced user cost-sharing requirements for funding, transforming the financing system for inland waterways. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 transformed inland waterway financing by introducing user cost-sharing requirements and a fuel tax on commercial barges. Prior to these laws, federal government funding covered all investments in inland waterway projects. The acts of 1978 and 1986 introduced a fuel tax on commercial barges and cost-share requirements for inland waterway projects, establishing the Inland Waterways Trust Fund to hold revenues and fund construction. This shifted financial and decision-making responsibility to commercial operators on the inland waterway system. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 established a fuel tax on commercial barge traffic, funding the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. The tax started at $0.04 per gallon in FY1980, increasing to $0.10 per gallon in FY1986, and eventually reaching $0.20 per gallon in 1994. No appropriations were authorized from the IWTF until WRDA 1986. WRDA 1986 authorized additional increases to the fuel tax, reaching $0.20 per gallon in 1994. It also established a cost-sharing process for inland waterway expenditures, with 50% of funds coming from the IWTF and 50% from the Treasury's General Revenue fund. Inland waterway expenditures under WRDA 1986 required a 50/50 funding split for construction projects, with 50% from the IWTF and 50% from the Treasury's General Revenue fund. Operations and maintenance costs remained a 100% federal responsibility. Projects funded by the IWTF must be authorized by Congress and funded through annual appropriations. Additional projects have been authorized by subsequent Water Resources Development Acts. The IWTF projects must be authorized by Congress and funded through annual appropriations. WRDA 1986 authorized the initial projects, with subsequent Acts authorizing more. Congress has made appropriations for these projects in annual bills. Funding for inland waterways is 100% federal, except for construction and major maintenance costs. Since 1986, WRDA retained 100% federal funding for inland waterway costs, excluding construction and major maintenance. The federal dollars spent on O&M exceed construction and rehabilitation costs, often a topic in policy discussions. WRDA 1986 also established the Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB), a federal advisory committee. WRDA 1986 established the Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB), a federal advisory committee representing shipping interests on inland waterways. The board meets regularly to make recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) was established by WRDA 1986 to represent shipping interests on inland waterways. It meets regularly to inform federal decision-making on IWTF projects and make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army and Congress. The IWTF balance varied between 1986 and 2011, with balances increasing from 1992 to 2002. The executive branch proposed fee increases on the user industry and requiring the IWTF to fund some operations and maintenance. The executive branch proposed fee increases on the user industry and requiring the IWTF to fund some operations and maintenance, but these proposals were not enacted by Congress. From FY2005, appropriations from the IWTF increased significantly as investments in IWTF-funded projects grew, surpassing annual fuel tax collections and interest on the IWTF balance. The Bush Administration requested and Congress appropriated greater investments in IWTF-funded projects, leading to significant increases in expenditures that exceeded fuel tax collections and interest on the IWTF balance. Some projects went over their cost estimates, causing balances to drop sharply from 2005 to 2010. Congress implemented \"stopgap\" measures to prevent the balance from falling to unsustainable levels. From 2005 to 2010, Congress implemented measures to reduce stress on the Inland Waterways Trust Fund (IWTF) and prevent the balance from becoming unsustainable. These measures included exempting major rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements, limiting access to the IWTF for projects, providing over $400 million in construction funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, and exempting this funding from IWTF cost-share requirements. These actions helped limit costs to the IWTF for ongoing projects. Congress provided over $400 million in construction funding for inland waterway projects under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, exempting this funding from IWTF cost-share requirements. Recent measures have limited new contracts requiring IWTF funding since FY2009 and restricted appropriations to expected fuel tax revenues, stabilizing the trust fund balance. The IWTF funding has been limited to expected fuel tax revenues since FY2009, stabilizing the trust fund balance. Without changes to financing, funding for new projects will be minimal, with most going to the Olmsted Locks and Dam project on the Ohio River, potentially increasing the project backlog for Corps inland waterways projects. Long-term solutions are discussed in the \"Inland Waterway Financing Proposals\" section. Long-term options and proposals to address the increased project backlog for Corps inland waterways projects are discussed in the \"Inland Waterway Financing Proposals\" section. Concerns have been raised about structural inefficiencies and inequities in the Corps project planning process for inland waterways investments, with complaints from fuel tax payers regarding inefficient project implementation and use of tax. Many complaints about structural inefficiencies and inequities in the Corps project planning process for inland waterways investments have been registered. Reforms were implemented in FY2006 to address concerns, including risk-based cost estimates and prioritized funding for high-risk projects. While improvements were recognized, advocates continue to push for additional structural changes. Several reforms were made to the project delivery process, such as risk-based cost estimates and prioritized funding for high-risk projects. Advocates still call for further structural changes, citing issues with cost overruns and project planning, particularly with the Olmsted Locks and Dam project. The estimated cost for the Olmsted project has increased significantly due to design and method changes. The Olmsted Locks and Dam project exemplifies the need for reform in planning and oversight of the IWTF. The estimated cost has risen from $775 million to $2.9 billion, with completion expected in 2024. The Olmsted Locks and Dam project, with completion expected in 2024, has faced concerns regarding the solvency of the IWTF and equity of the financing system for fuel-taxed inland waterways. Recent proposals by the Bush and Obama Administrations were rejected by Congress, leading to a new recommendation to raise revenues for the IWTF. The user industry, represented by the IWUB, has also taken action. The Obama Administration proposed raising revenues for the IWTF in 2009 and 2010, but Congress rejected the proposals. A new recommendation has been presented to Congress. The user industry, represented by the IWUB, has its own proposal to increase the fuel tax and federal share for inland waterway investments. Past Administrations have also submitted proposals to increase commercial user fees on inland waterways. The Bush Administration proposed a lock usage fee to replace the fuel tax for inland waterways, phasing in charges of $50-$80 per lockage for lock chambers greater than 600 feet in length. The Bush Administration proposed a lock usage fee to replace the fuel tax for inland waterways, phasing in charges of $50-$80 per lockage for lock chambers greater than 600 feet in length. Additionally, the fee would tie IWTF balances to user fees after 2012, adjusting fees based on the balance levels. The Bush Administration proposed raising lockage fees based on IWTF balance levels, with fees increasing below $25 million and decreasing above $75 million. However, Congress rejected this approach, citing concerns about burdening lock users with higher fees. Instead, temporary relief measures were implemented. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees for inland waterways, similar to the Bush Administration's rejected proposal. The fees aimed to increase efficiency by reducing traffic at high-traffic locks. The Obama Administration proposed user fees for inland waterways, similar to the Bush Administration's rejected proposal. The fees aimed to increase efficiency by reducing traffic at high-traffic locks. Congress generally rejected the user fee proposals. The Obama Administration proposed user fees for inland waterways to replace or supplement the fuel tax, but Congress generally rejected the proposals. The FY2013 and FY2014 budgets assumed new revenues from an unspecified user fee, but none of these proposals have been enacted. The 2011 Obama Administration proposed a new inland waterway financing structure with a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers to achieve a revenue target. This proposal included more detail than previous budget proposals. The Obama Administration proposed a new inland waterway financing structure with a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers to achieve a revenue target, including more detail than previous budget proposals. The proposed legislation did not specify the fee amount but set revenue targets to be achieved. The Obama Administration proposed a new inland waterway financing structure with a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers to achieve revenue targets. The proposed legislation did not specify the fee amount but aimed to generate approximately $1 billion in additional revenues for the IWTF over 10 years. The Obama Administration proposed a new inland waterway financing structure with a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers to increase revenue for the IWTF. The proposal included adding 39 new segments to the existing inland waterway system, but faced opposition from the user industry and was not enacted. In 2010, the Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) submitted its own proposal to Congress. The IWUB proposed a new financing structure for inland waterways in 2010, which has been introduced as legislation in Congress. The IWUB report, also known as the preferred alternative of the inland waterway user industry, recommended a new financing system and other proposed changes for inland waterways. The report's primary recommendations have been opposed by the Obama Administration. The IWUB report recommended a new financing system and proposed changes for inland waterways, including increasing user fees and the federal share of inland waterway costs. The Obama Administration opposed these recommendations. Increase overall spending on inland waterways, modify cost-share requirements for inland waterway investments, and involve IWUB in project planning and construction. Other recommendations include adopting prioritization criteria through regulations. The IWUB report recommends increasing the inland waterway fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon, depending on fuel tax collections. This increase is projected to generate approximately $112 million per year in fuel tax revenues for the IWTF. The IWUB report proposes increasing the inland waterway fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon, based on tax collections. This would generate around $112 million annually for the IWTF, allowing for balance replenishment. The new tax level is higher than the previous ten years' average revenue of approximately $85 million per year. The proposed increase would not be adjusted for inflation or include a capital recovery mechanism. The IWUB report suggests increasing the fuel tax by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon to generate $112 million annually for the IWTF. The proposed tax hike would not be indexed for inflation or include a capital recovery mechanism. Additionally, the report recommends shifting more project costs to the federal government and exempting certain dam-related expenses and rehabilitation projects from WRDA. The IWUB report recommends increasing the fuel tax to generate funds for the IWTF and shifting more project costs to the federal government. It also proposes exempting certain dam-related expenses and rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements under WRDA 1986. This would affect the overall cost-share for IWTF projects. The IWUB report proposes shifting more project costs to the federal government, exempting certain dam-related expenses and rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements under WRDA 1986. This would increase the overall federal share for new and major rehabilitation investments over the next 25 years from 50% to approximately 70% for a subset of projects. The report also suggests an overall increase in funding for inland waterways. The IWUB report proposes an increase in funding for inland waterways, with a shift to more federal funding for certain projects, raising the federal share from 50% to around 70%. To fully fund these investments, annual expenditures would need to average $380 million, a significant increase from the historical average of $234 million annually. The IWUB report proposes a significant increase in funding for inland waterways, with federal funding needing to average $380 million annually, up from the historical average of $234 million. To meet the proposal's requirements over the first five years, federal funding would need to be $1.33 billion, with most of the increase coming from the GR fund. The proposed portfolio of $380 million per year would be funded mainly from the GR fund to rebuild the trust fund balance. Federal funding of $1.33 billion over the first five years, 74% of the total, is required for the IWUB proposal. By 2020, the proportion of funds from the trust fund would gradually increase, but federal funding would still exceed 50% of the required investments. More new funding is needed from the federal government (GR fund) than the IWTF. The report recommends increased federal investment in IWTF projects, with more funding needed from the federal government than the IWTF. Reforms proposed include greater involvement of the IWUB in project delivery, expanding their roles and responsibilities. The report recommends increased federal investment in IWTF projects and greater involvement of the IWUB in project delivery, expanding their roles and responsibilities. This includes appointing IWUB representatives to project design teams, obtaining sign-off on project plans, and providing status updates on project planning documents. The IWUB seeks these changes as representatives of nonfederal cost-sharers. The IWUB seeks changes in project planning and funding from the IWTF, prioritizing projects based on asset condition and other factors. Concerns arise over nonfederal entities' involvement in federal agency studies and potential conflicts of interest. The IWUB report prioritized specific projects for funding based on asset condition and other factors, but the final decision on funding allocation would still need to be made by Congress or the Corps. The proposal recommends that the Corps establish selection criteria for inland waterway projects similar to those used in the IWUB report to increase the likelihood of project selection for funding by Congress or the Corps. Some have suggested shifting costs away from the federal government and increasing user-financed share of inland waterway costs. Some advocate for changes in funding for inland waterway projects to decrease federal costs and increase user-financed share. An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office in the 1990s found that the current tax system fails to cover operational costs, leading to inequalities in spending on the system. The Congressional Budget Office found in the early 1990s that the current tax system for the inland waterway system does not cover fixed operational costs, leading to distorted maintenance costs. They suggested implementing a user fee structure to recover true costs and increase economic efficiency, especially for waterways with low traffic-to-expense ratios. Several entities have proposed significant increases to inland waterway fees to address the imbalance between federal costs for maintaining waterways and fuel tax revenues. A coalition of organizations recommended increasing user contributions to achieve savings of $1 billion. A coalition of taxpayer watchdog and environmental NGOs suggested increasing user fees for inland waterways to save $1 billion over five years. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform proposed making inland waterways \"self-funding\" for $500 million in savings over five years. The CBO also recommended raising user fees to cover construction costs in its 2011 budget options report. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform proposed making inland waterways \"self-funding\" to save $500 million over five years. The CBO suggested increasing user fees to cover construction costs, estimating $4 billion in savings over a 10-year period. New user fees could raise additional revenues without specific recommendations on fee structures. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform and the CBO proposed increasing user fees for inland waterways to make them \"self-funding\" and cover construction costs, respectively. Specific recommendations on fee structures were not provided, but options include annual licensing fees, congestion pricing, tolls, and lockage fees. These proposals aim to address ongoing issues with the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. The proposals for increasing user fees for inland waterways include annual licensing fees, congestion pricing, tolls, and lockage fees. These proposals aim to address ongoing issues with the Inland Waterways Trust Fund and raise questions for Congress regarding new investment levels and revenue sources. The 113th Congress made limited changes to inland waterways financing through the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014. Questions for Congress include the level of investment needed, potential changes to fuel taxes, and cost-share arrangements for projects. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-121) made changes to inland waterways financing, including authorizing project delivery recommendations, increasing federal responsibility for rehabilitation costs, reducing cost-sharing for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project, and maintaining the inland waterways fuel tax. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 made changes to inland waterways financing, including reducing cost-sharing for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project and authorizing efforts to provide more information about inland waterways policy options. The House and Senate have made changes to inland waterways financing, including reducing cost-sharing for the Olmsted Project and exploring new funding options. A stakeholder roundtable will evaluate alternatives for the future of inland waterways. The House Appropriations Committee funded the Olmsted Project with a 15% cost-sharing requirement from the IWTF, allowing for increased funding for other construction projects. The House reduced cost-sharing for the Olmsted Project, allowing for more funding for other waterways projects. However, long-term financing for waterway upgrades remains a concern, with some supporting user proposals for the IWTF's solvency. Legislation like H.R. 1149 has been proposed in Congress to address these issues. Enactment of user proposals to address IWTF solvency, including H.R. 1149 (WAVE4 Act) and S. 407 for waterway upgrades. The RIVER Act proposes a $0.09 per gallon increase in the fuel tax, with the federal government responsible for 100% of dam construction and rehabilitation costs under $50 million. This bill addresses issues related to inland waterways proposals for Congress to consider. The RIVER Act proposes a $0.09 per gallon fuel tax increase, with the federal government responsible for dam construction and rehabilitation costs under $50 million. Congress faces issues regarding infrastructure investments on federal waterways, with commercial users advocating for additional investment due to aging infrastructure and the need for expanded capacity. Some shippers and agricultural interests argue for increased investment in inland waterways due to aging infrastructure, capacity expansion needs, and environmental benefits. However, taxpayer and environmental advocacy groups oppose additional federal funding, claiming that the benefits are exaggerated and not worth major funding increases. Advocacy groups oppose increased federal funding for inland waterways, arguing that the shipping industry overstates benefits. Despite disagreements, most agree that current financing is inadequate for future needs. The Corps is expected to have funding for only one lock replacement project through at least FY2016. The Corps of Engineers is facing funding challenges for ongoing lock replacement projects, with only one project funded through at least FY2016. Without new revenue or federal appropriations, future IWTF construction projects may be delayed. Aging locks in the United States are a key reason for the push for increased investment in inland waterways. The aging infrastructure of Corps inland waterway facilities, particularly locks past their intended design age, has led to decreased efficiency. Some advocate for new lock construction and expanded capacity over maintenance, while others oppose significant new investments in inland waterways. Lock unavailability has increased in recent years, leading to a debate between favoring new lock construction and expanded capacity versus ongoing maintenance for inland waterways. Environmental groups argue against new investments, stating that regular maintenance can extend the life of existing locks at a lower cost. They believe that the costs of new lock construction outweigh the benefits of reduced waiting time. Environmental groups argue that regular maintenance can extend the life of existing locks at a lower cost compared to new construction. They believe that the costs of new lock construction outweigh the benefits of reduced waiting time and lock unavailability. The Corps notes that new navigation alternatives depend heavily on unpredictable traffic forecasts from future trade scenarios. The Corps relies on traffic forecasts for new navigation alternatives, which are difficult to predict due to various factors. Total domestic freight traffic is expected to increase by 70% by 2020, but specific projections for inland waterway freight traffic are currently avoided. The Corps has noted that total domestic freight traffic is expected to increase by approximately 70% by 2020. The Department of Transportation projects that the majority of this increase will be on freight rail and highway traffic, with waterway traffic projected to increase 2% per year between 2010 and 2035. Shipping interests suggest that improving the efficiency of inland waterways could reduce pressure on highway and rail shipments. Shipping interests believe that enhancing inland waterway efficiency could alleviate pressure on highway and rail shipments. Future lock upgrades or new construction may boost demand for inland waterways, but the impact would depend on various external factors. Some groups oppose new lock construction, citing flat or declining traffic at certain locks on high-traffic waterway sections. Shipping interests argue for increased investment in inland waterways due to their overall value compared to other shipping modes. Some groups have criticized the Corps' traffic projections as overly optimistic, noting flat or decreasing traffic at certain locks. The Corps has not used projected traffic increases as a basis for investment changes on inland waterways. Shipping interests advocate for increased investment in inland waterways, citing studies that show barge shipping is more efficient and environmentally friendly than rail or highway transportation. For example, railroads are 28.3% less fuel-efficient than inland waterways. Additionally, inland waterways emit significantly fewer greenhouse gases. Inland waterways are considered more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly than rail or highway transportation. Studies show that barge shipping emits fewer greenhouse gases and contributes to reduced highway congestion and noise. However, some groups question the environmental benefits and fuel-efficiency calculations used to justify new investments in barge shipping. Environmental groups have raised concerns about the accuracy of industry fuel-efficiency calculations for barge shipping, pointing out the need to consider technical factors like river flow constraints. They suggest using a conversion factor for circuity to provide a more accurate comparison of fuel efficiency between barge and rail shipping. Environmental groups have raised concerns about the accuracy of industry fuel-efficiency calculations for barge shipping, suggesting using a conversion factor for circuity. They note that inland waterway projects can negatively affect riparian habitat and species through structural changes like locks, dams, and levees, as well as waterway traffic causing bank erosion. Increased construction and expansion of inland waterways, including dams and levees, can have negative environmental effects such as sedimentation, turbidity, and bank erosion. Congress is considering changes to the financing system for these investments, including proposals for additional revenue like an increase in the fuel tax. Congress may consider changes to the financing system for inland waterway investments, including proposals for additional revenue like an increase in the fuel tax or new annual fees. Other options such as a lock usage fee or toll system are also being discussed. The IWUB's proposed fuel tax increase aims to rebuild the trust fund balance and fund new projects. The IWUB proposes an increase in the fuel tax to rebuild the trust fund balance and fund new projects. Some groups argue that the associated increases in federal cost share responsibilities are unacceptable. The user industry's stance on accepting the fuel tax increase without changes to cost-sharing arrangements is unclear. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees in 2011 to address inadequate revenues from commercial users on the inland waterway system. The proposal includes raising fuel taxes and implementing new fees for non-lock users, with lock users facing even higher fees. New waterway segments may also be added to the system. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees in 2011 to address inadequate revenues from commercial users on the inland waterway system. The Administration suggests adding new waterway segments to the list of fuel-taxed waterways and argues that commercial shippers, especially lock users, should bear the costs for new capital investments. The proposal includes fuel tax increases and new fees for non-lock users, with lock users facing even higher fees. The IWUB and Congress have rejected lock usage fees and similar proposals, arguing that they unfairly burden waterway users. Users believe that major fee increases will impact shippers operating within the system. The user industry opposes the proposed new fee as it goes against the idea of the inland waterways as a interconnected system benefiting the nation. The user industry opposes major fee increases that will impact shippers operating within the inland waterways system. They argue against the proposed new fee delegation of fee-setting authority to the Secretary of the Army. Congress has considered alternative revenue-raising methods, such as lock usage fees and other supplements to the fuel tax. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 proposed various fees as alternatives or supplements to the fuel tax, including lock usage fees, annual licensing fees, tolls, ton-mile charges, and lock charges for congested areas. These could potentially be combined with the fuel tax or other proposals. Additionally, a financing concept called \"capital recovery\" was included in the original legislation. The 1978 Inland Waterways Revenue Act proposed various fees as alternatives to the fuel tax, including lock usage fees, annual licensing fees, tolls, and ton-mile charges. A financing concept called \"capital recovery\" was also included in the legislation, where user fees would adjust to recover government capital investments. This concept could help prevent future shortfalls in the trust fund. User fees may increase when the IWTF balance drops below a certain level or be structured as annualized or per-use fees to recover capital costs over time. This concept, seen in the Obama Administration proposal, ties user fees to trust fund balances after FY2022. Some users argue against capital recovery, citing difficulties in planning for constantly changing taxes and the potential for cost increases. Congress could consider additional means to increase the reliability of revenue for inland waterways, such as an automatic inflation adjustment for user fees tied to trust fund balances after FY2022. This adjustment could provide future revenues and increase the real purchasing power of IWTF funds. An automatic inflation adjustment for user fees tied to trust fund balances after FY2022 could increase future revenues and the real purchasing power of IWTF funds. If no long-term solution is enacted to address the revenue shortfall, Congress may need to take measures to ensure the trust fund's solvency. If no long-term solution is implemented to address the IWTF revenue shortfall, Congress may need to take action to ensure the trust fund's solvency. Options could include capping withdrawals at current fuel tax revenues or temporarily halting new contracts. These measures may impact investments in the inland waterway system. Congress might also consider exempting some IWTF investments from cost-sharing requirements, similar to past exemptions provided in appropriations. However, such exemptions would come with additional costs. Congress may need to address the IWTF revenue shortfall by capping withdrawals or halting new contracts. They could also exempt some IWTF investments from cost-sharing requirements, which would have additional costs to taxpayers. The balance of cost-share arrangements for inland waterway projects is a key question before Congress. The IWUB proposal would modify cost-sharing arrangements for inland waterway projects, excluding dams and minor rehabilitation from cost-share requirements. The IWUB proposal seeks to change cost-sharing arrangements for inland waterway projects, shifting funding for dams and minor rehabilitation to 100% federal funding. They argue that dams should be a federal responsibility due to the widespread benefits they provide. Additionally, the proposal sets a new threshold of $100 million for major lock rehabilitation projects. The IWUB proposes a new threshold of $100 million for major lock rehabilitation projects, shifting funding for dams and minor rehabilitation to 100% federal funding. All cost overruns for IWTF construction projects would also become a 100% federal responsibility. The IWUB proposes a new threshold of $100 million for major lock rehabilitation projects, shifting funding for dams and minor rehabilitation to 100% federal funding. Cost overruns for IWTF construction projects would also become a 100% federal responsibility, potentially increasing federal costs for inland waterway projects. The IWUB report proposes shifting the cost-share arrangement for IWTF construction projects from 50/50 to approximately 68% federal, 32% non-federal, which would increase federal costs for inland waterway projects. The IWUB report suggests changing the cost-share for IWTF construction projects to 68% federal, 32% non-federal, increasing federal costs for inland waterway projects. Taxpayer and environmental groups argue that the IWTF already receives significant federal support, with federal expenses potentially rising to over 90% of total costs under the proposal. The federal government's costs for inland waterways could increase to over 90% of total costs under the proposal, compared to the current 80%-85% responsibility. The Obama Administration's proposals suggest changes to user fees but maintain the federal-nonfederal cost-share. New revenues from users would be required, with appropriations from the IWTF needing to be matched with funds from other sources. The proposal recommends changes to user fees for inland waterways, requiring new revenues from users. However, the cost-share structure between federal and nonfederal expenditures would remain at 50/50. Some groups argue for shifting cost shares away from the federal government and increasing user responsibility for construction, operations, and maintenance of waterways. Some groups argue for shifting cost shares away from the federal government and increasing user responsibility for construction, operations, and maintenance of inland waterways. They propose that waterway users should pay for 50% of construction and major rehabilitation costs, as well as some or all operations and maintenance costs. These proposals, previously rejected by Congress, may be reconsidered in the context of government cost-cutting efforts. The IWUB has also requested Congress to provide reforms to Corps IWTF planning processes. The IWUB has proposed reforms to increase its involvement in Corps IWTF planning processes and improve project prioritization. Industry users believe these reforms will reduce cost overruns, which have been a problem in the past. Congress may reconsider proposals to shift cost shares to waterway users in the context of government cost-cutting efforts. The IWUB has proposed reforms to decrease cost overruns in IWTF projects, citing inaccurate construction schedules and costs, general cost escalation, and non-optimal funding as contributing factors. Concerns about conflicts of interest may arise due to the involvement of non-federal entities in decision-making. Congressional attention may also focus on the Corps' prioritization method for inland waterway projects. The IWUB report proposes reforms to address cost overruns in IWTF projects and suggests implementing a priority ranking system for investments competing for IWTF funds. This system aims to reduce conflicts of interest and improve decision-making processes. The IWUB report recommends implementing a priority ranking system for investments competing for IWTF funds, potentially changing the role of Congress in project selection and funding. The IWUB report suggests a priority ranking system for investments competing for IWTF funds, potentially shifting Congress's role in project selection and funding for Corps inland waterway projects. This could lead to a change where Congress provides project authorizations and overall funding levels, aligning with federal project allocation approaches for other agency programs."
