Congress acknowledges that hydraulic fracturing has been a widely used practice in the United States for over 60 years in numerous wells. The Ground Water Protection Council released a report in May 2009 affirming that current state regulations for oil and gas activities are proactive in protecting water resources. The 2009 report \"State Oil and Natural Gas Regulations Designed to Protect Water Resources\" found that all oil and gas producing states have regulations in place to protect water resources. Additionally, a 2004 EPA study on hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane reservoirs found no evidence of drinking water contamination. The 2004 EPA study found no evidence of drinking water wells contaminated by fracture fluid from hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane reservoirs. The 2009 report by the Ground Water Protection Council also found a lack of evidence that hydraulic fracturing in deep and shallow formations poses a risk to groundwater. The 2009 report by the Ground Water Protection Council and a January 2009 resolution by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission both found no evidence of groundwater contamination associated with hydraulic fracturing. States have comprehensive laws and regulations to ensure safe operations and protect drinking water. In 2011, Lisa Jackson testified that there were no proven cases of groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing. Bureau of Land Management Director Bob Abbey also stated that there was no evidence of adverse effects from the chemicals used in the process. The fracking process has not shown evidence of adverse effects from chemicals used, and activities related to hydraulic fracturing are already regulated at the Federal level under various environmental statutes. The Federal government regulates activities related to hydraulic fracturing under environmental statutes such as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Clean Air Act. However, Congress has chosen not to include the hydraulic fracturing process in the underground injection control program of the Safe Drinking Water Act. In 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced plans to introduce new Federal regulations for hydraulic fracturing. In 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced plans for new Federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing. A 2012 study by the Energy Institute at the University of Texas found no evidence of chemicals from hydraulic fracturing fluid in aquifers. The 2014 report by the Ground Water Protection Council and State Oil and Gas Regulatory Exchange concluded that State-based oil and gas regulations have substantially improved groundwater protection laws in response to industry growth. The 2014 report by the Ground Water Protection Council and State Oil and Gas Regulatory Exchange found that states have enhanced groundwater protection laws and regulations for oil and gas production in line with industry growth. In this Act, \"Federal land\" includes public lands, National Forest System land, Bureau of Reclamation land, and Corps of Engineers land. State authority is addressed in the Act. (a) A State has the authority to regulate the treatment of wells using fluids under pressure with propping agents to enhance oil, gas, or geothermal production on land within its boundaries. (b) Federal land is subject to regulations regarding well treatments using fluids under pressure with propping agents. The treatment of wells using fluids under pressure with propping agents to enhance production on Federal land is subject to the law of the State where the land is located."
