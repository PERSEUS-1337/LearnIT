DOD may use up to 1% of US refined petroleum products, with foreign purchases potentially doubling consumption. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) procures fuel for all DOD services and agencies, both in the US and overseas, with origins dating back to World War II. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) procures fuel for all DOD services and agencies, both in the US and overseas. DESC's origins date back to World War II, and it was re-designated the Defense Energy Support Center in 1998 with an expanded mission to manage a comprehensive energy portfolio. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), formerly known as the Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC), was designated in 1964 to manage the DOD's petroleum products and coal. In 1998, it was re-designated with an expanded mission to procure a variety of energy products, primarily focusing on fuel contracts based on the lowest cost to the point of delivery. The Defense Energy Support Center manages DOD's fuel procurement, including bulk petroleum products like JP-8, JP-5, and diesel fuel. This report summarizes DOD's fuel purchases from FY2000 to FY2008, comparing spending to overall DOD spending, prices to commercial equivalents, and quantities to U.S. refined petroleum production. The report summarizes DOD's fuel purchases from FY2000 to FY2008, comparing spending to overall DOD spending, prices to commercial equivalents, and quantities to U.S. refined petroleum production. It also discusses refining and refineries supplying DOD's jet fuel, DESC's fuel procurement practices, and recent legislation affecting fuel procurement. The report discusses recent legislation directing DOD to consider using alternative fuels to meet its needs and stimulate commercial interest in supplying the needs. High fuel prices have stimulated interest in producing alternative fuels from coal and oil shale, but no project has reached commercial operation yet. Legislation ensures federal agencies do not spend taxpayer dollars on new fuel sources exacerbating global warming. Fuel prices have stimulated interest in producing alternative fuels from coal and oil shale, but no project has reached commercial operation yet. Legislation now ensures federal agencies do not spend taxpayer dollars on new fuel sources exacerbating global warming. Proposed rules for greenhouse gas emission reporting may minimally affect refineries, while new legislation to cap greenhouse gas emissions could impact refinery operations and the industry's responsiveness to DOD's fuel requirements. DOD's fuel consumption varies yearly in response to mission changes and operational tempo. Legislation capping greenhouse gas emissions may impact refinery operations and the industry's response to DOD's fuel needs. DOD's fuel consumption fluctuates annually based on mission changes. DESC's bulk fuel purchases mainly consist of JP-8 jet fuel, with the Air Force and Army as primary consumers. Total fuel purchases peaked at 145.1 million barrels in FY2003 during the Iraq invasion. DESC's total fuel purchases peaked at 145.1 million barrels in FY2003 during the Iraq invasion, with JP-8 representing almost 60% of overall purchases in FY2000 and decreasing to 46% by FY2008. Overall DESC fuel expenditures grew from $3.6 billion in FY2000 to nearly $18 billion by FY2008, a 500% increase despite only a 30% increase in volumes purchased. DESC's fuel expenditures increased significantly from $3.6 billion in FY2000 to nearly $18 billion by FY2008, a 500% rise despite only a 30% increase in volumes purchased. DESC's purchases may not align with DOD's actual consumption as fuel may be drawn from storage or war reserves. Fuel costs and prices continued to rise even as DOD's consumption leveled off post-Iraq war. The Department of Defense (DOD) maintains a fuel \"war reserve\" to supplement demand and may replenish fuel stores with purchases. Fuel costs and average prices continued to increase, driven by rising crude oil prices and refining margins. The average cost of petroleum products purchased rose significantly from FY2000 to FY2008. The average cost of petroleum products purchased by the Department of Defense rose from $34.62 per barrel in FY2000 to over $133 per barrel in FY2008, an increase of nearly 370%. Jet and diesel fuel prices also increased during this time period, with the margin between refiners' crude oil cost and refined product prices widening. The Department of Defense responded to increasing fuel prices by purchasing alternate jet fuels and increasing diesel fuel purchases. The margin between refiners' crude oil cost and refined product prices widened from 15\u00a2/gallon in FY2000 to 91\u00a2/gallon by FY2008. The Department of Defense responded to rising fuel prices by buying alternate jet fuels and increasing diesel fuel purchases. Outlays represent cash payments made to fulfill the government's obligations in a fiscal year, with total defense outlays increasing 200% from FY2000 to FY2007. Total defense outlays increased by 200% from FY2000 to FY2007, with Operation and Maintenance spending rising by 231%. Fuel costs surged by 497% during the same period, mainly due to escalating crude oil prices, representing 1.2% of DOD's spending in FY2000 and doubling to 3% by FY2008. The U.S. produces one-third of its crude oil consumption annually, with the rest supplied by other countries. Fuel costs surged by 497% from FY2000 to FY2008 due to escalating crude oil prices, representing 1.2% of DOD's spending in FY2000 and doubling to 3% by FY2008. The U.S. produces one-third of its crude oil consumption annually, with the rest supplied by other countries like Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela, Nigeria, and smaller producers. Refineries previously relied on steady supplies of light sweet crude oil when U.S. production was higher, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) serving as the pricing benchmark for U.S. domestic crudes and oil imports. Refineries used to rely on light sweet crude oil, particularly West Texas Intermediate (WTI), as the pricing benchmark for U.S. domestic crudes and oil imports. However, with the diminishing supply of sweet crudes, refineries have shifted towards heavier sour crudes. Crude oil undergoes a refining process in which products like gasoline, kerosene/jet fuel, and diesel fuel are separated out. Many refineries now process the residuum that remains after this initial refining process. Refineries separate products like kerosene/jet fuel and diesel fuel during the refining process. Residuum from the initial refining process is further processed into gasoline and middle distillate range products using heat, pressure, hydrogen, and catalysts. Specifications for jet fuel, especially military grade, are more stringent than for kerosene. Refineries produce kerosene/jet fuel and diesel fuel, with specifications for jet fuel being more rigorous, especially military grade. Refineries are designed to process specific grades of crude oil, such as light sweet or heavy sour. Light sweet crude is preferred for gasoline refining due to its easier refining process, while heavier and sour crudes require more complex processing. Refineries are set up differently based on the type of crude oil they process. Topping refineries separate crude oil through distillation, producing naphtha but no gasoline. Hydroskimming refineries are more complex, running light sweet crude to produce gasoline. Cracking refineries add processes like vacuum distillation and catalytic cracking to run light sour crude for light product output. Refineries are set up differently based on the type of crude oil they process. Topping refineries separate crude oil through distillation, producing naphtha but no gasoline. Hydroskimming refineries run light sweet crude to produce gasoline. Cracking refineries add vacuum distillation and catalytic cracking to run light sour crude for light and middle distillate production. Coking refineries are high conversion refineries that add coking/resid destruction to run medium/sour crude oil. Atmospheric distillation capacity sets the limit of a refinery's crude oil processing. Catalytic cracking, coking, and other secondary processing units contribute to a refinery's capabilities. The Nelson Complexity Index rates the proportion of secondary processes to primary distillation capacity in refineries, measuring their complexity. It varies from 2 for hydroskimming refineries to over 9 for coking refineries. This index helps determine the relative size and complexity of different refineries. The Nelson Complexity Index rates the complexity of refineries based on secondary processes to primary distillation capacity. It ranges from 2 for hydroskimming refineries to over 9 for coking refineries. U.S. refineries have an average index of 10, with only 59 having coking capacity. Gulf Coast refineries with a complexity of 12 to 13 can yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel fuel. Refineries may upgrade their processes to handle changes in crude oil supplies. Gulf Coast refineries with a complexity of 12 to 13 can yield up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel. Refineries are upgrading processes to handle heavier sour crude oils and meet EPA regulations for ultra-low sulfur diesel by 2010. By the end of 2010, all highway-use diesel fuel in the US must have a sulfur content limited to 15 ppm, known as ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD). EPA regulations require measuring sulfur content at retail outlets, not refineries. Refiners must produce even lower sulfur diesel to limit additional sulfur picked up during pipeline transit or dispose of contaminated \"transmix.\" Refiners are faced with producing lower sulfur diesel fuel or disposing of contaminated \"transmix\" due to additional sulfur picked up during pipeline transit. DOD has adopted the \"single battlefield fuel\" concept, using JP-8 for land-based equipment, substituting diesel fuel. Diesel fuel quality, especially sulfur content, varies significantly. The U.S. Army has adopted the ASTM standard MIL-DTL-83133E for JP-8, limiting sulfur content to 3,000 ppm, with typical levels at 140 ppm. Diesel fuel quality varies globally, leading to potential exposure to high sulfur levels in regionally supplied fuel for land-based equipment. The U.S. Army follows ASTM standard MIL-DTL-83133E for JP-8 fuel, limiting sulfur content to 3,000 ppm, with typical levels at 140 ppm. EPA recognizes the need for tactical vehicles to operate on JP-8 or JP-5 fuel in the U.S. for readiness. EPA has not indicated plans to reduce sulfur content in jet fuel. The U.S. Army follows ASTM standard MIL-DTL-83133E for JP-8 fuel, limiting sulfur content to 3,000 ppm, with typical levels at 140 ppm. EPA has not indicated plans to reduce sulfur content in jet fuel. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that EPA can regulate CO2 emissions from vehicles, leading to a proposed finding in 2009 that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution. This finding has broad implications beyond automobile emissions. EPA recently proposed a Mandatory. EPA issued a proposed finding in April 2009 that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution endangering public health. A Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule was proposed, requiring petroleum refineries to report emissions. Petroleum refineries emit 205 million metric tons CO2 annually, representing 3% of U.S. GHG emissions. Compliance costs could be minimal. The EPA proposed a rule for petroleum refineries to report emissions, which account for 3% of U.S. GHG emissions. Compliance costs may be minimal, but the rule sets the stage for future regulations to cap emissions. Legislation like H.R. 2454 aims to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from refineries and other industrial sources. Recently introduced bills like H.R. 2454 aim to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from refineries. The bill would cap emissions and allow trading of emissions permits. It would gradually reduce the cap to 83%, requiring industries to cut emissions or purchase allowances. Currently, there are 142 refineries in the United States. Between FY2003 and FY2008, DESC reported its top domestic suppliers as Shell, Valero Marketing and Supply Company, ExxonMobil, and BP Corporation, operating a total of 31 refineries in the United States. DESC awards contracts under its fuel solicitations to top domestic suppliers including Shell, Valero Marketing and Supply Company, ExxonMobil, and BP Corporation. These companies operate 31 refineries in the United States with a combined crude capacity of nearly 6 million barrels per day. The refineries have an average Nelson Complexity Index rating of 10 and two-thirds have coking capacity for medium sour crude. The number of refineries in the US decreased from 155 to 141 between 2000 and 2009. Between 2000 and 2009, the number of refineries in the United States decreased from 155 to 141, with an increase in atmospheric crude oil distillation capacity to 18.6 million barrels per stream day. The median capacity of currently operating refineries is around 80,000 bpd, with 70 refineries above this making up 85% of overall U.S. refining capacity. The downstream charge capacity for kerosene/jet fuel in U.S. refineries is around 1 million barrels per stream day, with Gulf Coast refineries yielding up to 8% jet fuel and over 30% diesel. U.S. refineries produce ten times more commercial jet fuel than military specification jet fuel annually. U.S. refineries produce ten times more commercial jet fuel than military specification jet fuel annually, with military jet fuel production ranging from 9% to 11% of the U.S. net production of jet fuel. DESC's worldwide jet fuel purchases have exceeded the U.S. refining industry's jet fuel output in recent years, with U.S. refineries supplying less than 50% of DESC's jet fuel purchases in some years. DESC's jet fuel purchases have surpassed U.S. refineries' output in recent years, with U.S. refineries supplying less than 50% of DESC's jet fuel purchases in some years. To meet the demand, DESC has increased its purchase of commercial jet fuels, which has led to cost savings due to lower prices. The lack of U.S. refining capacity does not necessarily impact DOD's fuel supply. DESC purchases jet fuels, like Jet A, and upgrades them to military specification, reducing spending as commercial jet fuel prices are lower. The lack of U.S. refining capacity does not affect DOD's fuel supply, with DESC sourcing fuel from closer refineries and foreign suppliers for forces outside the continental United States. DESC purchases jet fuels, like Jet A, and upgrades them to military specification, reducing spending as commercial jet fuel prices are lower. The lack of U.S. refining capacity does not affect DOD's fuel supply, with DESC sourcing fuel from closer refineries and foreign suppliers for forces outside the continental United States. The Secretary of the Navy has the authority to procure fuel in the best manner for its intended use, as outlined in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7229. DESC relies on the general procurement authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304 to purchase fuel in a one-step process under the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF). This allows DOD to buy almost any kind of supply or service efficiently. DESC awards contracts and purchases fuel in a one-step process under the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF), allowing DOD to buy various supplies efficiently. This operation helps DOD customers benefit from price breaks for large quantity purchases and provides stabilized prices for products throughout the fiscal year. The term \"acquisition\" is defined as the process of acquiring property or services with appropriated funds to support an executive agency's missions and goals. \"Procurement\" encompasses all stages of acquiring property or services, from determining a need to contract completion. Title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 137 governs the Armed Forces acquisition process. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Acquisition Regulation System (DFARS) govern the process of acquiring property or services for federal agencies, including the Armed Forces. DESC typically awards one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct contracts. DESC typically awards one-year bulk-fuel contracts and multi-year direct delivery fuel contracts using fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment provisions. These contracts allow for upward and downward revision of the contract price based on specified contingencies, following the guidelines set by the Defense Acquisition Regulation System (DFARS) in 48 CFR Parts 201 through 299. DESC uses economic price adjustment provisions in contracts for refined petroleum products. Supplies and related services are eligible for multi-year contracting provisions. DESC adopted contracting instructions for bulk petroleum, ships' bunker, into-plane, and post-camp-and-station contracts for the period of October 1, 2008, through September 30. DESC adopted contracting instructions for multiyear contracts for bulk petroleum, ships' bunker, into-plane, and post-camp-and-station from October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2009, under FAR17.105-1(b) and DFARS 217.170(a) and 217.172(b). DOD and military departments can enter initial five-year contracts for liquid fuels or natural gas with options for up to three five-year renewals, not exceeding twenty years. Multiyear contracts for gas under 10 U.S.C \u00a72922 can include options for up to three five-year renewals, not exceeding a total of twenty years. These contracts involve purchasing supplies or services for more than one, but not more than five, program years. Performance in the second and subsequent years may be contingent on fund appropriation, with a cancellation payment possible if funds are not allocated by Congress. The key distinction from a multiple year contract is that multiyear contracts cover more than one year's requirement. Multiyear contracts for supplies under 10 U.S.C. 2306b allow for purchasing supplies for more than one year without the need to exercise an option each year. The authority for multiyear contracts is derived from general procurement statutes. Multiyear contract authority for supplies under 10 U.S.C. 2306b allows DOD agencies to enter into contracts for supplies for more than one year to promote national security and achieve cost savings. If Congress does not appropriate funds for succeeding years, the agency must cancel the contract. Multiyear contracts for supplies can be entered into to achieve cost savings and promote national security under 10 U.S.C. 2306b. If funds are not appropriated for succeeding years, the contract must be canceled. A multiyear contract for supplies, under certain conditions, can be entered into to promote national security. The contract cannot exceed $500 million without approval from the Secretary of Defense. The Department of Defense is authorized to procure fuel from coal, oil shale, and tar sands through multi-year contracts. The Department of Defense (DOD) is authorized to procure fuel derived from coal, oil shale, and tar sands through multi-year contracts, with the Secretary of Defense having broad waiver authority over acquisition of alternative fuels based on market conditions. The Secretary of Defense may waive contract provisions and terms for fuel sources like petroleum, natural gas, coal, and coke if market conditions affect DOD's acquisition. The five-year limit on multi-year contracts can be waived upon the Secretary's finding. DESC has not decided on this yet. The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) has not determined whether to waive the five-year limit on multi-year contracts for fuel sources like petroleum, natural gas, coal, and coke. Waiving this limit would require approval from the Secretary of Defense. DESC is cautious about jeopardizing its delegation and sales authority granted under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2922e by exercising this waiver authority. The contract delivery price is based on the \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government. DESC has not wanted to risk losing sales authority by waiving the five-year limit on multi-year contracts for fuel sources. The contract delivery price is based on the \"lowest laid down cost\" to the government, with a surcharge for operating costs. Additional costs may be incurred for tactical fuel delivery to final destinations. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 requires analyses and force planning processes to consider hidden costs in fuel logistics for new military capabilities. This includes fully burdened costs such as air-to-air refueling, underway replenishment, or ground transport. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 mandates that fuel logistics be integrated into acquisition processes for new military capabilities, considering life-cycle cost analysis and appointing a director for oversight of energy requirements. The Department of Defense experienced a 500% increase in fuel costs over the past decade due to rising crude oil prices and concerns over declining worldwide production. The Department of Defense (DOD) saw a 500% increase in fuel costs over the past decade due to rising crude oil prices. This led to concerns over declining worldwide production and impacted military operations, such as reducing funding for Air Combat Command aircrews' training hours. Fuel costs have represented a significant portion of DOD's spending, reaching as high as 3% of the budget and over 7% of the Operation and Maintenance budget in the past decade. Fuel costs have represented a significant portion of DOD's spending, reaching as high as 3% of the budget and over 7% of the Operation and Maintenance budget in the past decade. Unlike the airline industry, DOD's only recourse for increased fuel costs has been to request supplemental appropriations. DOD has faced challenges with increasing fuel costs, resorting to requesting supplemental appropriations to cover the expenses. To mitigate vulnerability, DOD has explored options like fuel hedging, multi-year contracting, and using alternate fuels like commercial Jet A fuel to reduce costs and expand supplies. DESC's \"business model\" includes fuel hedging, multi-year contracting, and using alternate fuels like commercial Jet A fuel to reduce costs and expand supplies. The fixed-price contracts have an economic price adjustment clause to take advantage of swings in fuel prices, reflecting crude oil prices. If prices decline, DESC's costs decrease, and if prices rise, the economic clause helps manage costs effectively. DESC's contracts include an economic price adjustment clause to benefit from fuel price fluctuations tied to crude oil prices. This provision adjusts prices based on market rates, reducing DESC's risk of holding contracts above market prices. The airline industry uses hedging strategies to mitigate future jet fuel price increases. The airline industry uses hedging strategies to minimize the risk of future jet fuel price increases. Southwest Airlines, for example, managed to hedge its fuel at $51/barrel when crude oil prices peaked at nearly $147 per barrel in 2008. The Defense Business Board also explored fuel hedging in commercial markets to reduce DOD's exposure to price volatility. The Defense Business Board examined ways to reduce DOD's exposure to fuel price volatility by hedging in commercial markets. They suggested engaging in \"no-market\" hedging through the Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Service to offset increasing DOD fuel costs during crude oil price spikes. The Group recommended seeking legislative authority to transfer funds from Interior to DOD. During crude oil price spikes, the Interior Department could use lease revenues to offset increasing DOD fuel costs. The Defense Business Board suggested seeking legislative authority to transfer funds between Interior and Defense depending on which department benefits from price changes. However, Interior's revenues mainly come from OCS leases, which are already allocated among various government accounts. OCS lessees pay royalties-in-kind by delivering oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Congress has allocated revenues from Continental Shelf leases among government accounts, including coastal states. OCS lessees pay royalties-in-kind with oil delivered to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), created in response to the 1970s oil embargo. The SPR, when filled to capacity, represents roughly 70 days of imported supply and can be drawn down through sales or exchanges under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) represents roughly 70 days of imported supply and can be drawn down through sales or exchanges under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. In 2006, 40% of the crude oil refined in U.S. refineries was heavier than that stored in the SPR, affecting refinery operations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in 2006 that 40% of crude oil refined in U.S. refineries was heavier than that stored in the SPR, impacting refinery operations. Refineries processing heavy oil would struggle to operate at normal capacity if they had to use SPR oil, leading to a significant decrease in U.S. refining throughput. This could reduce the SPR's effectiveness during an oil disruption, especially if it involved heavy oil. The SPR's effectiveness would decrease by 5% if refineries had to use SPR oil during an oil disruption, especially with heavy oil involved. The SPR does not have a defined role in mitigating a DOD fuel supply disruption, as refineries under contract to supply DOD could bid on a drawdown sale. Refineries typically yield only 8% jet fuel, limiting the SPR's role in supporting jet fuel production during a supply disruption. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve's role in supporting jet fuel production during a supply disruption is limited due to refineries yielding only 8% jet fuel on average. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits federal agencies from procuring alternative fuels without meeting specific emissions criteria. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-140) prohibits federal agencies from procuring alternative fuels unless emissions criteria are met to avoid exacerbating global warming. The Air Force abandoned plans for a coal-to-liquid fuel plant, but DESC is interested in pursuing alternative fuel sources. The Air Force has abandoned plans for a coal-to-liquid fuel plant due to concerns about global warming. DESC is now interested in pursuing a pilot program for synthetic fuels to support DOD JP-8 fuel requirements in Alaska. Despite declining crude oil prices, the possibility of supply shortages and price spikes remains. Policy and economics currently make fossil-based alternatives unattainable. DOD is shifting its focus towards efficiency in response to energy challenges. The reoccurrence of crude oil supply shortages and price spikes may be inevitable due to policy and economic constraints on fossil-based alternatives. The DOD is focusing on efficiency in response to energy challenges and may need to report on the cost of fuel for military operations. The refining sector's lack of responsiveness to DOD's procurement announcements during high petroleum prices could be a concern for Congress. Refinery operators may question the value of emission credits in response to proposed greenhouse gas emission caps. The refining sector's lack of responsiveness to DOD's procurement announcements during high petroleum prices raises concerns for Congress. Refinery operators may question the value of emission credits in response to proposed greenhouse gas emission caps, potentially leading to the shutdown of marginally profitable refineries. Congress may worry about the impact on defense fuel suppliers if operators choose to close refineries. For more information on alternative fuel sources, refer to CRS Report RL34133, Fischer-Tropsch Fuels from Coal, Natural Gas, and Biomass. The curr_chunk discusses the use of Avgas in light aircraft and Crude Oil Classification DFM in shipboard propulsion plants. It also references reports on alternative fuel sources, greenhouse gas legislation, and oil shale. H.R. 2454 as Passed by the House of Representatives covers Avgas for light aircraft, DFM for shipboard propulsion, DF2 for ground vehicles, FSII for icing inhibition, and FOB trade terms. FSII, or Fuel Systems Icing Inhibitor, is a trade term where the seller delivers goods on board a vessel designated by the buyer. The seller fulfills its obligation when the goods pass over the ship's rail. Jet A-1 (JA1) is a civilian-aviation kerosene-based turbine fuel. Jet A-1 (JA1) and Jet A are civilian-aviation kerosene-based turbine fuels with specific ASTM specifications. Jet A-1 is identified by NATO as F-35 and has a lower freeze point compared to Jet A. Both fuels have the same flash point. Trade terms in fuel transactions include details on delivery, payment, risk transfer, and cost responsibilities. Jet A (JA) is a civilian-aviation kerosene type of jet fuel with the same flash point as Jet A-1 but a higher freeze point. Jet B is a distillate with higher flammability, mainly used in very cold climates for better cold weather performance. It is supplied in Canada under Canadian Specification CAN/CGSB 3.23. JP-4 is another jet fuel variant. Jet B is a jet fuel variant used in very cold climates for better cold weather performance. It is supplied in Canada under Canadian Specification CAN/CGSB 3.23. JP-4 is the military equivalent of Jet B with corrosion inhibitor and anti-icing additives, meeting U.S. Military Specification MIL-DTL-5624U Grade JP-4 and British Specification DEF STAN 91-88 AVTAG/FSII. JP-5 is a kerosene-based fuel with a higher flash-point developed for military aircraft on carriers. It meets MIL-DTL-5624 U and NATO Code F-44. JP-8 is the military equivalent of Jet A-1. JP-5 is a kerosene-based fuel with a higher flash-point (140\u00b0F) suitable for military aircraft on carriers, meeting MIL-DTL-5624 U and NATO Code F-44. JP-8, the military equivalent of Jet A-1, contains corrosion and icing inhibitors, chosen by the Air Force in 1996 for safety and combat survivability over the more flammable JP-4. JP-8 is a military fuel with less benzene and n-hexane than JP-4, identified as F-34 by NATIO. It has a stronger smell and is oily to the touch, while JP-4 is more solvent-like. JP-8+100 includes an additive for thermal stability and is used in diesel-powered tactical ground vehicles. Middle Distillate range fuels like JP-8, kerosene, jet fuel, and diesel fuel are used in military installations. Mogas is the primary fuel for non-tactical ground vehicles. Multiyear contracting is a method to acquire known requirements for up to five years. Multiyear contracting is a special method to acquire known requirements for up to five years, even if total funds may not be available at the time of contract award. Agency funding of multiyear contracts must conform to OMB Circulars A-11 and A-34. Naphtha is a petroleum distillate. Naphtha is a petroleum distillate used in gasoline production to create a higher octane product called reformate. It is important to follow OMB Circulars A-11 and A-34 when funding multiyear contracts."
