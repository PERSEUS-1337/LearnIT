    "content": "Prior to 1996, health insurance coverage for mental illness was historically less generous than for physical illnesses, with lower limits, fewer covered services, and increased cost sharing. Mental health parity laws aim to ensure that health insurance coverage for mental health services is equal to coverage for medical and surgical benefits. This includes removing lower dollar limits, increasing coverage for hospital days and outpatient visits, and reducing cost sharing disparities. Mental health parity laws aim to ensure equal insurance coverage for mental health services compared to medical and surgical benefits. Policymakers have developed approaches based on coverage mandates and parity requirements to achieve this goal. Mental health parity laws aim to ensure equal insurance coverage for mental health services compared to medical and surgical benefits. Parity laws may require insurers to cover certain mental illnesses, with different approaches such as mandated coverage and parity coverage. Federal mental health parity law prior to the ACA employed a mandated approach. The ACA achieved two key goals regarding federal mental health parity law. It did not mandate coverage of specific mental health services but required compliance with parity requirements for insurers covering both mental health and medical/surgical benefits. The ACA expanded federal mental health parity requirements for insurers covering both mental health and medical/surgical benefits, creating a mandated benefit for certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services. The ACA expanded federal mental health parity requirements for insurers, mandating coverage of certain mental health and substance abuse disorder services in specific financing arrangements. It does not include a comprehensive coverage mandate for mental health services at the federal level but contains provisions that expand the applicability of federal mental health parity requirements. The ACA does not change federal mental health parity requirements but expands them to various financing arrangements. Two prior laws, MHPA and MHPAEA, establish federal mental health parity requirements, including parity in limits and treatment. These laws do not mandate coverage for specific mental health conditions. Recent data shows that around one-third of employers with over 50 employees have adjusted their benefits in response to MHPAEA, which expands federal parity requirements to include treatment limitations, financial requirements, and covered benefits. Insurers must comply with these requirements when covering both mental health and medical/surgical benefits, but specific mental health conditions are not mandated for coverage. Some employers have chosen to drop coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services in response to these requirements. Recent data indicates that about one-third of employers with more than 50 employees have adjusted their benefits in response to MHPAEA. Some have chosen to drop coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services, while others have eliminated coverage limits or increased utilization management. The ACA requires certain plans to cover mental health and substance use disorder services, but the impact on plans' coverage decisions is unclear. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) was the first federal law addressing mental health coverage, employing a mandated offering parity approach without coverage mandates but requiring partial parity. It remains unclear how the requirements for mental health and substance use disorder services under certain plans, including those offered through the Exchanges, will impact coverage decisions once fully in effect in 2014. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) mandates that annual and aggregate lifetime dollar limits on mental health services coverage must be no less than those for medical and surgical services under group health plans and health insurance issuers. It amends ERISA, PHSA, and IRC to apply parity coverage requirements to all group health coverage arrangements governed by these statutes, with a small employer exemption. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) amends ERISA, PHSA, and IRC to apply parity coverage requirements to all group health coverage arrangements. It establishes a small employer exemption for employers with 2-50 employees and a cost exemption for group health plans experiencing a 1% cost increase due to compliance. MHPA received annual extensions since its original sunset in 2001. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) includes a cost exemption for group health plans with a 1% cost increase due to compliance. MHPAEA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include substance use disorders and mandates parity in treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) includes a cost exemption for group health plans with a 1% cost increase due to compliance. MHPAEA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include substance use disorders and mandates parity in treatment limitations, financial requirements, and in- and out-of-network benefits. It also amends small employer exemptions and clarifies cost exemption parameters. Individual market is not covered by these requirements. The Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) and the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) amend federal mental health parity requirements for group health plans. These requirements do not apply to the individual market. Medicaid managed care plans and CHIP plans covering mental health services must comply with some or all of these requirements. Medicare beneficiaries are offered coverage under separate regulations. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid managed care plans and CHIP plans. Medicare, under traditional fee-for-service or Medicare Advantage plans, is not required to comply with these parity requirements. The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to various types of plans, including qualified health plans, Medicaid non-managed care benchmark plans, and individual market plans. This expansion raises questions about the reach of federal mental health parity law. The ACA extends federal mental health parity law to qualified health plans, Medicaid benchmark plans, and individual market plans. Small employer exemption remains, but the definition of small employer was expanded. QHPs purchased through an Exchange must cover mental health services starting in 2014. The federal parity law exempts small employers but was expanded under the ACA. QHPs from Exchanges must cover mental health services from 2014, complying with federal parity requirements. Considerations arise regarding the small employer exemption and mental health service coverage, potentially needing reconciliation through rulemaking. Medicaid benchmark plans offering mental health services must also comply with federal parity requirements. The ACA expanded the federal parity law to include small employers. QHPs from Exchanges must cover mental health services in compliance with federal parity requirements. Medicaid benchmark plans offering mental health services must also comply with these requirements. The application of federal mental health parity requirements to CHIP plans is explained in detail. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and new plans in the individual and small group markets. The application of federal mental health parity requirements to CHIP plans is explained in detail. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and new plans in the individual and small group markets. Federal mental health parity law requires full parity for covered services. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health and substance abuse services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the small and individual group market. It defines essential health benefits and requires all QHPs to provide these benefits. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health and substance abuse services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the small and individual group market. QHPs are required to provide essential health benefits, which include mental health and substance abuse services as defined by ACA Section 1302(b). The ACA mandates coverage of mental health and substance abuse services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the small and individual group market. These services are included in the essential health benefits package and must be offered by QHPs, with the specific scope defined through the rulemaking process. The statute does not specify coverage for individual services but requires coverage within 10 broad categories. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health and substance abuse services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the small and individual group market within 10 broad categories. ACA Section 2001(c) requires all Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans to offer at least the EHB by January 1, 2014. PHSA Section 2707(a) requires new plans offered by a health insurance issuer through the individual and small group markets to include coverage of essential health benefits. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the small and individual group market. While not a comprehensive federal mandate, these provisions create a federal requirement for mental health benefits coverage by a significant number of insurers. Some states also mandate coverage for specific mental health conditions through their parity laws. The ACA mandates coverage of mental health services for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and plans in the small and individual group market, creating a federal requirement for mental health benefits coverage by many insurers. Some states also mandate coverage for specific mental health conditions through their parity laws. ACA Section 1311(d)(3), as amended by ACA Section 10104(e), allows states to require additional benefits in QHPs, but the state must bear the cost of these extra benefits. The ACA mandates mental health services coverage for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and small/individual group market plans. States can require additional benefits in QHPs but must cover the costs. ACA Section 1311(j) ensures federal mental health parity requirements apply to all QHPs. The ACA mandates mental health services coverage for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and small/individual group market plans. ACA Section 1311(j) requires federal mental health parity requirements to apply to all QHPs in the same manner. QHPs offered by the Exchanges will be provided through both the small group and individual markets. Large group plans may have less incentive to participate due to risk pooling benefits for small group and individual plans. The ACA mandates mental health services coverage for QHPs, Medicaid benchmark plans, and small/individual group market plans. Large group plans may have less incentive to participate in Exchanges due to risk pooling benefits for small group and individual plans. The exemption of small employers from federal mental health parity requirements may impact plans offered through the Exchange. The ACA mandates mental health services coverage for various plans, including small/individual group market plans. The small employer exemption in federal mental health parity law may impact plans offered through the Exchange. The small employer exemption in federal mental health parity law extends to states where self-employed individuals are included in the small employer definition. ACA Section 1563(c)(4) aligns PHSA Section 2726 to apply federal mental health parity requirements to individual market plans, removing references to group health plans and extending these requirements to plans in the individual market. However, the small employer exemption under PHSA Section remains unclear. The ACA conforming amendment extends federal mental health parity requirements to individual market plans, including those offered by a health insurance issuer for small employers. The small employer exemption under PHSA Section remains unclear. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may remain in effect for small employers with 1 employee in states allowing single individuals in small groups. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may remain in effect for employers with 1 to 100 employees, an expansion from the previous limit of 2 to 50 employees. States have the option to use the old definition until 2016. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may now apply to employers with 1 to 100 employees, expanding from the previous limit of 2 to 50 employees. States have the option to use the old definition until 2016, which may raise questions about compliance with federal mental health parity requirements for plans offered to individuals seeking coverage on the individual market. The language in plans for individuals seeking coverage on the individual market may need to comply with federal mental health parity requirements, unlike plans for single individuals seeking group coverage as an employer. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may exempt small employer QHPs from these requirements. The small employer exemption under federal mental health parity law may exempt small employer QHPs from the requirements, but it is unclear if this exemption applies to QHPs in the same manner as health insurance issuers and group health plans. The ACA does not specify if the small employer exemption applies to QHPs in the same manner as health insurance issuers and group health plans. Medicaid managed care plans must comply with federal mental health parity requirements. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, in addition to Medicaid managed care plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, requiring compliance with parity requirements specifically for treatment limitations and financial requirements. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans, requiring compliance with treatment limitations and financial requirements. Plans offering EPSDT are deemed to meet the parity requirement. Medicaid benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans offering EPSDT services are deemed to meet the parity requirement, unlike Medicaid managed care plans. This exemption means that non-managed care plans are not obligated to comply with federal parity requirements for annual and lifetime limits, as well as in- and out-of-network covered benefits, as per ACA Section 2001(c). Medicaid benchmark or benchmark-equivalent plans offering EPSDT services are exempt from federal parity requirements for annual and lifetime limits and in- and out-of-network covered benefits, unlike Medicaid managed care plans. It is unclear if non-managed care plans under traditional Medicaid must adhere to federal mental health parity requirements. ACA Section 2001(a)(2)(A) expands federal mental health parity requirements to all \"newly eligible\" Medicaid populations, including those under traditional Medicaid plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to all \"newly eligible\" Medicaid populations, including those under traditional Medicaid plans, up to 133% of the federal poverty level. The CHIP statute also extends federal mental health parity requirements to CHIP plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to all \"newly eligible\" Medicaid populations, including those under traditional Medicaid plans, up to 133% of the federal poverty level. Two provisions prior to the ACA extend federal mental health parity requirements to CHIP plans, but may need to be conformed to reflect ACA redesignations. The state child health plan must comply with PHSA Section 2705 for both mental health/substance abuse and medical/surgical benefits. ACA Section 2001 extended federal mental health parity requirements to Medicaid non-managed care benchmark plans. SSA Section 2103(c)(6)(B) considers CHIP plans offering EPSDT as meeting parity requirements. SSA Section 2103(c)(6)(B) deems CHIP plans offering EPSDT services as meeting parity requirements, but it is unclear if this fulfills the full set of federal mental health parity requirements outlined in SSA Section 2103(f)(2). The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements for CHIP plans, requiring compliance with all aspects of the requirements outlined in SSA Section 2103(f)(2), including those in subpart 2 of part A of Title XXVII of the PHSA. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements for CHIP plans, extending them to plans in the individual market, QHPs, additional Medicaid plan types, and certain Medicaid expansion populations.

The ACA extends federal mental health parity requirements to various health plans, including CHIP plans, individual market plans, QHPs, and certain Medicaid plans. Questions remain about the impact on small employer plans in the Exchange and traditional Medicaid non-managed care plans. Medicaid non-managed care benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans may not be covered by federal mental health parity requirements. The CHIP statute contains two separate parity-related provisions, with one having a more limited reach and the other applying requirements in their entirety to CHIP plans."
