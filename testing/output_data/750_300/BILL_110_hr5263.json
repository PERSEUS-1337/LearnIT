The Forest Landscape Restoration Act aims to promote collaborative ecosystem restoration in priority forest areas by encouraging sustainability, leveraging local and national resources, reducing wildfire management costs, and demonstrating the effectiveness of ecological restoration techniques. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act promotes collaborative ecosystem restoration in priority forest areas to reduce wildfire risk, demonstrate ecological restoration techniques' effectiveness, and offset treatment costs with forest restoration byproducts. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act defines key terms such as \"covered Federal lands,\" \"Fund,\" \"program,\" and \"Secretaries\" for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act defines key terms for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program is established by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to fund ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes. Activities must comply with the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. Eligibility criteria are required for nomination and funding under the program. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, established by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture, funds ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes. Eligibility criteria for nomination and funding under the program include a complete landscape restoration strategy for a 10-year period across a forested landscape of at least 50,000 acres. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program funds ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes over a 10-year period on landscapes of at least 50,000 acres, primarily forested Federal lands but may include other land types, in need of active ecosystem restoration and accessible by wood-processing infrastructure for woody biomass use. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program funds ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes over a 10-year period on at least 50,000 acres of primarily forested Federal lands. The program focuses on landscapes in need of active ecosystem restoration and accessible by wood-processing infrastructure for woody biomass use. The restoration strategies incorporate the best available science, tools, and requirements for old-growth maintenance, restoration, and management. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program funds ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes over a 10-year period on at least 50,000 acres of primarily forested Federal lands. The program focuses on landscapes in need of active ecosystem restoration and accessible by wood-processing infrastructure for woody biomass use. The restoration strategies incorporate scientific application tools in ecological restoration strategies and requirements for old-growth maintenance, restoration, and management. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program funds ecological restoration treatments for priority forest landscapes on primarily forested Federal lands. The program requires a collaborative process involving diverse interests and successful planning and implementation of ecological restoration. The curr_chunk describes the requirements for a resource advisory committee under section 205 of Public Law 106-393, including an established record of successful planning and implementation of ecological restoration projects on covered Federal lands. Plans include using fire for ecological restoration, improving fish and wildlife habitat, and maintaining or improving water quality. The curr_chunk outlines the tasks for a resource advisory committee, including improving fish and wildlife habitat, maintaining water quality, controlling exotic species invasions, and using woody biomass for projects. The committee must also report annually on performance. The curr_chunk outlines the requirement to report annually on performance, develop small business incubators, and provide employment and training opportunities in rural communities through local entities. The curr_chunk focuses on providing employment and training opportunities in rural communities through local entities such as private, nonprofit, cooperative, Youth Conservation Corps crews, small businesses, and other entities hiring or training local people for contracts. The curr_chunk outlines criteria for entities hiring or training local people for contracts, considering community wildfire protection plans and analyzing cost savings from reduced wildfire management costs and lower unit costs for ecological restoration treatments. The curr_chunk outlines analyzing cost savings from reduced wildfire management costs and lower unit costs for ecological restoration treatments, estimating annual Federal funding needed, and leveraging new non-Federal investment for the proposal. The collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must include the amount of new non-Federal investment leveraged by Federal funding and be subject to additional requirements determined by the Secretaries for efficient administration. The proposal is submitted to the Director of the Bureau of Land Management for each State where the covered Federal lands are located. (1) A collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal must be submitted to the Director of the Bureau of Land Management and the Regional Forester for each State where the covered Federal lands are located.\n(2) State Directors or Regional Foresters can nominate proposals for selection by the Secretaries.\n(3) Documentation requirements apply to each collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal. (2) State Directors or Regional Foresters may nominate collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals for selection by the Secretaries. Documentation requirements apply to each nominated proposal, including a proposal to use Federal funds. The State Directors or Regional Foresters may nominate proposals to use Federal funds for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands. The State Directors or Regional Foresters may nominate proposals to use Federal funds for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands consistent with the landscape restoration strategy. Amounts transferred to the Secretaries from the Fund must be used for ecological restoration treatments within the same fiscal year. The State Directors or Regional Foresters may nominate proposals for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands. Funds transferred to the Secretaries must be used for treatments within the same fiscal year. If the proposal includes activities on non-federal lands, the State Director or Regional Forester will oversee them. The restoration proposal involves activities on non-covered Federal land, requiring evidence of the owner's intent to participate and provide funding. The selection process involves consultation with scientific and technical advisory panels. The Secretaries will select collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals based on nominations and eligibility criteria, after consulting with advisory panels. The Secretaries will select collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals based on nominations and eligibility criteria, giving special consideration to ecological case strength, collaborative process strength, and potential reduction of relative impacts. The Secretaries will evaluate landscape restoration proposals based on ecological and collaborative strengths, cost reduction potential, wildfire management benefits, and non-Federal involvement. The Secretaries will evaluate landscape restoration proposals based on ecological and collaborative strengths, cost reduction potential, wildfire management benefits, and non-Federal involvement. They may select up to 10 proposals for funding each fiscal year, with a limit of 2 proposals per region in the National Forest System. The Secretaries will establish a scientific advisory panel of experts in ecological forest restoration and fire ecology to evaluate and provide recommendations on nominated proposals meeting eligibility criteria for funding. The Secretaries may establish a technical advisory panel of experts in ecological forest restoration and fire ecology to evaluate nominated proposals for landscape restoration and wildfire management cost reductions.
