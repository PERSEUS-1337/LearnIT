The Premier Certified Lenders Program (PCLP) has been successful in helping small businesses expand by increasing resources. However, premier certified lenders are required to set aside large amounts in loss reserve accounts. Premier certified lenders in the PCLP are required to maintain unnecessarily large loss reserve accounts, limiting their ability to serve more small businesses. They should only be required to maintain reserves based on the risk associated with their loan portfolio. Premier certified lenders in the PCLP should maintain loss reserve accounts based on the risk of loss associated with their loan portfolio to protect taxpayers and support small businesses in creating economic development. SEC. 3. ALTERNATIVE LOSS RESERVE FOR CERTAIN PREMIER CERTIFIED LENDERS. Section 508(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 is amended to include an alternative loss reserve option for qualified high loss reserve PCLs. This allows them to elect to follow these requirements instead of others in certain calendar quarters. Qualified high loss reserve PCLs can elect not to make contributions to their loss reserve in a calendar quarter, based on the risk of loss. Qualified high loss reserve PCLs can choose not to contribute to their loss reserve in a quarter, ensuring it remains at least $25,000 and sufficient based on risk of loss. The company must maintain a loss reserve of at least $25,000 and ensure it is sufficient to protect the Federal Government from the risk of loss associated with their PCLP loan portfolio.

The company's loss reserve must be certified by a third-party auditor to protect against the risk of loss from its PCLP loan portfolio. The company's loss reserve must be certified by a third-party auditor to protect the Federal Government from the risk of loss associated with its PCLP loan portfolio.

The term 'calendar quarter' is defined as a period starting on January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1 of each year.
