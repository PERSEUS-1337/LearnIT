The CDBG Section 108 Loan Guarantee program allows states and communities to use their CDBG allocation to attract private capital for economic development, housing, and infrastructure projects. The Section 108 program allows states and communities to leverage their CDBG allocation to attract private capital for economic development, housing, and infrastructure projects. Communities can borrow up to five times their annual allocation for 20 years through bond issuance, with proceeds used to support job creation and meet CDBG program goals benefiting low to moderate income individuals and addressing community needs. The Section 108 program allows communities to borrow funds to support job creation and meet CDBG program goals benefiting low to moderate income individuals. The Administration's budget proposes doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2013 to address credit market difficulties. The budget proposes doubling the Section 108 program's loan commitment ceiling to $500 million in FY2013 to help local governments finance job creation activities. The Administration also suggests charging a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program to eliminate the need for an appropriated credit subsidy. The Administration proposed a fee-based assessment for borrowers accessing the program to eliminate the need for a credit subsidy. Congress rejected this proposal in favor of maintaining the status quo. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $3.210 billion for CDF activities in FY2013, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants, a 5% increase from the previous year. The bill recommends $3.210 billion for CDF activities in FY2013, including $3.100 billion for CDBG formula grants. It also supports $60 million funding for Indian tribes and recommends $50 million for SCI activities, half of the Administration's request. The bill recommends $50 million for SCI activities, half of the Administration's request. It also supports converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program and increasing the loan guarantee commitment to $500 million for FY2013. Additionally, $12.5 million of the appropriation for SCI would be allocated to communities with populations less than 500,000. The Administration's budget request includes converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program and increasing the loan guarantee commitment to $500 million for FY2013. The Senate committee bill recommends continued funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million but does not support transferring the program from its current account. The House Appropriations Committee reported the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations act on June 20, 2012. The House Appropriations Committee reported the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies Appropriations act on June 20, 2012, recommending $3.404 billion for activities funded under the CDF account, including $3.344 billion for CDBG formula grants. This is 13% more than the previous year's appropriation and 8% more than recommended in the Senate bill. H.R. 5972 also supports the Administration's $60 million funding request for Indian tribes. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $3.404 billion for CDF activities, including $3.344 billion for CDBG formula grants, in FY2012. H.R. 5972 supports the Administration's $60 million funding request for Indian tribes but does not include a set-aside of CDBG funds for SCI activities. Instead, it recommends just over $2 million for closeout and evaluation of previously awarded SCI awards. The House bill recommends just over $2 million for closeout and evaluation of previously awarded SCI awards, which is unauthorized and lacks support from the House Financial Services Committee. H.R. 5972 also supports $6 million in loan subsidies for a loan guarantee ceiling of $244 million, in line with the Senate bill's provisions. H.R. 5972 recommends $6 million in loan subsidies for a loan guarantee ceiling of $244 million and continues funding for Section 4 activities at $35 million. The bill does not support transferring the program from its current account. Amendments were introduced during floor debate calling for funding reductions or elimination of the CDBG and Section 108 loan guarantee. The full House began floor consideration of H.R. 5972, which recommends funding for the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program account. Several amendments were introduced during the debate, including proposals to reduce funding for various programs, all of which were defeated. Several amendments were introduced during the debate on H.R. 5972, including proposals to reduce funding for the CDF and Section 108 loan guarantee program, all of which were defeated. A point of order was sustained on an amendment seeking to change existing law. During the FY2012 budget debate, an amendment to increase the use of funds for demolition activities was challenged and ruled as legislation in an appropriation bill. Congress aimed to reduce federal spending while supporting private sector job growth. During the FY2012 budget debate, Congress focused on reducing federal spending to address the deficit while supporting private sector job creation. Supporters of CDBG highlighted its role in economic development and vowed to defend it against funding cuts. The Obama Administration proposed restructuring the CDF account by minimizing activities not directly related to the CDBG program in the FY2012 budget. This included reducing funding for CDBG formula grants and eliminating funding for the Neighborhood Initiative (NI) and Economic Development Initiative (EDI). The Obama Administration's FY2012 budget proposed restructuring the CDF account by reducing funding for CDBG formula grants, eliminating funding for the Neighborhood Initiative (NI) and Economic Development Initiative (EDI) programs, and transferring activities not directly related to the CDBG program. The proposed funding level was $3.804 billion, representing a 14.5% reduction from the FY2010 enacted appropriations level. The Administration's FY2012 budget proposed restructuring the CDF account by reducing funding for CDBG formula grants and eliminating funding for NI and EDI programs. The proposed funding level was $3.804 billion, a 14.5% reduction from FY2010 enacted appropriations. The Administration requested an 11.5% increase in funding for CDBG states and entitlement communities formula components, from $3.296 billion in FY2011 to $3.684 billion for FY2012.

The proposed funding level was $3.804 billion, a 14.5% reduction from FY2010 enacted appropriations. The Administration requested an increase in funding for CDBG states and entitlement communities formula components to $3.684 billion for FY2012. Additionally, funding was requested for CDBG grants to insular areas and Indian tribes, Rural Innovation Grants, and assistance to Guam. The Administration's FY2012 budget did not include funding for Economic Development Initiatives and Neighborhood Initiatives grants, programs subject to congressional earmarks. Rural Innovation Funds were to be awarded competitively to rural areas with populations under 20,000 for housing and economic development efforts, while assistance to Guam was for community development needs due to military relocations. The Administration's FY2012 budget did not include funding for Economic Development Initiatives and Neighborhood Initiatives grants, programs subject to congressional earmarks. The Administration recommended transferring the SCI programs to a new stand-alone account and requested an appropriation of $150 million to support Regional Integrated Planning Grants in metropolitan areas. The Administration's FY2012 budget did not include funding for Economic Development Initiatives and Neighborhood Initiatives grants. Instead, $150 million was allocated for Regional Integrated Planning Grants in metropolitan areas, with $100 million for regional organizations and $40 million for individual communities. Additionally, $10 million was set aside for Housing-Transportation Integration Research. The Administration's budget proposed doubling the program's loan commitment ceiling from $250 million in FY2011 to $500 million in FY2012 to help local governments finance job creation activities. The Administration proposed increasing funding to help local governments finance job creation activities by doubling the loan commitment ceiling. Congress rejected the proposal to charge a fee-based assessment to borrowers accessing the program. Congress rejected the Administration's proposal to increase funding for credit subsidy in favor of maintaining the status quo. The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies approved a draft bill recommending $3.501 billion for CDF activities, including $3.466 billion for CDBG formula grants and $35 million for Indian tribes. The House Appropriations Subcommittee approved $3.501 billion for CDF activities, with $3.466 billion for CDBG formula grants and $35 million for Indian tribes. The draft report recommended maintaining funding levels, but noted a proposal to eliminate the program due to it not being a core federal function. The House Appropriations Subcommittee approved $3.501 billion for CDF activities, with $3.466 billion for CDBG formula grants and $35 million for Indian tribes. The draft bill proposed shifting community development activities to states and local communities for better transparency and accountability. Funding priorities would be adjusted, including eliminating the Sustainable Communities Initiative and reducing funding for CDBG Indian Tribes. The draft bill proposed shifting CDF funding priorities, including eliminating the Sustainable Communities Initiative and reducing funding for CDBG Indian Tribes from $64 million to $35 million. It also recommended maintaining the current structure of Section 108 loan guarantees instead of restructuring it into a fee-based program. The bill recommended maintaining the current structure of Section 108 loan guarantees, including appropriating $6.8 million in credit subsidies to support $275 million in loan guarantees. It also suggested lowering the ceiling on the percentage of funds grantees could use for CDBG administrative expenses from 20% to 10% of the grantee's allocation. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended reducing the percentage of funds grantees could use for CDBG administrative expenses from 20% to 10% of the grantee's allocation in the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act for FY2012. The proposed CDF funding would have decreased to $3.0 billion, with an additional $400 million for CDBG supplemental disaster assistance. This was $500 million less than the previous year's appropriation and $280.4 million less than requested by the Administration. The Senate bill recommended $2.851 billion for CDBG formula funding, a reduction of 13.7% from FY2011 levels. It also proposed $90 million for the Sustainable Communities Initiative, $60 million less than requested by the President. The Senate bill recommended a funding level of $3.302 million, which was 22.3% below the amount requested by the Administration. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to consolidate three appropriations measures into a Minibus, which was approved by the Senate on November 1, 2011. The amendment approved on October 21, 2011, consolidated three appropriations measures into a Minibus. The Senate approved the \"Minibus\" on November 1, 2011. One of the amendments, S.Amdt. 796 proposed by Senator Coburn, aimed to prevent the use of grants to repay federal loans, impacting the CDBG program and Section 108 loan guarantee program. The amendment approved on October 21, 2011, consolidated three appropriations measures into a Minibus. It has implications for the CDBG program and Section 108 loan guarantee program. CDBG funds have been used to cover revenue shortfalls associated with the repayment of bonds for Section 108 projects. The House requested a conference on H.R. 2112 to reconcile differences in the bill versions. The House requested a conference on H.R. 2112 to reconcile differences in the bill versions. The conference version of H.R. 2112 was approved by the House and Senate on November 17, 2011, and the act was signed into law by the President as P.L. 112-55 on November 18, 2011, appropriating $3.308 billion for CDF activities, including $300 million for CDBG disaster activities. The House and Senate approved the conference version of H.R. 2112, signed into law by the President as P.L. 112-55 on November 18, 2011. It appropriated $3.308 billion for CDF activities, with $300 million for CDBG disaster activities. The act funded core CDBG programs, allocating $60 million for Indian Tribes and $2.948 billion for formula grants to states and entitlement communities. The $3.308 billion appropriated for CDF activities in P.L. 112-55 included $300 million for CDBG disaster activities. The funding for CDBG formula grants in FY2012 was 10.7% less than in FY2011, 19.6% less than requested by the President, and 15% less than recommended by the House. The decline in funding reflects congressional efforts to reduce federal spending for deficit reduction. The decline in CDBG funding and elimination of funding for other programs in P.L. 112-55 reflect congressional efforts to reduce federal spending for deficit reduction. The act did not include provisions from the Senate version of H.R. 2112 that would have restricted the use of federal grants like CDBGs for repaying federal loans or reduced the percentage of CDBG funds for administrative expenses. Instead, it directed the GAO to conduct a study. The act P.L. 112-55 included provisions such as a study by the GAO on the effectiveness of CDBG and HOME block grant programs, with a deadline for completion within 180 days. HUD was also directed to submit a progress report on their efforts within 120 days. The act P.L. 112-55 required a study to be completed within 180 days and a progress report to be submitted within 120 days by HUD. The Administration's proposal to convert Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program did not receive congressional support for the third year in a row. The Administration's proposal to convert Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based program did not receive congressional support for the third year in a row. P.L. 112-55 maintained the program's current structure and appropriated $5.952 million in credit subsidies to support $240 million in Section 108 loan guarantee commitments. The act also prohibited states from diverting proceeds from the sale of notes backed by Section 108 loan guarantees to any community other than the local government that initially sought the loan guarantee commitment. The act P.L. 112-55 included $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance for FY2012. These funds were to be used by states and local governments for disaster relief and long-term recovery efforts in areas declared disasters by the President in 2011. The act also prohibited states from diverting proceeds from the sale of notes backed by Section 108 loan guarantees to any community other than the local government that initially sought the loan guarantee commitment. The act P.L. 112-55 allocated $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance for FY2012 to states and local governments for disaster relief and long-term recovery in areas declared disasters by the President in 2011. Funds were to be used for housing, infrastructure, and economic revitalization. Eligible entities had to submit a disaster recovery plan detailing fund usage. The act P.L. 112-55 allocated $400 million in CDBG supplemental disaster assistance for FY2012 to states and local governments for disaster relief and long-term recovery. Funds were to be used for housing, infrastructure, and economic revitalization. Grantees could seek waivers for certain CDBG program requirements to aid in their recovery efforts. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011, signed into law on April 15, 2011, appropriated $3.508 billion for disaster relief activities, with $100 million exempted from spending limits. Grantees could seek waivers for CDBG program requirements to support recovery efforts. The Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011, signed into law on April 15, 2011, included a provision appropriating $3.508 billion for the Community Development Fund (CDF). This amount was reduced to $3.501 billion due to a mandatory rescission and discretionary transfer. The Department's Transformation Initiative granted the Secretary of HUD the authority to reduce the CDF account's total appropriation to $3.501 billion, approximately 16% below the amount appropriated for FY2010. The CDF, including the formula-based Community Development Block Grant program, was targeted for significant budget reductions in H.R. 1, which passed the House but not the Senate. Funding for HUD's Community Development Fund, including the CDBG program, was initially targeted for reduction. The House-passed H.R. 1 bill aimed to reduce funding for CDBG activities by 62.5% below the FY2010 appropriation as part of efforts to cut the federal budget deficit. The bill also proposed a $61 billion cut in discretionary programs, including HUD's Community Development Fund. The House-passed H.R. 1 bill aimed to reduce funding for CDBG activities by 62.5% below the FY2010 appropriation as part of efforts to cut the federal budget deficit. The bill also proposed a $61 billion cut in discretionary programs, including HUD's Community Development Fund. The bill failed to win Senate approval, leading to renewed negotiations between the Obama Administration and House and Senate leadership to resolve the FY2011 budget impasse. After S.Amdt. 149 failed in the Senate, negotiations between the Obama Administration and House and Senate leadership led to the signing of P.L. 112-10, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011, on April 15, 2011. This measure was passed to avoid a government-wide shutdown after a temporary spending measure, P.L. 112-8, expired. The House and Senate negotiated P.L. 112-10 to avoid a government shutdown by appropriating $3.508 billion for CDF activities, including $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. The act included a 0.2% mandatory across-the-board rescission and a 1% discretionary transfer to HUD's Transformation Initiative. This reduced the CDF account to $3.501 billion. The House and Senate negotiated P.L. 112-10 to appropriate $3.508 billion for CDF activities, including $3.343 billion for CDBG formula funds. This involved a 0.2% across-the-board rescission and a 1% discretionary transfer to HUD's Transformation Initiative, reducing the CDF account to $3.501 billion. Additionally, $35 million was transferred from the CDF account to the Department's Transformation Initiative. The P.L. 112-10 appropriation of $3.501 billion for CDF activities is 21.3% less than the FY2010 appropriation and 20.1% less than the Administration's FY2011 request. The FY2011 appropriation is 133% higher than recommended by H.R. 1. The P.L. 112-10 appropriation of $3.501 billion for the CDF account is 21.3% less than FY2010 and 20.1% less than the FY2011 request. The FY2011 appropriation is 133% higher than recommended by H.R. 1. Included in the CDF account is the CDBG program, which includes formula-based grants awarded to various entities. The CDF account includes formula-based grants for Puerto Rico, the 50 states, entitlement communities, insular areas, and Indian tribes. P.L. 112-10 reduced funding for CDBG formula grants by 16.4% and for Sustainable Communities Initiative activities by 33%. H.R. 1, Full Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011, was passed by the House on February 19, 2011. The House passed H.R. 1, reducing funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative (SCI) by 33% and the CDF account by 66.3% below the FY2010 level. Funds were prohibited from being used for earmarks and SCI. Allocation instructions for the CDBG program components were not included. The House-passed H.R. 1 reduced funding for the Sustainable Communities Initiative and the CDF account. It prohibited funds for earmarks and SCI, but did not include allocation instructions for the CDBG program components. Senator Inouye submitted an amendment to H.R. 1 for Senate consideration, which included a provision to appropriate $4.230 billion for CDF activities. The House-passed version of H.R. 1 did not provide specific allocation instructions for the CDBG program components. Senator Inouye submitted S.Amdt. 149, an amendment to H.R. 1, for Senate consideration, which included a provision to appropriate $4.230 billion for CDF activities. The amendment, defeated by a vote of 42 to 58, allocated $3.990 billion for the CDBG program, freezing funds at the FY2010 level. Additionally, insular areas would have received $7 million and Indian tribes $40 million. The Senate bill also funded the Rural Innovation Fund, University Community Fund, and SCI. The FY2011 appropriations for the formula-based components of the CDBG program totaled $3.296 billion, a decrease of 16.4% from the FY2010 level. In FY2012, allocations for entitlement communities and states were $2.942 billion, a 10.7% decline from the previous year. In FY2011, CDBG allocations totaled $3.296 billion, a 16.4% decrease from FY2010. For FY2012, allocations were $2.942 billion, a 10.7% decline from FY2011. Average grant amount for entitlement communities decreased from $2.4 million in FY2010 to $1.7 million in FY2012, a 29.1% reduction. The average grant amount for entitlement communities declined from $2.4 million in FY2010 to $1.7 million in FY2012, a 29.1% reduction. This decrease is due to lower appropriations and an increase in the number of qualifying communities. The average state allocation also decreased by 25.4%, from $23.2 million in FY2010 to $17.3 million in FY2012. Despite these reductions, they are less than the 62.5% reduction proposed in H.R. 1. The reductions in CDBG funding for FY2012 are less than the 62.5% reduction proposed in H.R. 1. The proposed reduction in funding would have significantly impacted long-term community and economic development plans, forcing states and local governments to postpone or terminate activities supporting economic development, job creation, public facilities, and services. The proposed funding reduction in H.R. 1 would impact economic development plans of states and local governments, leading to postponement or termination of activities supporting job creation, public facilities, and services. Non-profit organizations serving as CDBG sub-grantees would also see reduced resources, affecting public services like homeless shelters and job counseling. Supporters argue that the funding cut disproportionately affects low and moderate-income households. The reduction in funding for the CDBG program impacts services like homeless shelters, job counseling, and public safety activities. Supporters argue that the cut disproportionately affects low and moderate-income households. The CDBG program's formula component faces the lowest appropriation in over a decade, leading to delays and reduced support for projects in entitlement communities. FY2010-FY2012 distribution data shows the impact on states and entitlement communities. The CDBG program's formula component saw reduced support for projects in entitlement communities due to decreased allocations in FY2011 and FY2012. The distribution data for these fiscal years shows the impact on states and entitlement communities. The CDBG program's formula component saw reduced support for projects in entitlement communities with decreased allocations in FY2011 and FY2012. Allocation percentages were lowered in both fiscal years, with 70% going to cities and urban counties meeting population thresholds, and the remaining 30% distributed among the 50 states. CDBG funds are allocated to entitlement communities and states using two formulas. 70% goes to cities and urban counties meeting population thresholds, while the remaining 30% is distributed among the 50 states and Puerto Rico for small communities. The allocation of CDBG funds to entitlement communities is based on two formulas. Formula A, created in 1974, considers factors like population, poverty, and overcrowded housing for metropolitan cities and urban counties. The allocation of CDBG funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties is determined by two formulas. Formula A, established in 1974, considers factors such as population, poverty, and overcrowded housing. Formula B, introduced in 1977, uses weighted factors including population growth lag to allocate funds. The Amendments of 1977, P.L. 95-128, allocate CDBG funds to metropolitan cities and urban counties based on weighted factors like population growth lag, poverty share, and housing built before 1940. The distribution to states follows a two formula system. Formula A considers each state's relative share of factors like population and poverty. The distribution of CDBG funds to states is governed by a two formula system based on factors like population, poverty, and housing built before 1940. Formula A uses population, poverty, and overcrowded housing in nonentitlement areas, while Formula B considers poverty housing built before 1940 and persons living in poverty in all nonentitlement areas. HUD is required to use the most recent Census data for allocation. The CDBG program allocates funds based on population, poverty, and housing factors. HUD uses Census data for allocations, with updates from the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey. This allows for annual updates to reflect current data sources. HUD will use Census Bureau data from the 2010 Decennial Census and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS) five-year estimates to allocate CDBG funds, allowing for annual updates to reflect the most recent demographic changes accurately. Prior to FY2012, HUD used the 2000 Decennial Census as the data source for poverty, overcrowded housing conditions, and pre-1940 housing stock. The FY2011 allocations for CDBG funds were based on 2009 population estimates and 1960 census data. A study in December 2011 analyzed the impact of using 2010 Census and ACS data on fund allocation, assuming constant eligible entities and appropriations from FY2011 to FY2012. The study analyzed the impact of new data sources on the distribution of program funds, assuming constant eligible entities and appropriations from FY2011 to FY2012. Findings show that communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific/Hawaii regions were most negatively affected, with declines in CDBG allocations. Entitlement communities in Puerto Rico, the Mid-Atlantic, and Pacific/Hawaii regions saw a decrease in CDBG allocations due to changes in data sources. Conversely, communities in the Rocky Mountain, Great Plains, and Midwest regions experienced an increase in funding. The introduction of new data sources resulted in principal cities and urban counties receiving a larger share of funds. The introduction of new data sources led to changes in CDBG allocations, with principal cities and urban counties receiving a larger share of funds. Some regions experienced an increase in funding, while others saw a decline. Notably, New Mexico and Puerto Rico had the largest decrease in funding. The report discusses changes in CDBG funding allocations, with urban counties seeing a rise in poverty shares and principal cities receiving more pre-1940 housing. New Mexico and Puerto Rico had the largest funding decline due to decreased poverty and overcrowding shares. The report can be found at http://www.huduser.org/publications/pdf/cdbg_redis_eff.pdf, with an appendix comparing funding allocations for entitlement communities in FY2011. Appendix 2 of the report compares funding allocations for entitlement communities in FY2011. It reviews the funding history of the CDF account from FY2000 to FY2011, discussing its primary components. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of these components since FY2000. Total appropriations for the CDF account fluctuated between FY2000 and 2010, excluding special appropriations for disasters, mortgage foreclosures, and economic recovery. Total appropriations for the CDF account fluctuated between FY2000 and 2010, with the FY2011 appropriation being the lowest in over a decade. The funding level for the CDBG-formula component has been a focus of debate during recent appropriations cycles. Supporters of the program have pushed for increased funding, citing a decline in appropriations. The CDBG-formula component of the CDF account has been a focus of debate during recent appropriations cycles. Supporters of the program have advocated for increased funding due to a decline in appropriations and the increased number of communities gaining entitlement status. During FY2000 to FY2010, CDBG entitlement communities saw a 26.7% decrease in average grant allocation, leading to concerns about the program's funding justification and the need to reduce domestic discretionary spending. During FY2000 to FY2010, CDBG entitlement communities experienced a 26.7% decrease in average grant allocation due to the need to reduce domestic discretionary spending. The average allocation declined annually from FY2001 to FY2008 but has been increasing since FY2009. However, the FY2011 estimated average allocation is $1.9 million, reversing the recent trend. The average allocation for CDBG entitlement communities has been declining, with an increase in FY2010. However, the estimated average allocation for FY2011 is $1.9 million, 34.5% less than in FY2000. This decline is due to fewer dollars appropriated and an increase in the number of entitlement communities. The number of CDBG entitlement communities has increased, with a rise in direct allocations from FY2000 to FY2011. The average annual grant amount awarded to states showed less fluctuation, with $1.183 billion allocated in FY2010, a decrease from FY2000 but an increase from FY2009. In FY2010, $1.183 billion was allocated among the 50 states and Puerto Rico for distribution to nonentitlement communities, which was 7.4% less than in FY2000 but 7.6% more than in FY2009. The average state allocation declined from $25.5 million in FY2002 to $21.1 million in FY2008 before increasing to $23.2 million in FY2010. However, the FY2011 average state allocation decreased to $19.1 million, which is 23.3% less than in FY2000 and 17.7% less than in FY2010. Program funding declined in inflation-adjusted constant dollars. The FY2011 average state allocation for CDBG formula grants decreased to $19.1 million, which is 23.3% less than in FY2000 and 17.7% less than in FY2010. Program funding declined by 40% in inflation-adjusted constant dollars from $4.235 billion in FY2000 to $2.545 billion in FY2011. Appropriations for CDBG formula grants have fluctuated between $3.5 billion and $4.3 billion in current dollars over the last decade. The CDF also includes other programs with smaller appropriations and narrower objectives. The CDF, which includes the CDBG formula program, has fluctuated between $3.5 billion and $4.3 billion in current dollars over the last decade. Other programs with smaller appropriations and narrower objectives are also part of the CDF, some of which complement the larger formula grant program while others meet different agency objectives or are earmarked for specific activities. Critics argue that funding for these smaller programs has come at the expense of the CDBG formula grant program. In FY2000 to FY2011, appropriations for CDF set-aside programs varied significantly, with Congress allocating $647 million in FY2001 but only $61 million in FY2007. By FY2010, $509 million was appropriated for CDF set-aside activities, with a focus on Economic Development earmarks. In FY2000 to FY2011, appropriations for CDF set-aside programs varied significantly, with Congress allocating $647 million in FY2001 but only $61 million in FY2007. In FY2010, $509 million was appropriated for CDF set-aside activities, with a focus on Economic Development earmarks. Congress made significant changes to funding for CDF set-asides, including eliminating earmarked accounts like EDI and NI in FY2011. The swing in CDF appropriations was due to Congress's decisions to move grant programs in and out of the account, reduce funding for specific programs, and allocate funds to EDI and NI programs. CDBG-related set-asides declined by 59.4% from FY2000 to FY2008 but rebounded in FY2009 and FY2010 before declining again. See Table A-1 in the Appendix for a detailed listing of set-aside programs from FY2000 to FY2011. From FY2000 to FY2008, CDBG-related set-asides and earmarks declined by 59.4% in constant FY2000 dollars, rebounded in FY2009 and FY2010, then declined significantly in FY2011. Earmarked projects funded by the EDI and NI programs were dominant in CDBG-related set aside appropriations, except for FY2011, FY2007, and FY2010. In FY2007, Congress removed all earmarks from the CDF account, leading to new rules for disclosure of earmark requests. Since then, EDI and NI earmarks have been included in legislation appropriating funds for CDF activities. In FY2008 and FY2009, EDI and NI earmarks were the main components of CDBG-linked projects. In FY2007, Congress implemented new rules for disclosing earmark requests, including EDI and NI earmarks in funding legislation for CDF activities. In FY2008 and FY2009, these earmarks were prominent in CDBG-linked programs, with appropriations for EDI and NI being twice that of other set-aside activities combined. However, for FY2011, Congress did not allocate funds for NI and EDI earmarks. Congress has utilized the CDBG program's framework for supplemental appropriations when necessary. For FY2011, Congress did not fund NI and EDI earmarks. Congress has used the CDBG program's administrative framework for supplemental appropriations to support disaster relief, recovery, and mitigation activities, as well as to assist in reducing abandoned and foreclosed properties. The government allocated funds to assist in disaster relief, reduce abandoned properties, and support job creation in response to the economic recession under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The government allocated funds for disaster relief, reducing abandoned properties, and supporting job creation in response to the economic recession through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. CDBG disaster funding is only allocated to communities designated as disaster areas by a presidential declaration, at the discretion of Congress. Each Congress decides if the magnitude of the disaster warrants supplemental CDBG funds beyond those typically available from FEMA. Communities designated as disaster areas by a presidential declaration receive funds at Congress's discretion. Congress decides if the disaster warrants supplemental CDBG funds beyond FEMA's usual allocation. Funds for NSP-1 and NSP-3 were based on mortgage foreclosures, subprime loans, and delinquencies. Minimum grant amounts are set at 0.5% of the appropriated funds for each state. Congress established minimum grant amounts for each state based on mortgage foreclosures, subprime loans, and delinquencies. States were required to allocate funds to local governments experiencing high rates of these issues, with a minimum threshold for direct allocation to communities. This resulted in 309 communities receiving funds. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program established minimum grant amounts based on mortgage foreclosures, subprime loans, and delinquencies. Funds were allocated to communities meeting specific thresholds, with 309 communities qualifying for NSP-1 and 268 for NSP-3. NSP-2 funds were awarded competitively to various entities. Representative Gary Miller introduced the Neighborhood Stabilization Termination Act, H.R. 861 on March 1, 2011. On March 1, 2011, Representative Gary Miller introduced the Neighborhood Stabilization Termination Act, H.R. 861, which aimed to rescind $1 billion in NSP-3 funds. Subsequently, the House Financial Services Committee conducted a hearing on NSP and federal foreclosure mitigation programs, followed by the committee approving H.R. 861 on March 9, 2011. The House Financial Services Committee approved H.R. 861, which includes an amendment requiring HUD to publish a notice of termination of the NSP program on its website within five days of enactment. The notice directs citizens to contact their representatives and local officials regarding foreclosure impacts on communities. During the House Financial Services Committee hearings, Representative Miller criticized the NSP-3 program as ineffective and wasteful, calling for its funding to be rescinded due to the need to address federal debt and deficit. He argued that the program primarily benefited banks and speculators. During a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Representative Miller criticized the NSP-3 program as a waste of taxpayers' dollars, arguing for its funding to be rescinded to address the federal debt and deficit. He claimed the program mainly benefited banks and speculators. Other Members defended the program, stating it has successfully helped communities combat the negative impacts of the mortgage foreclosure crisis on neighborhoods and property values. HUD's Assistant Secretary, Mercedes M. M\u00e1rquez, testified that NSP is expected to impact 100,000 properties in the nation's hardest-hit markets. During a House Financial Services Committee hearing, HUD's Assistant Secretary, Mercedes M. M\u00e1rquez, testified that the NSP program is expected to impact 100,000 properties in the nation's hardest-hit markets, with 36,000 units already under construction. The program is estimated to support more than 93,000 jobs nationwide and help reduce the supply of abandoned, blighted, and foreclosed housing stock. The measure passed the House on March 16, 2011, by a vote of 242 to 182. NSP will support more than 93,000 jobs nationwide. The measure passed the House on March 16, 2011, by a vote of 242 to 182. A companion bill to H.R. 861 has not been introduced in the Senate."
