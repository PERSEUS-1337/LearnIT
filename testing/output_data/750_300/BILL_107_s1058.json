    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Biodiesel Renewable Fuels Act\" and includes an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding a credit for biodiesel used as fuel. The \"Biodiesel Renewable Fuels Act\" amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a biodiesel fuels credit based on the biodiesel mixture rate and the number of gallons of qualified biodiesel mixture used by a taxpayer in a taxable year. The biodiesel fuels credit for any taxpayer in a taxable year is calculated by multiplying the biodiesel mixture rate for each blend by the number of gallons of the blend used by the taxpayer. The biodiesel mixture rate varies depending on the blend, with rates of 3.0 cents for a B-2 blend and 20.0 cents for a B-20 blend. The biodiesel fuels credit rates vary for different blends: 3.0 cents for a B-2 blend and 20.0 cents for a B-20 blend. The terms B-1, B-2, and B-20 blends are defined based on the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture. The terms B-2 and B-20 blends are defined based on the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture, with B-2 containing at least 2.0 percent but less than 20 percent biodiesel, and B-20 containing at least 20 percent biodiesel. The term 'applicable amount' is used to determine the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture for qualifying as a biodiesel blend. A qualified biodiesel mixture contains at least 20 percent biodiesel. The 'applicable amount' is calculated based on the percentage of biodiesel in the blend. A qualified biodiesel mixture contains at least 20 percent biodiesel and is sold or used as a fuel in a trade or business. The applicable amount is calculated based on the percentage of biodiesel in the blend, with a denominator of 1 percent. The credit for biodiesel used in qualified mixtures is only allowed for sales or use in the taxpayer's trade or business for the taxable year. Casual off-farm production is not eligible for this credit. The credit for biodiesel in qualified mixtures is only allowed for sales or use in the taxpayer's trade or business for the taxable year.

A tax is imposed on a person who uses a biodiesel mixture other than as fuel, based on the biodiesel mixture rate and the number of gallons used. Applicable laws and penalties apply to this tax.
