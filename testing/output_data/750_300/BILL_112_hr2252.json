    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Citizens' Self-Defense Act of 2011\". The Congress finds that police are not legally liable for failing to protect individual citizens, as courts have ruled that their obligation is to the public in general. For example, in Warren v. District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, the court stated that municipalities providing police services do not have a duty to protect individuals. The court in Department, 444 A.2d 1 (D.C. App. 1981) stated that municipalities providing police services have a duty only to the public at large, not to individual community members. Former Florida Attorney General Jim Smith reported that police only responded to 200,000 out of 700,000 calls for help to Dade County authorities. The United States Department of Justice also found... Florida legislators reported that police responded to only 200,000 out of 700,000 calls for help to Dade County authorities. The United States Department of Justice found that in 1989, there were 168,881 crimes of violence for which police had not responded within 1 hour. Additionally, every year, more than 2,400,000 people in the United States use a gun to defend themselves against criminals. Every year, over 2.4 million people in the United States use guns to defend themselves, with 192,000 cases involving women protecting themselves from sexual abuse. 92 percent of these self-defense incidents do not result in any harm. In self-defense incidents involving guns, 92 percent of the time, citizens only brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off attackers. Less than 8 percent of the time, a citizen kills or wounds their attacker. Law-abiding citizens are often prosecuted for using firearms in self-defense. For example, in 2001, a grand jury ruled on a case. In 2001, a grand jury ruled on the case of 2 brothers who used firearms to protect their lives and livelihood in a fatal shooting in Reisterstown, Maryland. The grand jury decided not to press criminal charges as the brothers had encountered several burglaries at their concrete business.

The injured men were charged with burglary, and 2 others were also charged in connection with previous burglaries at the warehouse.

In a separate incident in 2008, a store clerk in Waukegan, Illinois, shot and injured a robber, potentially facing criminal charges. In 2008, a Waukegan, Illinois store clerk shot and injured a robber, facing potential criminal charges for acting in self-defense without a firearm owner's identification card. Illinois law prohibits employees from carrying guns in a place of business unless they are the owner. In September 2009, a Lithonia homeowner from Dekalb County, Georgia, was charged with aggravated assault for shooting someone trying to break into his home. The law in Illinois only allows individuals with ownership or proprietary interest to carry a gun in a place of business.

Law-abiding citizens using firearms to protect themselves from violent felons should not face lawsuits from the felons. The right to obtain firearms for security and use them in defense of self, family, or home is protected by law. (a) Reaffirmation of Right.--A person not prohibited from receiving a firearm by section 922(g) of title 18, United States Code, shall have the right to obtain firearms for security and to use firearms in self-defense, defense of family against imminent threats, and defense of home during the commission of a felony by another person.
