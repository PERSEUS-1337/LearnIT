    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Personal Health Investment Today Act\" or the \"PHIT Act.\" Congress finds that almost 20 percent of American children aged 2 to 19 are overweight or obese, leading to increased healthcare costs and higher prevalence of expensive illnesses. The World Health Organization suggests that investing in physical activity can help address this issue. Between 1987 and 2001, Americans saw a 27% increase in per capita healthcare costs. The World Health Organization found that a $1 investment in physical activity could save $3.20 in medical expenses. Research shows that financial incentives could motivate 2 in 5 Americans to be more active. The US ranks last in preventing obesity-related deaths, highlighting the importance of physical activity from a young age. The purpose of this Act is to promote health and prevent disease, particularly related to obesity, by encouraging healthier lifestyles and providing financial incentives to ease the burden of healthy behavior. Engaging in physical activities at a young age can significantly impact long-term health. To prevent disease, particularly related to obesity, the Act aims to encourage healthier lifestyles, offer financial incentives for healthy behavior, and increase access to physical fitness activities. Certain amounts paid for physical activity, fitness, and exercise are treated as amounts paid for medical care under SEC. 3. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 includes adding a new subparagraph for qualified sports and fitness expenses. This defines qualified sports and fitness expenses as amounts paid for membership at a fitness facility. Qualified sports and fitness expenses include payments for fitness facility membership, participation in physical exercise programs, and equipment for physical activity. The overall dollar limitation for qualified sports and fitness expenses is $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for joint filers or heads of household. A fitness facility is defined as a facility for physical exercise or activity. The term 'fitness facility' is defined as a facility providing physical exercise instruction or facilities for physical fitness development, not including private clubs. The term 'fitness facility' is a facility for physical fitness development, excluding private clubs, that complies with state and federal regulations. The text chunk discusses the treatment of exercise videos and materials related to physical exercise in compliance with state and federal anti-discrimination laws. Amounts paid for sports and fitness equipment must be used exclusively for fitness, exercise, sports, or physical activity programs to be considered a qualified expense. Amounts paid for sports and fitness equipment must be used exclusively for fitness, exercise, sports, or physical activity programs, with a limit of $250 for sports equipment. Amounts paid for sports and fitness equipment, up to $250, must be used for fitness, exercise, sports, or physical activity programs. Rules apply to programs with components other than physical exercise, treating travel and accommodations as additional components. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act."
