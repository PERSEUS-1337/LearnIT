    "content": "The 112th Congress is considering legislative proposals to limit the government's risk from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises responsible for nearly half of the nation's outstanding residential mortgage debt. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac faced capital inadequacy due to increased mortgage defaults and foreclosures, leading to the U.S. Department of the Treasury purchasing over $175 billion of special preferred stock to support the mortgage markets during the financial crisis. The U.S. Department of the Treasury purchased over $175 billion of special preferred stock to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the 2008 financial crisis. Treasury and the Federal Reserve also provided mortgage market support by purchasing nearly $1.4 trillion in MBS. Treasury's purchase of preferred stock includes contracts requiring the enterprises to pay a 10% cash dividend annually. The enterprises' survival without continued Treasury support is uncertain. The U.S. Department of the Treasury purchased over $175 billion in preferred stock to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the 2008 financial crisis. Legislation may reduce the enterprises' size and increase their cost of doing business, potentially leading to lower mortgage prices and higher interest rates for borrowers. One category of proposed legislation, such as H.R. 1222, would increase the cost of doing business for enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This could result in lower mortgage prices and higher interest rates for borrowers. Another group of bills, like H.R. 1227, would impose new limitations on the types of mortgages the enterprises can purchase, allowing more competition in the market. Some bills, including H.R. 31 and H.R. 1225, aim to increase regulatory oversight and disclosure. The proposed legislative changes aim to increase regulatory oversight, disclosure, and capital requirements for enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Additionally, there are proposals to limit the types of mortgages they can purchase, set deadlines for returning to stockholder control, and require filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC would eliminate a competitive advantage for enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, requiring them to follow the same rules as competitors. Legislative proposals include setting deadlines for returning to stockholder control or dissolution, phasing out charters, and replacing the enterprises in secondary mortgage markets. In the 112th Congress, legislative proposals were introduced to address the financial difficulties of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including setting deadlines for returning to stockholder control or dissolution and replacing the enterprises in the secondary mortgage markets. In September 2008, both enterprises entered voluntary conservatorship under the Federal Housing Finance Agency. In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered voluntary conservatorship under the Federal Housing Finance Agency, with the Treasury providing financial support to keep them solvent. Homeowners and potential homeowners indirectly rely on them for mortgage money. The enterprises purchase mortgages from lenders, package them into MBS, and either keep them in portfolio or sell them. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages from lenders and package them into MBS, providing a guarantee for repayment. They back almost half of the nation's home mortgages. The Obama Administration's report presents three alternatives for the future of the enterprises and the housing finance system. The Obama Administration's report outlines three alternatives for the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which back almost half of the nation's home mortgages. These alternatives include a privatized system with government mortgage programs targeted towards specific groups, a privatized system with government guarantee only during crises, and a privatized system with government reinsurance of private mortgage insurance. No legislation has been introduced to implement these alternatives yet. The Obama Administration's report outlines three alternatives for the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including a privatized system with government mortgage programs targeted towards specific groups, a privatized system with government guarantee only during crises, and a privatized system with government reinsurance of private mortgage insurance. No legislation has been introduced to implement these alternatives yet. The report discusses proposals for reforming America's housing finance market, including legislation introduced in the 112th Congress. Most bills focus on specific areas like executive compensation, while some companion bills aim to reform multiple areas. One bill, H.R. 31, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Accountability and Transparency for Taxpayers Act of 2011, would require the director to make changes to the enterprises' operations. H.R. 31, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Accountability and Transparency for Taxpayers Act of 2011, would require the director of FHFA to make quarterly reports on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 12 specific areas, including total liabilities, executive compensation, foreclosure mitigation efforts, and mortgage fraud prevention efforts.

The reports must also cover underwriting standards, mortgage buyback policies, and actions affecting enterprise securities, with additional relevant information as deemed necessary. The FHFA inspector general will review the reports and inform Congress of findings, with all information to be posted on the FHFA website. Additionally, the IG will examine FHFA's loss mitigation policies. The bill requires the FHFA inspector general to review reports on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including loss mitigation policies and the impact of principal reduction on financial condition. The IG's findings will be shared with Congress and posted on the FHFA website, with some overlap in reporting requirements with current reports.

The Dodd-Frank Act requires joint regulations to implement risk retention requirements for mortgages in MBS, with QRMs exempt. H.R. 1223 was marked up by the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. Under Dodd-Frank, QRMs would be exempt from the risk retention requirement. The Federal Reserve's general counsel testified that the enterprises' guarantees do not satisfy the risk retention requirements of the proposed rules. The enterprises' guarantees of timely payment on their MBS may not satisfy risk retention rules, but could be allowed if they are in conservatorship or receivership.

Companion bills H.R. 1182 and S. 693 follow the same schedule, while H.R. 408 and S. 178 propose a four-year reduction. Table 2 compares the current portfolio caps. The companion bills H.R. 1182 and S. 693, along with H.R. 408 and S. 178, propose reducing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's portfolios over four to five years. H.R. 1224 excludes delinquent mortgages repurchased to meet guarantees from portfolio limits. FHFA, as regulator, could mandate portfolio reductions for the enterprises. The House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises marked up H.R. 1224 and forwarded it to the full committee.
