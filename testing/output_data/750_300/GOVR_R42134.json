    "content": "Risk adjustment is the process of adjusting payments to health insurance plans based on differences in the risk characteristics of enrollees. For example, if the cost of providing healthcare benefits to women is $100 more than men, insurers may be paid $100 more for women to level the playing field. One way to level the playing field in health insurance is to risk adjust payments to insurers by paying them $100 more for women than for men. This would make insurers indifferent between enrolling men or women into their plan, considering factors like age and expected health expenditures. Insurers should be indifferent between enrolling men or women into their plan, as health care costs vary by factors like age, geography, health status, and family size. Risk adjustment models aim to account for these factors but do not fully explain differences in expected health care spending. The report discusses how CMS pays private health plans under Medicare Advantage and how payments are risk adjusted. The report discusses how CMS pays private health plans under Medicare Advantage, including risk adjustment for differences in expected health care spending. Medicare Advantage offers private plan options for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Parts A and B. MA payments and potential issues with risk adjustment and audits are associated with Medicare Advantage, which provides private plan options for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Parts A and B. Health plans receive capitated monthly payments adjusted for demographics and health status of enrolled beneficiaries, regardless of the services used. Plans are at risk if costs exceed payments, but can retain profits otherwise. The Medicare Advantage plan receives monthly payments based on the estimated cost of providing benefits, with the plan being at risk if costs exceed payments. The bid includes administrative costs and is compared to the maximum amount the government will pay for services in the plan's service area. The Medicare Advantage plan receives monthly payments based on bids reflecting the plan's estimate of covering an average beneficiary. CMS sets a benchmark, and plans receive payments based on whether their bid is above or below the benchmark. Payment adjustments are made based on the characteristics of enrolled beneficiaries. The Medicare Advantage plan receives payments based on bids compared to a benchmark. CMS adjusts payments based on the characteristics of enrolled beneficiaries, using factors like age and health history. The current MA risk adjustment methodology adjusts payments to plans based on demographic and health factors of enrollees. CMS estimates next year's healthcare expenditures using beneficiary characteristics from the current year, such as age and gender. The CMS determines risk adjustment for MA plan payments based on beneficiary demographic and health factors, including age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and disability. Data on how beneficiaries became eligible for Medicare is also considered. Administrative sources provide accurate and stable data for these variables. Incorporating health status into payments is a more complex process. The CMS uses administrative data to determine risk adjustment for MA plan payments based on beneficiary demographic and health factors. Health status is incorporated into payments through ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes submitted by physicians for Medicare reimbursement. ICD-9-CM codes are used by physicians for Medicare reimbursement. There are over 13,000 codes organized into diagnostic groups and condition categories. The codes have a hierarchy where only the most significant manifestation of a disease is coded for payment purposes. The ICD-9-CM codes have a hierarchy imposed on them, with only the most significant manifestation of a disease being coded for payment purposes. For example, Ischemic Heart Disease codes are organized into the Coronary Artery Disease hierarchy, consisting of four condition categories arranged by clinical severity and cost. A person with a code in one category is excluded from being coded in others, even if codes that group into those categories were also present. The ICD-9-CM codes are hierarchically organized, with only the most costly form of the disease being coded for reimbursement. There are 189 hierarchical condition codes, but only 70 are used in the current CMS model, which are chronic codes that best predict the disease. Coding ensures that the most costly form of the disease dictates reimbursement, with 70 HCC codes currently used in the CMS model. In 2012, 87 HCC codes will be incorporated, as shown in Table B-1. Figure 2 illustrates the conversion of ICD-9-CM codes to HCC codes for predicting Medicare expenditures. Figure 2 shows how ICD-9-CM codes are converted into HCC codes for predicting Medicare expenditures. It demonstrates the conversion for a 76-year-old female with various diagnosed conditions, indicating that not all diagnoses result in an HCC code. Not all diagnoses result in an HCC code. For example, a woman's HCC code for acute myocardial infarction implies she is not coded with HCC 83 despite also being diagnosed with unspecified angina pectoris. Some conditions like chest pain and ankle sprain map to HCCs but are excluded from the CMS model as they are not chronic. Short-term illnesses, even if costly, are not captured in the models predicting next year's expenditures. Some conditions like chest pain and ankle sprain are excluded from the CMS model as they are not chronic. Short-term illnesses, even if costly, are not captured in the models predicting next year's expenditures. The model uses the highest code in a related disease category and codes across unrelated categories, making it additive. Table 1 shows the risk factors estimated for each condition, with a hypothetical total risk score of 1.583 for a 76-year-old female. The model is additive, using codes across unrelated disease categories. Table 1 depicts risk factors for each condition, with a hypothetical total risk score of 1.583 for a 76-year-old female. The risk score is multiplied by the MA plan's base rate to determine the risk-adjusted base payment, resulting in an estimated annual payment of $11,810. The presence of two or more conditions can result in greater costs due to interaction effects. For example, health care costs for an individual with diabetes and congestive heart failure are higher than expected from just adding the costs of each condition. Health care costs for individuals with multiple conditions can be higher than expected due to interaction effects. For example, those with both diabetes and congestive heart failure incur costs that exceed the sum of each condition's costs. Additionally, individuals with disabilities and diabetes also experience higher health care costs than predicted. These interaction effects have been incorporated into the CMS-HCC model for adjusting payments to MA plans. The CMS-HCC model adjusts payments to MA plans based on interaction effects between different health conditions and demographic variables. This linear regression model predicts expenditures using diagnoses (CMS-HCCs) and includes variables representing interactions between certain diseases. The CMS-HCC model is a linear regression model that predicts expenditures based on diagnoses and demographic variables, including interactions between certain diseases and permanent disability. The model uses actual claims data for Medicare Parts A and B, with relative risk factors periodically recalculated using updated claims data. The CMS-HCC model predicts healthcare costs based on diagnoses and demographic variables using Medicare claims data. Risk scores are standardized to reflect average, below average, or above average costs, with a score of 1.2 indicating 20% higher costs. The CMS-HCC model uses risk scores to predict healthcare costs for Medicare beneficiaries. These scores can be standardized to reflect different cost levels, with 1 equating to below average costs and above 1 equating to above average costs. This allows CMS to adjust payments to plans based on individual health status and demographics. The CMS-HCC model uses risk scores to adjust payments to Medicare Advantage plans based on individual health status and demographics. The goal is to reflect the likely costs that a plan should incur in treating a similarly situated beneficiary. Risk scores are attributed to MA enrollees to estimate adjustments to payments. The discussion explains how CMS estimates payment adjustments for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries based on risk scores. New enrollees without 12 months of Part B eligibility have rates determined by age, sex, Medicaid status, and original reason for Medicare entitlement, not diagnoses. CMS collects information from Medicare Advantage plans to update the risk score of beneficiaries. Historically, diagnostic information was mainly provided by physician claims. CMS is transitioning from RAPS to EDPS for updating beneficiary risk scores in Medicare Advantage plans. Data from physician claims, inpatient/outpatient facilities, and encounter level data with ICD-9-CM codes are used. Risk scores are adjusted twice a year on January 1 and July 1. The risk scores and payments in Medicare Advantage plans are updated twice a year on January 1 and July 1. Data from physician claims, inpatient/outpatient facilities, and encounter level data with ICD-9-CM codes are used for this purpose. The data used for risk-adjusted payments are always from the prior 12-month period, and errors in age, gender, disability status, Medicaid eligibility, or disease can impact the calculation. The risk-adjusted Medicare Advantage payments are adjusted twice a year based on data from various sources. Errors in age, gender, disability status, Medicaid eligibility, or disease can affect the payment calculation. Plans are responsible for providing accurate health status information to CMS for audit purposes. CMS audits Medicare Advantage plans to ensure that risk-adjusted payments are supported by medical records (RADV audits). Previously, audits only sought to recover errors in payments for sampled enrollees, but in February 2011, the President's FY2011 expanded the scope of audits. In February 2011, CMS proposed to extrapolate RADV error rates to entire plan contracts for the year, aiming for $2.27 billion in savings over five years. The final notice of payment error calculation methodology was released in February 2012. In December 2010, CMS proposed auditing Medicare Advantage plan data and extrapolating payment errors. The final notice in February 2012 stated audits will be conducted at the contract level, potentially leading to recoveries that could be problematic for some Part C plans. Plans may push back against larger recovery amounts. CMS is conducting audits at the contract level to potentially recover larger dollar amounts from Medicare Advantage plans. This process includes sampling, medical record review, and error rate calculation/payment adjustment. The sample size of 201 enrollees has been determined to be sufficient. CMS conducts audits at the contract level to recover funds from Medicare Advantage plans through sampling and review of 201 enrollees. Enrollees must meet specific criteria to be included in the sample. Enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans must meet specific criteria to be included in audits conducted by CMS at the contract level. Criteria include continuous enrollment in the same MA contract for 12 months, non-ESRD status, non-hospice status, full Medicare Part B coverage for 12 months, and diagnosis of at least one risk adjustment condition leading to CMS-HCC assignment. During the data collection period, eligible enrollees are divided into three equal groups based on the total number of eligible enrollees. The first group consists of 67 eligible enrollees with the highest risk scores, randomly drawn. The second group also consists of 67 enrollees. During data collection, eligible enrollees are divided into three equal groups based on risk scores. Each group consists of 67 randomly selected enrollees. Sampling weights ensure representation of each group. The eligible enrollees are divided into three equal groups based on risk scores, with each group representing high, medium, and low strata. Sampling weights are used to randomly select enrollees from each group, with a weight of 14.925 assigned to each sampled enrollee. These weights are then used to scale-up the sample payment error findings to the entire population it represents. The enrollee sampling weights of 14.925 are used to scale-up the sample payment error findings to the population. MA plans are required to provide evidence from medical records for audited enrollees within 12 weeks. The MA plans have 12 weeks to provide medical records for audited enrollees to substantiate HCC codes for payment. If the records confirm the diagnosis, the payment is justified; if not, it is considered an error. Plans can appeal findings to CMS for review. The CMS allows MA plans to appeal payment errors based on diagnosis findings. The final decision is binding unless a review is requested by the CMS Administrator. Payment errors can result in either overpayment or underpayment, with underpayments needing to be supported by the initial medical record. The review is based on the first medical record that validates the audited CMS-HCC. Underpayments must be supported by the initial medical record, as additional records cannot justify them. Enrollee-level payment errors are corrected based on supported HCCs, with payment errors defined as the difference between original and corrected payments. The RADV medical record review corrects payment errors for each sampled enrollee based on supported HCCs. Payment errors are the difference between original and corrected payments, either positive (overpayment) or negative (underpayment). Errors are calculated per enrollee for the months enrolled in the MA contract, not including ESRD or hospice. Total payment errors for each MA contract are derived from sampled enrollees. The estimated payment error for each MA contract is calculated based on the weighted enrollee payment errors, which are summed across all sampled enrollees. The payment recovery amount for each audited MA contract is determined by the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval around the payment error estimate. The estimated payment error for each MA contract is calculated based on weighted enrollee payment errors, summed across all sampled enrollees. The payment recovery amount for audited MA contracts is determined by the lower bound of the 99% confidence interval around the payment error estimate, modified by a fee-for-service adjuster. This adjuster addresses methodological concerns raised by the American Academy of Actuaries. Figure 4 illustrates the payment error calculation. The risk adjustment model used in the audit process addresses concerns raised by the American Academy of Actuaries. Payment errors for each enrollee are calculated and extrapolated to the contract by weighting and adjusting for time in the plan. The audit process calculates payment errors for each enrollee, extrapolates them to the contract by weighting and adjusting for time in the plan. The estimated plan level error across all enrollees is $1,187.50 with a 99% confidence interval from $1,037.50 to $1,337.50. The estimated plan error is calculated with a 99% certainty that the actual error in payment will fall within the confidence interval of $1,037.50 to $1,337.50. If the interval includes $0 or is below $0, the recovery amount would be $0. If not, a fee-for-service adjuster modifies the lower bound to determine the reimbursement amount to the government. The RADV audit results in no additional payment to MA plans. Concerns have been raised about risk adjustment under Medicare Advantage. Recent academic studies and preliminary research by MedPAC have raised concerns about risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage. Medicare reimburses plans based on the average cost of treating beneficiaries with the same HCC code. Plans may reduce efforts to screen enrollees along included dimensions while increasing efforts along excluded dimensions. Recent studies and MedPAC have raised concerns about risk adjustment in Medicare Advantage plans. Plans may enroll beneficiaries with below average costs to experience lower expenses while being reimbursed at average rates. MedPAC and stakeholders are concerned about Medicare Advantage plans potentially enrolling high-cost individuals but being reimbursed for average-cost enrollees. Stakeholders have also raised concerns about the audit process, with the American Academy of Actuaries responding to CMS's proposed RADV sampling. The American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) expressed concerns about the audit process in response to CMS's proposed RADV sampling and error calculation methodology. They are skeptical about improving the risk adjustment model, highlighting that the Medicare fee-for-service data used for risk adjustments were never validated and may contain errors. The methodology was criticized for estimating payment errors instead of adjusting premiums, potentially leading to premiums that do not reflect the actual risk profiles of enrollees. The American Academy of Actuaries raised concerns about the inconsistency in the audit process for CMS's proposed RADV sampling and error calculation methodology. They noted that the Medicare fee-for-service data used for risk adjustments were never validated, potentially leading to premiums that do not accurately reflect the risk profiles of enrollees. The concern is that the risk adjustment factors were developed without validation, creating a discrepancy in how they were developed and how they are now being applied. The CMS-HCC risk adjustment factors were developed with FFS data that were not validated for accuracy. The proposed audit process would apply these factors only to MA data that are validated, creating a discrepancy in data used for payment error determination and risk adjustment model development. The RADV audit uses different data than the risk adjustment model, potentially leading to inadequate payments if lower-cost enrollees are no longer considered diabetic. This discrepancy could result in understated risk scores for certain conditions. The risk score factor associated with diabetes may be understated due to lower-cost patients lowering average spending amounts in FFS data. This inconsistency could lead to systematic underpayment and payment inequities in the risk adjustment system. The Health Practice Council is concerned about data inconsistency leading to underpayment and payment inequities in the risk adjustment system, potentially affecting the accuracy of plan bids and premium payments for MA plans. Extrapolating RADV payment-error calculations to adjust premium payments represents a significant change in the risk adjustment methodology. The Health Practice Council is concerned about potential underpayment and payment inequities in the risk adjustment system for MA plans. Adjusting premium payments using RADV payment-error calculations is a significant change in the methodology, but the final calculation methodology includes a fee-for-service adjustment to address concerns about reflecting the relative risk profile of enrollees. The fee-for-service adjuster is intended to address concerns about the risk adjustment system for Medicare Advantage plans. Some plans worry that using Medicare fee-for-service data for risk adjustment coefficients may lead to under or overcompensation. RADV audits may also pose financial risks for some plans. Some Medicare Advantage plans are concerned about using Medicare fee-for-service data to generate risk adjustment coefficients, as it may lead to financial risks from RADV audits. The Secretary's approach to addressing methodological concerns in risk adjustment implementation is still uncertain. Risk adjustment models for Medicare private plan payments have evolved over time, with increasing complexity and explanatory power. Table A-1 displays the different models used, the corresponding years of use, and the percentage of variation in individual expenditures predicted by each model (R2). The R2 is a measure of how well risk adjustment models explain variations in individual Medicare beneficiary expenditures, ranging from $0 for healthy individuals to hundreds of thousands for ill beneficiaries. These models predict spending based on beneficiary characteristics. The R2 quantifies how well risk adjustment models explain variations in Medicare beneficiary expenditures, ranging from healthy individuals to very ill beneficiaries. The models predict spending based on beneficiary characteristics, with the AAPCC model having an R2 of 0.0077, explaining 0.77% of expenditure variation. Each subsequent model used by CMS has increased the percentage of variation explained. The AAPCC model predicts expenditures with an R2 of 0.0077, explaining 0.77% of the variation. Subsequent models by CMS have increased the explained variation, with the most recent model able to explain approximately 12.5% of expenditures. Adjusted Average Per Capita Cost (AAPCC) was used prior to payment year 2000 for risk adjustment in Medicare programs. Adjusted Average Per Capita Cost (AAPCC) was used for risk adjustment in Medicare programs before 2000, incorporating demographic variables like age, sex, Medicaid enrollment, institutionalized status, and working aged status. These factors explained less than 1% of expenditure variation. The demographic data of Medicare beneficiaries over 65 with employer-sponsored insurance explain less than 1% of expenditure variation. Private plan enrollees were healthier than original Medicare enrollees, leading to higher payments. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required CMS to implement a risk adjustment methodology. Private plan enrollees were healthier than original Medicare enrollees, resulting in higher payments. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated CMS to implement a risk adjustment methodology, leading to the use of the Principal Inpatient Diagnostic Cost Group (PIP-DCG) model from 2000 to 2003. The Principal Inpatient Diagnostic Cost Group (PIP-DCG) model considered the worst principal inpatient diagnosis for hospital admissions. It explained more Medicare expenditure variation than the demographic-only model but had limitations. Illnesses with high costs not resulting in hospital admissions were not included, and efforts to reduce admissions could lead to lower payments. The model was to be phased-in. Starting in 2004, Medicare plan payments were adjusted by the CMS-HCC model, which includes information from various healthcare settings to determine payments for Medicare Advantage plans. The PIP-DCG model, while effective in explaining Medicare expenditure variation, had limitations as it did not account for illnesses with high costs that did not result in hospital admissions. Efforts to reduce hospital admissions could potentially lead to lower risk-adjusted payments for Medicare Advantage organizations. Subsequent legislation maintained a phase-in schedule of 90% demographic-only method and 10% PIP-DCG method through 2003 to mitigate the financial impact of risk adjustment on M+C organizations. The CMS-HCC model, implemented in 2004, adjusts Medicare plan payments based on severity of illness, accumulated effects of multiple diseases, and interactive effects. It considers information from various healthcare settings to determine payments for Medicare Advantage plans. The CMS-HCC model, implemented in 2004, adjusts Medicare plan payments based on severity of illness, accumulated effects of multiple diseases, and interactive effects. It explains nearly 10% of the variation in beneficiary expenditures and is updated annually to reflect changes in diagnosis codes and recalibrated with recent data. The CMS-HCC model is updated annually to reflect changes in diagnosis codes and recalibrated with recent data. Version 12 and Version 21 of the model include updates to diagnosis codes and recalibration with more recent data, with Version 21 undergoing a major clinical revision in 2009. Version 21 of the CMS-HCC model underwent a major clinical revision in 2009 to adjust for changes in disease patterns, treatment methods, and coding practices. This update increased the predictive power of the model to approximately 12.5% and is set to be implemented in 2012 for PACE plans."
