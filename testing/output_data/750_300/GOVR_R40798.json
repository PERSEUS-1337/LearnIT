    "content": "The unemployment rate, as defined by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, is the percentage of unemployed individuals in the civilian labor force age 16 and older. Unemployment is the number of people actively seeking work in the four weeks before the Current Population Survey. Mathematically, the unemployment rate is calculated as the number of unemployed individuals divided by the labor force. The unemployment rate is the number of people actively searching for work in the four weeks before the Current Population Survey. It can fluctuate based on changes in the number of jobless workers and the size of the labor force, which may decrease during a recession as discouraged workers stop looking for jobs. During a recession, the size of the labor force may decrease as unemployed workers give up searching for jobs out of discouragement. Conversely, the number of labor force participants may increase if people see signs of economic improvement. The unemployment rate is a lagging economic indicator that typically improves after other indicators signal an impending recovery. During a recession, discouraged workers may reenter the labor force, causing the unemployment rate to rise despite positive economic news. The unemployment rate is a lagging economic indicator that improves after other indicators signal recovery. Firms are hesitant to hire until they are confident in sustained economic growth. During a recession, employers may boost production by increasing hours for current employees or having them work overtime instead of hiring new workers. Job growth may not immediately follow signs of economic turnaround. Labor market analysts rely on the Current Employment Statistics program for job data from nonfarm employers. The Current Employment Statistics program is a key source of job data used by labor market analysts to determine economic trends. Employers provide more accurate information on job numbers compared to household surveys. The Business Cycle Dating Committee uses data from this program to identify the start and end of recessions. The Business Cycle Dating Committee relies on changes in national output and employment trends from the Current Employment Statistics program to determine recessions. The U.S. economy has had 10 recessions since World War II, with varying severity in GDP decline and duration. Unemployment rates consistently increased during and after each recession, peaking at the bottom of the business cycle in some instances. The U.S. economy has experienced 10 recessions since World War II, with varying severity in GDP decline and duration. Unemployment rates consistently increased during and after each recession, peaking at the bottom of the business cycle in some instances. The unemployment rate peaked at 7.9% in October 1949, 7.8% in July 1980, and 10.8% in November 1982. In the remaining recessions, the unemployment rate continued to climb even after the recession had ended. The unemployment rate continued to climb for a few months after several recessions ended, peaking at different times during the economic recovery. In contrast, in three instances, the unemployment rate did not peak until well into the recovery period. Employment data generally followed a similar pattern. After the end of 10 recessions, job growth did not immediately follow, with employment levels fluctuating for months. Only in the short January-July 1980 recession did job growth start immediately. After the end of 10 recessions, job growth did not immediately follow, with employment levels fluctuating for months. Sustained job growth occurred within three to five months of the start of seven recoveries, but in the cases of the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions, steady job growth was delayed, leading to jobless rebounds in the economy. The delayed improvement in the labor market after the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions led to jobless recoveries. While private sector employment started to rise in January 2010, fiscal issues in local governments have slowed down the recovery. Despite the end of the recession, many believe the nation is facing another jobless recovery. Private sector employment began to increase in January 2010, but overall job growth has been hindered by fiscal problems in local governments."
