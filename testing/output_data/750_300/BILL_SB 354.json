    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 7522.02 of the Government Code is amended. On January 1, 2013, this article applies to all state and local public retirement systems and their participating employers, including various specific systems and individual retirement plans offered by public employers. The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 applies to independent public retirement systems and individual retirement plans offered by public employers, subject to the Internal Revenue Code and Section 17 of Article XVI of the California Constitution. Compliance with applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and Revenue and Taxation Code is required for administering the requirements of this article. The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 applies to public retirement systems and individual plans offered by public employers, subject to specific constitutional and statutory provisions. However, certain entities exempt from this law are not affected by it, including those outlined in the California Constitution. The County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 applies to public retirement systems and individual plans offered by public employers, subject to specific constitutional and statutory provisions. However, certain entities exempt from this law are not affected by it, including those outlined in the California Constitution. Additionally, a public employee's interests protected under Section 5333(b) of Title 49 of the United States Code are exempt from this law until a federal district court rules otherwise or until January 1, 2016. If a federal district court upholds the Secretary of Labor's determination that this law precludes certification under Section 5333(b) of Title 49, it does not apply to certain public employees. Additionally, the law does not apply to a multiemployer plan regulated by ERISA if the public employer joined before January 1, 2013. The benefit plan under this article applies to new public employees as defined in Section 7522.04. Individuals who switched public employers after January 1, 2013, will follow the retirement plan of their new employer if they had concurrent membership or reciprocity within the previous six months. Individuals who changed employment positions before January 1, 2013, and switched to a different defined benefit plan in another public retirement system offered by their employer will be subject to the new plan as if they were first employed before December 31, 2012. If a public employer offered a defined benefit pension plan with a lower benefit factor before January 1, 2013, they can continue with that plan instead of the new required formula. However, any new formula adopted after January 1, 2013, must comply with the new requirements or be certified by the retirement system's chief. If a public employer adopts a new defined benefit formula after January 1, 2013, it must meet the requirements of this article or be certified by the retirement system's chief actuary and approved by the Legislature. New members can only join the lower cost defined benefit formula in place before 2013 or an approved formula. New members of the defined benefit plan must join the lower cost formula in place before January 1, 2013, or an approved formula by the Legislature. If a public employer offers a retirement benefit plan consisting solely of a defined contribution plan before January 1, 2013, they can continue with that plan instead of the defined benefit pension plan required by this article. However, if they adopt a new defined benefit pension plan or formula on or after January 1, 2013, it must meet the requirements of this article or be certified by the retirement system's chief actuary and board to have no greater risk or cost to the employer than the required formula. The new members of the employer's plan must adhere to the approved formula by the Legislature. The employer's retirement plan must be approved by the Legislature and certified by the retirement system's chief actuary and board to have no greater risk or cost than the defined benefit formula required by the article. New members can only participate in a defined contribution plan that meets the requirements of the article. This does not prevent the employer from offering a defined contribution plan with or without a defined benefit plan after January 1, 2013. The employer can offer a defined contribution plan after January 1, 2013, with or without a defined benefit plan, as long as it meets the requirements of the article. If the Cities of Brea and Fullerton form a joint powers authority after January 1, 2013, they can provide employees with the same defined benefit plan they had before joining the authority. This applies to employees from the City of Brea, City of Fullerton, or other specified cities who are not new members and are hired by the joint powers authority within 180 days of the common power being exercised. Employees from specified cities can receive the same defined benefit plan if they join a joint powers authority within 180 days of the common power being exercised. On or before January 1, 2017, a city in Orange County contiguous to Brea or Fullerton may join the joint powers authority, with a limit of three cities. New members joining after January 1, 2013, must adhere to the requirements of the defined benefit plan. On or before January 1, 2017, a city in Orange County contiguous to Brea or Fullerton may join the joint powers authority, with a limit of three cities. New members joining after January 1, 2013, must adhere to the requirements of the defined benefit plan. The Judges\u2019 Retirement System and the Judges\u2019 Retirement System II are exempt from certain defined benefit formula and compensation limitations. Public retirement systems must modify their plans to comply with the article's requirements by January 1, 2013."
