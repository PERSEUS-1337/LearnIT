    "content": "The Trump Administration requested $76.2 billion for the Department of Transportation (DOT) for FY2019, proposing significant cuts in funding for various programs. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for DOT in the FY2019 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $87.8 billion for the Department of Transportation in the FY2019 appropriations bill, an increase of 1.8% over the previous year. The Senate passed a bill providing $86.6 billion for DOT, slightly above the previous year's amount. The FY2019 THUD appropriations bill would provide $86.6 billion in new budget authority for the Department of Transportation, slightly above the previous year's amount and 14% higher than the Administration request. The House committee bill would result in level inflation-adjusted funding for DOT compared to FY2018, while the Senate bill may lead to a slight reduction in inflation-adjusted funding. The Department of Transportation's funding is unique compared to other federal agencies, with most of its funding coming from trust funds. Roughly two-thirds to three-fourths of its funding is mandatory budget authority, while one-third to one-fourth is discretionary. This results in a slight reduction in inflation-adjusted funding compared to FY2018 levels. The Department of Transportation's funding is primarily derived from trust funds, with around two-thirds to three-fourths being mandatory budget authority. The remaining one-third to one-fourth is discretionary funding. The Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund typically provide about 90% of the DOT's annual funding. However, in FY2018, there was a significant increase in discretionary funding, leading to a shift in the funding breakdown. In FY2018, there was a significant increase in discretionary funding for the Department of Transportation, leading to a change in the funding breakdown. Approximately 80% of DOT's funding is distributed to states, local authorities, and Amtrak in the form of grants. The Department of Transportation's funding primarily comes from trust funds supported by taxes, with grants making up 80% of the budget. The Federal Aviation Administration, responsible for air traffic control, has a budget that is not grant-based. Reauthorizations of taxes supporting trust funds and budget apportionment to DOT programs are crucial. The Department of Transportation's funding mainly comes from trust funds supported by taxes, with grants making up 80% of the budget. Reauthorizations of taxes supporting trust funds and budget apportionment to DOT programs are significant. The highway, transit, and rail programs are authorized through FY2020, while the federal aviation programs face reauthorization in 2018. DOT's nonemergency annual funding has increased from $70 billion in FY2012 to $86 billion in FY2018. The Department of Transportation's funding comes from trust funds supported by taxes, with grants making up 80% of the budget. Reauthorization of the program may impact its structure and funding level. In nominal dollars, DOT's nonemergency annual funding has risen from $70 billion in FY2012 to $86 billion in FY2018. However, adjusting for inflation, funding peaked in FY2010 at $87.5 billion and declined until FY2015, then began rising again in FY2016. Real funding was roughly the same in FY2016 and FY2017 as in FY2006, but lower than during the FY2007-FY2011 period. In FY2016, DOT's real funding was roughly the same as in FY2006, but lower than during FY2007-FY2011. FY2019 appropriations for DOT are compared to FY2018 in Table 4. Most federal highway and transit funding comes from the Highway Trust Fund, funded by the federal motor fuels excise tax. Annual expenditures from the fund have exceeded revenues for many years. Transit funding from the Highway Trust Fund, largely funded by the federal gas tax, has been facing a shortfall for many years. Congress has transferred funds from the general Treasury to keep the trust fund solvent, as the gas tax has not been raised since 1993. The Highway Trust Fund received $143 billion from the Treasury's general fund during FY2008-FY2016 to address a shortfall. The federal gas tax, unchanged since 1993, contributes 18.3 cents per gallon of gasoline and 24.3 cents per gallon of diesel, but inflation and fuel efficiency have reduced its effectiveness. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts stagnant gasoline consumption through 2024 due to increasing fuel efficiency offsetting mileage increases. This will result in Highway Trust Fund revenues of $39-41 billion annually from FY2018 to FY2027, falling short of the required amount. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects stagnant gasoline consumption through 2024, with Highway Trust Fund revenues expected to be $39-41 billion annually from FY2018 to FY2027. Congress allocated $1.5 billion for national infrastructure investment grants in FY2018, known as BUILD Transportation grants. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $750 million, while the Senate-passed bill proposed $1 billion. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $1 billion for Transportation grants in FY2018, previously known as the TIGER grant program. Last year, the DOT was forbidden from using the federal share requested as a criterion for project selection, but instead, considered an applicant's willingness to create new nonfederal revenue sources for transportation projects. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $1 billion for Transportation grants in FY2018, previously known as the TIGER grant program. The committee report prohibits DOT from using an applicant's willingness to create new nonfederal revenue sources as a selection criterion, directing it to use the selection criteria listed in the FY2016 grant process. The TIGER grant program originated in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act as a discretionary grant program addressing criticisms of federal transportation funding structure. The TIGER grant program, originating from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, aims to address criticisms of federal transportation funding by funding projects with national or regional impacts. The TIGER grant program aims to fund projects with national or regional impacts, addressing criticisms of federal transportation funding. One challenge is funding projects with costs falling largely on one or two states, like Amtrak's Gateway Program focused on the Northeast Corridor rail line. The program includes replacing a deteriorating tunnel under the Hudson River, benefiting Amtrak and New Jersey Transit. The Gateway Program aims to replace a deteriorating tunnel under the Hudson River for Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains. The $13 billion project's funding burden falls on New York and New Jersey. The BUILD program provides grants for projects of national significance in various transportation modes on a competitive basis. The BUILD program provides grants for projects of national, regional, or metropolitan-area significance in various transportation modes on a competitive basis, with funding distribution directed by Congress to be equitable across geographic areas. The BUILD program's funding is directed by Congress to be distributed equitably across geographic areas, between rural and urban areas, and among transportation modes. The program is oversubscribed, with applications exceeding available funding. Critics have argued that TIGER grants have disproportionately benefited urban areas. The BUILD/TIGER program is oversubscribed, receiving many more applications than available funding. Critics have argued that TIGER grants favored urban areas, leading Congress to direct a portion of funding to rural areas. In FY2018, Congress increased the rural funding portion to 30%, and in FY2019, the House Appropriations Committee recommended 33% for rural projects. In FY2018, Congress increased rural funding to 30%. The House Appropriations Committee recommended 33% for rural projects in FY2019. The Senate bill maintained the 30% rural portion. Funding allocation includes 33% for major seaports and 33% for urban areas over 200,000 in population. The BUILD/TIGER grant process has shown two recent patterns. In recent years, the BUILD/TIGER grant appropriation process has shown a pattern where the Obama Administration requested more funding, the House proposed cuts, the Senate proposed similar amounts to previous appropriations, and Congress ultimately agreed on a final amount similar to previous years. In FY2018, the Trump Administration requested no funding, but Congress funded the program. This pattern seems to be repeating in the current year. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program is funded through a combination of mandatory and discretionary budget authority, with an estimated $140 million for FY2019. This funding is financed by overflight fees collected from commercial airlines by the FAA. The EAS program is funded by a mandatory annual authorization of $140 million for FY2019, financed by overflight fees from commercial airlines. The Trump Administration requested $93 million in discretionary funding for FY2019, $62 million less than FY2018. The House committee bill recommended a $175 million discretionary appropriation, $20 million more than FY2018. The Trump Administration requested $93 million for the EAS program in FY2019, $62 million less than FY2018. The House committee bill recommended $175 million, $20 million more than FY2018. The Senate-passed bill also recommends $175 million. With estimated mandatory funding of $140 million, a total of $175 million in discretionary funding would result in a 10% increase over the FY2018 total funding level of $285.8 million. The EAS program aims to maintain commercial air service to small communities by subsidizing services. The EAS program seeks to preserve commercial air service to small communities by subsidizing unprofitable routes. The program's cost has doubled since FY2008 due to route reductions and new community additions. Congress made changes in 2012, including capping subsidies at $1,000 per passenger and limiting subsidies for communities less than 210 miles from a hub airport. Congress made changes to the EAS program in 2012, including capping subsidies at $1,000 per passenger and limiting subsidies for communities less than 210 miles from a hub airport. Small planes can now be used for communities with few daily passengers to maintain airline service in small communities as originally intended in 1978. Congress made changes to the Essential Air Service (EAS) program in 2012, capping subsidies at $1,000 per passenger and limiting subsidies for communities less than 210 miles from a hub airport. The program aims to preserve airline service to small communities, with supporters arguing it promotes economic development in rural areas. Critics point out the high subsidy cost per passenger, low passenger numbers at some airports, and proximity of some EAS-subsidized airports to major airports. In 2008, Congress directed railroads to install positive train control (PTC) on certain segments of the national rail network by the end of 2015. PTC is a communications and signaling system that can prevent incidents caused by train operator or dispatcher error. Despite billions spent by freight railroads, most required track did not have PTC installed by the end of 2015. Congress extended the deadline to the end of 2018. Freight railroads have spent billions to install positive train control (PTC) by the end of 2018, with an option to extend to 2020. Congress provided funding in recent years, but the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget did not include any funding for PTC implementation. The Trump Administration did not include funding for PTC implementation in the FY2019 budget. The House-reported bill allocated $150 million for PTC projects, while the Senate-passed bill did not specify an amount but directed DOT to prioritize PTC projects for grants. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 reauthorized funding for PTC projects. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 reauthorized Amtrak funding and changed the structure of its federal grants. It now receives separate grants for the Northeast Corridor and the national network, with three new programs for intercity passenger rail development. The committee report directs DOT to prioritize PTC projects for grants from the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements grant program. The Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act of 2015 reauthorized Amtrak funding and established new grant programs for intercity passenger rail development. The FY2019 budget requested $738 million for Amtrak, with additional funding recommended by the House Appropriations Committee for various grant programs. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.9 billion for Amtrak, $800 million for two new grant programs, and $150 million for the Magnetic Levitation Technology Deployment Program. The Senate bill proposed $1.9 billion for Amtrak and $565 million for three new grant programs, with a directive to accelerate grant-making and prioritize projects. The Senate bill proposed $1.9 billion for Amtrak and $565 million for three new grant programs, prioritizing PTC projects. Congress historically provided little funding for intercity passenger rail development, except for brief periods in FY2009 and FY2010. Funding for intercity passenger rail development was absent from FY2011 to FY2016. In FY2009 and FY2010, Congress allocated $10.5 billion for DOT's high-speed and intercity passenger rail grant program. However, from FY2011 to FY2016, there was no funding for intercity passenger rail development, except for PTC implementation. In FY2017, Congress provided $98 million for new intercity passenger rail grant programs, increasing to $863 million in FY2018. The Federal Transit Administration funnels most of its $13 billion funding to state and local transit agencies. In FY2017, Congress allocated $98 million for new intercity passenger rail grant programs, increasing to $863 million in FY2018. The Federal Transit Administration distributes most of its $13 billion funding to state and local transit agencies through various programs, with the Capital Investment Grants program being the largest discretionary grant program. The Capital Investment Grants program (CIG) is the largest discretionary grant program by the Federal Transit Administration. It funds new fixed-guideway transit lines and extensions, with three components: New Starts grants for projects over $300 million seeking over $100 million in federal funding, Small Starts grants for projects under $300 million seeking less than $100 million, and Core Capacity grants for increasing existing system capacity. The Capital Investment Grants program (CIG) offers funding for transit projects through New Starts grants for projects over $300 million, Small Starts grants for projects under $300 million, and Core Capacity grants for increasing existing system capacity. Additionally, there is an Expedited Project Delivery Pilot for eligible projects with a 25% federal share and public-private partnership support. Grant funds for large projects are disbursed over several years. The Capital Investment Grants program offers funding for transit projects through New Starts grants for projects over $300 million, Small Starts grants for projects under $300 million, and Core Capacity grants for increasing existing system capacity. Grant funds for large projects are typically disbursed over a period of years. In FY2019, the Trump Administration requested $1.0 billion for Capital Investment Grants, $1.6 billion less than the previous year. Funding is provided only to projects with existing full funding grant agreements (FFGAs). In FY2019, the Trump Administration requested $1.6 billion less for Capital Investment Grants compared to FY2018. The House Committee recommended $2.614 billion, slightly less than the previous year. The Senate-passed bill would provide $2.553 billion. Congress has expressed concern about the Administration's approach to the CIG program. The Trump Administration has requested less funding for Capital Investment Grants in FY2019 compared to FY2018. Congress is concerned about the Administration's stance on the CIG program, which includes not requesting funding for new transit projects in FY2018 and FY2019. The Administration believes state and local governments should fund transit projects without federal contribution. Congress does not support this proposal. The Trump Administration has not requested funding for new transit projects in its FY2018 and FY2019 DOT budget requests. Congress has provided more than twice the amount requested by FTA for the CIG program in both years, directing FTA to continue the program as described in statute. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed the agency to carry out the CIG program as described in statute, providing more than twice the amount requested by FTA for the program. The committee reports noted FTA's failure to comply with congressional directives for program improvements, citing lack of plans due to the Administration not requesting funding for new projects. Transportation for America, a transportation advocacy group, asserts that FTA has failed to comply with congressional directives regarding improvements to the CIG program and is deliberately delaying the project development process for transit projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee report also expressed concern about FTA creating unnecessary delays for projects in the project development pipeline. Transportation for America, an advocacy group, claims that the FTA is intentionally delaying transit project development despite Congress providing $2.3 billion for new projects. Only $533 million in grants have been issued, leading to increased costs for project sponsors as FTA prolongs the review process, causing construction bids to expire before applications are completed. The FTA is facing allegations of delaying transit project development, leading to increased costs for project sponsors. Construction bids have expired before FTA completed its review, forcing agencies to rebid projects. The FTA denies delaying the process, but there have been limitations on federal funding for New Starts projects. The FTA has faced allegations of delaying transit project development, causing increased costs for sponsors. There have been limitations on federal funding for New Starts projects, with a provision in the FY2018 DOT appropriations act lowering the federal share limit to 51%. Critics argue that the higher federal share for highway projects makes them more attractive than public transportation projects. Critics argue that the higher federal share for highway projects makes them more attractive than public transportation projects. Advocates of lowering the federal share for New Starts projects believe it allows the FTA to support more projects with the available funding and encourages communities to carefully estimate costs and benefits of proposed transit projects. Requiring a higher local match allows FTA to support more projects with available funding and encourages careful cost estimation for proposed transit projects. Most federal transportation funding is distributed by mode, with grant programs reserved for highways, public transportation, rail, and airport development. Most federal transportation funding is distributed by mode, with the majority going to states by formula. While Congress allocates around $55 billion annually for surface transportation programs, most of the funding is automatically divided among states, making it challenging for states to accumulate funds for major projects. This situation is exemplified by Amtrak's Gateway Program. Amtrak's Gateway Program aims to enhance rail service between northern New Jersey and Manhattan by replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The program faces funding challenges due to the automatic distribution of federal transportation funds among states. The Gateway Program aims to improve rail service between northern New Jersey and Manhattan by replacing bridges, expanding track capacity, and adding a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The estimated cost of the program is at least $24 billion, with the new Hudson River Tunnel alone costing $11.1 billion. The existing tunnel, over a century old, was flooded during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and is deteriorating. The estimated cost of the Gateway Program is at least $24 billion, with the new Hudson River Tunnel alone costing $11.1 billion. The new tunnel is eligible for DOT funding from both the intercity rail program and the public transportation Capital Investment Grants program. Funding for intercity rail projects has been limited in recent years. Despite limited funding for intercity rail projects in recent years, the Capital Investment Grants program had $2.6 billion available in FY2018. However, competition for this funding is intense, with the largest grant awarded to a single project in the past 10 years being $2.6 billion. In 2016, an agreement was reached between DOT, Amtrak, and the States of New Jersey and New York to share costs for the Gateway Program, which has an estimated cost of at least $24 billion. The Trump Administration does not feel bound by a previous agreement to share costs for the new Hudson Tunnel project. Congress would need to provide the funding, but neither the House nor Senate Appropriations Committees mentioned the project in their FY2019 reports. The Trump Administration does not feel bound by a previous agreement to share costs for the new Hudson Tunnel project. Congress would need to provide the funding. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not mention the Gateway Program or Hudson Tunnel project in their FY2019 reports, but recommended significant funding for rail and transit grant programs that Gateway projects could be eligible for. Additionally, they recommended $240 million more for Amtrak's Northeast Corridor account than Amtrak requested for FY2019. The Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized $1.5 billion over 10 years in grants to WMATA for maintenance and capital grants, in addition to around $310 million from FTA formula programs. The Senate Appropriation Committee's report noted that the FY2018 grant was the final installment of the $1.5 billion funding commitment made in 2008. The FY2018 grant was the final installment of the $1.5 billion funding commitment Congress made in 2008 for WMATA. The Administration requested $120 million for FY2019, while the House and Senate recommended $150 million. The Senate Appropriation Committee's FY2019 report directed WMATA, local jurisdictions, and FTA to work on extending the authorization for the grant. The Senate Appropriation Committee's FY2019 report directs WMATA, local jurisdictions, and FTA to continue working on extending the authorization for the grant. WMATA is facing a backlog of maintenance needs and safety concerns following fatal incidents. WMATA is dealing with a backlog of maintenance needs and safety concerns following fatal incidents, leading to FTA assuming oversight of safety compliance practices in 2015. An investigation found mismanagement of federal funding, prompting FTA to restrict WMATA's use of federal funds. In 2015, FTA took over safety oversight of WMATA from the Tri-State Oversight Committee, implementing recommendations for safety improvements. FTA conducts inspections, leads accident investigations, and ensures federal funds are used for safety enhancements. In 2017, FTA notified leaders of the three jurisdictions that 5% of their transit funds would be withheld until a new State Safety Oversight Program is established. Federal funds received by WMATA are used to improve safety. In February 2017, FTA notified leaders of the three jurisdictions that it would withhold 5% of their FY2017 transit funds until they establish a new State Safety Oversight Program. The jurisdictions passed legislation to create the Metrorail Safety Commission, but FTA requires the agency to be operational before releasing the funding. On September 6, 2018, FTA outlined the steps for the Commission to take over oversight responsibilities. The new Metrorail Safety Commission must complete steps outlined by FTA to transition oversight responsibility from FTA to the Commission. The National Transportation Safety Board recommends FRA oversee WMATA's rail operations instead of FTA, but Congress would need to grant FRA authority."
