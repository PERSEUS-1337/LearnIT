    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of 2003\". The findings are also included in the Act. Research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health has shown the feasibility of using cord blood for clinical applications, including bone marrow reconstitution for certain diseases. Stem cells from cord blood can be used for transplantation in conditions like leukemia, lymphoma, sickle cell anemia, and other acquired diseases. Cord blood, collected from the umbilical cord and donated by the mother, is a source of stem cells used for bone marrow reconstitution in recipients with malignancies, genetic disorders, and acquired diseases. This cord blood can be preserved through freezing for many years and is readily available for transplantation. Cord blood, a source of stem cells, can be collected from residual neonatal blood without risk to the donor. It can be preserved through freezing for many years and used for transplantation in clinical situations or scientific research. Advantages of cord blood stem cell transplants include reduced risks to the donor, quicker availability of donor cell units, and lower transplant complications compared to bone marrow transplants. Advantages of cord blood stem cell transplants over bone marrow transplants include reduced risks to the donor, quicker availability of donor cell units, and lower transplant complications such as graft versus host disease and latent virus infections. When a matched sibling donor is not available, a search for an unrelated donor is initiated to optimize transplant success. When no matched sibling donor is found, a search for an unrelated donor is initiated to increase the chances of successful bone marrow transplantation. Patients from ethnic minorities often struggle to find fully matched donors, leading to partially matched transplants with higher complication rates such as graft versus host disease and mortality. Cord blood stem cell banks offer increased genetic diversity in donor supply, allowing for fully matched or partially matched transplants. This reduces the risk of complications like graft versus host disease and mortality associated with partially matched transplants. Cord blood stem cell banks provide an opportunity to identify fully matched and partially matched transplant units for qualified candidates. Using partially matched units reduces the risk of graft versus host disease compared to conventional bone marrow transplantation. Identifying and delivering an unrelated bone marrow donor from the National registry can take many months to over a year, but an inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units, considering ethnic diversity, would help. An inventory of 150,000 cord blood stem cell units, considering ethnic diversity, would help provide appropriate matches for at least 90 percent of those seeking matched transplants within days. Matched donors are more likely within the same ethnic group as the patient, with some genetic conditions being more prevalent in specific ethnic groups. Patients with Sickle Cell Anemia, a genetic condition more common in African-Americans, have a high risk of severe bacterial infections and frequent painful crises. Children with complications like chest syndrome or strokes face a significant risk of premature death. Patients with Sickle Cell Disease are at risk of bacterial blood infections and frequent painful crises, with a median lifespan of 42 years. Children with complications like chest syndrome or strokes have a high risk of premature death. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has shown promising results in curing Sickle Cell Anemia. Cord blood stem cell transplantation has cured patients with Sickle Cell Anemia, especially beneficial for African American and other ethnic minority patients. The earlier the transplant is performed, the better the outcomes. African American and other ethnic minority patients benefit from cord blood transplants as they do not need as close of a match as bone marrow. With a national cord blood bank of 150,000 units, 90 percent of African American patients with conditions like Sickle Cell Anemia could find suitable cord blood donors for successful treatment. Since 1987, the National Marrow Donor Program has facilitated 17,000 bone marrow transplants. Cord blood transplantation complements bone marrow transplants by providing matched units, especially for non-caucasoid patients with lower match probabilities. Cord blood transplantation complements bone marrow transplants by providing matched units, especially for non-caucasoid patients with lower match probabilities. Radiation exposure can cause bone marrow failure, requiring treatment such as bone marrow reconstitution. Radiation exposure can lead to bone marrow failure, necessitating treatment like bone marrow reconstitution. Cryopreserved cord blood stem cell units may be crucial in these cases. There is an increased risk of leukemia or lymphoma in those exposed to radiation, which may also require stem cell transplantation. Research on cord blood stem cells could provide insights into chronic diseases. Research on cord blood stem cells may lead to a greater understanding of chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, potentially improving therapies and finding cures. These diseases contribute significantly to chronic disabilities and healthcare costs in the United States. The Public Health Service Act is amended to establish a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is defined by key terms such as Administrator, cord blood unit, donor, and donor bank. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network includes terms such as donor bank, human cord blood stem cells, and qualified cord blood stem cell banks. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network is a network of qualified cord blood stem cell banks established to contain at least 150,000 units of human cord blood stem cells. The National Network of Cord Blood Stem Cell Banks aims to establish and maintain at least 150,000 units of human cord blood stem cells. The purpose of the donor banks is to acquire, test, store, and preserve donated cord blood units in compliance with regulations. The National Network of Cord Blood Stem Cell Banks aims to store donated units of human cord blood in compliance with regulations. The banks make cord blood units available for transplantation and allocate a portion for research each year. Eligible donor banks must meet federal and state requirements. Eligible donor banks must have all necessary licenses, certifications, and registrations to operate a cord blood stem cell bank. They must also have proper donor screening and collection practices to protect donors and recipients. The eligible cord blood stem cell bank must have proper donor screening, collection practices, and confidentiality measures to protect donors and recipients. The eligible cord blood stem cell bank must ensure confidentiality, diversity in donors, and communication with other banks. The eligible cord blood stem cell bank must encourage donation by a diverse group of donors and have systems for communication with other banks, transplant centers, and physicians for the distribution of cord blood units. The eligible cord blood stem cell bank must comply with regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, track recipients' outcomes, and educate the public about the benefits of donating cord blood stem cells. The Secretary shall establish a Board of Directors for the administration of the network. The Secretary will establish a Board of Directors to administer the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network, including creating a national cord blood stem cell registry and coordinating donor banks. The Board of Directors for the National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network will be appointed by the Secretary and will include representatives from cord blood stem cell transplant centers and physicians from participating birthing hospitals. The National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Network will include representatives from cord blood stem cell transplant centers, physicians from participating birthing hospitals, the cord blood stem cell research community, transplant recipients, family members, and experts.
