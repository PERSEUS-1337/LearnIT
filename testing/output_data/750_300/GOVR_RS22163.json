The transatlantic partnership between the United States and Europe is based on common values, interests, and goals, including democracy, open societies, human rights, and free markets. Supporters argue that close U.S.-European cooperation is essential for addressing global challenges. The relationship also includes a significant trade and investment partnership. This report highlights shared interests, cooperation, and challenges in the transatlantic relationship. The U.S. and Europe have a strong trade and investment relationship. The U.S. Congress engages with European legislators on various economic, security, and diplomatic issues. Congressional activities often involve considering the benefits and challenges of U.S.-European cooperation. Members of Congress engage in discussions on U.S.-European cooperation, considering benefits, alignment, and partnership. They have historically supported a close transatlantic relationship, viewing the EU, NATO, and a united Europe as advancing U.S. interests, especially during the Cold War. Congressional interest in Europe remains strong. During the Cold War, a united Europe was seen as a way to counter the Soviet Union, with NATO and the EU as key pillars of the Euro-Atlantic community. Congressional interest in Europe is rooted in the need for like-minded partners in facing global challenges. Members have at times questioned the level of cooperation from Europe and whether it might constrain U.S. policy choices. The institutional pillars of the Euro-Atlantic community, NATO and the EU, have successfully promoted prosperity and security in Europe. The U.S. strongly supports these institutions to foster democratic states, reliable military allies, and strong trading partners. While bilateral relationships between the U.S. and European countries are crucial, the relationship between the U.S. and Europe remains vital for transatlantic relations. The EU has become increasingly important for the United States as its 28 member countries make common decisions and policies in various areas. The EU is a key interlocutor for the US in economic, social, law enforcement, and judicial matters. The EU makes common decisions and policies in economic, social, law enforcement, and judicial matters. Efforts are ongoing to strengthen the Common Foreign and Security Policy and Common Security and Defense Policy. NATO remains the primary security institution in the Euro-Atlantic community, with the US playing a leading role. NATO has evolved significantly since the end of the Cold War, adding 12 new members. Members of Congress maintain a consistent interest in NATO. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO has added 12 new member states from Central and Eastern Europe. The conflict in Ukraine and tense relations with Russia have become central factors in discussions about the future role and capabilities of NATO. The year 2014 saw leadership transitions for Euro-Atlantic institutions. In 2014, leadership transitions occurred in Euro-Atlantic institutions. German MEP Martin Schulz was reelected as President of the European Parliament, while Jens Stoltenberg replaced Anders Fogh Rasmussen as NATO Secretary General. The conflict in Ukraine and tense relations with Russia influenced discussions about NATO's future role and capabilities. In 2014, leadership transitions occurred in Euro-Atlantic institutions. Jens Stoltenberg replaced Anders Fogh Rasmussen as NATO Secretary General. The European Commission welcomed a new group of commissioners for a five-year term, with Jean-Claude Juncker taking over as President. Federica Mogherini became the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs, and Donald Tusk became the new President of the European Council. In 2014, leadership transitions occurred in Euro-Atlantic institutions. Federica Mogherini replaced Catherine Ashton as the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, while Donald Tusk became the new President of the European Council. Polls show favorable European perceptions of U.S. foreign policy under the Obama Administration compared to the George W. Bush Administration, leading to mostly constructive transatlantic relations over the past six years. The positive tone of transatlantic relations in recent years has been mostly constructive, with both the United States and Europe working together on global challenges. However, frustrations and reality checks have reminded both sides to be realistic about their expectations. Europeans expressed anxiety when the Obama Administration announced a shift towards focusing more on Asia in 2012. After the Obama Administration announced a \"re-balancing\" of U.S. foreign policy towards Asia in 2012, Europeans expressed anxiety about the United States pulling back from Europe. The crisis in Ukraine has caused U.S. policymakers to rethink assumptions about European security, with the United States continuing to play a leading role in NATO and managing relations with Russia. The U.S. hopes Europe will share the burden in its own security. Europe continues to play a leading role in NATO and managing relations with Russia. The U.S. expects Europe to share the burden of its own security and act as an effective partner in addressing common threats. Concerns remain about Europe's economic difficulties and declining defense spending. Europe's role in NATO and relations with Russia are key aspects of transatlantic cooperation. U.S. officials are concerned about Europe's economic challenges, defense spending reductions, and the ability to maintain a unified foreign policy. The EU's political dynamics and the aftermath of the financial crisis also impact the partnership. The European financial crisis post-2008 global downturn revealed unresolved issues within the EU, causing tensions among member states. Despite some reforms, questions about further EU integration persist. The European financial crisis post-2008 global downturn revealed unresolved issues within the EU, causing tensions among member states. Despite some reforms, questions about further EU integration persist. The crisis has led to an anti-establishment backlash among European voters, with new populist parties gaining strength advocating nationalist, anti-immigration, and anti-EU policies. In various countries, new populist parties are gaining strength, advocating far-right and far-left policies, often anti-EU. Euro-skeptic parties won a significant portion of votes in the 2014 European Parliament election. The trend will be further tested following the victory of the radical-left Syriza party in the 2015 Greek elections. The far-right and far-left won a quarter of the votes in the 2014 European Parliament election. The trend will be tested further with national elections in several European countries, including the UK, which could have major implications for EU membership. European domestic challenges include political instability, economic struggles, and growing skepticism. The possible national referendum on EU membership in the United States' closest European ally could impact Europe's ability to partner with the US due to domestic challenges. The crisis in Ukraine has transformed Russia from a strategic partner to a strategic problem for US and European policymakers. The crisis in Ukraine in 2014 transformed Russia from a strategic partner to a strategic problem for US and European policymakers, leading to tensions in relations between Russia and the West. Relations between Russia and the West have been tense for over a decade, with conflicts over NATO enlargement, Kosovo's independence, and the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict. The Obama Administration tried to improve relations through initiatives like the New START treaty and cooperation on Afghanistan and Iran, but objections to Russia's policies remained. U.S.-Russia cooperation improved with the signing of the New START treaty and temporary easing of tensions over missile defense plans. However, strains persisted due to objections over Russia's policies on various issues, leading to increased criticism after the 2011-2012 elections and Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency. Strains between the U.S. and Russia increased after the 2011-2012 elections and Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency. Russia strongly reacted to U.S. criticism and adoption of the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012. Russia also clashed with U.S. and European foreign policy on various issues. Russia's response to alleged human rights violations against journalists and opposition activists led to increasing tensions with the U.S. and Europe. This included criticism of the NATO operation in Libya, support for Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and opposition to U.S. and European efforts in the UN Security Council regarding the violence in Syria. The political crisis in Ukraine from late 2013 further strained relations, culminating in Russia pressuring then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to reject an Association Agreement with the EU. In 2013, Russia pressured Ukrainian President Yanukovych to reject an EU Association Agreement, leading to his ousting in 2014 and the formation of a new pro-Western government. In 2014, violent clashes in Kiev led to the formation of a new pro-Western government. Russian forces then annexed Crimea, citing historical significance and protecting its inhabitants. The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 was justified as rectifying a historical transfer from Russia to Ukraine, protecting inhabitants, and responding to the will of the population in Crimea. The annexation and referendum are not recognized internationally, leading to sanctions against Crimean and Russian individuals and entities. The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, not recognized internationally, led to sanctions. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has resulted in over 4,300 deaths despite a ceasefire agreement. Western governments accuse Russia of involvement. The conflict in eastern Ukraine, which began in April 2014, has resulted in over 4,300 deaths despite a ceasefire agreement. Western governments accuse Russia of direct involvement in the conflict, including providing military support to separatists. Russia denies these claims, stating they only offer political and humanitarian aid. The United States and Europe have been closely monitoring and responding to the situation in Ukraine. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has resulted in over 4,300 deaths despite a ceasefire agreement. Western governments accuse Russia of providing separatists with heavy weapons and small arms, which Russia denies. U.S. and European coordination in responding to the situation has been generally strong, with aligned analyses and efforts to maximize influence through sanctions. Tensions arose over EU's reluctance to expand sanctions, but the shooting down of MH17 in July 2014 led to increased actions. The shooting down of MH17 in July 2014 led the EU to expand sanctions on Russia beyond individuals and specific entities to target wider sectors of the Russian economy, due to the large economic ties many European countries have with Russia. Many European countries have significant economic ties with Russia in trade, investment, finance, and energy, leading to debates within the EU over the value and effectiveness of sanctions. US policymakers express frustration at the differing attitudes towards Russia among European nations. Despite skepticism from some Europeans, sanctions have been unanimously adopted to deter Russia's actions in Ukraine. The EU member states unanimously adopted sanctions to deter Russia's actions in Ukraine, based on a common assessment that sending a strong message outweighed economic disruption. The sanctions package is reviewed monthly, requiring unanimous consensus for renewal. The EU adopted sanctions to deter Russia's actions in Ukraine, prioritizing a strong message over economic disruption. Sanctions are reviewed monthly, with unanimous consensus needed for renewal in July 2015. Russia's economy has entered recession, with a weakened ruble and high inflation, partly due to oil prices and Western sanctions. Impact on foreign policy remains unclear. Most analysts attribute Russia's economic downturn to a sharp drop in oil prices and Western sanctions. The impact of these factors on Russia's foreign policy decisions remains uncertain, with speculation ranging from maintaining a \"frozen conflict\" in eastern Ukraine to seeking de-escalation. A massive Russian invasion to expand separatist territory or establish a land connection to Crimea is deemed unlikely. Many analysts believe Russia's economic downturn is due to oil prices and sanctions. Speculation ranges from maintaining a \"frozen conflict\" in eastern Ukraine to seeking de-escalation. In January 2015, EU proposed easing sanctions if Russia complies with ceasefire agreement. Resurgence of combat in eastern Ukraine led to a backtrack on the proposal. The High Representative emphasized that any proposal regarding Russia's relations with the US and Europe depends on Russia's full implementation of the ceasefire agreement. With Vladimir Putin expected to remain Russia's leader, policymakers will focus on discerning Russia's foreign policy intentions. Members of the 114th Congress may need to address developments related to Russia and Ukraine. European relations with Russia are a central topic for policymakers seeking to understand Russia's foreign policy intentions. Members of the 114th Congress may consider additional sanctions or cooperation with European counterparts. They may also explore ways to support Ukraine in coordination with Europe. The US provided $291 million in aid and a $1 billion loan guarantee for Ukraine in 2014. Additional support includes $139 million in bilateral assistance and funds from various accounts. The 113th Congress passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act in December. The US provided $291 million in aid and a $1 billion loan guarantee for Ukraine in 2014. The 113th Congress passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act, authorizing $350 million in military assistance, including lethal weapons. The EU signed an Association Agreement with Ukraine and plans to provide over \u20ac11 billion in development assistance and loans. The EU has provided over \u20ac11 billion in development assistance and loans to Ukraine between 2014 and 2020. International financial assistance is contingent on Ukraine's economic reforms and anti-corruption efforts, sparking debates about NATO's future and impacting U.S. views on European defense issues. Developments in Ukraine have reinvigorated debates about NATO's future and altered the U.S. outlook on European defense issues. Russia's actions in Ukraine have driven calls for NATO to focus on collective territorial defense, leading to increased defense spending by European countries. The Obama Administration's European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) was established in response to Russian aggression, aiming to reassure European allies of the U.S. commitment to European security. Congress allocated $810 million for the initiative in December 2014, but criticized the lack of detail provided regarding its proposed activities. The European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) was proposed by President Obama in June 2014 and funded with $810 million by Congress in December 2014. It extends reassurance measures like troop rotations and pre-positioning military equipment in Eastern Europe. The U.S. military presence in Europe related to ERI is rotational, with no plans for a permanent increase in personnel. Plans to close 15 bases in Europe were announced in January 2015. The U.S. military presence in Europe related to the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI) is rotational, with no plans for a permanent increase in personnel. Plans to close 15 bases in Europe were announced in January 2015, but the overall U.S. force level in Europe is expected to remain at approximately 67,000 personnel. Debates about the future of NATO were expected to revolve around long-term questions highlighted by the end of the alliance's mission in Afghanistan. Debates about the future of NATO were expected to focus on the impact of declining European defense budgets and the growing transatlantic military \"capabilities gap.\" European militaries lack important capabilities like strategic air- and sealift, aerial refueling, helicopters, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, which could increase NATO's reliance on U.S. military capacity. NATO relies heavily on U.S. military capacity due to European military limitations in key capabilities. Efforts for European defense integration have had limited success, and NATO's ability to address unconventional security threats is crucial for its relevance. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO members, including the United States, have debated the alliance's focus on \"out-of-area\" operations and unconventional security threats. The 2010 Strategic Concept outlines NATO's core tasks as collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security. The 2010 NATO summit adopted the Strategic Concept, which outlines three core tasks: collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security. It emphasizes NATO's role in ensuring the security of its members and developing capabilities for various operations and security challenges. Some analysts believe that Europe may be less willing to engage in large-scale missions overseas due to public opposition, lack of political will, and resource shortages post-Afghanistan. The security outlook in Europe has shifted with increased concerns about the threat posed by Russia, particularly in countries like Poland and the Baltic states. In response to increased perceptions of the threat posed by Russia, some European countries, such as Poland and the Baltic states, have called for permanent basing of U.S. and NATO forces on their territory. The European Reassurance Initiative includes rotating forces, increased exercises, and pre-positioning of assets to bolster security in the region. NATO countries have tripled the number of fighter aircraft participating in the Baltic Air Policing mission. Increased exercises and pre-positioning of assets are a more likely U.S. and NATO response to bolster security in the region. NATO countries have tripled the number of fighter aircraft in the Baltic Air Policing mission. The 2014 NATO Summit in Wales agreed to a \"Readiness Action Plan\" for enhanced infrastructure and troop deployments in Central and Eastern Europe. The NATO allies agreed on a plan for enhanced infrastructure and troop deployments in Central and Eastern Europe, including the establishment of a new Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) with 4,000 soldiers capable of deploying within days to respond to threats. The NATO allies agreed on a plan for enhanced infrastructure and troop deployments in Central and Eastern Europe, including the establishment of a new Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) with 4,000 soldiers capable of deploying within days to respond to threats. Additionally, allied leaders pledged to halt declining defense expenditures and work towards spending 2% of national GDP on defense within a decade. Tensions between the EU and Russia have refocused attention on European energy security due to Europe's dependence on Russian natural gas. The EU and Russia are focusing on European energy security as Europe heavily relies on Russian natural gas for imports. This dependence has raised concerns due to Russia using energy supplies as a tool for foreign policy leverage, seeking bilateral energy deals with European countries. In recent years, Russia has increased its use of energy supplies as a tool for foreign policy leverage, seeking bilateral energy deals with European countries and acquiring ownership of European energy infrastructure. Concerns have been raised about Russia's lack of transparency and market reciprocity in business practices and investment policies, as well as the possibility of gas cutoffs to countries dependent on Russian natural gas. Many U.S. officials and Members of Congress view European energy security as a U.S. interest due to concerns about Russian energy dominance and its impact on transatlantic unity. The United States is concerned about Russian energy dominance impacting transatlantic unity. U.S. Administrations urge EU states to reduce reliance on Russia through diversification and support for alternative energy sources. Europe faces challenges in diversifying its energy supply, with North Africa seen as a potential gas supplier despite political and economic instability in the region. Europe is working to diversify its energy supply by looking to sources like North Africa and Central Asia. However, political and economic instability in North Africa has hindered its role as a gas supplier. Russia has also impeded the development of alternative pipelines to Central Asia. European countries are also focusing on renewable energy, but the contribution of this source is still uncertain. Russia has hindered the development of alternative pipelines linking Europe to Central Asian suppliers. European leaders are working on a common energy strategy, including initiatives to integrate the internal energy market. Recent events in Ukraine and Crimea have increased the urgency for these efforts. The EU has taken steps to liberalize and integrate the European energy market, including expanding grid and pipeline interconnections. Recent events in Ukraine and Crimea have heightened the importance of these efforts. Some European countries have built LNG terminals, increased pipeline connectivity, and developed the ability to reverse gas flow to counter a Russian gas cut-off. Former Prime Minister Tusk of Poland proposed an EU \"energy union\" with a single agency purchasing natural gas for all 28 member states. In April 2014, then-Prime Minister Tusk of Poland proposed an EU \"energy union\" with a single European agency purchasing natural gas for all 28 members. This union would include \"solidarity mechanisms\" to aid member states in cases of supply disruption. The EU had already adopted legislation to introduce competition and transparency in the energy sector by unbundling gas production ownership from distribution. Before recent events in Ukraine, the EU had legislation to increase competition and transparency in the energy sector by separating gas production ownership from distribution. Russia criticized this legislation and canceled the South Stream project in December 2014, which would have bypassed Ukraine. Russia canceled the South Stream project in December 2014, a pipeline intended to run from Russia under the Black Sea to Bulgaria and other European countries, bypassing Ukraine. The cancellation was seen as a response to EU bureaucratic obstacles and criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine. This move was also seen as a way for Russia to abandon a project that had become politically and financially burdensome. Russia aims to diversify its gas markets while Europe remains its main buyer. Russia canceled the South Stream project in December 2014, a pipeline intended to run from Russia under the Black Sea to Bulgaria and other European countries, bypassing Ukraine. This move was seen as a response to EU bureaucratic obstacles and criticism of Russia's actions in Ukraine. Russia aims to diversify its gas markets by concluding pipeline construction deals with China and Turkey. The United States has been leading a coalition to combat the Islamic State organization in Iraq and Syria. The United States and Europe have been working together to combat the Islamic State organization in Iraq and Syria. The US leads a coalition to \"degrade and destroy\" IS through military action and support for partner ground forces. NATO countries like Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom have participated in airstrikes against IS in Iraq. European countries have also provided trainers, advisers, weapons, and humanitarian aid to Iraqi and Kurdish forces. European countries have pledged trainers, advisers, and support for Iraqi forces in coalition airstrikes against IS in Iraq. Military action against IS has been limited to Iraq due to political and legal challenges in Syria. European policymakers are concerned about the civil war in Syria, where over 191,000 people have died since 2011. The EU has condemned the Assad government alongside the United States. The EU, like the US, is concerned about the civil war in Syria and has imposed sanctions on the Assad government. In 2012, the EU recognized the Syrian National Coalition as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. In 2013, the EU lifted an embargo on arming Syrian rebel forces, providing mainly non-lethal equipment, humanitarian aid, and training. The January 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris raised concerns about Europe's vulnerability to terrorism, leading to raids by authorities. The January 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, claimed by individuals linked to al Qaeda and the Islamic State, heightened concerns about Europe's vulnerability to terrorism. Authorities conducted raids to break up an Islamic State-linked terrorist cell in Belgium. Analysts and European governments are worried about \"foreign fighters,\" European citizens or residents of Muslim background joining conflicts in Syria and Iraq. The exact number of Muslims from Europe and other Western countries involved in these conflicts is hard to determine. Growing concerns about \"foreign fighters,\" European citizens or residents of Muslim background traveling to Syria or Iraq to join the group. Recent estimates suggest there may be 3,000 to 5,000 individuals from significant EU countries and countries with large Muslim populations in the Balkans and Russia. Authorities are concerned about fighters returning home. Authorities in European countries are worried about the potential threat posed by foreign fighters returning from conflict zones like Syria and Iraq. Concerns include the possibility of these fighters bringing back extremist views, enhanced training, and weapons skills to carry out terrorist attacks in Europe. European governments are implementing security measures to address these risks. European governments are taking measures to address security concerns related to foreign fighters returning from conflict zones like Syria and Iraq. Actions include increasing surveillance, combating terrorist recruitment, prohibiting travel, arresting suspects, confiscating passports, detaining returning fighters, and providing support for concerned family members. European governments are implementing measures to address security concerns related to foreign fighters returning from conflict zones like Syria and Iraq. This includes increasing surveillance, combating terrorist recruitment, prohibiting travel, arresting suspects, confiscating passports, detaining returning fighters, and providing support for concerned family members. However, challenges remain in preventing the flow of European fighters to these regions and tracking their movements. EU-wide efforts are hindered by differing views on intelligence-sharing, data privacy, and other issues among member states and institutions. The EU faces challenges in tracking European fighters traveling to Syria and Iraq due to differing views on intelligence-sharing, data privacy, and civil liberties among member states and institutions. The Paris attacks have reignited debates on enhancing security and surveillance powers within the EU, especially considering the open internal borders. The Paris attacks have sparked debates on enhancing security within the EU, including the proposal for an EU airline passenger name record system. Transatlantic cooperation on counterterrorism has been strong since 9/11, with regular dialogues between U.S. and European officials. Since the 9/11 attacks, transatlantic cooperation on counterterrorism has been strong, with regular dialogues between U.S. and European officials. In 2010, new U.S.-EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance were implemented, along with agreements on container security and sharing airline passenger data to enhance aviation and border security. The United States and the EU also collaborate on tracking and countering terrorism financing through forums like the Financial Action Task Force. The United States and the EU collaborate on sharing airline passenger data and countering terrorism financing through agreements like the U.S.-EU \"SWIFT agreement.\" Bilateral intelligence sharing and law enforcement cooperation also occur between the United States and individual European countries. The U.S. and EU collaborate on counterterrorism efforts through agreements like the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. Data privacy concerns have been raised by the EU regarding U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements. European policy makers have concerns about data privacy safeguards in U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements. The EU values data privacy as a basic right and has strict regulations. Objections in the European Parliament have complicated agreements on SWIFT and airline passenger data sharing. Negotiations for a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement have been ongoing since 2011. The U.S. and EU have aligned their lists of terrorist organizations in the past decade. The United States and the EU have been negotiating a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) since 2011. In July 2013, the EU added Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, aligning with U.S. efforts. However, critics argue that listing only the military wing is insufficient as Hezbollah can still fundraise in Europe. Critics argue that listing only Hezbollah's military wing on the EU's terrorist list is inadequate as the group can still fundraise in Europe. In December 2014, the EU General Court ruled to remove Hamas from the terrorist list due to procedural issues, which was not a political decision by EU governments. The EU General Court ruled to remove Hamas from the list of designated terrorist organizations on procedural grounds. The EU External Action Service clarified that this was not a political decision and sanctions against Hamas will remain in place during the appeal process. The US and Israel urged the EU to maintain the sanctions. Members of Congress are interested in international efforts to ensure Iran's nuclear program is peaceful, with Europe playing a key role in these efforts. In 2006, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (EU-3) joined the United States, Russia, and China to form the \"Permanent Five Plus One\" (P5+1) group that conducted negotiations with Iran. The EU-3 and the United States successfully pushed for United Nations Security Council approval of four rounds of sanctions on Iran between 2006 and 2010. Starting in 2010, the EU has played a central role in international efforts to ensure Iran's nuclear program is peaceful. The EU, along with the US, Russia, and China, formed the P5+1 group to negotiate with Iran. From 2006 to 2010, the EU-3 and the US pushed for UN sanctions on Iran. Since 2010, the EU has taken independent action, aligning with US sanctions. An EU embargo on Iranian oil started in mid-2012, impacting a significant portion of Iran's oil exports. The EU's shift towards aligning with US sanctions on Iran included an embargo on Iranian oil starting in mid-2012, impacting a significant portion of Iran's oil exports. Other EU sanctions on Iran involve restrictions on nuclear technology, dual-use items, natural gas, arms, financial transactions, and business activities with Iranian entities. The EU aligned with US sanctions on Iran, imposing an embargo on Iranian oil in mid-2012. Additional sanctions included restrictions on nuclear technology, arms, financial transactions, and business activities with Iranian entities. Sanctions also targeted Iranian cargo vessels, aircraft, individuals involved in Iran's nuclear program, and entities supporting the program. These measures aimed to isolate Iran, generate economic pressure, and curb its nuclear activities. Following the imposition of sanctions by the US, EU, and other international partners on entities supporting Iran's nuclear program, tensions eased after the election of Hassan Rouhani as Iran's president in 2013. This led to the P5+1 and Iran agreeing to a Joint Plan of Action (JPA) in November 2013, setting the stage for negotiations on Iran's nuclear program. The P5+1 and Iran agreed to a Joint Plan of Action (JPA) in November 2013, outlining a framework for a comprehensive agreement on Iran's nuclear program. Iran agreed to freeze some nuclear activities and cooperate with enhanced monitoring by the IAEA in exchange for limited sanctions relief, including allowing Iran to repatriate $700 million per month in oil sales proceeds and suspending certain trade restrictions. The Joint Plan of Action (JPA) between the P5+1 and Iran, agreed upon in November 2013, includes measures such as suspending sanctions, allowing Iran to repatriate funds from oil sales, and lifting certain trade restrictions. The terms of the JPA have been extended twice, with negotiations ongoing to reach a final agreement by July 6, 2015. Despite progress, significant differences remain, posing challenges to a final deal. Negotiators have extended the terms of the JPA twice, most recently to July 6, 2015, as they work towards a final deal. However, significant differences remain, raising concerns about Iran's potential nuclear capabilities and regional influence. The EU-3 foreign ministers and EU High Representative oppose new U.S. sanctions at this stage, fearing it could jeopardize the negotiations. The EU-3 foreign ministers and EU High Representative oppose new U.S. sanctions at this stage of negotiations to prevent jeopardizing talks and fracturing the international coalition. The United States, European Union, Russia, and the United Nations are part of the diplomatic quartet mediating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The EU, along with the United States, Russia, and the United Nations, is part of the diplomatic quartet mediating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The EU advocates for a \"two-state\" solution and emphasizes the importance of U.S. engagement in achieving peace and stability in the region. Talks have been unsuccessful, and recent conflicts have dimmed prospects for a negotiated settlement in the near-term. The most recent round of talks in April 2014 ended unsuccessfully, with prospects for a negotiated settlement appearing remote due to conflicts between Israel and Hamas. European support for Palestinians has raised Israeli concerns about international isolation. Sweden recognized a Palestinian state in October 2014, diverging from U.S. views. Israeli Foreign Minister Lieberman sees this as a top diplomatic challenge. In January 2015, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman highlighted European support for Palestinians as a major diplomatic challenge. Several European countries, including Sweden, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom, passed resolutions in support of recognizing a Palestinian state. A UN Security Council draft resolution on Israeli-Palestinian issues was not adopted, with France and Luxembourg voting in favor, the UK and Lithuania abstaining, and the US opposing it. Israel has concerns about reduced economic cooperation with the EU, its largest trading partner, due to international debates on European recognition of Palestinian statehood, potential ICC investigations of Israeli actions, and expected U.N. Security Council resolutions proposed by Palestinians and Arab states. France and Luxembourg supported a UNSC draft resolution on Israeli-Palestinian issues in 2014, opposed by the US and not adopted, with the UK and Lithuania abstaining. The EU has debated recognizing Palestinian statehood, potential ICC investigations of Israeli actions, and possible U.N. Security Council resolutions. In 2013, the EU stopped funding Israeli organizations in certain settlements and may consider labeling settlement products. Some analysts believe these measures are not a significant economic threat to Israel, as no European government supports boycotting Israel. The EU has debated various measures regarding Israeli actions, including the possibility of labeling settlement products. Analysts believe these actions do not pose a significant economic threat to Israel, as no European government supports boycotting Israel. High Representative Mogherini stated that there is no current intention to sanction anyone, but rather to motivate peace talks. The EU may offer financial incentives and upgrades to encourage peace negotiations. In East Jerusalem, High Representative Mogherini emphasized the need to motivate peace talks rather than impose sanctions. The EU may offer financial incentives and upgrades to both Israel and the Palestinians for a successful peace agreement. The United States and the European Union have a significant trade relationship, generating $5 trillion annually and supporting millions of jobs. The investment relationship between the United States and Europe generates approximately $5 trillion annually in total commercial sales and provides up to 15 million jobs. Merchandise trade totaled around $787 billion in 2013. U.S. and European companies are the biggest investors in each other's markets, with 56% of U.S. global investment going to Europe since 2000. In 2012, over 70% of total foreign investment in the United States came from Europe, with European affiliates in the U.S. having approximately $8.7 trillion in assets, and U.S. corporate assets in Europe totaling over $13 trillion. The investment relationship between the United States and Europe is significant, with European affiliates in the U.S. having approximately $8.7 trillion in assets, and U.S. corporate assets in Europe totaling over $13 trillion. The transatlantic economic relationship between the United States and the EU is influential in shaping global standards and regulations, with both entities comprising 50% of global GDP by value and 40% in terms of purchasing power parity. Since July 2013, the United States and the EU have been negotiating a Transatlantic Trade agreement. The United States and the EU are key players in shaping global standards and regulations. They have been negotiating a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) since July 2013, aiming to boost jobs and growth on both sides of the Atlantic by reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Harmonizing regulations is also a key focus. The TTIP aims to reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers between the U.S. and EU, potentially boosting GDP. Harmonizing regulations and standards could help define global standards and strengthen the U.S.-EU political relationship. The TTIP aims to reduce barriers between the U.S. and EU to boost GDP and define global standards. The agreement is crucial for the U.S.-EU political relationship, with hopes to initial a draft by the end of 2015.
