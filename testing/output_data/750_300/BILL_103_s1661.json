    "content": "The \"Worker Protection Warnings Act of 1993\" is referenced in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. The Congress recognizes the need for uniform warnings on personal protective equipment for occupational use to prevent confusion among employers and employees, reduce workplace injuries and illnesses, and address inconsistencies in state requirements. The absence of Federal standards for warnings on personal protective equipment for occupational use leads to varying State requirements, creating a burden on interstate commerce. The purpose of this Act is to enhance workplace safety by improving understanding of personal protective equipment through uniform warnings and preempting State standards on such warnings. SEC. 5. UNIFORM WARNINGS FOR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR OCCUPATIONAL USE. Section 6 (29 U.S.C. 655) is amended to include a new subsection requiring the Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, to establish uniform warnings for personal protective equipment for occupational use within 12 months of enactment. Personal protective equipment refers to gear for worker protection in workplaces covered by this Act. The term 'personal protective equipment' refers to gear for worker protection in workplaces covered by this Act, including equipment for eyes, face, head, hearing, extremities, or respiratory tract. 'Warning' is defined as any statement directing actions or procedures related to equipment use. Each standard under this Act will include the full text of warnings related to personal protective equipment and how manufacturers should communicate these warnings to employers. Each standard issued under this Act will include warnings for personal protective equipment and guidelines for employers to communicate these warnings to employees. The standards will also require training employees on the proper use of the equipment and understanding the warnings. The standards issued under this Act will include warnings for personal protective equipment and guidelines for employers to train employees on the proper use of the equipment and consequences of not following the warnings. The standards for personal protective equipment will become effective 6 months after publication in the Federal Register. Manufacturers must communicate prescribed warnings to employers using the equipment. The Secretary will consider factors like manufacturer experience and communication methods when promulgating standards. The Secretary will consider factors like manufacturer experience and communication methods when promulgating standards for personal protective equipment. SEC. 6. PREEMPTION. Section 4 and Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act are amended to clarify that Congress intends to regulate warnings for personal protective equipment and prevent states from establishing conflicting standards. Under section 6(h), no State or political subdivision can establish different or additional standards for personal protective equipment than those set by the Secretary under occupational safety and health standards. The Secretary cannot approve a State plan that includes conflicting requirements. The Secretary cannot approve a State plan with requirements different from those in occupational safety and health standards."
