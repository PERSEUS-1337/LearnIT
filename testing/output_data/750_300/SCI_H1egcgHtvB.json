    "content": "Contemporary semantic parsing models struggle to generalize to unseen database schemas when translating natural language questions into SQL queries. A unified framework based on relation-aware self-attention mechanism addresses schema encoding, schema linking, and feature representation within a text-to-SQL encoder, boosting exact match accuracy on the Spider dataset to 53.7%. The self-attention mechanism improves exact match accuracy on the Spider dataset to 53.7% compared to 47.4% for the previous state-of-the-art model unaugmented with BERT embeddings. This framework enhances schema linking and alignment in natural language queries to databases. The release of large annotated datasets containing natural language questions and corresponding database SQL queries has advanced research in translating natural language into database queries. New tasks like WikiSQL and Spider present real-life challenges for generalization to unseen data. The new tasks WikiSQL and Spider present challenges for generalization to unseen database schemas in semantic parsing. The models must encode schemas into suitable representations for decoding SQL queries involving given columns and tables. The challenge in text-to-SQL semantic parsing lies in encoding schema information for decoding SQL queries and aligning natural language references to database columns and tables. This includes encoding column types, foreign key relations, and primary keys for database joins. Schema linking is a challenge in text-to-SQL semantic parsing, aligning natural language references to database columns and tables. This involves resolving ambiguity in linking column/table references, as illustrated in an example where \"model\" refers to car_names.model and \"cars\" refers to cars_data and car_names for table joining. The challenge of ambiguity in schema linking involves resolving column/table references by considering known schema relations and question context. Previous work addressed this by encoding foreign key relations with a graph neural network, but lacked contextualization with the question. The schema representation problem was addressed by encoding foreign key relations with a graph neural network. However, this approach lacked contextualization with the question and limited information propagation. Global reasoning is crucial for effective representations. The RAT-SQL framework utilizes relation-aware self-attention to encode relational structures in the database schema and questions, combining global reasoning with structured reasoning over predefined schema relations. In this work, a unified framework called RAT-SQL is introduced for encoding relational structure in the database schema and questions. It utilizes relation-aware self-attention for global reasoning over schema entities and question words, achieving 53.7% exact match accuracy on the Spider test set. This result is currently the state of the art without pretrained BERT embeddings, demonstrating improved internal representations of question alignment with schema. Semantic parsing of natural language to SQL queries has gained popularity with the creation of WikiSQL and Spider datasets. RAT-SQL, a model without pretrained BERT embeddings, achieved state-of-the-art results on the Spider test set by improving internal representations of question alignment with schema. Schema encoding is less challenging in WikiSQL compared to Spider due to the lack of multi-table relations. Schema linking is more challenging in Spider because of its richer natural language expressiveness and less restricted SQL grammar. The state-of-the-art semantic parser on WikiSQL achieves a test set accuracy of 91.8%, higher than Spider. Recent models on Spider use attentional architectures for question/schema encoding and AST-based structural architectures for query decoding. The recent state-of-the-art models on Spider achieve a test set accuracy of 91.8%, surpassing previous benchmarks. These models utilize attentional architectures for question/schema encoding and AST-based structural architectures for query decoding. IRNet encodes question and schema separately with LSTM and self-attention, while Bogin et al. use a graph neural network for schema encoding. Both approaches aim to improve schema linking and query decoding. The AST-based decoder of Yin and Neubig (2017) and the graph neural network used by Bogin et al. (2019b) highlight the importance of schema encoding and linking. RAT-SQL provides a unified way to encode relational information, while Global-GNN offers a different approach to schema linking. The relational framework of RAT-SQL encodes relational information among inputs, while Global-GNN uses global reasoning between question words and schema columns/tables. Global reasoning in Global-GNN is implemented by gating the graph neural network to compute schema element representations based on question token representations. This differs from RAT-SQL as question word representations influence schema representations but not vice versa. The relation-aware transformer mechanism allows encoding arbitrary relations between question words and schema elements explicitly, computed jointly using self-attention. This differs from RAT-SQL as question word representations influence schema representations but not vice versa. The transformer mechanism enables encoding relations between question words and schema elements using self-attention. It extends previous work by encoding complex relationships within unordered sets of elements, such as columns and tables in a database schema. Relation-aware self-attention effectively encodes complex relationships within unordered sets of elements like columns and tables in a database schema. This is the first application of relation-aware self-attention to joint representation learning with predefined and softly induced relations. The RAT-SQL framework is described, focusing on schema encoding and linking in the context of text-to-SQL semantic parsing. The RAT-SQL framework is applied to schema encoding and linking in text-to-SQL semantic parsing. It defines the problem and introduces a relation-aware self-attention mechanism for encoding relational structure. The goal is to generate SQL queries from natural language questions and database schemas. The RAT-SQL framework aims to generate SQL queries from natural language questions and database schemas. It utilizes a relation-aware self-attention mechanism for encoding relational structure. The schema includes columns and tables, with some columns serving as primary keys for unique indexing and others as foreign keys for referencing primary key columns in different tables. The desired SQL program is represented as an abstract syntax tree in the context-free grammar of SQL. The schema encoding mechanism in the RAT-SQL framework aims to align question words with columns or tables using an alignment matrix, crucial for generating SQL queries accurately. Schema linking is essential for parsers to generate the correct columns and tables in SQL queries. An alignment matrix is used to model the latent alignment between question words and schema elements. The database schema is represented as a directed graph, with nodes representing tables and columns labeled with their names. This graph helps support reasoning about relationships between schema elements in the encoder. In schema linking, the database schema is represented as a directed graph with nodes for tables and columns labeled with their names. Each node in the graph represents a table or column, and edges describe relationships between them. This graph aids in understanding the connections between schema elements in the encoder. The approach involves using a bidirectional LSTM to obtain initial representations for nodes in a graph and words in a question. The LSTM is used separately for graph nodes and the question, with no parameter sharing between them. The approach involves using a bidirectional LSTM to obtain initial representations for nodes in a graph and words in a question. These initial representations are then imbued with information from the schema graph using relation-aware self-attention. The approach involves using relation-aware self-attention to imbue initial representations with information from the schema graph. This process utilizes a form of self-attention that is relation-aware to encode the relationship between elements in the input. The approach described involves using relation-aware self-attention to encode the relationship between elements in the input. Initial representations are constructed using c init i, t init i, and q init i, followed by applying a stack of N relation-aware self-attention layers with separate weights for each layer. The directed graph representing the schema contains edge types. After processing through a stack of N encoder layers with separate weights, the directed graph representing the schema contains edge types for different relationships such as SAME-TABLE, FOREIGN-KEY-COL-F, FOREIGN-KEY-COL-R, PRIMARY-KEY-F, and PRIMARY-KEY-R. The text discusses various types of relationships in a database schema, such as SAME-TABLE, FOREIGN-KEY, PRIMARY-KEY, and BELONGS-TO. It also mentions mapping relation types to embeddings to obtain values for each pair of elements. In the context of database schema relationships, the text describes the mapping of relation types to embeddings to obtain values for each pair of elements. It discusses the use of labels on edges in a graph to determine the relation type between nodes in the schema. In database schema relationships, labels on edges in a graph are used to determine relation types between nodes. Additional types are added beyond those in Table 1 to obtain values for all pairs of elements. In database schema relationships, labels on edges in a graph determine relation types between nodes. To aid model alignment of column/table references in questions to schema columns/tables, relation types are defined based on text matching. This includes exact and partial matches for n-grams in the question text. The text discusses determining matches between n-grams in questions and column/table names, assigning types based on the match (exact or partial), resulting in a total of 33 types. This process aids in aligning column/table references in questions to schema columns/tables. The memory-schema alignment matrix involves using relation-aware attention to align memory elements in questions with columns/tables in the schema. This process helps in computing explicit alignment matrices for columns and tables. The memory-schema alignment matrix uses relation-aware attention to align memory elements in questions with columns/tables in the schema, ensuring sparsity and real discrete alignments. An auxiliary loss encourages sparsity of the alignment matrix. The alignment in the memory-schema matrix should be aligned with car_names.model to bias towards real discrete structures. An auxiliary loss encourages sparsity of the alignment matrix by using a cross-entropy loss to strengthen the model's belief. The decoder from Yin and Neubig (2017) is used to generate the SQL query. The decoder from Yin and Neubig (2017) is used to generate the SQL query by expanding nodes in the abstract syntax tree according to grammar rules and selecting columns or tables from the schema. This process strengthens the model's belief by encoding the input and outputting a sequence of decoder actions. The LSTM's state is updated by choosing columns or tables from the schema and expanding nodes in the abstract syntax tree to generate the SQL query. The LSTM cell state is updated using multi-head attention and a 2-layer MLP with a tanh non-linearity. The model is implemented in PyTorch and uses GloVe word embeddings for preprocessing. Within the encoder, GloVe word embeddings are used with fixed dimensions except for the 50 most common words. Bidirectional LSTMs with hidden size 128 per direction and recurrent dropout method are employed. 8 relation-aware self-attention layers are stacked on top of the LSTMs with specific parameters. Position-wise feed-forward network is also utilized in the model. In the model, 8 relation-aware self-attention layers are stacked on top of bidirectional LSTMs. Parameters include d x = d z = 256, H = 8, dropout rate of 0.1, and inner layer dimension of 1024. Rule embeddings are size 128, node type embeddings are size 64, and LSTM hidden size is 512 with dropout rate of 0.21. Adam optimizer with default settings in PyTorch is used, with a linear increase in learning rate during warmup_steps. During training, the model uses Adam optimizer with default settings in PyTorch and a dropout rate of 0.21. The learning rate is increased linearly during warmup_steps and then annealed. The Spider dataset is used for experiments with 8,659 examples. We use a batch size of 20 and train for up to 40,000 steps on the Spider dataset, which contains 8,659 examples from various datasets. The test set is only accessible through an evaluation server, so most evaluations are done using the development set, which has 1,034 examples. The study evaluates the RAT-SQL model on the Spider dataset using the development set due to test set accessibility restrictions. Results are reported based on exact match accuracy and difficulty levels specified in the dataset. The metrics do not assess the model's performance in generating query values. In Table 2a, RAT-SQL's accuracy on the hidden test set is compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, showing superior performance without BERT embeddings. It comes close to beating the best BERT-augmented model, hinting at the potential for further improvement with BERT augmentation. The study compares RAT-SQL's accuracy on the hidden test set to other approaches, showing superior performance without BERT embeddings. It suggests potential for further improvement with BERT augmentation, as seen in the close performance to the best BERT-augmented model. The breakdown of accuracy by difficulty reveals a drop in performance with increasing difficulty, particularly on extra hard questions. Ablation study shows that schema linking significantly improves accuracy. The gap between development and test accuracy was affected by a significant drop (15%) on extra hard questions. An ablation study showed that schema linking significantly improved accuracy. The alignment between a specific question and the database schema was discussed, with differences in model accuracy explained. In the final model, the alignment loss terms did not impact overall accuracy, despite earlier improvements seen during development. The alignment loss terms did not affect overall accuracy in the final model, despite earlier improvements observed during development. Hyper-parameter tuning that increased encoding depth may have eliminated the need for explicit alignment supervision. An accurate alignment representation also helps identify question words for copying when necessary. An accurate alignment representation has benefits like identifying question words for copying when needed. The alignment matrix in Figure 4 correctly identifies key words referencing columns, but there are some mistakes in alignment. Despite research in semantic parsing, explicit alignment supervision may not be necessary due to hyper-parameter tuning. In this work, a unified framework is presented to address challenges in encoding database schema and linking column/table references in questions. Despite research in semantic parsing, contemporary models struggle with learning representations and proper alignment. The unified framework presented addresses challenges in encoding database schema and linking column/table references in questions by using relation-aware self-attention to learn schema and question word representations. This framework leads to significant improvements in text-to-SQL parsing and allows for combining predefined schema relations with inferred self-attended relations in the same encoder architecture. The RAT framework combines predefined schema relations with inferred self-attended relations in the encoder architecture, leading to state-of-the-art improvements in text-to-SQL parsing. The joint representation learning is seen as beneficial for various tasks with predefined structures. An oracle experiment was conducted to assess the decoder's ability to select the correct column, even with schema encoding and linking enhancements. The oracle experiment conducted assessed the decoder's ability to select the correct column in text-to-SQL parsing, with an accuracy of 99.4% using oracle sketch and oracle cols. This verifies the sufficiency of the grammar to answer most questions in the dataset. With \"oracle sketch\" and \"oracle cols\", the decoder achieves 99.4% accuracy in selecting the correct column or table, verifying the grammar's effectiveness in answering dataset questions. However, using only one oracle results in lower accuracies of 70.9% with \"oracle sketch\" and 67.6% with \"oracle cols\", indicating the importance of improving both column and structure selection for future work."
