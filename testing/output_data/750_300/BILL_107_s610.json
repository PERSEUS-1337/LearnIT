Congress finds that decommissioned firearms previously used by law enforcement agencies have been involved in various crimes, including shootings at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles and near a playground in Chicago. Additionally, firearms stolen during shipment from the Miami-Dade Police Department have been traced to crimes in Chicago. In the past 9 years, decommissioned firearms once used by law enforcement agencies have been involved in over 3,000 crimes, including 293 homicides, 301 assaults, and 279 drug-related crimes. Many State and local law enforcement departments also resell firearms confiscated from crimes, including assault weapons that were in circulation before restrictions were imposed.

Some states and cities have chosen to destroy decommissioned firearms instead.
