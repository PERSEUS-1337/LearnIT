    "content": "Pakistan's stability, democracy, and prosperity are crucial to U.S. interests due to its role in combating religious militancy and addressing various urgent policy areas such as terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and regional tensions with India. The country is known for hosting extremist groups and being a rapid nuclear weapons proliferator, making it a top priority on the international security agenda. Pakistan is a haven for Islamist extremist groups and the world's fastest proliferator of nuclear weapons, posing a significant threat to international security. Despite initial cooperation with the U.S. on counterterrorism efforts post-2001, doubts about Islamabad's commitment to core U.S. interests have deepened. Pakistan's mixed record in battling extremism includes tolerating Afghan insurgents and anti-India militants. The country's economic instability adds to its challenges. Pakistan's troubled economic conditions, precarious political setting, and history of difficult relations with neighbors present serious challenges to U.S. decision makers. The spread of Islamist radicalism in the country and the presence of insurgents near the Afghan border have led to a heavy toll on the Pakistani people. Islamabad claims that the \"war on extremism\" has been costly. The spread of Islamist radicalism in Pakistan has led to heavy casualties, with over 37,000 civilian lives lost, 6,300 security forces killed, and $78 billion in financial losses. The country experienced an average of more than 26 terrorist attacks per week in 2011, ranking among the highest globally. Pakistani officials emphasize the sacrifices made in the \"war on extremism,\" particularly following the revelation of Osama bin Laden's presence in the country in May 2011. In 2011, Pakistan faced over 26 terrorist attacks per week, ranking among the highest globally. The revelation of Osama bin Laden's presence in the country led to increased scrutiny and strained relations with the US, with accusations of Pakistan supporting Afghan insurgents. In 2011, Admiral Mike Mullen accused Pakistan of supporting Afghan insurgents attacking U.S. interests, causing frustration. In November, NATO troops were attacked by Pakistani army outposts, leading to retaliatory airstrikes and 24 Pakistani soldiers dead. In late November 2011, NATO troops in Afghanistan were attacked by Pakistani army outposts at Salala, resulting in 24 Pakistani soldiers dead. A Pentagon investigation blamed poor coordination and miscommunication, leading to fury in Pakistan and the scrapping of bilateral agreements with the United States. Following the intentional strike on NATO troops by Pakistani army outposts at Salala in late November 2011, Pakistani officials moved to scrap and renegotiate bilateral agreements with the United States related to supply lines into Afghanistan. Islamabad demanded a full apology from Washington for restored cooperation, leading to the closure of Pakistani ground lines of communication (GLOCs) for NATO supplies into Afghanistan. The closure of Pakistani ground lines of communication (GLOCs) for NATO supplies into Afghanistan remains unresolved, with negotiations stalled over a potential fee increase of up to $5,000 per truck. Senior U.S. officials have criticized this as \"extortion\" and \"price gouging,\" overshadowing the May 2012 NATO summit in Chicago. Pakistani negotiators are demanding a significant fee increase of up to $5,000 per truck for NATO supplies, causing tension with senior U.S. officials who view it as extortion and price gouging. In a separate incident, a Pakistani doctor involved in a CIA operation received a 33-year prison sentence for treason, leading to backlash from American lawmakers who responded by cutting $1 million from U.S. aid funding. A Pakistani doctor involved in a CIA operation received a 33-year prison sentence for treason, prompting backlash from American lawmakers who cut $1 million from U.S. aid funding in response. The Administration expressed disbelief in the conviction, leading to strained bilateral relations in 2012. The cooperative aspects of bilateral relations between the United States and Pakistan have been frozen since 2012. Anti-American sentiments are prevalent among Pakistanis, while Americans have increasingly negative views of Pakistan. The State Department warns against high travel risks in Pakistan. Pakistan has replaced India as the least favored nation by Pakistanis, while Americans have increasingly negative views of Pakistan. The State Department warns of high travel risks in Pakistan, with American diplomats facing travel restrictions and civilians being abducted, including the execution of Daniel Pearl. Islamist extremism in Pakistan is a major concern for U.S. foreign policy, hindering progress towards key goals such as defeating terrorist groups and stabilizing Afghanistan. Islamist extremism and militancy in Pakistan is a central U.S. foreign policy concern, hindering progress towards defeating terrorist groups and stabilizing Afghanistan. American citizens recruited for Islamist terrorism by Pakistan-based elements is a growing worry, with key enemies believed to reside in Pakistan. The United States is increasingly concerned about Islamist terrorism in Pakistan, with key enemies like Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri believed to be residing there. Some American officials suspect that Zawahiri may be receiving protection from elements of the Pakistani government. There is growing skepticism in Congress about the effectiveness of current U.S. policy towards Pakistan, with calls to curtail all foreign assistance to the country. Increasing numbers in Congress are questioning the effectiveness of current U.S. policy and large-scale aid to Pakistan. Some are calling for a reduction in foreign assistance, with legislation in Congress aiming to cut aid and impose new conditions. In FY2012, Congress allocated about $2 billion in direct aid to Pakistan, making it one of the top recipients of U.S. foreign assistance. Pakistan's Ambassador to the U.S. has raised concerns about the restrictions on aid. Pakistan received $2 billion in direct aid from Congress in FY2012, making it a top recipient of U.S. foreign assistance. The closure of Pakistani GLOCs to Afghanistan did not have the expected logistical impact, leading Islamabad to withhold cooperation with Washington. Pakistan risks losing out on hoped-for gains by keeping the routes closed. Pakistan's closure of supply routes to Afghanistan did not have the expected logistical impact, leading to a potential diplomatic isolation. By bowing to domestic pressures, the civilian government risks losing billions in foreign aid and influence in post-war Afghanistan. Working positively with the United States and NATO may be the only way to avoid this outcome. The civilian government of Pakistan risks losing foreign aid and influence in post-war Afghanistan due to its negotiating strategy under domestic pressures. President Obama urged Pakistan to expand its role in securing the region and neutralizing terrorist safe havens. Secretary of Defense Panetta acknowledged Pakistan's ties to terrorist groups but emphasized the need for cooperation. The United States acknowledges Pakistan's ties to terrorist groups but still maintains a relationship with the country to neutralize terrorist safe havens. Despite some calls for a more confrontational approach, continued engagement with Pakistan is seen as the only realistic option for stabilizing Afghanistan. The United States acknowledges Pakistan's ties to terrorist groups but maintains engagement as the only realistic option for stabilizing Afghanistan. The Administration's Pakistan policy includes increased nonmilitary aid and conditioning military aid on progress in combating militancy and fostering democratic institutions. In July 2011, up to $800 million in planned security assistance was suspended pending Pakistan's cooperation evaluation. The Administration suspended up to $800 million in security assistance to Pakistan in July 2011, and $1 billion in approved coalition support fund reimbursements remains undisbursed due to disagreements. Observers believe Pakistani behavior is unlikely to change due to long-held geostrategic perspectives in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Developments in 2011 seem to validate the view that Pakistani behavior is unlikely to change due to long-held geostrategic perspectives in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Pakistan may continue to tolerate safe havens for militant groups regardless of U.S. aid or threats, driven by the military's strategic interests. Analysts suggest strong U.S. support for Pakistan's civilian authorities to reduce conflict. The Pakistan military's strategic interests drive its schizophrenic foreign policy behavior, leading analysts to advocate for strong U.S. support for Pakistan's civilian authorities. U.S. Ambassador Cameron Munter emphasizes the need for a strong civilian government in Pakistan for successful partnerships. However, four years later, Pakistan's civilian leaders show little willingness to address critical issues. Pakistan's civilian leaders have shown reluctance to address critical security issues and tend to blame the United States for extremism in the country. This perspective, shared by many in Pakistan, overlooks the government's support for Islamist militancy in the region. The Pakistani public and officials tend to blame the United States for extremism in the country, overlooking their own support for Islamist militancy. President Obama's decision to visit India without stopping in Pakistan heightened concerns of a \"pro-India\" tilt in Washington. President Obama's decision to travel to India in 2010 without visiting Pakistan raised concerns among Pakistani officials about a perceived \"pro-India\" bias in U.S. policies. This, along with the U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation and alignment with India on regional terrorism, has led to suspicion and unease in Pakistan. Afghanistan's closer ties with India in 2011 further exacerbated these tensions. The Administration's India policies are viewed suspiciously by Pakistani leaders and citizens due to New Delhi's perspective on regional terrorism. Afghanistan's ties with India and the U.S.-Afghanistan partnership have fueled concerns in Pakistan about strategic encirclement by external forces. The events of 2011, including the Salala incident, have heightened tensions and may signal the end of a certain era. Pakistan is increasingly under threat of strategic encirclement by external forces, leading to a shift towards more narrow, issue-based engagement in bilateral relations. The events of 2011, including the Salala incident, have heightened tensions and may mark the end of a certain era in relations. Pakistan's shift towards more narrow, issue-based engagement in bilateral relations is evident in the desire for a formal, business-like relationship with the U.S. This includes new restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance to Pakistan, signaling a move towards a transactional relationship. The FY2013 congressional legislation suggests new restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance to Pakistan, leading to a more focused, issues-based engagement between the two countries. Ambassador Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's envoy to the United States, emphasized Islamabad's prerequisites for a formal relationship. Ambassador Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's envoy to the United States, outlined Islamabad's conditions for improving the bilateral relationship, including apologizing for the Salala incident, releasing suspended CSF reimbursements, increasing intelligence sharing, halting drone strikes, and focusing on trade over aid. Former U.S. diplomats acknowledge the challenges in achieving a strategic bond between the two countries. The outlook for a strategic bond between Pakistan and the United States is poor, according to former diplomats. They suggest forging a more normal relationship by reducing mutual expectations, targeting economic aid programs better, promoting business ties, and supporting initiatives for regional stability discreetly. This includes potential cooperation between Pakistan and India and dropping opposition to the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project. The outlook for a strategic bond between Pakistan and the United States is poor, according to former diplomats. They suggest forging a more normal relationship by reducing mutual expectations, targeting economic aid programs better, promoting business ties, and supporting initiatives for regional stability discreetly. This includes potential cooperation between Pakistan and India and dropping U.S. opposition to the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project. Another expert sees optimism in the humble domestic status of the Pakistani military and improvements in Pakistan-India relations, urging the Obama Administration to consider these factors and avoid a purely security-oriented approach. The Obama Administration should consider the positive trends in Pakistan-India relations and the domestic status of the Pakistani military, instead of solely focusing on security concerns. Analysts warn that Pakistan's insistence on an apology for Salala in May 2012 could harm cooperation with the United States. It is advised to pressure Islamabad while also recognizing the potential benefits of cooperation in the region. In May 2012, Pakistan's intransigence on GLOCs and demand for an apology for Salala may hinder cooperation with the United States. Analysts suggest pressuring Islamabad on counterterrorism due to reduced leverage. Some view Pakistan's stance as a \"catastrophic mistake\" driven by short-term thinking. Calls for a more adversarial U.S. policy towards Pakistan were made even before the breakdown in relations post-Salala. Some analysts advocate for a shift to a more adversarial U.S. policy towards Pakistan, suggesting \"focused hostility\" and considering Pakistan as an enemy of the United States. This could involve holding Pakistan's military and intelligence services accountable and cutting military aid. Some analysts suggest a more adversarial U.S. policy towards Pakistan, advocating for targeted sanctions, cutting military aid, and considering Pakistan as an enemy in the context of Afghanistan policy. Threatening to end assistance and retaliate if Pakistan does not comply with U.S. demands is seen as a way to ensure genuine cooperation. Some analysts advocate for a more adversarial U.S. policy towards Pakistan, including targeted sanctions and cutting military aid. Threatening to end assistance and retaliate if Pakistan does not comply with U.S. demands is seen as a way to ensure genuine cooperation. However, others believe this approach could be counterproductive and risk the U.S.-led project in Afghanistan. A Washington-based Pakistani analyst also rejects the idea of exploiting internal Pakistani disconnect, as it could strengthen conservative Islamist elements and fuel anti-American sentiments. Some analysts advocate for a more adversarial U.S. policy towards Pakistan, including targeted sanctions and cutting military aid. However, a Washington-based Pakistani analyst rejects this approach, arguing that a \"passive\" U.S. approach rooted in providing security assurances and bolstering civilian governance institutions would be more prudent. The observer questions whether the Pakistani military's current economic rapprochement with India is a tactical choice or a strategic shift. The Pakistani military's current economic rapprochement with India is questioned as a tactical choice or a strategic shift. The country's geostrategic status could suffer from international isolation despite potential tactical gains in Afghanistan. Geostrategic considerations should prompt Pakistan to prioritize energy and trade. The post-NATO government in Kabul may impact Pakistan's geostrategic status. Commentators suggest Pakistan should focus on energy and trade cooperation with neighbors instead of conflict with India and \"strategic depth\" in Afghanistan. The worldview of Pakistan's security services and public hinder civilian leaders from pursuing these policies. Pakistan's security services and domestic public hinder civilian leaders from pursuing more robust policies. Governor Salman Taseer's assassination in 2011 highlighted the challenges faced by liberal politicians in the country. Governor Salman Taseer, a liberal politician from the PPP, was assassinated in 2011 for criticizing blasphemy laws. His killer was hailed as a hero by some in Pakistani society, dealing a blow to liberal forces. Additionally, Minister Shabaz Bhatti, the only Christian member of the federal cabinet, was also attacked by gunmen. The assassination of Governor Salman Taseer and Minister Shabaz Bhatti, the only Christian member of the federal cabinet, in 2011 dealt a major blow to liberal forces in Pakistan. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton strongly condemned the attacks, expressing shock and outrage at the killings. Secretary Clinton condemned the killings of Governor Salman Taseer and Minister Shabaz Bhatti in 2011, expressing shock and outrage. President Zardari highlighted the threat of Islamist radicalism in Pakistan, emphasizing the importance of tolerance and respect for all faiths. The Taseer and Bhatti assassinations in 2011 highlighted the increasing Islamist radicalism in Pakistan. Raymond Davis, an American working at the U.S. Consulate in Lahore, shot and killed two men in self-defense, leading to a diplomatic dispute between Pakistan and the U.S. Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor and member of a covert team tracking militant groups in Pakistan, shot and killed two men in self-defense during a robbery attempt. Despite U.S. officials asserting his diplomatic immunity, Pakistani authorities accused him of murder. The controversy surrounding Davis's legal status raised concerns in Congress about reducing U.S. assistance to Pakistan. The controversy surrounding Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor in Pakistan, led to concerns in Congress about reducing U.S. assistance to Pakistan. Senator Kerry traveled to Islamabad to ease tensions, expressing U.S. leaders' sorrow over the loss of life. The CIA negotiated with the ISI for Davis's release, which was eventually secured on March 16, 2011. In late February, the CIA initiated direct negotiations with the ISI to secure Raymond Davis's release in Pakistan. After weeks of closed-door talks, political pressure, and a pledge of $2.3 million in blood money, Davis was freed on March 16, 2011. Top U.S. officials denied any quid pro quo arrangement or financial compensation. On May 2, 2011, Osama bin Laden was located and killed in Pakistan. On May 2, 2011, Osama bin Laden was located and killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, raising doubts about Pakistan's commitment to fighting extremism and leading to calls to reduce U.S. assistance. Osama bin Laden was located and killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, just 35 miles north of Islamabad. The circumstances of his death raised doubts about Pakistan's commitment to fighting extremism, leading to calls to reduce U.S. assistance. Questions arose about Pakistan's role and potential complicity in providing refuge to bin Laden. President Obama's advisor stated it was \"inconceivable\" that bin Laden did not have a support system in Pakistan. Counterterrorism advisor John Brennan stated that it was \"inconceivable\" that Osama bin Laden did not have a support system in Pakistan, leading to doubts about the country's credibility. Pakistan's military and intelligence services faced criticism for either complicity or incompetence in the search for top Al Qaeda leaders, damaging their reputation. Pakistan's credibility suffered a serious blow after failing to detect a foreign military raid that killed the world's most-wanted terrorist. Army Chief Gen. Kayani warned against future incursions, leading Parliament to condemn the U.S. raid and call for an end to drone strikes in western Pakistan. The presence of the world's most-wanted terrorist in Pakistan led to strong condemnation of the U.S. raid by Parliament. Public demonstrations turned anti-American, fueling bilateral distrust and acrimony. Congress questioned the wisdom of continued engagement with a government possibly aware of OBL's whereabouts. The demonstrations in Pakistan took on an anti-American tone, leading to increased distrust and tension between the two countries. Congress questioned the wisdom of continuing engagement with a government that may have had knowledge of Osama bin Laden's whereabouts. Some members called for greater oversight and accountability for future U.S. assistance to Pakistan, while others advocated for more engagement with the country. Despite tensions and distrust, senior Members advocate for continued engagement with Pakistan, likening it to a \"bad marriage.\" President Obama and top officials maintain a positive stance post-Abbottabad raid, though questions linger about Osama bin Laden's refuge. The U.S. lacks conclusive evidence implicating Pakistani officials. In the weeks following the Abbottabad raid, top U.S. officials maintained a positive stance towards Pakistan despite questions about Osama bin Laden's refuge. There is no conclusive evidence that official Pakistan was aware of bin Laden's whereabouts. Privately, senior Administration officials were divided over the future of the bilateral relationship, with some advocating strong reprisals for perceived Pakistani intransigence. On May 22, 2011, militants stormed Pakistan's naval base near Karachi. On May 22, 2011, militants attacked Pakistan's naval base near Karachi, resulting in casualties and destruction of U.S.-supplied aircraft. The attack was claimed by the Pakistani Taliban as revenge for bin Laden's killing. The militants attacked Pakistan's naval base near Karachi, destroying two U.S.-supplied aircraft. The Pakistani Taliban claimed it was revenge for bin Laden's killing, causing embarrassment to the military and raising concerns about the security of Pakistan's nuclear weapons. Suspicions of inside help were also raised. The attack on Pakistan's naval base near Karachi raised concerns about the security of the country's nuclear weapons. Suspicions of inside help were confirmed when a former navy commando was arrested. Three navy officers, including the base commander, are facing court-martial for negligence. This breach led to scathing criticism from the media and an unusual disciplinary action by the Pakistani military. Three navy officers, including the base commander, are to be court-martialed for negligence in connection with the attack on Pakistan's naval base near Karachi. The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) is accused of ordering the torture and murder of journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad, who suggested the attack was due to the Navy cracking down on Al Qaeda cells. The ISI is accused of ordering the torture and murder of journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad, who suggested the attack on the naval base was due to the Navy cracking down on Al Qaeda cells. A closed government inquiry into Shahzad's death began in June, with U.S. officials later claiming that senior ISI officials directed the brutal attack to silence critics. In June, U.S. officials claimed that senior ISI officials directed the brutal attack on journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad to silence critics. Admiral Mike Mullen stated that Shahzad's killing was sanctioned by the Pakistani government. A Commission of Inquiry in January 2012 was unable to identify the culprits behind Shahzad's murder, recommending that intelligence agencies be more law-abiding and accountable. The Commission of Inquiry in January 2012 was unable to identify the culprits behind Shahzad's murder. Recommendations were made for intelligence agencies to be more law-abiding and accountable. In July 2011, the Obama Administration made significant changes in security-related aid policy towards Pakistan, reallocating $440-$500 million worth of scheduled counterinsurgency training and equipment. In July 2011, the Obama Administration suspended $440-$500 million worth of counterinsurgency training and equipment aid to Pakistan due to reduced U.S. military presence and visa delays. This move was seen as a message and warning to Islamabad. The Obama Administration suspended $300 million in planned FY2011 Coalition Support Fund reimbursements to Pakistan due to visa delays, seen as a warning for improved cooperation. Pakistani military downplayed the impact, suggesting reprogramming U.S. security assistance towards development projects. The Obama Administration suspended $300 million in planned FY2011 Coalition Support Fund reimbursements to Pakistan, with no effect on future combat operations. Some observers believe this decision may lead to greater resentment from Pakistani leaders and validation for ordinary Pakistanis who view the U.S. as an unreliable ally. In October 2011, Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz referenced a memorandum allegedly \"dictated\" to him by the then-Pakistani Ambassador after bin Laden's death. In October 2011, Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz mentioned a memo allegedly \"dictated\" to him by the Pakistani Ambassador after bin Laden's death, requesting U.S. assistance to prevent a military coup and install friendly leaders for cooperation in counterterrorism efforts. In October 2011, Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz claimed he was given a memo by the Pakistani Ambassador, requesting U.S. help to prevent a military coup and install pro-U.S. leaders for counterterrorism cooperation. The resulting \"Memogate\" scandal led to an investigation by the Pakistani Supreme Court, causing pressure on President Asif Zardari and resulting in the dismissal of Ambassador Haqqani. Both deny involvement in the memo's creation, and the investigation lost momentum due to the credibility issues of Ijaz as a witness. The \"Memogate\" scandal in Pakistan involved Mansoor Ijaz claiming he received a memo from Ambassador Haqqani, requesting U.S. help to prevent a military coup. The investigation lost momentum due to Ijaz's credibility issues, and no evidence of wrongdoing by civilians was found. Despite concerns of a civil-military clash, Haqqani was allowed to leave Pakistan. Army and intelligence officers submitted statements to the Supreme Court confirming the memo's authenticity, raising fears of a conspiracy against the army. President Zardari faced concerns of a military overthrow in mid-December, with army and intelligence officers confirming the authenticity of a memo as evidence of a conspiracy. Prime Minister Gilani warned against conspiracies to remove the elected government, emphasizing the military's accountability to parliament. Despite rumors of a coup, the army publicly pledged support for democracy, with Gen. Kayani dismissing the speculation. Rumors of a military coup in Pakistan were widespread in December, leading to the army publicly pledging support for democracy. The civilian government was angered by the army and intelligence chiefs engaging the court without their involvement, with Prime Minister Gilani calling it unconstitutional. Despite concerns about the democratic government's status, the Pakistani public seems opposed to direct military rule. The Pakistani public is increasingly against direct military rule, with opposition politicians not seeking the military's help. The odds of a military coup are low due to an assertive judiciary, a vocal media, and Parliament reaffirming its supremacy. Prime Minister Gilani has softened his criticisms of the military. In January, Parliament reaffirmed its supremacy and urged the army and Supreme Court to stay within constitutional limits, reducing the likelihood of a coup. In November 2011, U.S. forces near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border were mistakenly attacked by Pakistani forces due to a lack of awareness of their presence. In November 2011, U.S. forces near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border were mistakenly attacked by Pakistani forces under heavy machine gun and mortar fire from hilltop positions inside Pakistan. U.S. commanders believed they were being attacked by Afghan insurgents and called in NATO air assets, leading to the death of 24 Pakistani soldiers before the air assault ended. Pakistani soldiers were killed during a NATO air assault after being mistakenly attacked near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. The incident led to accusations of intentional killings and a breach of Pakistan's sovereignty, resulting in the closure of NATO's ground logistics routes through Pakistan and the eviction of U.S. personnel from the Shamsi airfield. The NATO air assault on Pakistani soldiers led to anger and closure of logistics routes. Pakistan demands a formal apology from the US. The Pakistani government demands a formal and unconditional apology from the US for the NATO air assault on Pakistani soldiers. Islamabad rejected US expressions of regret and condolences, insisting on a formal apology. The Pentagon conducted an investigation, concluding that US forces acted in self-defense with no intentional targeting of Pakistanis. The US forces acted in self-defense during the NATO air assault on Pakistani soldiers, with no intentional targeting of Pakistanis. Miscommunication and poor coordination were identified as central factors, but no NATO personnel were found to have acted improperly. Pakistan's military criticized the partial blame placed on them as unjustified and unacceptable. Pakistan's perspective, released in January 2012, acknowledged that Pakistani forces fired first, but deemed it legitimate given the circumstances. The Pakistani perspective on the NATO air assault in 2012 criticized the blame placed on them as unjustified and unacceptable. They acknowledged firing first but deemed it legitimate. The document also criticized NATO for not sharing information and suggested the incident was deliberate at some level. Press reports indicated the Obama Administration was close to issuing an apology for the incident. The International Security Assistance Force criticized Pakistan for not sharing information about the near-border operation and suggested the incident was deliberate. The Obama Administration considered issuing an apology for the incident, with advocates believing it would mend relations, while opponents argued it would show weakness. Pentagon figures were concerned that an apology would imply fault. In late February, Secretary Clinton was set to apologize to Foreign Minister Khar in London, but the plan was canceled after U.S. military personnel burned Korans in Afghanistan. Later, coordinated insurgent attacks in April blamed on the Haqqani Network led to silence from those in the Administration advocating for an apology. U.S.-Pakistan relations were further strained in February 2012. In February 2012, U.S.-Pakistan relations were strained further when the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations held a hearing on Baluchistan, a Pakistani province with a violent separatist conflict. Witness called for the partition of Pakistan into substates, including Baluchistan. Representative Dana Rohrabacher offered H.Con.Res. 104 expressing Congress's support for the people of Baluchistan. In response to a hearing on Baluchistan, a province in Pakistan with a violent separatist conflict, Representative Dana Rohrabacher introduced H.Con.Res. 104 expressing Congress's support for the people of Baluchistan's right to self-determination. This resolution, although with limited support, angered the Islamabad government and caused criticism from the Pakistani media, with Prime Minister Gilani calling it an attack on Pakistani sovereignty. The Islamabad government was infuriated by congressional attention to the Baluchistan issue, leading to criticism from the Pakistani media. Prime Minister Gilani denounced it as an attack on Pakistani sovereignty, while Pakistan's Ambassador in Washington warned of its impact on bilateral relations. The Obama Administration distanced itself from the resolution, stating no policy to support Baluchistan's independence. The Salala incident prompted Islamabad to freeze relations with the US for a comprehensive review by Parliament, delayed until April 2012. The Islamabad government froze relations with the United States for a review by Parliament, completed in April 2012. Some saw it as assertiveness by the civilian government, while others viewed it as a reflection of army policy. The 14-point \"Guidelines for Revised Terms of Engagement with the United States\" was unanimously approved on April 13, 2012. The 14-point \"Guidelines for Revised Terms of Engagement with the United States\" was unanimously approved on April 13, 2012. Key demands included immediate cessation of U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan, stopping infiltration into Pakistani territory, and prohibiting the use of Pakistani airspace for transporting arms to Afghanistan. The NATO/ISAF attack was condemned as a breach of international law. The 14-point \"Guidelines for Revised Terms of Engagement with the United States\" approved on April 13, 2012, demanded an end to U.S. drone attacks, stopping infiltration into Pakistani territory, and prohibiting the use of Pakistani airspace for transporting arms to Afghanistan. The NATO/ISAF attack was condemned as a breach of international law, and Pakistan called for an unconditional apology from the United States and justice for those responsible for the Salala incident. No verbal agreements on national security would be made, and existing agreements would be terminated immediately. The 14-point \"Guidelines for Revised Terms of Engagement with the United States\" demanded an end to U.S. drone attacks, stopping infiltration into Pakistani territory, and prohibiting the use of Pakistani airspace for transporting arms to Afghanistan. Pakistan called for an apology from the United States and justice for the Salala incident. No verbal agreements on national security would be made, and existing agreements would be terminated immediately. Additionally, Pakistan requested no covert operations, private security contractors, or foreign bases on its territory, and suggested a civil nuclear deal similar to the one offered to India in 2005. The review's authors requested that the United States offer a civil nuclear deal to Pakistan similar to the one offered to India in 2005. The Obama Administration has expressed respect for Pakistani democracy and sovereignty, despite ongoing drone strikes. U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Marc Grossman, held high-level talks in Islamabad in late April. U.S. Special Representative Marc Grossman visited Islamabad for high-level talks in late April, discussing Pakistan's demands for a cessation of drone strikes. Hopes for a reset in the bilateral relationship were dashed as no breakthrough was achieved. Pakistan's demands for a cessation of drone strikes remain a major point of contention. The CIA is unlikely to give up the ability to strike \"high-value targets\" or continue \"signature strikes\" targeting low-level militants. Reports suggest that Pakistani leaders may refuse to open NATO's ground supply lines until drone strikes are stopped. The U.S. government is withholding $1 billion in military reimbursements and counterterrorism funding from Pakistan until an agreement is reached on bilateral reengagement. Pakistan is also demanding an unconditional apology for the inadvertent deaths of Pakistani soldiers at Salala. The issue of drone strikes, which are considered likely to result in civilian deaths, remains a major point of contention. Pakistani leaders may refuse to open NATO's ground supply lines to Afghanistan via the Karachi port until drone strikes are ended. At present, key issues between the U.S. and Pakistan remain unresolved, with the U.S. withholding $1 billion in military reimbursements. Pakistan insists on following Parliament's recommendations regarding the Salala incident. The NATO summit in Chicago focused on future engagement in Afghanistan, with Pakistan boycotting a previous conference after the Salala incident. The NATO summit in Chicago, the first ever held in an American city outside of Washington, DC, focused on decisions about the alliance's future engagement in Afghanistan. Despite U.S.-Pakistan tensions and unresolved issues, President Zardari received a personal call to attend from the NATO Secretary-General. President Obama apparently refused to meet in person with attendees. At the NATO summit in Chicago, President Zardari received a personal call to attend from the NATO Secretary-General. However, tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan overshadowed the meeting, with President Obama refusing to meet with Zardari in person. This snub, combined with the absence of an apology for the Salala incident, left the Pakistanis feeling chastened. Despite some observers in Pakistan considering Zardari's participation embarrassing, Foreign Minister Khar remained optimistic. At the NATO summit, President Zardari faced tensions with the U.S. and was snubbed by President Obama. Despite criticism, Foreign Minister Khar defended Pakistan's participation. Urdu editorials praised Zardari for standing up to international pressure. In Pakistan, Shakil Afridi was convicted of treason and sentenced to 33 years in prison. On May 23, 2012, a tribal court in northwestern Pakistan convicted Shakil Afridi of treason and sentenced him to 33 years in prison for working with the CIA in collecting DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound. The sentence sparked outrage in the United States. The sentence of 33 years in prison for Shakil Afridi, convicted of treason for working with the CIA to collect DNA samples from Osama bin Laden's compound, caused widespread outrage in the United States. The Obama Administration and Senate officials criticized the sentence as \"shocking and outrageous,\" arguing that Afridi should be praised, not punished. The Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee criticized the punishment of Shakil Afridi for helping the US in capturing Osama bin Laden. Islamabad defends the legal process but doubts remain about the conviction. Some Pakistani commentators question the conviction of Shakil Afridi, citing concerns about the legal process and his right to appeal. The Administration's assessment in March 2011 noted static progress in Afghanistan and Pakistan policy, with improved cooperation in counterinsurgency efforts but no significant progress in the last quarter of 2010. The assessment in March 2011 highlighted improved cooperation in counterinsurgency efforts but noted no progress in effectively executing the COIN cycle in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, raising concerns about the lack of a clear path to defeat the insurgency in Pakistan. The lack of 'hold' and 'build' planning in Pakistan complicates efforts to defeat the insurgency. Despite a certification by Secretary Clinton in March 2011, there is still no clear path forward in combating terrorist groups in the region. The certification in 2009 allowed the release of security-related aid to Pakistan, contingent on Islamabad's efforts to combat terrorist groups and cease support to extremists. However, skepticism arose following revelations about Osama bin Laden and concerns about Pakistan's actions against the Haqqani Network in the FATA region. The certification in 2009 allowed the release of security-related aid to Pakistan, contingent on efforts to combat terrorist groups. However, skepticism arose following revelations about Osama bin Laden and concerns about Pakistan's actions against the Haqqani Network in the FATA region. The certification met with skepticism and appeared driven by political considerations rather than ground realities. The Secretary certified that Pakistan met legal requirements for aid in 2009, but no similar certification has been made for FY2012. The Administration's assessment in September 2011 showed little progress in civilian control and stable government in Pakistan. The assessment in September 2011 showed little progress in civilian control and stable government in Pakistan, with \"significant successes\" against Al Qaeda. However, indicators for enhancing civilian control and stable government, developing COIN capabilities, and involving the international community in stabilizing Pakistan remained static or declined due to decreased bilateral security cooperation. The decrease in bilateral security cooperation with Pakistan was attributed to the lack of progress in involving the international community in stabilizing Pakistan. The IMF Stand-By Arrangement has been on hold since August 2010, with limited progress in funding the World Bank Multi-Donor Trust Fund and the U.N. Pakistan Humanitarian Response Plan. The Pentagon's recent report to Congress noted some positive trends in Afghanistan but stated that the Taliban insurgency and its al Qaeda affiliates remain a challenge. The Pentagon's recent report to Congress highlighted positive trends in Afghanistan but emphasized the ongoing threat posed by the Taliban insurgency and its al Qaeda affiliates operating from sanctuaries in Pakistan. The security situation in eastern Afghanistan was described as volatile, with Kabul facing persistent security threats planned and controlled from Pakistan. The security situation in eastern Afghanistan is volatile, with persistent security threats in Kabul planned and controlled from Pakistan. Pakistan's actions, including selective counterinsurgency operations and provision of insurgent safe havens, undermine security in Afghanistan and threaten ISAF's campaign. Pakistan's desire for a Pashtun-led Afghan government with limited Indian influence motivates its support for insurgent sanctuaries. The U.S. government believes that Pakistan's support for insurgent sanctuaries in Afghanistan is motivated by its desire for a Pashtun-led Afghan government with limited Indian influence. U.S.-Pakistan relations have also been strained by issues such as freedom of travel for U.S. diplomats in Pakistan. The U.S.-Pakistan relations have been strained by issues such as freedom of travel for U.S. diplomats in Pakistan and the revelation of U.S. citizens working for the ISI to influence U.S. Kashmir policy. President Obama has not visited Pakistan since taking office, and the bilateral Strategic Dialogue has not had a formal session since October. The U.S.-Pakistan relations have been strained by issues such as freedom of travel for U.S. diplomats in Pakistan and the revelation of U.S. citizens working for the ISI to influence U.S. Kashmir policy. President Obama has not visited Pakistan since taking office, and the bilateral Strategic Dialogue has not had a formal session since October. High-level interactions, especially among military and intelligence officials, have continued to be frequent, with a notable late 2011/early 2012 lapse. In October 2011, Secretary Clinton led a high-level delegation to Islamabad, accompanied by CIA Director David Petraeus and Gen. Martin Dempsey. In late 2011/early 2012, Secretary Clinton led a high-level delegation to Islamabad to address the issue of militant safe havens in western Pakistan. The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue has been postponed indefinitely. The United States will not tolerate militant safe havens in western Pakistan and will take action if Pakistan does not address the issue. The U.S.-Pakistan Strategic Dialogue has been postponed indefinitely, but engagement continues at other levels. Secretary Clinton met with Foreign Minister Khar in London to convey U.S. respect for Parliament's review of bilateral relations and eagerness to resume discussions on counterterrorism. Clinton met with Foreign Minister Khar in London, expressing U.S. respect for Parliament's review of bilateral relations. She emphasized the eagerness to resume discussions on counterterrorism and Afghanistan. Khar mentioned Islamabad's focus on upcoming Senate elections before addressing Parliament's recommendations. Amb. Grossman later met with President Zardari in Tajikistan, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to a constructive relationship with Pakistan. In March, Amb. Grossman met with President Zardari in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, emphasizing the U.S. commitment to a constructive relationship with Pakistan. President Obama also reiterated the desire for cooperation on counterterrorism and Afghanistan during a meeting with Prime Minister Gilani in Seoul. In March, senior U.S. and Pakistani military commanders held formal talks in Rawalpindi to discuss border coordination issues. In April, Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides met with Foreign Minister Khar in Islamabad to build upon previous conversations. The United States welcomed Pakistan's potential participation in the upcoming Chicago NATO summit. In April, high-level officials from the US, including Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides and USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah, visited Pakistan to strengthen ties through civilian assistance and development support. Amb. Grossman also visited Islamabad during the same month. In late April, Amb. Grossman visited Islamabad for the 6th Trilateral Core Group meeting between the United States, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. He focused on the U.S. desire to see GLOCs quickly reopened, while Pakistan reiterated its opposition to further drone strikes. Amb. Grossman and Foreign Secretary Jalil Abbas Jilani met for the parliamentary review but made no breakthroughs on key issues. The U.S. wanted GLOCs reopened, while Pakistan opposed further drone strikes. The U.S.-Pakistan-Afghanistan Tripartite Commission met for the 35th time in Rawalpindi. Missile strikes in Pakistan were reportedly launched by American unmanned aerial vehicles. The Tripartite Commission, established in 2003 for discussions on Afghan stability and border security, met for the 35th time in Rawalpindi. American Predator and Reaper drones launched controversial but effective missile strikes in Pakistan, overseen by the CIA and approved by President Obama. Over 118 drone strikes occurred in 2010, with 70 more reported in 2011. President Obama personally approves the CIA's drone strike program targeting \"kill list,\" with 118 strikes in 2010 and 70 in 2011 in western Pakistan. The strikes have been effective against Al Qaeda but criticized for civilian casualties and violating Pakistani sovereignty, fueling anti-American sentiment. The Pakistani government condemns drone strikes as a violation of territorial integrity and international law, fueling anti-American sentiment. Despite protests, it is believed that Pakistan has allowed and even provided intelligence for the strikes. Most observers believe Pakistan has tacitly allowed and provided intelligence for drone strikes, despite official condemnation. Informed domestic debate exists, with some analysts supporting the tactic as effective against Al Qaeda and its allies in FATA. The drone campaign's messaging to Pakistan is evident, with major strikes following significant events like Raymond Davis's release in March 2011. The drone campaign in Pakistan has been effective against Al Qaeda and its allies in FATA. Messaging to Pakistan is evident, with major strikes following significant events like Raymond Davis's release in March 2011. Top Administration figures differ on the wisdom of continuing UAV strikes, with some urging the CIA to reduce the pace of its strikes. At the 2012 NATO summit, President Obama declined to meet with his Pakistani counterpart. There are differing opinions within the Administration on the use of UAV strikes in Pakistan, with some urging the CIA to reduce the pace of strikes. While UAV attacks are seen as tactically effective, concerns exist about worsening relations with Pakistan and destabilizing the country. A mid-2011 White House review reaffirmed support for the CIA campaign but also implemented changes, including a greater role for the State Department in strike decisions. The mid-2011 White House review reaffirmed support for the CIA drone campaign in Pakistan but made changes to reduce \"signature strikes\" and involve the State Department in strike decisions. The changes aimed to address concerns about destabilizing Pakistan and strained relations. The changes in the drone program aimed to reduce \"signature strikes\" and involve the State Department in strike decisions. President Obama defended the program, claiming minimal civilian casualties, but independent analysts dispute this, estimating 145-535 civilian deaths. Despite claims of minimal civilian casualties and tight control over the drone program, independent analysts estimate that 145-535 civilians, including children, have been killed. The violence in western Pakistan has not subsided despite the killing of militants and commanders. With a NATO troop drawdown in Afghanistan, the U.S. government may have no better option than to continue using drones. Close U.S. links with Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) are also a factor. Many believe the U.S. government may have to continue using drone strikes despite concerns about civilian casualties and the ISI's involvement in supporting Islamist militants. In 2008, doubts about ISI's activities and aims compounded, with concerns about its use of militant proxies, extralegal abductions, and manipulation of politics. The agency is under army control, with the Director-General seen as deputy to the Chief of Army Staff. Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam replaced Lt. Gen. Pasha as DG-ISI in March 2012. Islam was previously commander of the army's V Corp in Karachi. Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam replaced Lt. Gen. Pasha as DG-ISI in March 2012. He received military training in the United States in 2002-2003 and is considered more open and moderate than his predecessors. U.S. officials have accused ISI of supporting Afghan insurgents. Islam may be a candidate for the COAS position after Kayani's retirement. Lt. Gen. Zaheer-ul-Islam, who replaced Lt. Gen. Pasha as DG-ISI in March 2012, is considered a candidate for the COAS position after Kayani's retirement. U.S. officials have accused the ISI of actively supporting Afghan insurgents with money, supplies, and planning guidance, leading to ongoing concerns about sanctuaries in Pakistan aiding Afghan militants. Reports suggest increased ISI-Taliban contacts in late 2011, with the ISI allegedly encouraging more violence and supplying high-powered explosives. The ISI increased direct contacts with the Taliban in late 2011, encouraging violence and supplying high-powered explosives. A leaked NATO report revealed ongoing support from the ISI to Afghan insurgents, with senior Taliban leaders regularly meeting with ISI personnel for strategic advice. The ISI continues to support the Taliban leadership, advising on strategy and maintaining close ties. Pakistan's foreign minister dismissed the report as old news. The ISI is also linked to anti-India terrorist groups, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attack. The ISI is regularly linked to anti-India terrorist groups, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attack. Secretary of State Clinton stated that elements of the Pakistani government are ambivalent about cracking down on terrorism, with relationships between terrorist groups and the military and intelligence services. Pakistani officials deny cooperation between ISI and militants, but independent observers see Pakistan's security services increasingly involved. Pakistan's security services are believed to be infiltrated by Islamist extremists, as per leaked U.S. diplomatic cables. Some analysts suggest that the security services can be divided into two groups, with one led by Gen. Kayani being fundamentally nationalist. Some analysts argue that Pakistan's security services can be divided into two groups: one led by Gen. Kayani is nationalist, while the other, driven by Islamist ideology, is currently leaderless. CIA-ISI relations were strained even before the Raymond Davis incident, with American officials frustrated at the lack of Pakistani military action against militants. The Raymond Davis episode strained CIA-ISI relations further, leading to Pakistani scrutiny of U.S. security presence. ISI demanded accountability for all CIA operatives in Pakistan after Davis, a CIA contractor, was revealed. OBL's death highlighted alleged ISI ties to extremism. Following the death of Osama bin Laden in May 2011, Pakistan cracked down on its citizens working with the CIA and allowed American investigators access to bin Laden's widows. A Pakistani newspaper revealed the purported name of the CIA's Islamabad station chief a week after bin Laden's death. After Osama bin Laden's death, Pakistan granted American investigators access to his three widows in custody. A Pakistani newspaper, believed to be close to the military and intelligence services, exposed the name of the CIA's Islamabad station chief a week later. U.S. officials suspected these disclosures were intentional to show ISI's power and express displeasure with U.S. policies. Post-raid, ISI leaders faced increased scrutiny over collusion with Afghan insurgents. After the OBL raid, ISI leadership faced scrutiny over collusion with Afghan insurgents, with U.S. evidence of tipped-off bomb-making facilities in FATA. Pakistani military denied allegations as \"totally false and malicious.\" After the OBL raid, Pakistani army units found abandoned bomb-making sites in FATA, leading to accusations of tipped-off targets. Pakistani military denied collusion, citing incorrect intelligence. U.S. officials criticized Pakistan's tribal elder permission process for allowing militants to escape. Pakistan's insistence on gaining permission from local tribal elders before entering the area allowed militants to escape. A Yemeni Al Qaeda operative was arrested in Karachi with U.S.-provided intelligence, seen as a Pakistani effort to mend relations with Washington. Pakistan pledged to grant more than three dozen visas to CIA officers in June. The capture of a key courier between Al Qaeda's leaders was seen as a Pakistani effort to mend relations with Washington. In June, Pakistan pledged to grant visas to CIA officers. Ilyas Kashmiri and Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, top Al Qaeda militants, were reported killed in drone strikes. Pakistan also announced the arrest of three senior individuals in September. Libyan explosives expert Atiyah Abd al-Rahman was killed in an August strike in North Waziristan. Pakistan announced the arrest of three senior Al Qaeda operatives near Quetta with CIA assistance. Bilateral intelligence cooperation targeting Al Qaeda and the \"Pakistani Taliban\" has continued despite worsening government relations. The CIA has reportedly established a network of \"secret friends\" in Pakistan. The CIA has reportedly established a network of \"secret friends\" in Pakistan, including security officials and intelligence operatives, to counter less trustworthy army and ISI officials. Pakistani leaders have historically sought strategic depth with Central Asia and India through friendly relations with Afghanistan. President-General Zia ul-Haq supported Afghan mujahideen against Soviet invaders. Pakistani leaders have long sought access to Central Asia and \"strategic depth\" with regard to India through friendly relations with neighboring Afghanistan. President-General Zia ul-Haq supported Afghan mujahideen against Soviet invaders, and later Islamabad supported the Afghan Taliban regime. The British colonialists divided the Pashtun tribes with the Durand Line, a disputed border not accepted by Afghan leaders. Both Pakistan and Afghanistan have at times fanned Pashtun nationalism, causing tension between the two countries. The Durand Line, a disputed border dividing Pashtun tribes, has caused tension between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Both countries play key roles in combating Islamic militancy, but their ongoing acrimony is detrimental to U.S. interests. There is little agreement between Pakistan and the U.S. beyond the shared interest in a stable Afghanistan. Pakistan and the U.S. have differing goals in Afghanistan, with Pakistan seeking influence and dependence on Kabul, while the U.S. aims for an independent and capable Afghanistan that may cooperate more with India. The U.S. aims for an independent Afghanistan that may cooperate more with India, while Pakistan seeks influence in Kabul. Pakistan's use of proxies like the Quetta Shura and Haqqani Network could increase its leverage in the reconciliation process with Washington seeking Islamabad's support for talks. Pakistan's leverage in the Afghan reconciliation process is increasing with continued reliance on Islamabad. Tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan are evident in their differing approaches, with Americans wanting to \"fight, talk, build\" and Pakistanis opting for a \"cease-fire, talk, wait for the Americans to leave\" strategy. Pakistani officials are confused by the lack of clarity in U.S. goals for Afghanistan and pressure to use force against militants in North Waziristan. Pakistani officials are taking a \"cease-fire, talk, wait for the Americans to leave\" approach in the Afghan reconciliation process. There is confusion over U.S. goals for Afghanistan and pressure to use force against militants in North Waziristan. Concerns are raised about rewarding Pakistani intransigence and the ISI's alleged support for insurgent forces. The ISI has been accused of trying to reinstate the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Pakistani cooperation is seen as crucial for stability in Afghanistan, despite troubled relations with Kabul. Afghan insurgents find safe havens in Pakistani cities, hindering pacification efforts in southern and eastern Afghanistan. Afghan insurgents find safe havens in Pakistani cities like Quetta and Karachi, hindering pacification efforts in southern and eastern Afghanistan. Declassified U.S. government documents show that Taliban's resurgence in the mid-2000s was possible due to sanctuaries in western Pakistan's tribal agencies. Despite some improvement in Pakistan-Afghanistan ties, Afghan officials still accuse Pakistan of supporting terrorism in Afghanistan. Afghan wariness of Pakistani influence remains strong. Despite warming Pakistan-Afghanistan ties in 2010 and early 2011, Afghan officials openly accuse Pakistan of aiding terrorism in Afghanistan. Afghan wariness of Pakistani influence persists, with analysts skeptical of Islamabad's use of \"Pashtun jihadi proxies\" to exert dominance over its neighbors. Islamabad is concerned about the potential for the U.S. to withdraw from Afghanistan, as seen in the 1990s. Pakistani leaders are concerned about the U.S. potentially withdrawing from Afghanistan, as it could impact Pakistani interests. President Obama's announcement of a military drawdown in 2011 signaled a focus on an exit strategy, raising doubts about long-term U.S. commitment to stabilizing the region. Pakistani leaders emphasize the importance of Afghan stability for Pakistan. In April 2011, Pakistani leaders traveled to Kabul to upgrade the Afghanistan-Pakistan Joint Commission and accelerate the peace process. Prime Minister Gilani's meetings with Afghan officials raised concerns among American observers as he appeared to steer Kabul towards closer ties with Islamabad and China, potentially distancing from the United States. In June 2011, Prime Minister Gilani and President Karzai reaffirmed their commitment to an \"Afghan-led and Afghan-owned\" peace process, criticizing America's \"imperial designs\" and emphasizing the need for Kabul and Islamabad to take ownership. They also signed a 23-point \"Islamabad Declaration\" to strengthen ties across various issues. In June 2011, the Joint Commission meeting between Gilani and President Karzai reaffirmed their commitment to an \"Afghan-led and Afghan-owned\" peace process. They signed a 23-point \"Islamabad Declaration\" to strengthen ties. However, tensions arose in the summer of 2011 due to increased \"reverse infiltration\" incidents, leading to friction between Islamabad and Kabul. In June 2011, up to 400 militants from Afghanistan's Kunar province killed several people in a cross-border raid. Afghan officials accused Pakistan of firing over 760 rockets into Afghan provinces, resulting in at least 60 deaths. Pakistan denied involvement in the attacks, but tensions between the two countries escalated, with some in Afghanistan viewing the attacks as part of a larger Pakistani effort to exert control over Afghanistan. Pakistan-Afghanistan relations deteriorated further in September 2011 after the assassination of Afghan High Peace Council chairman Burhanuddin Rabbani in Kabul. Afghan officials suspected ISI involvement, leading to criticism of Pakistan's lack of cooperation in the investigation. Pakistani officials denied any role in the assassination. The ISI is suspected of playing a role in the murder of Afghan High Peace Council chairman Burhanuddin Rabbani in Kabul. Afghan officials criticized Islamabad for not cooperating in the investigation. Pakistani officials denied involvement, but Afghan President accused Pakistan of supporting terrorism. Afghan intelligence claimed to have stopped a plot to assassinate Karzai, with culprits based in FATA linked to Al Qaeda and the Haqqanis. Islamabad supports peace efforts with the Afghan Taliban. Pakistan, affiliated with Al Qaeda and the Haqqanis, halted a plot to assassinate Karzai. Islamabad endorses peace efforts with the Afghan Taliban, insisting Kabul government sets parameters. Motivated to deny India influence in post-conflict Afghanistan, Pakistan controls Taliban figures for negotiations. In 2010, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, key aide to Mullah Omar, was captured. Pakistan's desire to deny India influence in post-conflict Afghanistan led to the capture of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in 2010. The ISI may have orchestrated the arrest to facilitate talks with Taliban commanders for reconciliation negotiations. Pakistan also attempted to broker a reconciliation between the Kabul government and the Haqqani Network. In mid-2010, Pakistan initiated efforts to broker reconciliation between the Kabul government and the Haqqani Network, raising concerns about Islamabad exploiting the situation for maximal influence in post-conflict Kabul. NATO facilitated secret meetings between QST figures, Haqqani Network representatives, and Afghan officials in Kabul. Pakistan exerted significant influence in post-conflict Kabul by facilitating secret meetings between QST figures, Haqqani Network representatives, and Afghan officials. There were conflicting reports on the involvement of Pakistani officials in these meetings. The U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan noted Pakistan's reluctance to allow Taliban leaders to travel to Kabul for reconciliation talks, indicating Islamabad's control over top Afghan insurgents. In late 2011, the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan raised concerns about Pakistan's influence over top Afghan insurgents, suggesting that Islamabad was hindering reconciliation talks by not allowing Taliban leaders to travel to Kabul. Afghan President Karzai also criticized Pakistan for not allowing independent negotiations with insurgent leaders based in Pakistan. However, by early 2012, Islamabad seemed to be cooperating with the U.S.-Taliban negotiating initiative. During an April visit to Islamabad, Karzai reportedly requested Pakistani support for the reconciliation process. In early 2012, the Islamabad government appeared to be cooperating with the U.S.-Taliban negotiating initiative. Afghan President Karzai asked Pakistani leaders to influence the Taliban for negotiations, which was initially deemed unrealistic by Foreign Minister Khar. However, Prime Minister Gilani later made an open appeal to the Taliban for participation in Afghan reconciliation and peace efforts, which was welcomed by the Obama Administration. Prime Minister Gilani issued an open appeal to the Afghan Taliban leadership for national reconciliation and peace, which was welcomed by the Obama Administration. Concerns persist about Pakistan's ties with Afghan insurgent groups. The Haqqani terrorist network based in FATA is a significant concern. The Haqqani Network, led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son Sirajuddin, is considered the most dangerous Afghan insurgent group. They pose a strategic threat to Afghan stability and U.S. national security interests in the region. The Haqqanis maintain close ties with Afghanistan's most capable insurgent group. The Haqqani Network is a significant threat to Afghan stability and U.S. national security interests. They are Afghanistan's most potent insurgent group with strong ties to al-Qaeda. Military offensives are deemed necessary to address the group beyond 2012, as Pakistani officials have been reluctant to take action against them. The Haqqani Network poses a significant threat to Afghan stability and U.S. national security interests. Pakistani officials have been hesitant to launch military offensives against the group, citing stretched forces and a historical relationship with Jalaluddin Haqqani. This inaction has led to high-visibility attacks in Afghanistan that have angered U.S. and Afghan officials. The Haqqani Network, representing the army and ISI, is seen as Islamabad's best chance to exert Pashtun-based influence in post-ISAF Afghanistan. They have carried out high-profile attacks in Afghanistan, including assaults on Kabul's Intercontinental Hotel and the U.S. Embassy compound, leading to strained U.S.-Pakistan relations. The attack on the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul on September 13, 2011, injured 77 American troops and killed 5 Afghans, including 5 police officers and 6 children. This assault significantly impacted U.S.-Pakistan relations and raised concerns about the security situation in Afghanistan. The attack on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul was seen as a sign of insurgents' weakness, undermining the narrative of Afghanistan's security. Admiral Mullen urged Pakistani military action against Haqqani bases, escalating tensions with accusations of ISI supporting a \"proxy war.\" Secretary Panetta issued a perceived ultimatum to Pakistan. The ISI was accused of using the Haqqanis for a \"proxy war\" in Afghanistan. Secretary Panetta warned of taking necessary steps to protect US forces from future Haqqani attacks. Mullen stated that the Haqqani network is supported by Pakistan's ISI. Mullen stated that the Haqqani network acts as an arm of Pakistan's ISI, responsible for various attacks including the truck bomb attack on September 13 and the assault on the US embassy. Panetta emphasized the need to put pressure on Pakistan. The Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul was attacked on the 28th, along with other effective operations. Secretary Panetta emphasized the need to pressure Pakistan to address the issue from their side. This signaled a new level of U.S. intolerance for Pakistan's regional \"double-game.\" President Obama later stated that the intelligence on the situation was not clear. The Obama Administration did not fully align with Admiral Mullen's charges of Pakistan's \"double-game.\" President Obama mentioned unclear intelligence on the ISI-Haqqani relationship but urged Pakistan to address the issue. Secretary Clinton's attitude hardened after the Wardak truck bombing, leading to further attacks by Haqqani fighters in Afghanistan. The Wardak truck bombing was a turning point in hardening Secretary Clinton's attitude towards the Haqqanis. Pakistan denies responsibility for attacks in Afghanistan and rejects claims of supporting the Haqqanis. The Pakistani military refuted allegations of conducting a proxy war and warned the US of potentially losing an ally. President Zardari also weighed in on the issue. The Pakistani military denied conducting a proxy war or supporting the Haqqanis, calling Mullen's statements \"very unfortunate.\" Foreign Minister Khar warned the US of potentially losing an ally due to such allegations. President Zardari criticized \"verbal assaults\" damaging the bilateral relationship. Pakistan has been trying to reconcile with the Haqqanis, but their links with Al Qaeda remain a major obstacle. Pakistan has been attempting to facilitate reconciliation between the Haqqanis and the Kabul government for two years. However, the close ties between the Haqqanis and Al Qaeda have hindered progress. Pakistani military officials believe they can influence the Haqqanis to negotiate, as a military assault on their bases could lead to a wider conflict. Pakistan's military and intelligence agencies are seen as having significant influence over the Haqqanis. Military officials claim they can bring the Haqqanis to the negotiating table to avoid a conflict that Pakistan may not win. Islamabad's involvement in negotiations would give them a central role, which some in Washington and other capitals want to prevent. The Obama Administration is considering designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under U.S. law, with pressure from senior Senators and the Armed Services Committee Chairman. The Obama Administration is considering designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) under U.S. law, with pressure from senior Senators. Seven Haqqani leaders are already under U.S. sanctions, but negotiations with the Haqqani leadership complicate the decision. The Obama Administration is considering designating the Haqqani Network as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) under U.S. law, with pressure from senior Senators. Secretary Clinton designated operational commander Badruddin Haqqani under Executive Order 13224 in 2011. The potential decision on an FTO designation is complicated by negotiations with the Haqqani leadership for sustainable peace in Afghanistan. The Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act of 2011 (S. 1959) passed the Senate but has not emerged from the House committee. U.S. congressional frustration with the Administration's overdue \"formal review\" persists. The Haqqani Network Terrorist Designation Act of 2011 (S. 1959) passed the Senate but has not advanced in the House committee. U.S. congressional frustration with the Administration's delay in the formal review on the FTO designation has increased in 2012. Ammonium nitrate (AN) is a widely used fertilizer and chemical explosives precursor in Afghanistan, with most IEDs using AN. Illicit AN in Afghanistan is believed to come through transshipments since the government banned it in 2010. The majority of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) used by Islamist insurgents in Afghanistan utilize ammonium nitrate (AN), which is believed to be smuggled from Pakistan since the Afghan government banned it in 2010. Data from the Pentagon shows a peak in total IED attacks in the summer of 2011, but improved detection and clearing capabilities have led to a decline in the effective IED attack rate. The Intelligence Authorization Act of FY2012 required a report on countering IED-related networks in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The U.S. government is urging Islamabad to adjust Pakistani national laws to restrict access to AN or enhance border security measures. The U.S. government is urging Pakistan to adjust national laws to restrict access to explosive materials and enhance border security measures to prevent their movement into Afghanistan. Efforts include diplomatic, law enforcement, and science and technology initiatives involving various agencies. The U.S. government is involved in diplomatic, law enforcement, and science and technology initiatives to combat the illicit cross-border diversion and trafficking of chemical explosives precursors. JIEDDO, SRAP staff, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement are engaged in these efforts, along with Operation Global Shield, a multilateral law enforcement operation launched in 2010. The U.S. government is involved in combating cross-border diversion and trafficking of chemical explosives precursors. A collaborative effort with international organizations has seen success. Experts recommend adding urea fertilizer granules to Ammonium Nitrate (AN) to complicate processing for explosives. Other options include adding colored dyes or radio frequency identification tags to track AN shipments. Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan, is the country's largest fertilizer complex. Pakarab Fertilizers Ltd. in Multan, Pakistan, is the country's largest fertilizer complex, producing over 300,000 metric tons of Ammonium Nitrate (AN) annually since 2004. Legislation in Islamabad aims to further restrict AN and other precursors, but remains in draft stage. Options to track AN shipments include adding colored dyes or radio frequency identification tags. The Islamabad government has pending legislation to restrict Ammonium Nitrate (AN) and other precursors, but it remains in draft stage. The United States relies on Pakistani authorities to combat corruption, while NATO uses ground and air lines of communication through Pakistan for supplying its forces. The United States and NATO rely on Pakistani authorities for logistics support in Afghanistan. However, due to Pakistan's anger over incidents and its strained relationship with Washington, the supply routes have been closed for six months. In response to anger over incidents and strained relations with Washington, supply routes in Pakistan have been regularly attacked by militants, leading to destruction of trucks and deaths of drivers. Truck drivers often have to pay bribes to police to reach the Afghan border from Karachi. The route from Karachi to Kandahar, passing through Quetta and the Chaman border crossing, has been targeted by militants, resulting in destroyed trucks and deaths of Pakistani drivers. Truck drivers often pay bribes to officials to reach the Afghan border, with some trucks being emptied of their cargo for sale in Peshawar markets. To reduce reliance on Pakistan, the U.S. military began testing alternative routes, such as the Northern Distribution Network from Central Asia and Russia. The U.S. military started testing alternative routes, like the Northern Distribution Network from Central Asia and Russia, to reduce reliance on Pakistan for supplies. The NDN now carries over half of NATO's supplies, but only nonlethal cargo. Despite the preference for Pakistan due to speed and cost, the U.S. has expanded aerial and NDN routes, even though they are more expensive and involve authoritarian regimes in Central Asia. Loss of Pakistani routes has had less impact on Afghan operations than expected. The loss of Pakistani GLOCs has had less impact on Afghan operations than expected. The U.S. has expanded aerial and NDN routes, despite their higher costs and reliance on authoritarian regimes in Central Asia. Gen. Allen stated that the closure of the GLOCs has not negatively affected the campaign in Afghanistan. The Pentagon's April report highlighted the strategic concern of the continued closure of the GLOCs, which has hindered Afghan security forces by causing a backlog of equipment. Over 4,100 vehicles are stranded in Pakistan due to the closure, but airlift capabilities have mitigated the impact on communication equipment and weapons movement. NATO will need to remove at least 100,000 troops from Afghanistan. In withdrawing from Afghanistan, NATO must remove over 100,000 shipping containers and 70,000 vehicles worth $30 billion. U.S. commanders pushed for the reopening of Pakistani GLOCs as the spring fighting season approached in 2012. Pakistani political and military leaders agreed to reopen the GLOCs in mid-March, with parliamentary approval finalized in mid-April. In mid-March, Pakistani political and military leaders agreed to reopen the GLOCs, with indications of imminent reopening by senior officials in mid-May. Islamabad was reportedly seeking a fee of $1,500-1,800 per truck, but negotiations continued just days before the Chicago summit. Negotiations for reopening the GLOCs between the US and Pakistan were ongoing before the Chicago summit. Initially, Islamabad sought a fee of $1,500-1,800 per truck, but just days before the summit, they proposed a drastic increase to $5,000 per truck. This significant price hike was deemed unacceptable by the Senate Armed Services Committee due to the historical agreement of free GLOC usage in exchange for CSF reimbursements. The Pentagon is facing opposition to the proposed $5,000 fee for Pakistani GLOC usage, with Senate members calling it \"extortion.\" Negotiations on the issue have not yet been resolved. Pakistan has been dealing with Islamist extremism and militancy since 2001, with a peak in attacks and victims in 2009. Additionally, there is a separatist insurgency in the country. Since 2001, Pakistan has faced Islamist extremism and militancy, with a peak in attacks and victims in 2009. There is also a separatist insurgency in Baluchistan and politically motivated violence in Karachi. The U.S. NCTC reports a decline in terrorist incidents since 2009, but Pakistan still ranks third globally in both measures. Suicide bombing is a relatively new issue in the country. The NCTC reports a significant decline in terrorist incidents and deaths in Pakistan since 2009, ranking the country third globally after Afghanistan and Iraq. Suicide bombings have increased in Pakistan, with a peak in 2009 before decreasing in subsequent years. Despite a drop in Islamist attacks in 2011, militants have targeted the country's military and intelligence institutions. In recent years, militants in Pakistan have targeted the country's military and intelligence institutions, leading to a nearly 20% drop in rates of Islamist attacks in 2011. The government is sometimes seen as being influenced by terrorists, and there are various Islamist militant groups operating in the country. The Islamabad government is viewed as sometimes being influenced by terrorists, with various Islamist militant groups operating in Pakistan. These groups have become more intermingled and mutually supportive since 2009. Concerns persist about Al Qaeda operating in Pakistan, although the group has weakened in recent years. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) emerged as a coherent grouping in late 2007. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) emerged in late 2007, representing Pakistan's tribal agencies and settled districts. The Quetta Shura Taliban and Haqqani Network are based in different regions of FATA. Punjab province houses various Islamist militant groups with global jihadist aspirations. The Haqqani Network of Afghan insurgents is based in North Waziristan and Kurram agencies of the FATA. Punjab province in Pakistan is home to Islamist militant groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) with ties to the ISI. The LeT is seen as a growing threat to U.S. national security and is considered the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia. The Raymond Davis affair may have exposed new U.S. intelligence operations against the LeT in Pakistan. The Raymond Davis affair may have revealed new U.S. intelligence operations against the LeT in Pakistan, identified as the most dangerous terrorist group in South Asia. The LeT's charity wing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), has an expanding infrastructure in Pakistan. Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States criticizes the country's focus on U.S. violations of sovereignty rather than combating jihadist ideology that has caused many Pakistani deaths. Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's former Ambassador to the United States, criticizes Pakistan's focus on U.S. sovereignty violations instead of addressing the jihadist ideology responsible for numerous Pakistani deaths. He condemns the Supreme Court for targeting the civilian government over pursuing terrorist leaders. Haqqani believes this misguided mindset was fostered by military dictators to divert public attention. In Haqqani's view, the national mindset was manipulated by military dictators to shift focus from serious social and economic debates. The Pakistan army has deployed 150,000 troops in response to increased militancy, with over 3,000 soldiers killed in combat. Conflict has affected all FATA agencies, with notable offensives in Swat Valley and South Waziristan in 2009. U.S. government assessments paint a discouraging picture. The Pakistan army has deployed 150,000 troops in response to increased militancy, with over 3,000 soldiers killed in combat. Conflict has affected all FATA agencies, with notable offensives in Swat Valley and South Waziristan in 2009. U.S. government assessments paint a discouraging picture of recent efforts, with the military offensives facing challenges in the \"holding\" and \"building\" phases. Independent analyses also reach similar conclusions about the difficulties faced in Swat and FATA from 2009 to 2011. The Pakistani military offensives in Swat and FATA from 2009 to 2011 had mixed results, with temporary dislodging of militants but no sustained progress in counterinsurgency. The air force conducted over 5,500 combat sorties, dropping 10,000 bombs, but no notable militant leaders were killed or captured in ground operations. The Pakistani air force has flown over 5,500 combat sorties in the FATA, destroying 4,600 targets with laser-guided bombs. Government forces continue sporadic offensives in Kurram and Khyber agencies, leading to bloody fighting and displacement of over 500,000 civilians. The army is making progress in degrading the capabilities of TTP-allied Lashkar-i-Islam. In Spring 2012, battles in Khyber led to the displacement of over 500,000 civilians due to the TTP-allied Lashkar-i-Islam. The Pakistani army has been successful in degrading LI's capabilities, but a simmering insurgency still affects most FATA agencies. TTP militants overran a Frontier Constabulary fort in South Waziristan, killing 15 soldiers. Bajaur also experienced a deadly TTP suicide bombing in retaliation for the killing of an Al Qaeda operative by security forces in 2011. In May 2012, Bajaur suffered a deadly TTP suicide bombing, killing dozens including the local Bajaur Levies commander and his deputy. This attack was seen as retaliation for the killing of an Al Qaeda operative by security forces in 2011. North Waziristan is considered the most important haven for Afghan- and Pakistan-oriented militants, including the Haqqani Network and TTP forces. Pakistani officials have been hesitant to move their military into North Waziristan despite urgent requests from the U.S. The Pakistani military has been hesitant to move into North Waziristan, which is a key haven for Afghan- and Pakistan-oriented militants. They cite the need to consolidate control in other areas and lack of hardware support from the U.S. as reasons for their limited capacity in counterinsurgency operations. The ejection of U.S. military trainers in 2011 has further hindered efforts to enhance Pakistan's capabilities in this regard. The ejection of U.S. military trainers in 2011 has hindered U.S. efforts to bolster Pakistan's counterinsurgency capabilities. Pakistan's military operations, political approach, drone strikes, and internal militant power struggles have splintered the Pakistani Taliban, leading to a decrease in suicide bomb attacks in Pakistan. The power struggles within the Pakistani Taliban in 2011 resulted in the splintering of the group into smaller factions, leading to a decrease in suicide bomb attacks in Pakistan. TTP leader Hakimullah Mehsud faces feuds with other militant commanders and was reportedly ordered to be killed by his former deputy, Wali-ur-Rehman. In 2011, TTP leader Hakimullah Mehsud faced power struggles within the Pakistani Taliban, leading to a decrease in suicide bomb attacks. He was reportedly ordered to be killed by his former deputy, Wali-ur-Rehman, due to disagreements over TTP's relationship with Al Qaeda Arabs. Pakistani officials considered negotiations with TTP militants, but concerns arose over the failure of similar efforts. The TTP leader faced power struggles within the Pakistani Taliban in 2011, leading to a decrease in suicide bomb attacks. Negotiations with the Afghan Taliban were rumored, but concerns arose over past failed efforts. Deputy TTP chief Maulvi Faqir Muhammad claimed talks with government representatives began in November, sparking domestic and international concerns. Despite denials, negotiations may have taken place, leading to Faqir's reported removal from his TTP position in March. In March, Faqir was removed from his TTP position for engaging in dialogue with the government, angering his lieutenants in Bajaur agency. Negotiations with Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar may be ongoing, with Al Qaeda and Haqqani group mediating a pact to unify four major militant factions under Omar's leadership in Waziristan agencies. A group of interlocutors mediated an intra-militant pact to unify four major militant factions under Omar's leadership in Waziristan agencies. This \"Shura-i-Muraqba\" includes the Haqqanis, Wali-ur-Rehman, Maulvi Nazir, and Gul Bahadar, directing hostility towards Afghanistan. The Haqqanis aim to shift focus from anti-Pakistan insurgency to Afghanistan, aligning with Pakistani military interests. Pakistan's role in terrorist international activity remains a central concern. The U.S. government offered a $10 million reward for information leading to the conviction of Hafiz Saeed, the leader of the group responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attack, causing tension in U.S.-Pakistan relations. Pakistan's role in terrorist activities remains a major concern for the international community. In April, Hafiz Saeed, leader of the terrorist group behind the 2008 Mumbai attack, was criticized by Prime Minister Gilani for causing further animosity in U.S.-Pakistan relations. Opposition lawmakers denounced the U.S. announcement as \"ridiculous.\" Additionally, militants freed nearly 400 prisoners, including a terrorist sentenced to death for a 2003 plot to kill President-General Pervez Musharraf. In Bannu, militants attacked a prison, freeing 400 prisoners, including a terrorist sentenced to death for a 2003 plot against President Musharraf. The raid exposed security failures and boosted Pakistani Taliban forces, raising concerns about the state's security apparatus. Clinton urged Pakistan to take action during a visit to India in May 2012. The Pakistani Taliban attack on a prison in Bannu exposed security failures and boosted their forces, raising concerns about the state's security apparatus. Secretary of State Clinton urged Pakistan to take action during a visit to India in May 2012, expressing concerns about extremist groups operating with impunity in Pakistan. U.S. officials are concerned about Pakistan-based extremist groups operating with impunity, including the Afghan Taliban in Quetta and Karachi, the Haqqani Network in North Waziristan, and other designated terrorist organizations in Pakistan. Worries about American citizens being recruited for terrorism by these groups increased in 2010, highlighted by the case of Faisal Shahzad in May of that year. In 2010, concerns grew over American citizens being recruited for terrorism by Pakistan-based extremist groups. Faisal Shahzad, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin, attempted a car bomb attack in Times Square, claiming he received training in western Pakistan. Shahzad was sentenced to life in prison for the attempted bombing. In 2010, Faisal Shahzad, a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin, attempted a car bomb attack in Times Square and received bomb-making training in western Pakistan. He was sentenced to life in prison for the attempted bombing. Other cases involving U.S. citizens and residents with links to Islamist extremism in Pakistan and terrorist plots against American targets are numerous. One Pakistani-born American was involved in the 2008 terrorist attack on Mumbai, India, and David Coleman Headley, a Chicagoan convert to Islam, was charged with scouting for the attack by the Pakistan-based LeT terrorist group. In 2009, David Coleman Headley, a Chicagoan convert to Islam, was charged with scouting for the Mumbai attack by the Pakistan-based LeT terrorist group. He pleaded guilty to the charges and had connections to a retired Pakistani major and Ilayas Kashmiri, a former Pakistani special forces commando with ties to Al Qaeda. In 2010, Indian officials gained direct access to David Coleman Headley for interrogation, revealing a Pakistani role in the Mumbai attack. In 2011, testimony was heard in the trial of Tahawwur Rana, who was charged with supporting terrorism related to the attack. Three senior LeT members were also involved. In 2010, Indian officials confirmed Pakistani involvement in the Mumbai attack through information obtained from David Coleman Headley. In 2011, Tahawwur Rana was on trial for supporting terrorism related to the attack, along with three senior LeT members. Headley's testimony implicated the ISI and added strain to U.S.-Pakistan relations. Rana was acquitted of Mumbai attack charges but found guilty of aiding terrorism. The ISI's links to terrorism strained U.S.-Pakistan relations. Rana was acquitted of Mumbai attack charges but found guilty of aiding LeT and plotting against a Danish newspaper. Pakistan and India have a history of bitter rivalry with three wars and ongoing tension over Kashmir. The bitter rivalry between Pakistan and India, stemming from the partition of British India in 1947 and the Kashmiri sovereignty issue, has led to decades of tension. Both countries have large defense establishments, impacting economic and social development. A \"Composite Dialogue\" initiated in 2004 has seen some successes, including a formal cease-fire and increased trade and people-to-people contacts across the Kashmiri Line of Control. The dialogue aims to achieve peaceful resolution. In 2004, dialogue between Pakistan and India saw modest successes, including a cease-fire along the shared frontier and increased trade across the Kashmiri Line of Control. However, relations deteriorated in 2008 after a terrorist attack in Mumbai, leading to a halt in the peace process. Following the 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai, relations between Pakistan and India deteriorated, with unresolved territorial disputes over Kashmir, the Siachen Glacier, and the Sir Creek. Conflict over water resources also emerged as a factor in the bilateral relationship. Pakistani leaders emphasize the importance of resolving the Kashmir dispute for regional peace, while the U.S. government maintains a policy of staying neutral on the issue. Under the Obama Administration, the U.S. government has maintained a policy of neutrality in the Kashmir dispute, with Pakistan and India engaging in a \"shadow war\" in Afghanistan. Islamabad accuses New Delhi of interference through Indian consulates in Afghanistan, following the 2008 Mumbai attack. Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using Indian consulates in Afghanistan for interference in Pakistan's western regions, despite limited evidence. After the 2008 Mumbai attack, India held Pakistan responsible for supporting anti-India terrorist groups. In early 2011, India agreed to resume peace talks without emphasizing the terrorism issue. India agreed to resume peace talks in early 2011 without emphasizing the terrorism issue. This led to high-level peace talks being resumed after a hiatus of more than two years, with the establishment of a \"terror hotline\" between the two countries' ministries. Bilateral talks between home secretaries also produced agreements, including a meeting between commerce secretaries in April 2011. During the resumed dialogue process between India and Pakistan, agreements were made to establish a \"terror hotline\" between their ministries. Commerce secretaries met for talks on economic cooperation, while foreign secretaries agreed to expand confidence-building measures and increase trade and travel across the Kashmiri LOC. A successful Joint Statement was produced during Foreign Minister Khar's visit to New Delhi. During the resumed dialogue process between India and Pakistan, agreements were made to establish a \"terror hotline\" between their ministries. The two officials agreed to expand confidence-building measures related to nuclear and conventional weapons, increase trade and travel across the Kashmiri LOC, and further liberalize bilateral trade. India also dropped its opposition to a proposed EU initiative to waive duties. India and Pakistan agreed to further liberalize their trade, with India dropping its opposition to waiving duties on Pakistani exports from flood-ravaged areas. The circumstances of Osama bin Laden's death impacted relations between the two countries, with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh calling it a significant step forward in combating terrorism. However, there are concerns in New Delhi about the potential hastening of a U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh praised the killing of Osama bin Laden as a significant blow to terrorist groups but expressed concerns about a possible hastened U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. New Delhi also saw this as an opportunity to push for the extradition of Lashkar-e-Taiba figures and other anti-India terrorists in Pakistan. Pakistan faced pressure to extradite alleged perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack and other anti-India terrorists. Afghan President Karzai's strategic agreement with India heightened Pakistan's fears of encirclement. Kabul's efforts to reconcile with the Taliban may have influenced Karzai's decision. Pakistan's fears of encirclement increased as Afghanistan aligned closer with India, potentially hindering efforts to improve relations with Pakistan. The current Pakistan-India relations are better than in previous years. The current Pakistan-India relations are improving, with Pakistan vowing to grant MFN trade status to India by the end of 2012. This development is seen as a significant step towards regional prosperity. Pakistan has vowed to grant Most-Favored Nation (MFN) trade status to India by the end of 2012, a move that could significantly boost bilateral trade and build peace constituencies in both countries. Islamabad's shift towards freer bilateral trade, including a move from a \"positive list\" to a \"negative list\" for imports from India, indicates progress in resolving long-standing issues like Kashmir. Pakistan's offer to move towards freer bilateral trade, shifting from a \"positive list\" to a \"negative list\" for imports from India, suggests a shift in its stance on the Kashmir issue. There have been no terrorist attacks in India traced to Pakistan in over three years, and President Zardari's visit to India in 2012 marked a significant diplomatic step. In April 2012, President Zardari visited India for the first time since 2005, meeting with Prime Minister Singh. Shortly after, an avalanche at Siachen Glacier killed 139 Pakistani soldiers, highlighting the ongoing conflict in the region. Despite the tragedy, both governments remain unwilling to redeploy their forces. The avalanche tragedy in the harsh environment of Kashmir brought attention to the conflict over the region with negligible military value. Pakistan and India signed pacts with Turkmenistan in May 2012 to build a pipeline through Afghanistan for natural gas, supported by Washington as part of the New Silk Road Initiative. The 1,100-mile-long natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan, costing $7.6 billion, is supported by Washington as part of the New Silk Road Initiative to bypass Iran. Security concerns in Afghanistan raise doubts about investor confidence despite some optimism. Despite some cautious optimism, investor confidence in Afghanistan is still uncertain due to ongoing security concerns. India's willingness to make concessions is limited by the threat of Islamist militancy from Pakistan. New Delhi criticizes Islamabad for not prosecuting Mumbai terrorism masterminds, particularly LeT chief Hafiz Saeed. This issue continues to strain relations between the two countries. The strained relations between India and Pakistan are exacerbated by Pakistan's failure to prosecute Mumbai terrorism masterminds, including LeT chief Hafiz Saeed. India seeks extradition of suspects residing in Pakistan, but economic ties could prevent open conflict. Pakistan's generals play a crucial role in shaping future relations with India. China's close relationship with Pakistan dates back to the 1960s when China became a primary arms supplier for Pakistan. Chinese companies and workers are now deeply involved in the Pakistani economy. China's continuing role as a primary arms supplier for Pakistan began in the 1960s, including helping to build arms factories and supplying weapons systems. Chinese companies are pervasive in the Pakistani economy. Beijing plans to build two new civilian nuclear reactors in Pakistan, potentially violating international guidelines. During Premier Wen Jiabao's 2010 visit to Islamabad, 12 Memoranda of Understanding were signed, designating 2011 as the \"Year of China-Pakistan Friendship.\" Contracts worth $15 billion were signed for cooperation in oil and gas. During the visit to Islamabad, the governments signed 12 Memoranda of Understanding covering various cooperative efforts and designated 2011 as the \"Year of China-Pakistan Friendship.\" Pakistani and Chinese businesses also signed contracts worth $15 billion in areas such as oil and gas, mining, space technology, heavy machinery, and manufacturing. Pakistan quickly responded in August 2011 when Beijing blamed Islamist militants trained in Pakistan for terrorist activities in China's Xinjiang province, sending ISI Director Pasha to Beijing to address the issue. In August 2011, Pakistan reacted swiftly to China's accusations of Islamist militants trained in Pakistan being responsible for terrorist activities in Xinjiang province. ISI Director Pasha was sent to Beijing to address the issue. China expressed concerns in 2012 about Uighur separatists finding refuge in Pakistan, straining bilateral relations. With deteriorating U.S.-Pakistan ties, Islamabad is increasingly reliant on its friendship with Beijing. Pakistani leaders have close ties with China, as U.S.-Pakistan relations deteriorate. Islamabad is relying more on its friendship with Beijing, evident in Prime Minister Gilani's 2011 visit. China emphasized respecting Pakistan's sovereignty and agreed to expedite delivery of fighter jets to Pakistan. The Chinese government emphasized respecting Pakistan's sovereignty and agreed to expedite delivery of 50 JF-17 fighter jets with upgraded avionics. Pakistan is also in talks with Beijing for the purchase of six new submarines worth up to $3 billion, the largest-ever bilateral defense purchase. China sees its relationship with Pakistan as a way to balance against India and strengthen Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities. China sees its relationship with Pakistan as a means of balancing against India and strengthening Pakistan's counterterrorism capabilities. Beijing recognizes the potential for Pakistan-based terrorist groups to harm Chinese economic interests in the region, leading to a basis for greater U.S.-China coordination in improving Pakistan's military and intelligence services. This could also involve Chinese pressure on Islamabad to dismantle global jihadist groups like LeT. The United States and China could enhance cooperation in various areas, including nonproliferation, governance, and economic growth in Pakistan, despite differing views on India's regional role. Chinese support for Pakistan hinders India's regional ambitions, and as the U.S. strengthens ties with India, China's reliance on Pakistan is expected to increase. Chinese military and diplomatic support for Pakistan continues to hinder India's regional ambitions. As the United States deepens its partnership with India, China's geostrategic reliance on Pakistan is expected to grow. However, China's own interests suggest that its \"all-weather friendship\" with Pakistan may not entail blanket support as in the past. Beijing is unlikely to mediate in any U.S.-Pakistani rift and has no intention of replacing Washington as Islamabad's primary foreign benefactor. China's support for Pakistan may not entail blanket support as in the past, and Beijing is unlikely to mediate in any U.S.-Pakistani rift. Pakistan's relations with Iran have been troubled by differences over Afghanistan and the presence of anti-Shia terrorist groups, but both countries cooperate in some areas and aim to complete a natural gas pipeline from Iran. Iran and Pakistan have cooperated on a natural gas pipeline project, despite tensions over Afghanistan and anti-Shia terrorist groups. Tehran claims construction on its side is complete and has offered $500 million to finance Pakistan's side after a Chinese consortium withdrew. The U.S. opposes the project due to sanctions on Iran's nuclear program. Iran has offered $500 million to finance construction on the Pakistani side of the natural gas pipeline project after a Chinese consortium withdrew. The U.S. government opposes the project due to sanctions on Iran's nuclear program. Secretary of State Clinton has stated that beginning construction on the Pakistani side would violate Iran sanctions law. Islamabad remains determined to complete the project despite U.S. concerns. Iran has also sought barter deals with Pakistan to trade oil. The U.S. government opposes the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project due to sanctions on Iran's nuclear program. Tehran has tried to bypass sanctions by proposing barter deals with Pakistan for oil. U.S. concerns also include the security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal amid the influence of Islamist militants and past illicit nuclear proliferation activities. Pakistan's nuclear security has improved, but concerns remain about potential leakage of nuclear know-how or technologies. The illicit nuclear proliferation network led by A.Q. Khan was disrupted in 2004, but no charges have been brought against him or his alleged co-conspirators. Analysts warn that parts of the network may still be active. Recent reports suggest that Pakistan is rapidly expanding its nuclear weapons arsenal, possibly in response to U.S. civil nuclear cooperation with India. This growth raises concerns about the security of Pakistan's nuclear know-how and technologies, despite improvements in recent years. Additionally, China's plans to build new nuclear reactors in Pakistan may violate nonproliferation regimes. Pakistan's rapidly growing nuclear arsenal raises concerns about security and potential violations of nonproliferation regimes. China's plan to build new nuclear reactors in Pakistan adds to the dilemma for the Obama Administration, which seeks justification and approval through international fora. Economic challenges such as inflation, unemployment, food, and energy shortages further exacerbate existing problems in Pakistan. The devastating flooding in Pakistan in 2010 and 2011 exacerbated existing economic problems, including inflation, unemployment, food, and energy shortages. Corruption hinders economic development by affecting investment rates and public confidence. Foreign direct investment dropped to under $2.2 billion. Corruption in Pakistan is a serious obstacle to economic development, impacting investment rates and public confidence. Foreign direct investment decreased to under $2.2 billion in FY2010/2011. The main causes for the decline are increasing militancy, global recession, and political instability in Islamabad. Pakistan's economic priorities include addressing inflation, containing the budget deficit, reviving growth, and meeting challenges posed by higher. In the assessment of international financial institutions, Pakistan's economic priorities are addressing inflation, containing the budget deficit, reviving growth, and meeting the challenge posed by higher global oil prices. Pakistan's economic development levels were similar to India's for many years, but India's growth surpassed Pakistan's in the early 2000s, leading to higher national wealth figures even on a per capita basis. In the early 2000s, India's economic growth surged ahead of Pakistan's, leading to higher national wealth figures even on a per capita basis. Pakistan faced a balance-of-payments crisis in 2008, resulting in seeking multi-billion dollar loans from the IMF. The current IMF-supported program is a 34-month, $11.3 billion Stand-By Arrangement, with $3.6 billion yet to be disbursed. The IMF-supported program for Pakistan is a 34-month, $11.3 billion Stand-By Arrangement, with $3.6 billion yet to be disbursed. The program was put on hold in 2010 due to Islamabad's failure to implement required reforms, leading to potential restructuring of public sector enterprises. Security concerns in 2011 further delayed negotiations with the IMF. Pakistan sought U.S. help to influence the IMF for relaxed conditions. Pakistan's IMF-supported program faces delays due to security concerns and failure to implement reforms, leading to potential restructuring of public sector enterprises. Islamabad seeks U.S. help to influence the IMF for relaxed conditions, with concerns over repayment of loans burdening the federal budget. The United States is unlikely to intervene in Pakistan's repayment of IMF loans, which will strain Islamabad's federal budget due to low revenue generation and mass tax evasion by the economic elite. Secretary Clinton criticizes Pakistan's low tax-to-GDP ratio and the government's failure to implement tax reforms. Pakistan's low tax-to-GDP ratio of 9% has drawn criticism from U.S. officials. Efforts to implement tax reforms and lower fuel subsidies have faced challenges, leading to political turmoil. Electricity shortages are a major factor in the country's economic decline, forcing many businesses to shut down. Electricity shortages in Pakistan are causing economic deterioration, leading to businesses shutting down due to power outages. Public protests over gas shortages have turned violent, with citizens ransacking offices and torching vehicles. Despite this, public opinion surveys show inflation is the top concern for Pakistanis. Thousands of angry citizens in Lahore and other Punjabi cities ransacked offices and torched vehicles. Public opinion surveys reveal inflation as the top concern for Pakistanis, with 52% citing it as the most important issue. Despite economic growth of 2.4% in FY2011, challenges like public debt, inflation, and energy shortages continue to hinder progress. The State Bank of Pakistan acknowledged that despite the devastating floods in FY2011, structural deficiencies in Pakistan's economy persist, including low tax revenues and power shortages. Plans to reform taxes and phase out subsidies are delayed, with power outages expected to reduce GDP growth by up to 4%. The State Bank of Pakistan recognizes ongoing economic challenges in Pakistan, including low tax revenues and power shortages. Plans to reform taxes and phase out subsidies are delayed, with power outages estimated to reduce GDP growth by up to 4%. International financial institutions regularly assess the Pakistani economy, highlighting governance issues as a central cause of economic problems. The World Bank's assessment of the Pakistani economy in November 2011 highlighted challenges faced by the Islamabad government, including a deteriorated fiscal situation and governance issues. The report recommended a focus on human development sectors like education and health to alleviate poverty, as overall macroeconomic risks remain significant. The World Bank's assessment in November 2011 highlighted challenges faced by the Islamabad government, recommending a focus on human development sectors like education and health for poverty alleviation. The outlook is negative due to significant macroeconomic risks, with warnings that poverty alleviation gains are at risk. The February 2012 IMF report bluntly stated that Pakistan's near- and middle-term prospects are not good, with low growth, high inflation, and a weakening external position due to current fiscal deficits and accommodative monetary policy. The IMF recommends urgent policy action for Pakistan to address low growth, high inflation, and a weakening external position. Key measures include strengthening public finances, reforming the energy sector, and implementing financial measures to reduce inflation and safeguard financial stability. Pakistani leaders aim to improve access to Western markets amidst security concerns deterring foreign investors and impacting exports. Pakistani leaders aspire to improve access to Western markets, especially for textile exports, to aid in the country's recovery. The textile sector employs 3.5 million Pakistanis and accounts for 40% of urban factory jobs. Islamabad is seeking reduced tariffs on textile exports following flood damage to the cotton crop. Pakistani officials and business leaders are pushing for the abolishment of American tariffs on textile exports, aiming to increase exports by $5 billion annually. The country's political landscape is characterized by power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs, with a bicameral Parliament holding federal power. Pakistan's political landscape is marked by power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs. The country has endured direct military rule for over half of its 65 years of existence. The bicameral Parliament, consisting of a 342-seat National Assembly and a 100-seat Senate, holds federal power under the constitution. Members are elected to five-year terms, with a President serving indirectly for the same duration. President Zardari was elected in September 2008. President Zardari was elected in September 2008. Despite a civilian government led by the PPP, Pakistan's military still holds significant influence over foreign and national security policies. The coalition government has struggled to enact reforms and rein in security agencies. The PPP-led coalition in Pakistan has faced challenges in maintaining power and implementing reforms. The judiciary, empowered by the 2008 \"Lawyer's Movement,\" is pursuing corruption charges against politicians, including President Zardari. Analysts warn that political turmoil could lead to economic chaos due to widening deficits. The PPP-led coalition in Pakistan has faced challenges in maintaining power and implementing reforms. Independent analysts warn that political turmoil could lead to economic chaos due to widening deficits. The Jamaat Ulema Islami (JUI) and the Karachi-based Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) have withdrawn and rejoined the coalition multiple times due to rising fuel prices, inflation, and government mismanagement. The MQM and Islamist party have withdrawn and rejoined the coalition in reaction to fuel prices, inflation, and government mismanagement. The MQM's withdrawals were seen as attempts to gain more control in Karachi. The PPP strengthened its standing in 2011 through an alliance with the PML-Q faction. In May 2011, the PPP strengthened its standing by forming an alliance with the PML-Q faction, former supporters of Pervez Musharraf. This alliance, along with the party's support in Punjab, could pose a threat to Nawaz Sharif's PML-N faction. The secular Pashtun nationalist Awami National Party (ANP) is also a PPP coalition ally. The PPP's alliance with PML allies strengthened its position, posing a threat to Nawaz Sharif's PML-N faction. The ruling party's gains in Senate elections ensured control through 2015, allowing them to block legislation even if they lose in upcoming polls. The circumstances of OBL's death were embarrassing for Pakistan. The ruling party's increased control of the Senate until 2015 allows them to block legislation even if they lose in upcoming polls. The embarrassment of OBL's death and criticism of the Pakistani military have created an opportunity for civilian leaders to gain more control over foreign and national security policies. Pakistan's civilian leaders have the opportunity to gain more control over foreign and national security policies following the embarrassment of the May 2011 Mehran naval base attack and criticism of the security establishment. Despite media criticism, there has been little indication that civilians will take advantage of this opportunity. Parliament has formed a commission to investigate how bin Laden found refuge in Pakistan and how American forces entered Pakistani territory. The Parliament in Pakistan formed a commission to investigate how bin Laden found refuge in the country and how American forces entered Pakistani territory. Civil-military tensions following the bin Laden raid in May 2011 almost led to a military coup in late 2011. In early 2012, Prime Minister Gilani faced contempt charges for not complying with orders. In late 2011, civil-military tensions in Pakistan escalated after the bin Laden raid, nearly leading to a military coup. In early 2012, Prime Minister Gilani faced contempt charges for failing to request the reopening of a corruption case against President Zardari. The Supreme Court issued a contempt notice against Gilani, eventually finding him guilty in April. In early 2012, Prime Minister Gilani faced contempt charges for failing to request the reopening of a corruption case against President Zardari. The court found Gilani guilty of contempt in April but sentenced him to only the time it took for the court to adjourn. Legal scholars predict he will be disqualified from office after the appeal period expires in June. In late 2011, former cricket hero Imran Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party gained support, despite minimal representation in Parliament. Legal scholars predict Prime Minister Gilani will be disqualified from office after the appeal period expires in June. Imran Khan and his PTI party gained support in late 2011 by attracting young and middle-class Pakistanis with anti-corruption and anti-American sentiment. Khan's rallies in Lahore and Karachi drew huge crowds, and the PTI has since won converts from major national parties, posing a threat to Nawaz Sharif's votebank. Imran Khan and his PTI party gained support in late 2011 by attracting young and middle-class Pakistanis with anti-corruption and anti-American sentiment. Khan's rallies in Lahore and Karachi drew huge crowds, with strong support in Punjab. He poses a threat to Nawaz Sharif's votebank and may become a \"kingmaker\" in future governance arrangements. Khan vows to cut off U.S. aid, end conflict with the Pakistani Taliban in 90 days, and eradicate big corruption. Imran Khan's rise in late 2011 reflected the Pakistani public's desire for honest politicians. He aims to cut off U.S. aid, end conflict with the Pakistani Taliban, and tackle corruption within 90 days if he becomes Prime Minister. Khan's anti-corruption stance and appeal to young and middle-class Pakistanis have positioned him as a potential \"kingmaker\" in future governance arrangements. Imran Khan's rapid political ascent in late 2011 resonated with the Pakistani public's desire for honest leaders. The emergence of Pakistan's conservative Islamist political forces through the Difa-e-Pakistan (DPC) has raised concerns among international observers. The DPC, consisting of over 40 Islamist and rightwing parties, including banned extremist groups, has been organizing large street rallies and demanding an end to Islamabad's cooperation with certain entities. The DPC, comprised of over 40 Islamist and rightwing parties, including banned extremist groups, opposes cooperation with the US and India.
