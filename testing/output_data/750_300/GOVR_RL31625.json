    "content": "Title VI of the Higher Education Act authorizes grants to institutions for enhancing foreign language and area studies instruction. It is one of the oldest federal support programs for higher education, dating back to the National Defense Education Act of 1958. The program played a key role in establishing area studies departments in colleges and universities. The National Defense Education Act (NDEA, P.L. 85-864) supported the establishment of area studies departments in colleges and universities in the late 1950s and 1960s. The program prioritized foreign language and area studies for diplomacy, national security, and trade competitiveness. Interest in federal programs like HEA Title VI has grown due to concerns about terrorism from foreign regions. The federal government placed emphasis on FLAS for diplomacy, national security, and trade competitiveness. Interest in HEA Title VI and other federal programs supporting FLAS has increased due to concerns about terrorism from foreign regions. The appropriation for Title VI remained at $93.1 million in FY2007 and $95.6 million in FY2008. This report provides an overview of Title VI programs and reauthorization issues. The report provides an overview of Title VI programs and reauthorization issues. The appropriation for Title VI remained at $93.1 million in FY2007 and $95.6 million in FY2008. Authorization and appropriations statutes for HEA Title VI give discretion to the U.S. Department of Education in allocating funds among specific activities. The U.S. Department of Education has discretion in allocating funds for Title VI activities under HEA. Most grants are multi-year with obligations for future years. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 authorized Title VI until December 31, 2005. The statutory authorities expired in FY2004 but have been recently extended. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 (P.L. 105-244) authorized Title VI until December 31, 2005, with recent extensions. The last specific authorization was for FY1999, allocating funds for various activities. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 authorized Title VI until December 31, 2005, with recent extensions. Approximately three-fifths of the funds are used for National Language and Area Centers (NLACs) and FLAS Fellowships. These programs are closely related, with NLAC grant recipients also offering FLAS Fellowships to graduate students. Title VI funds support NLACs and FLAS Fellowships for graduate students. Other programs serve specific goals or support the primary programs. Funds are allocated competitively under each Title VI program. Funds under HEA Title VI programs are allocated competitively, with an emphasis on excellence and equitable distribution. Provisions in annual appropriations acts accompany increased funding for Title VI programs. The increased funding for Title VI programs is accompanied by provisions in annual appropriations acts specifying activities and regions for specialization. Earmarks of the increased funds were included in the FY2002 Department of Education Appropriations Act. The FY2002 Department of Education Appropriations Act and FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution specified regions and languages for Title VI funds without earmarks. The FY2002 Department of Education Appropriations Act and FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution specified regions and languages for Title VI funds without earmarks. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108-447) and conference report (P.L. 108-401) retained provisions directing Title VI funds to specific world regions and languages to sustain investments in foreign language proficiency and cross-cultural skills in strategic areas important to national security interests. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108-447) does not specify constraints on languages or fund distribution for building foreign language capacity in strategic world areas important to national security interests. It earmarks one percent of the total appropriation for program evaluation and $1,500,000 for an independent review of Title VI programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 allocates one percent of the total appropriation for program evaluation, national outreach, and information dissemination. $1,500,000 is designated for an independent review of Title VI programs. Evaluations of HEA Title VI programs are primarily conducted by the National Foreign Language Center (NFLC). Funds from the International Research and Studies program can be used for assessing the effects of HEA Title VI programs. Funds from the International Research and Studies program, as noted in Table 1, can be used for assessing the effects of HEA Title VI programs. The ED has provided funds to the NFLC for the \"Evaluation of Exchange, Language, International and Area Studies (EELIAS) Project\" to meet evaluation and assessment needs of HEA Title VI and the Fulbright-Hays program. The EELIAS project aims to meet evaluation and assessment needs of HEA Title VI and the Fulbright-Hays program by developing performance indicators, an Internet-based data reporting system, and evaluating Title VI programs. It also aims to determine the level of need for advanced foreign language and international studies and the capacity of IHEs to meet those needs. The EELIAS project aims to evaluate HEA Title VI and Fulbright-Hays programs by developing performance indicators and assessing the need for advanced foreign language and international studies at IHEs. The evaluation system will be phased in over a five-year period. The report evaluated the impact of HEA Title VI and Fulbright-Hays programs on national language capacity, emphasizing the importance of supporting less commonly taught languages. IHEs receiving Title VI NLAC grants enroll 59% of all graduate students. The report highlights the importance of supporting less commonly taught languages for the nation's capacity, especially in unpredictable moments. IHEs receiving Title VI NLAC grants enroll a significant percentage of graduate students in these languages. The Higher Education Act may be up for reauthorization during the 110th Congress, with discussions on related issues expected. The Higher Education Act may be considered for reauthorization during the 110th Congress, with discussions on HEA Title VI-related issues likely to be debated. There is a consensus on the increasing interaction between American society and cultures worldwide, leading to national security concerns. It is important for the nation to provide education and support for people to acquire advanced knowledge of languages. To address national security concerns involving various nations, it is crucial for our nation to provide education and support for individuals to acquire advanced knowledge of languages and cultures. This is essential as foreign nations like Afghanistan have recently attracted significant attention, and it is impossible to predict which nations may generate concern in the future. Ongoing support is necessary to develop the necessary human capital. It is important to provide ongoing support for instruction in all of the world's major languages and cultures, including those with major security or trade interests, and especially the infrequently taught ones. The federal government may need to consider providing support for instruction in critical foreign languages and cultures, especially those with major security or trade interests. This support could be focused on colleges and universities, federally-operated institutions, or both. The government currently operates two foreign language schools to meet immediate language requirements. The federal government operates two foreign language schools, the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center in Monterey, California, and the Foreign Service Institute School for Language Studies in Arlington, Virginia, to meet immediate language requirements. Title VI provides grants to institutions to develop educational programs in specific subject areas, differing from the HEA's focus on student aid based on financial need. The HEA Title VI departs from the general approach of providing student aid based on financial need by offering grants to IHEs for educational programs in specific subject areas. This is different from most institutional aid, which is usually focused on specific types of institutions rather than subject fields. Title VI combines institutional aid for instruction in a specific field with fellowships for students in that field. Title VI of the HEA provides institutional aid for specific subject areas, focusing on advanced study of foreign languages and regions for national security and economic competitiveness. The advanced study of foreign languages and regions is crucial for national security, defense, and economic competitiveness. Supporters argue that maintaining research and instructional programs in critical foreign language and area studies is a national priority that should be supported in both federally-operated institutions and colleges accessible to the public. Federal employees' needs are just a part of the broader national requirements for individuals knowledgeable in foreign languages and cultures. The study of foreign languages and cultures is essential for national security, defense, and economic competitiveness. It is a national priority to support research and instructional programs in critical foreign languages and area studies in both federally-operated institutions and colleges accessible to the public. Federal employees' needs are just a part of the broader national requirements for individuals knowledgeable in foreign languages and cultures, which are also crucial for international trade and increasing understanding of foreign nations and cultures among the public. The quality of FLAS programs in colleges and universities depends on developing linkages with foreign educational institutions, which is easier for IHEs than federal institutions. This support for foreign language instruction is crucial for national security and international trade. The support for foreign language instruction in colleges and universities is crucial for national security and international trade. Federal agencies other than the Department of Education also provide support for specific subject areas on a larger scale than HEA Title VI. Examples include health care education and training supported by the National Institutes of Health. Other federal agencies support instruction in specific subject areas on a larger scale than HEA Title VI, such as health care education by the National Institutes of Health and science and mathematics education by the National Science Foundation. These subject areas are considered of special national interest and receive targeted federal support. It is argued that if there is enough student interest, colleges and universities will provide sufficient instruction and research in critical foreign languages and area studies. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of targeted federal support for critical foreign languages and area studies in higher education. It suggests that federal aid could be limited to start-up costs for initiating programs, rather than ongoing support. Additionally, there should be more systematic efforts to identify areas of special national interest. The curr_chunk suggests limiting federal support to start-up costs for foreign language and area studies programs in higher education. It also proposes utilizing the language skills of recent immigrants and mentions the support provided by IHEs, foundations, and corporations. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges faced by individual institutions in offering instruction in rare languages like Pashto or Farsi and argues for federal support under Title VI programs for economies of scale. Proponents of Title VI argue for federal support to offer instruction in rare languages like Pashto or Farsi due to insufficient funding from individual institutions. Without targeted federal aid, ongoing support for such languages may be inadequate to meet national needs. The report focuses on Title VI of the HEA for reauthorization by the 109th Congress. The report focuses on Title VI of the HEA for reauthorization by the 109th Congress, questioning the adequacy and coordination of federal support for FLAS programs in U.S. colleges and universities. It suggests potential consolidation of related programs with Title VI to improve efficiency and coordination. Title VI of the HEA aims to coordinate federal programs in foreign language, area studies, and international studies. There is a question about the coordination and efficiency of Title VI with other related programs, suggesting potential consolidation for improved efficiency. Programs related to HEA Title VI include the Fulbright-Hays Act, NSEP, Gilman International Scholarship Program, and international activities under ED's FIPSE. The Fulbright-Hays Act authorizes various international exchange activities. The Fulbright-Hays Act authorizes international exchange activities for graduate students, scholars, and professionals in various fields, primarily administered by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the Department of State. Participants are mainly citizens of nations other than the United States. The Fulbright-Hays programs, relevant to HEA Title VI, support foreign travel activities for American graduate students and professors. These activities include faculty research abroad, doctoral students conducting dissertation research, and group seminars abroad, exclusively for U.S. citizens. The Fulbright-Hays programs support foreign travel activities for American graduate students and professors, focusing on improving FLAS instruction in American colleges and universities. These activities are available to U.S. citizens only and are smaller in scale compared to HEA Title VI programs. The NSEP, under the David L. Boren National Security Education Act, provides aid for international education and foreign language studies for American undergraduate and graduate students. The NSEP, funded at $12.9 million for FY2003, offers scholarships, grants, and fellowships for American students to study critical foreign languages and areas. The program aims to allocate one-third of annual grant funding to each type of assistance. The NSEP offers scholarships, grants, and fellowships for American students to study critical foreign languages and areas. A trust fund of $150 million was provided in FY1992 for this purpose. Recipients are required to seek employment in a national security position or fulfill other obligations. The NSEP program offers scholarships, grants, and fellowships for American students to study critical foreign languages and areas. Recipients are obligated to seek employment in a national security position or fulfill the requirement through work in higher education related to their scholarship. Institutional grants focus on establishing instructional programs for less commonly taught languages and increasing minority student participation in international programs. In 2002, institutional grants supported instructional and exchange programs for less commonly taught languages and nations/regions at U.S. IHEs, increased minority student participation in international programs, and integrated foreign language studies with professional education. A revised strategy for institutional grants starting in 2003 includes a Flagship Language Initiative for advanced language study. The revised strategy for institutional grants starting in 2003 includes a Flagship Language Initiative for advanced language study, authorized by P.L. 107-306. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) aims to support advanced study of critical foreign languages and complement existing programs under HEA Title VI. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) complements existing programs under HEA Title VI by supporting advanced study of critical foreign languages. NSEP, administered by the Department of Defense's National Defense University, includes unique elements such as a service requirement and travel grants for undergraduate students. There may be potential overlap between NSEP institutional grants and HEA Title VI National and Language Resource Center grants. The NSEP, administered by the Department of Defense's National Defense University, determines critical areas for national security and is largely administered through non-governmental organizations. The NSEP is administered through non-governmental organizations like the Institute of International Education and the Academy for Educational Development. Grants were first awarded in the 1994-1995 academic year, and there were attempts to eliminate the program in the 104th Congress. The NSEP, administered by non-governmental organizations, began making grants in 1994-1995. In the 104th Congress, there were attempts to eliminate the program, but a compromise was reached to reduce the trust fund to $75 million. The annual funding level for NSEP was set at $8 million in FY2003. The NSEP differs from HEA Title VI in that only the former includes a service component. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) is funded at $8 million annually by the Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2003. It differs from HEA Title VI as it has a service requirement, focuses on national security-related FLAS skill needs, is financed through a trust fund, and supports international travel for undergraduate students. Administered by the Department of Defense, NSEP is smaller in scale compared to Title VI and was authorized by the International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000. The NSEP, funded at $8 million annually, supports international travel for undergraduate students. Administered by DOD, it is smaller in scale than Title VI and offers scholarships of up to $5,000 for U.S. citizen undergraduate students. Eligibility requires recipients of Pell Grants. The NSEP offers scholarships for undergraduate students to cover travel, tuition, and study abroad expenses. Eligibility is for Pell Grant recipients from low-income families, with preference given to first-time study abroad students. There are no restrictions on subjects or regions, except for Cuba or countries under travel warnings. The Gilman program, administered by the Department of State through the Institute of International Education, provides study abroad opportunities to students who may not otherwise be able to participate. In the 2002-2003 academic year, 179 students received Gilman Scholarships. The program does not focus on specific foreign languages or regions deemed critical to national security. In the 2002-2003 academic year, 179 students received Gilman Scholarships administered by the Department of State through the Institute of International Education. The Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) administers programs to foster innovative approaches in U.S. postsecondary education, authorized by Title VII, Part B of the HEA. Targeted support for activities related to HEA Title VI is provided under specific programs. Title VII, Part B of the HEA provides targeted support for international education programs through specific programs like the Program for North American Mobility in Higher Education, the U.S.-Brazil Higher Education Consortia Program, and the European Community-United States of America Cooperation Program in Higher Education and Vocational Education and Training. Grants are awarded to U.S. IHEs to form consortia with foreign institutions for activities such as student and staff exchange. The Program for North American Mobility in Higher Education, U.S.-Brazil Higher Education Consortia Program, and European Community-United States of America Cooperation Program provide grants to U.S. IHEs for student and staff exchange and curriculum development. Funding levels for FY2002 are $2,043,000, $1,495,000, and $2,254,000 respectively. Consideration may be given to consolidating these related programs. The U.S.-Brazil Higher Education Consortia Program received $1,495,000 in funding, while the European Community-United States of America Cooperation Program received $2,254,000. There is a question of whether these programs should be consolidated under a coordinated national strategy for efficiency. The federal programs serving similar purposes may be consolidated to avoid duplicative grant competitions. Coordination among these programs, such as Fulbright-Hays, FIPSE, and NSEP, could be improved as they are administered by the same office. Further coordination and efficiency efforts are suggested. The grant programs described are similar to HEA Title VI activities and are administered by the same office. Coordination and efficiency could be improved by consolidating or placing them under a single advisory board. The NSEP has unique national security emphasis and service requirements for aid recipients, making coordination more aligned with its purposes than consolidation with Title VI. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) stands out from other programs due to its focus on national security needs and service requirements for aid recipients. Coordination with NSEP's unique characteristics may be more effective than consolidation with Title VI programs. Despite operating separately, questions arise about the efficiency of maintaining a program similar to Title VI, especially with NSEP's reduced trust fund. The efficiency of operating a separate program like NSEP with purposes similar to Title VI is questioned due to NSEP's reduced trust fund. The Gilman International Scholarship Program also funds undergraduate students to travel abroad but lacks the national security focus and service requirements of NSEP. Transferring the Gilman program from ED's Pell Grant program is a possibility. The International Scholarship Program provides funding for undergraduate students to travel abroad, without the national security focus and service requirements of NSEP. Consider transferring the Gilman program to the Department of Education and incorporating it under the Undergraduate International Studies and Foreign Language Programs of HEA Title VI. Proposals for a multi-agency board or independent federal entity to coordinate federal programs in foreign language and international studies could also be considered. Proposals may be considered to establish a multi-agency board or independent federal entity to coordinate federal programs in foreign language and international studies, including Fulbright-Hays activities and the K-12 Foreign Language Assistance Program. This entity could focus on long-range planning to meet the nation's needs for specialists in a coordinated manner. One proposal is to establish a board or agency to coordinate federal programs in foreign language and international studies, focusing on long-range planning to meet the nation's needs for specialists in a coordinated manner. Coordination between institutions funded by HEA Title VI and federal agencies offering language instruction is also questioned. This includes coordinating HEA Title VI fellowships and institutional grants with the foreign language needs of federal government agencies, as well as sharing resources and coordinating instructional programs between federal language programs. Currently, there is a question about the coordination between HEA Title VI fellowships and institutional grants with the foreign language needs of federal government agencies. The grants are dispersed across various languages and regions, including critical areas related to national security and trade. The NLAC and FLAS Fellowship grant recipients for FY2000-2002 cycle reflect a balance among all world regions, including critical areas like the Middle East and South Asia. Grants also cover areas like Western Europe without targeted federal assistance. The definition of \"critical\" languages or regions may change over time. The NLAC and FLAS Fellowship grants cover all world regions, including critical areas like the Middle East and South Asia, as well as Western Europe. The definition of \"critical\" languages or regions may change over time, raising questions about targeting Title VI funding. The discussion revolves around the decision-making process for targeting Title VI grants towards languages or regions that are not commonly taught in American institutions. Various options are considered, including the involvement of the Department of Education, an interagency advisory body, a new entity for federal FLAS programs, or Congress. Matching federal funds with non-federal resources is a requirement for several HEA Title VI programs. The HEA Title VI programs require federal funds to be matched with non-federal resources, leading to additional funding from various sources. However, questions arise about whether the program's scale is sufficient to meet national needs. The HEA Title VI program receives funds from various sources, but there are concerns about its adequacy to meet national needs. Opponents argue against increased targeting of grants for specific languages and regions due to uncertainty about future needs. It is uncertain what languages and regions will be needed in the future for HEA Title VI grants. Advocates suggest relying on IHEs to propose grants for a comprehensive range of languages and regions, rather than central coordination. Difficulty in quantifying national needs precisely. The annual survey conducted as part of the NSEP identifies a wide range of foreign languages, world regions, and disciplines of major national security interest. The annual survey conducted as part of the NSEP identifies a wide range of foreign languages, world regions, and disciplines of major national security interest. Another study by the General Accounting Office focused on federal departments and agencies concluded that the changing security environment necessitates increased language skills. The General Accounting Office report highlighted shortages of translators, interpreters, diplomats, and intelligence specialists with critical foreign language skills in federal agencies like the Army, State Department, Department of Commerce's Foreign Commercial Service, and the FBI. These shortages have negatively impacted agency operations and hindered various national security efforts. Shortages of translators, interpreters, diplomats, and intelligence specialists with critical foreign language skills have harmed agency operations and hindered U.S. military, law enforcement, intelligence, counterterrorism, and diplomatic efforts."
