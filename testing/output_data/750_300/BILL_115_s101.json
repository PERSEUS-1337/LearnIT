The Act defines \"Federal land\" as approximately 206 acres within the Refuge, including 131 acres in the Wilderness for road construction. \"Non-Federal land\" is also defined. The curr_chunk defines terms related to the road corridor construction project, including \"non-Federal land,\" \"Refuge,\" \"road corridor,\" and \"Secretary.\" The curr_chunk defines terms related to the Izembek Wilderness in Alaska, including \"road corridor,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"State.\" The curr_chunk states that a land exchange is required. The State will convey non-Federal land to the Secretary, who will then convey Federal land to the State for road corridor construction in the Refuge. Valuation and appraisals will determine the land exchange value. The land exchange for road corridor construction in the Refuge requires equal valuation through appraisals conducted by the Secretary and State. The Secretary and State will select an appraiser to conduct appraisals of Federal and non-Federal land in accordance with nationally recognized standards. The Secretary and State will select an appraiser to conduct appraisals of Federal and non-Federal land in accordance with nationally recognized appraisal standards, including the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice. If the final appraised value of the Federal land exceeds the final appraised value of the non-Federal land in a land exchange, the values shall be equalized. In a land exchange, if the appraised value of the Federal land exceeds the appraised value of the non-Federal land, the values shall be equalized by conveying additional non-Federal land, making a cash payment, or using a combination of both methods. If the final appraised value of the non-Federal land exceeds the final appraised value of the Federal land in a land exchange, the State can equalize the values by adjusting the acreage of the non-Federal land to be conveyed. This can be done by making a cash payment to the United States or using a combination of methods. The State can adjust the acreage of non-Federal land to be conveyed to equalize the value in a land exchange. The Secretary has the authority to accept a payment exceeding 25% of the Federal land value. The land exchange under this section allows for the modification of the Wilderness boundary to exclude Federal land and add non-Federal land to the Wilderness, which will be administered according to the Wilderness Act and other applicable laws. The land exchange must be completed within 180 days of the enactment of the Act, following the Wilderness Act and other relevant laws. The road corridor will follow the southern road alignment described in the final environmental impact statement. Requirements for usage, barrier cables, dimensions, and support facilities will apply to the road constructed in the corridor. The exchange of Federal land and non-Federal land and the construction of a road under this Act will not be considered a major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
