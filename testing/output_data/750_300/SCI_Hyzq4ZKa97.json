    "content": "In the design of deep neural networks, the focus has been on improving accuracy, resulting in complex architectures that are hard to deploy practically. Recently, there is interest in developing quantitative metrics that go beyond accuracy to evaluate network performance. This study introduces NetScore, a new metric that assesses the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and practical on-device edge usage. NetScore is a new metric designed to evaluate the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network architecture complexity of deep neural networks for practical on-device edge usage. It was compared with other metrics across 60 different deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ImageNet dataset. The study compared NetScore, top-1 accuracy, and information density metrics across 60 deep convolutional neural networks for image classification on the ImageNet dataset. Results serve as a reference guide for practitioners in the field amidst growing interest in deep learning. There is a recent surge in interest in deep learning for various applications, but the challenges of deploying complex neural networks in practical industrial settings are becoming more apparent. Designing networks that balance accuracy and complexity is a key focus of current research. The current research focus is on balancing accuracy and complexity in designing practical deep neural networks. One key challenge is assessing network architecture to strike this balance. The information density metric is widely cited but does not consider computational requirements for network inference. In this study, NetScore is introduced as a new metric to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network design. It aims to improve network model search and design by considering accuracy, architectural complexity, and computational complexity. NetScore is a new metric introduced in this study to assess the balance between accuracy, computational complexity, and network design. The study sets \u03b2 = 0.5 and \u03b3 = 0.5 to provide a reference guide for practitioners. The deep convolutional neural networks evaluated include AlexNet BID22."
