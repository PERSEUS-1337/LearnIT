The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) defines TBML as disguising crime proceeds through trade transactions. This typically includes misrepresenting prices, quantities, or quality of imports/exports, often used by terrorist groups to finance activities and disguise money movements. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves disguising crime proceeds through trade transactions by misrepresenting prices, quantities, or quality of imports/exports. TBML schemes, also known as TBML/FT when used by terrorist groups, aim to legitimize illicit funds and hide their origins. Financial institutions can be unwittingly involved in TBML and TBML/FT schemes when they settle, facilitate, or finance international trade transactions. The U.S. Department of the Treasury issued reports in June 2015 on money laundering risks, highlighting trade-based money laundering (TBML) as a significant challenge. TBML schemes can launder billions of dollars annually through international trade transactions. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) is identified as a challenging form of money laundering, capable of laundering billions of dollars annually. The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued an advisory in February 2010, reporting over 17,000 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) related to TBML between January 2004 and May 2009, totaling more than $276 billion. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers also exploit the international financial system and physical cash movement for illicit activities. Between January 2004 and May 2009, potential TBML activity involving transactions exceeding $276 billion was identified. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers utilize the international financial system and physical cash movement to conceal their illicit activities, taking advantage of the complexities of trade and finance systems to obscure transactions. Money launderers exploit the international trade and finance system by using various techniques to obscure transactions, including multiple foreign exchange transactions, co-mingling of funds, and exploiting vulnerabilities in financial arrangements. According to FATF, trade-based money laundering techniques vary in complexity and are often used in combination with other methods to further conceal the money trail. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves using credit and financial arrangements to launder funds across borders. TBML techniques vary in complexity and are often combined with other methods to obscure the money trail. Common TBML activities include misrepresenting the price, quality, or quantity of goods during transit. Basic TBML techniques include over- and under-invoicing of goods and services, which is a commonly used method for laundering funds internationally. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves using credit and financial arrangements to launder funds across borders. TBML techniques include over- and under-invoicing of goods and services, which is a commonly used method for laundering funds internationally. By invoicing goods or services below market value, funds can be shifted between exporters and importers. Similarly, invoicing goods or services above market value allows for the transfer of value between parties. Over- and under-invoicing of goods and services in trade can transfer value between parties, leading to potential tax implications. Complex products and those in supply chains are more susceptible to these activities, complicating customs officials' ability to determine true market value. Multiple invoicing of goods and services is also a common practice in such transactions. Multiple invoicing of goods and services in trade can complicate transactions by justifying multiple payments for the same goods or services. Using multiple financial institutions can increase the complexity of the transaction and make detection more difficult for money launderers or terrorist financiers. A money launderer or terrorist financier can increase transaction complexity by using multiple financial institutions for multiple payments, making detection more difficult. They can offer plausible explanations if detected, manipulate prices, misstate quantities of goods/services, or collude to not ship any goods but process shipping and customs documents. Money launderers can manipulate prices and misstate quantities or qualities of goods and services in trade transactions to create discrepancies and deceive financial institutions. This can involve colluding with exporters and importers to falsify shipping and customs documents, leading to undetected \"phantom\" transactions. The Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE) is a classic scheme involving the laundering of drug proceeds from Latin America. Colombian drug traffickers used trade-based schemes to disguise billions in narcotics profits. TBML is a common manifestation of international money laundering, involving misstating goods or services in trade transactions. Colombian drug traffickers used sophisticated trade-based schemes to disguise up to $4 billion in annual narcotics profits in the 1980s, known as the Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE). Trade-based money laundering (TBML) is a common method used by terrorist organizations, less understood than traditional forms of money laundering. TBML can have significant consequences for international commerce due to the volume and value of global trade transactions. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) is a method used by terrorist organizations that can have substantial consequences for international commerce and government revenue. TBML's effects can be more destructive than other money laundering schemes, with transnational criminal organizations sometimes selling imported goods purchased with illicit proceeds at below-market prices to expedite the money laundering process. Transnational criminal organizations engage in trade-based money laundering by selling imported goods at below-market prices to expedite the process. This activity not only harms legitimate businesses by creating a competitive disadvantage but also deprives governments of tax revenue from underpriced goods and undervalued imports. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) undermines legitimate economic activity and deprives governments of tax revenue by selling goods below market prices and undervaluing imports. Global trends in trade have enabled criminal organizations to hide illegal gains through advances in communication, lower transportation costs, and interconnected economies. Global trends in trade, such as advances in communications and lower transportation costs, have led to more interconnected economies and societies. This has created new market opportunities and allowed organized crime to expand into new markets. According to a report by the OECD, criminal organizations are diversifying into profitable activities with low detection risks in these global markets. According to the OECD, global markets offer criminal organizations new opportunities to diversify into profitable activities with low detection risks. Criminal groups have adopted new types of trade to connect production to distant consumers, creating economies of scale and the chance to enter new illicit markets. The OECD highlighted the challenges of illegal trade and financial flows, which could have significant economic and development consequences. Criminal organizations and terrorist groups have the potential to exploit the international trade system with low risk of detection, as per FATF. The FATF warns that the international trade system's characteristics make it attractive and vulnerable to illicit exploitation by criminal organizations and terrorist groups due to the enormous volume of trade flows and complexity of foreign exchange transactions. According to FinCEN, trade-based money laundering (TBML) activity is increasing in volume and global reach due to the complexity and obscurity of trade flows, foreign exchange transactions, comingling of illicit funds with legitimate business, limited verification procedures, and resources of customs agencies. According to FinCEN, TBML activity is on the rise globally, with Mexico and China being the most frequently identified countries for TBML transactions. Panama, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela also show rapid growth in potential TBML activity. Limited resources in customs agencies hinder the detection of illegal trade transactions. According to the U.S. Department of State's 2016 annual report on money laundering and financial crimes, concerns about trade-based money laundering (TBML) have been identified in various countries including Afghanistan, Australia, Belize, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, China, Colombia, Greece, Guatemala, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, the Philippines, Singapore, Saint Maarten, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Uruguay, Venezuela, and the West Bank and Gaza. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 highlighted trade-based money laundering (TBML) in various countries including Trinidad and Tobago, leading to significant revenue losses, corruption, and illicit financial activities. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves significant revenue losses, corruption, and illicit financial activities, including exploitation of free trade zones and laundering of proceeds. While some known terrorist groups have used TBML, it is not a dominant method for terrorist financing according to the Treasury Department's June 2015 National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment. The Treasury Department's June 2015 National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment found that TBML is not a dominant method for terrorist financing. U.S. law enforcement investigations show that physical movement of cash and movement through the banking system are the primary methods of funding terrorists. Organizations have been predominant in convictions and cases pending since 2001, with the physical movement of cash and funds through the banking system being key methods. The State Department identified trade-based money laundering (TBML) as a significant issue in its latest Country Reports on Terrorism. The State Department identified trade-based money laundering (TBML) as a significant issue in its latest Country Reports on Terrorism, with 18 percent of funds being constituted through TBML. TBML is a concern in Tunisia and Syria, involving hawala brokers and corrupt officials. Hawala is an informal fund transfer method used in regions with limited banking presence. Hawala is an informal fund transfer method used in regions with limited banking presence, involving a network of trusted money brokers who facilitate transfers for clients. The system is preferred for its quickness, reliability, and lower cost, but is seen as lacking transparency by government authorities. Unregulated hawala systems, used for informal value transfers, are quick, reliable, and cost-effective. However, they lack transparency and are vulnerable to abuse by terrorist groups. The State Department's 2016 report identified specific countries at risk for trade-based money laundering and financial crimes. The State Department's 2016 report identified specific countries vulnerable to trade-based money laundering (TBML) and financial crimes. In Lebanon, individuals are involved in a TBML scheme with trade in vehicles and weapons to launder drug proceeds linked to Hezbollah. Money wires from Jordanian and Lebanese entities were identified coming into the United States. Trade in vehicles, sometimes with weapons, is used to launder drug proceeds linked to Hezbollah. U.S. law enforcement traced money wires from Jordanian and Lebanese entities to domestic vehicle dealerships in the United States. The purchased vehicles are exported to Lebanon and Jordan, with some containing hidden weapons. The transactions in the U.S. seem legitimate, but the final destination of the vehicles is unknown, and the proceeds may go back to Hezbollah in Lebanon. TBML schemes are prevalent in Paraguay's Tri-Border Area. TBML schemes involving vehicle trade are used for money laundering and potentially funding terrorist organizations like Hezbollah. In Paraguay's Tri-Border Area, a cross-border cigarette smuggling market worth $1 billion per year is also utilized for money laundering, benefiting criminal organizations and corrupt officials. In the United Arab Emirates, TBML schemes may support sanctions-evasion networks and terrorist groups in Afghanistan. In the United Arab Emirates, TBML schemes may support sanctions-evasion networks and terrorist groups like Hezbollah. The Lebanese Canadian Bank was designated as a primary money-laundering concern for aiding Hezbollah in drug and money laundering activities. The U.S. Treasury designated the Lebanese Canadian Bank as a primary money-laundering concern for supporting Hezbollah in drug and money laundering activities involving TBML. The bank facilitated illegal drug trafficking from South America to Europe and the Middle East through West Africa, laundering hundreds of millions of dollars monthly. They used trade-based money laundering with consumer goods worldwide, including wire transfers to U.S. banks for purchasing used cars. LCB facilitated wire transfers to U.S. banks to purchase used cars in the United States, which were then shipped to countries in West Africa and elsewhere. The proceeds from the car sales were repatriated back to Lebanon through bulk cash deposits among exchange houses. Additionally, Asian-supplied consumer goods were shipped to Latin America, and the proceeds were laundered through a BMPE-styled scheme. The Banque du Liban revoked LCB's banking license in September 2011 due to its involvement in illicit activities. LCB's former shareholders sold its assets to the Lebanese Societ\u00e9 Generale de Banque au Liban. Individuals and entities linked to this network have faced legal action. The Banque du Liban revoked LCB's banking license in September 2011, leading to the sale of its assets and liabilities to the Lebanese Societ\u00e9 Generale de Banque au Liban. Individuals and entities associated with this network have faced financial sanctions and law enforcement investigations in the United States for their involvement in illicit activities, including money laundering from Colombian and Mexican narcotics trafficking through a BMPE scheme. Woody Toys, Inc., a Los Angeles-based toy wholesaler, received millions in cash payments from Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking. They laundered the funds through a BMPE scheme by depositing small amounts under $10,000 into their bank account to avoid reporting requirements. The cash was used to purchase toys from China, which were then exported to Colombia. The Colombian pesos from toy sales were used to reimburse the drug traffickers. Some employees had previously worked for Angel Toy Company. Woody Toys, Inc., a Los Angeles-based toy wholesaler, received cash payments from Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking. They laundered the funds through a BMPE scheme by depositing small amounts into their bank account to purchase toys from China, which were exported to Colombia. The Colombian pesos from toy sales were used to reimburse the drug traffickers. Some employees had previously worked for Angel Toy Company, implicated in a similar scheme. Law enforcement investigation benefitted from information sharing between the United States and Colombia through Trade Transparency Units. The United States and Colombia have a sharing arrangement on trade data through Trade Transparency Units. An Indian national in Dubai was involved in a money laundering scheme using cash couriers, money transfer services, and trade finance mechanisms. An Indian national in Dubai was engaged in a money laundering scheme involving cash couriers, money transfer services, hawala, and trade finance mechanisms. The individual operated businesses in Dubai and affiliates globally, opening letters of credit for importers to benefit affiliated exporters in India and other countries. The LCs were in amounts higher than market value, facilitated through connections with certain banks. The individual in Dubai engaged in a money laundering scheme by opening LCs with inflated export values to benefit affiliated exporters in India. Bogus trade documents were used to satisfy banks, and drug trafficking funds were remitted along with the LCs. The exporters in India distributed the drug proceeds. The individual in Dubai engaged in a money laundering scheme by opening LCs with inflated export values to benefit affiliated exporters in India. The drug trafficking funds were remitted to the exporters in India, who then distributed the proceeds and sold the exports at market value. Additionally, the individual used various techniques to move funds offshore through hawala operators, facilitating trade in banned goods by falsifying trade documents. The individual in Dubai engaged in a money laundering scheme by falsifying trade documents through hawala operators to export banned goods from India. U.S. government policy responses to address trade-based money laundering include participation in the Financial Action Task Force, Treasury Department regulatory responses, and the use of Trade Transparency Units by the Department of Homeland Security. Policy responses and tools to address trade-based money laundering (TBML) include U.S. participation in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), Treasury Department regulatory responses, and the use of Trade Transparency Units by the Department of Homeland Security. FATF develops and promotes anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) guidelines, comprising 34 member countries and territories. While FATF has no enforcement capabilities, it conducts annual self-assessments and periodic mutual evaluations on member compliance, with the authority to suspend non-compliant countries. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) relies on self-assessments and mutual evaluations to ensure member compliance with guidelines. It can suspend non-compliant countries. Since 1989, FATF has focused on combating money laundering, issuing comprehensive recommendations in 1990. The U.S. delegation to FATF is led by the Treasury Department's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes (TFFC). The FATF issued 40 recommendations in 1990 to combat money laundering. The U.S. delegation, led by the Treasury Department's TFFC, supports FATF's global efforts against money laundering and terrorist financing. The United States strongly supports the FATF in combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The U.S. delegation, led by Treasury staff members, plays a key role in developing U.S. positions, representing the country at FATF meetings, and implementing domestic actions to meet commitments. In 2012, FATF members adopted a revised set of the FATF 40 Recommendations, integrating CFT guidelines into the core framework. The FATF 40 Recommendations were revised in 2012 and again in 2015 to include CFT guidelines and the financing of weapons of mass destruction. The new mandate aims to enhance global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats, strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and improve standards, especially in low capacity countries. The revised FATF recommendations aim to deepen global surveillance of criminal and terrorist threats, strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and improve standards, especially in low capacity countries. The new standards address emerging threats, strengthen requirements for higher-risk situations, and enhance transparency on beneficial ownership and control of legal entities. The FATF standards aim to address high-risk situations and enhance transparency on beneficial ownership and control of legal entities to combat various types of criminal activity. However, recommendations to counter trade-based money laundering are not included in the current set of FATF 40 Recommendations. Despite the recognition of the increased opportunities for abuse in the international trade and financing system by money launderers and terrorist financiers, trade-based money laundering (TBML) is not addressed in the current FATF 40 Recommendations. The FATF has issued stand-alone reports on TBML and best practices, but surveys show a lack of comprehensive data on the extent of the TBML issue due to jurisdictions not identifying it as a separate activity under money laundering. The FATF found a lack of comprehensive data on trade-based money laundering (TBML) due to jurisdictions not identifying it separately under money laundering. They also noted a lack of training programs specific to TBML for trade and finance specialists. The FATF recommended developing specific TBML training programs to improve detection efforts. The FATF recommended developing specific TBML training programs for trade and finance specialists to improve detection efforts. FinCEN plays a central role in combating TBML by issuing advisories and applying special measures to jurisdictions of primary money laundering concern. FinCEN combats TBML by issuing advisories and geographic targeting orders, applying special measures to high-risk jurisdictions, and red flagging activities for financial institutions to detect money laundering. The advisories aim to assist in filing SARs and reporting suspicious activity related to TBML, based on law enforcement experience with U.S. trade in Central and South America. In February 2010, FinCEN issued an advisory on TBML to aid financial institutions in reporting suspicious activity related to trade-based money laundering. The advisory highlighted basic schemes and specific red flags, emphasizing the need for consistent reporting and including TBML or BMPE on SARs. In May 2014, an updated advisory addressed increased TBML activity involving funnel accounts. In May 2014, FinCEN issued an updated advisory on trade-based money laundering (TBML) involving funnel accounts, following restrictions on U.S. currency in Mexico. Funnel accounts receive multiple cash deposits below reporting thresholds and withdraw funds in different areas quickly. The advisory outlines red flags for TBML activity by Mexican criminal and drug organizations. The advisory outlines red flags for trade-based money laundering (TBML) involving funnel accounts used by Mexican criminal and drug trafficking organizations. FinCEN has also started using Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) more frequently to identify criminal activity in specific geographic areas. Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) were first authorized in 1988 to assist regulators and law enforcement in identifying criminal activity. GTOs impose time-limited recordkeeping and reporting requirements on domestic financial institutions or nonfinancial businesses in specific geographic areas. Violators may face civil or criminal liability, and GTOs can only remain in effect for a maximum of 180 days. Recent GTOs have been used to combat trade-based money laundering (TBML), such as one issued in April 2015 for Miami-based electronics exporters. In April 2015, FinCEN issued a GTO for Miami-based electronics exporters, lowering cash reporting thresholds to combat TBML schemes by drug and transnational crime organizations. FinCEN issued a new GTO in October 2015, lowering cash reporting thresholds to $3,000 to combat TBML schemes by drug and transnational crime organizations like Sinaloa and Los Zetas. This GTO targeted businesses in the Los Angeles Fashion District to disrupt BMPE schemes used by Mexican and Colombian drug traffickers. The GTO issued by FinCEN in October 2015 targeted businesses in the Los Angeles Fashion District to combat BMPE schemes used by Mexican and Colombian drug traffickers. FinCEN may require financial institutions to take regulatory special measures against money laundering concerns. The Treasury Department can impose special measures on foreign entities deemed high risk for money laundering, ranging from enhanced due diligence to prohibiting certain account activities. OFAC also administers financial sanctions on designated foreign individuals and entities. In April 2013, the Treasury Department, through OFAC, designated Halawi and Rmeiti Exchanges as financial institutions of primary money laundering concern due to their involvement in a large-scale TBML scheme. The U.S. government designated Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange as primary money laundering concerns for their involvement in a TBML scheme and providing services to a narcotics trafficking network linked to Hezbollah. ICE/HSI established the first Trade Transparency Unit in Washington, DC in 2004. The U.S. government designated Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange as primary money laundering concerns for their involvement in a TBML scheme and providing services to a narcotics trafficking network linked to Hezbollah. ICE/HSI established the first Trade Transparency Unit in Washington, DC in 2004 to examine trade anomalies and financial irregularities in domestic and foreign trade data. The U.S. government designated Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange as primary money laundering concerns for their involvement in a TBML scheme and providing services to a narcotics trafficking network linked to Hezbollah. ICE/HSI established the first Trade Transparency Unit in Washington, DC in 2004 to examine trade anomalies and financial irregularities in domestic and foreign trade data. Trade data is used to identify instances of TBML, customs fraud, contraband smuggling, and tax evasion for further law enforcement investigation, often with funding support from the Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). TTUs have been established in various countries with the goal of developing an international network similar to the Egmont Group of FIUs, as part of the 2007 National Money Laundering Strategy. The 2007 National Money Laundering Strategy established attacking TBML as a national goal and called for the deployment of ICE-led TTUs to exchange and analyze trade data. The State Department reports that TBML investigations from TTU activity are increasing, with over $1 billion seized since the TTU effort began. The 114th Congress has addressed TBML in hearings exploring links with specific terrorist groups. The U.S.- and foreign-based TTU effort has seized over $1 billion since its creation. The 114th Congress has addressed TBML in hearings focusing on links with terrorist groups like Hezbollah and regional security priorities in Latin America. Witnesses have questioned the effectiveness of U.S. and international efforts to combat TBML. The 114th Congress has focused on addressing anti-money laundering and terrorist financing, with hearings questioning the effectiveness of efforts to combat trade-based money laundering (TBML). There is interest in linking U.S. trade policy to commitments to combat TBML and terrorist financing, potentially through the establishment of Trade Transparency Units (TTUs). The 114th Congress has shown interest in combating trade-based money laundering (TBML) and terrorist financing, with a focus on establishing Trade Transparency Units (TTUs). Concerns remain about links between terrorism and TBML, with examples implicating Hezbollah in TBML schemes. In December 2015, the Congress enacted the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 to address these issues. In December 2015, the 114th Congress enacted the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 to address concerns about links between terrorism and trade-based money laundering (TBML). The Act directed the President to impose additional financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial institutions with U.S. correspondent or payable-through accounts. It also required reporting to congressional committees on Hezbollah's financing operations, including its use of TBML for raising and transferring funds. The Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 required the President to report to congressional committees on Hezbollah's financing operations, including its use of TBML for raising funds. The Act also mandated the Secretaries of State and Treasury to brief congressional committees on Hezbollah's assets and financing activities. OFAC issued a final rule in April 2016 to implement the Act, with President Obama committing to imposing sanctions on Hezbollah operatives and supporters. President Obama is committed to taking strong action against Hizballah operatives and supporters, including imposing sanctions. The Treasury Department plans to implement the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 robustly while preserving the Lebanese financial system. Congress may monitor the Act's implementation and other financial tools to address TBML. Congress may seek to monitor the implementation of the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 and other financial tools to address trade-based money laundering (TBML) in the Lebanese financial system.
