    "content": "Prescription drug affordability has become a major concern due to the rapid increase in retail drug spending. This rise is attributed to manufacturers introducing new drugs and raising prices for existing brand-name products. Additionally, fewer brand-name drugs losing patent protection has resulted in lower savings from generic substitutes. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services predict a 6.3% annual growth in retail drug spending from 2017 to 2026. Retail drug spending is projected to increase by 6.3% annually from 2017 to 2026, with fewer drugs losing patent protection leading to lower savings from generics. CMS expects drug spending to outpace other medical expenses over the next decade. This report will cover government and private-sector policies affecting drug prices and availability. This report addresses government and private-sector policies impacting drug prices and availability, including federally funded research, regulation of direct-to-consumer advertising, legal restrictions on reimportation, and federal price negotiation. It provides an overview of the issues and references to more detailed CRS products. The appendix includes references to relevant congressional hearings. Data on prescription drug spending is commonly sourced from the National Health Expenditures accounts compiled by CMS. The National Health Expenditures (NHE) accounts compiled by CMS track annual spending on prescription drugs in retail settings. In 2016, the United States spent $328.6 billion on prescription drugs according to NHE data. According to recent NHE data, the United States spent $328.6 billion on prescription drugs in 2016 and is forecasted to spend $338.1 billion in 2017, accounting for 10% of predicted national health care spending. Prescription drug spending is expected to increase to about 11% of national health care spending by 2027. Retail drug spending has ranged from 5% to 10% of total health care expenditures since 1960. Retail drug spending has ranged from about 5% to 10% of total health care expenditures since 1960. The NHE data only provide information about retail drug sales, leading to an incomplete picture of U.S. drug spending. The Department of Health and Human Services issued a study in April 2016 to estimate total U.S. prescription drug spending, including retail and institutional use in hospitals. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a study in April 2016 to estimate total U.S. prescription drug spending, including retail and institutional use in hospitals. Various studies show a trend towards higher spending in recent years. The pace of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has varied through the decades, with growth slowing from 2003 through 2013 due to various reasons including a deep economic recession. In 2014, U.S. retail drug spending accelerated with a 12.4% increase, the largest in over a decade. Spending rose by 8.9% in 2015, slowed to a 1.3% increase in 2016, and is forecasted to increase by 2.9% in 2017. Retail prescription drug spending in the U.S. saw a significant increase in 2014, with a 12.4% jump, the largest in over a decade. The growth rate slowed down in the following years, with a 8.9% increase in 2015, a 1.3% increase in 2016, and a projected 2.9% increase in 2017. Despite this slowdown, retail drug spending is expected to continue growing at an average rate of 6.3% annually through 2027, driven by faster drug price growth, especially for specialty drugs. This growth rate is higher than other areas of health care spending. Retail prescription drug spending in the U.S. is expected to continue growing at an average rate of 6.3% annually through 2027, driven by faster drug price growth, particularly for specialty drugs. This growth rate is higher than other areas of health care spending, such as physician services and hospital care. Hearings have been held in Congress to address the sharp increases in drug prices and overall spending acceleration. Retail prescription drug spending has been the focus of congressional hearings due to the rise in prices and spending. Factors affecting spending include changes in drug availability, prices, and usage volume. The increase in spending in 2014 and 2015 was driven by new high-cost drugs, price hikes for existing drugs, and reduced generic substitution impact. The rise in retail drug spending in 2014 and 2015 was mainly due to new high-cost drugs, price increases for existing drugs, and decreased generic substitution impact. The implementation of the ACA also contributed to increased drug demand. Despite an overall rise in drug utilization in 2016, the rate of prescription drug spending slowed due to fewer new drug approvals, reduced use of expensive hepatitis C drugs, and decreased spending on diabetes treatments. Overall drug utilization increased in 2016, but prescription drug spending growth slowed due to factors such as fewer new drug approvals, decreased use of high-cost hepatitis C drugs, and reduced spending on diabetes treatments. The cost of new drugs versus older drugs, as well as the introduction of generic drugs, played a role in impacting drug spending trends. The FDA has approved many new expensive specialty drugs in recent years, leading to a significant increase in prescription drug spending. The introduction of new hepatitis C drugs has contributed to a large portion of this growth, with generic drugs offering a more cost-effective alternative. The introduction of new hepatitis C drugs significantly increased drug spending in 2014 and 2015, accounting for a large portion of the growth. However, the impact of these drugs is diminishing as fewer new patients are treated and net prices drop. New generic substitution has played a smaller role in reducing total drug spending since 2009. Since 2009, patents for best-selling brand-name drugs have expired, leading to the production of new generic versions. In 2012, spending for brand-name drugs subject to generic competition fell by $32.6 billion. However, savings from brands losing patent protection have decreased since then. Changes in drug mix will continue to impact spending, with many biologics in the development pipeline. Annual savings from brands losing patent protection have decreased since 2012. Changes in drug mix, especially the rise of biologics with high introductory prices, will continue to impact spending. FDA has approved biosimilar substitutes for some biologics, but their prices are not significantly lower. Prescription drug prices have outpaced overall U.S. goods and services prices since 2014. Prescription drug prices have risen faster than overall U.S. goods and services prices since 2014. The gap between drug and overall inflation narrowed significantly in 2017. Biosimilars for biologics with lost patent protection are not significantly lower-priced. U.S. retail drug inflation outpaced general consumer inflation in recent years, driven by price increases for brand-name and generic drugs. Manufacturers raised prices for existing drugs, while new innovator brand-name drugs also contributed to the inflation. However, a 2016 HHS study found that generic price increases were not a major factor. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts also analyzed prescription drug prices. The 2016 HHS study found that generic price increases were not a major contributor to inflation. Express Scripts analysis showed brand-name drug prices rose 10.7% from 2015 to 2016, while generic drug prices declined by 8.7%. ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage boosted demand for drugs since 2014. Specialty drugs and biologics drove much of the price inflation in the brand-name drug category. The ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage has increased demand for drugs since 2014, with biologics and specialty drugs driving price inflation in the brand-name drug category. Studies show a nearly 15% annual increase in drug spending for insured consumers from 2014 to 2015, mainly due to higher utilization. Medicaid coverage also expanded under the ACA, including drug coverage. The ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage has led to a significant increase in drug spending, driven by higher utilization. This increase is also attributed to Medicaid coverage expansion, particularly for non-elderly, low-income individuals. Additionally, the aging population, especially patients aged 50 and older, has contributed to a rise in drug dispensing. The aging population, especially patients aged 50 and older, has contributed to a 20% rise in gross Medicaid prescription drug spending. Consumer out-of-pocket spending for prescriptions has decreased over the years as commercial payers and taxpayer-financed health programs cover a growing share of the nation's retail drug bill. Consumer out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs has decreased over the years, with commercial payers and taxpayer-financed health programs covering a growing share of the nation's retail drug bill. Out-of-pocket spending is forecast to account for 12.1% of retail drug costs in 2026. Consumer out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs is forecast to account for 12.1% of retail drug costs in 2026. Health plans have been increasing cost sharing for prescription drugs to control spending, with the share of commercial health plans with a prescription drug deductible rising to 46% from 2012 to 2015. Health plans have been imposing higher cost sharing for prescription drugs in an effort to control spending and costs. The share of commercial health plans with a prescription drug deductible rose to 46% from 23% from 2012 to 2015. Formulary tiered pricing and coinsurance for expensive drugs are becoming more common. The use of formulary tiered pricing and coinsurance for expensive drugs is increasing, imposing a greater financial burden on consumers. For example, in 2017, enrollees in employer-sponsored health plans with multiple drug tiers had significantly higher co-payments for high-priced drugs compared to generic drugs. In 2017, enrollees in employer-sponsored health plans faced higher co-payments for high-priced drugs compared to generic drugs, increasing financial burden. The ACA helped by capping total annual out-of-pocket spending and reducing cost sharing for Part D enrollees. Pharmaceutical manufacturers provided patient assistance through discount coupons and assistance programs. In recent years, health plans have eliminated cost sharing for contraceptives and reduced costs for Part D enrollees. Pharmaceutical manufacturers have increased patient assistance with discount coupons and assistance programs. Generic drug use rates have risen, leading to a decrease in average out-of-pocket spending for retail drugs. However, the number of consumers facing high out-of-pocket costs, especially those with serious conditions or needing specialty drugs, has increased. Recent studies show that average out-of-pocket spending for retail drugs has decreased in recent years. However, the number of consumers facing high out-of-pocket costs, particularly those with serious conditions or requiring specialty drugs, has increased significantly. In 2014, nearly 3% of enrollees in large employer-sponsored health plans had out-of-pocket costs exceeding $1,000, accounting for a third of drug spending and overall out-of-pocket expenses. The share of people with high drug costs has tripled since 2004. The share of people with high drug costs has tripled since 2004, with nearly 3% of enrollees facing out-of-pocket costs exceeding $1,000 in 2014. Out-of-pocket spending for outpatient specialty drugs increased by 46% from 2003 to 2014, while spending on nonspecialty drugs decreased by 57%. Per person out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs declined from $146 in 2010 to $140 in 2016. Out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs declined from $146 in 2010 to $140 in 2016. It is forecast to dip to $137 in 2017 and then gradually increase to $207 by 2026. This spending is expected to rise more slowly than overall U.S. retail drug spending in the next decade, leading to a continued decline in out-of-pocket spending as a share of retail drug expenditures. Congress and presidential administrations have expanded subsidized drug coverage to tens of millions of consumers during the past decade. Out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs is forecast to decline to $137 in 2017 and gradually increase to $207 by 2026. The government share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending rose from 25% in 2005 to 44.1% in 2017 and is projected to reach 47% by 2026. Unlike other industrialized nations, the United States does not have universal drug coverage. Drug spending in the United States, including federal, state, and local expenditures, increased from 25% in 2005 to 44.1% in 2017, with a projected rise to 47% by 2026. Unlike other countries, the U.S. lacks a centralized system for managing government-sponsored drug benefits and setting drug prices, relying instead on various departments and agencies to oversee different programs. The federal health programs operate different drug discount and contracting systems, with FDA regulating drug safety. Congress has not given FDA authority to set drug prices. Federal agencies can secure discounts for prescription drugs, but prices vary among programs. Federal agencies can secure substantial discounts for prescription drugs under a decentralized system, with Medicaid rebates equaling 47% of Medicaid spending in 2012 and making up a smaller 15% of Part D spending that same year. Medicaid rebates for some drugs were significantly larger than Part D rebates for the same products. Legislation has been introduced to give the HHS Secretary more power to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. The HHS Secretary may receive more power to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. A table outlines prescription purchasing systems for federal health care programs like Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, Medicaid, and the Veterans Health Administration system. These programs were chosen as they are among the largest federal health programs. The table outlines prescription purchasing systems for federal health care programs like Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, Medicaid, and the Veterans Health Administration system. These programs were chosen as they are among the largest federal health programs. Medicare Part D is designed as a market-oriented program where commercial health payers compete for enrollees based on drug coverage prices and scope. Part D plan sponsors negotiate drug rebates and discounts with manufacturers and contract with pharmacies to dispense drugs at set rates to enrollees. The Medicare Part D program involves various entities negotiating drug rebates and discounts with manufacturers and pharmacies to dispense drugs to enrollees. The market-based model created by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 includes a \"noninterference provision\" to promote competition. Congress has debated the effectiveness of this model in controlling drug costs. The Medicare Part D program includes a noninterference provision to promote competition in negotiations between plan sponsors, drug manufacturers, and pharmacies. Congress has debated the effectiveness of this market-based model in controlling drug prices and enrollee costs. Program spending has been below initial budget projections, with total drug rebates forecasted to rise to 24% in 2018. Total Part D drug rebates have increased from 9.6% in 2007 to a projected 24% in 2018. Studies show that Part D plans have higher drug prices compared to Medicaid, which secures lower prices. Lawmakers are considering changes to the noninterference provision to address this issue. Some lawmakers propose modifying the noninterference provision to allow the Secretary to negotiate drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries, leveraging their combined purchasing power for larger discounts. In 2007, the House approved a bill that would have granted this negotiation authority. In 2007, the House approved H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act of 2007, allowing the Secretary to negotiate Part D drug prices but not to craft a formulary. A CBO analysis stated that the bill would only produce savings if the Secretary had authority to create a central formulary or set prices administratively. Patient and consumer groups have opposed giving the Secretary more control over the Part D formulary. The Obama and Trump Administrations recommended giving the Secretary authority to negotiate prices for Medicare Part D high-cost and biologic drugs, but proposals were not scored as producing cost savings. Lawmakers introduced bills to modify the noninterference provision in recent Congress sessions. Patient and consumer groups have opposed proposals to give the Secretary more control of the Part D formulary. The Trump Administration recommended additional approaches for Medicare Part D, including requiring plans to pass on more drug rebates to enrollees and moving some Part B-covered drugs to Part D. Lawmakers have also introduced legislation to apply Medicaid's rebates to Part D drugs for low-income enrollees, with potential cost savings according to CBO. State governments play a key role in regulating prescription drug use and pricing, as they are the main regulators of health insurance and jointly administer and fund Medicaid with the federal government. Lawmakers have introduced legislation to apply Medicaid's rebates to Part D drugs for low-income enrollees, with potential cost savings according to CBO. State governments regulate prescription drug use and pricing, administer Medicaid with the federal government, and offer health insurance plans. Some states have patient assistance programs for low-income residents. Various approaches are used to address drug spending and access, focusing on limiting spending for high-priced drugs and requiring price transparency. States are implementing laws to limit prescription drug costs for low-income residents, such as setting caps on cost sharing and requiring manufacturer disclosure for drugs with significant price increases. The Vermont law requires drug manufacturers to justify large price increases for certain drugs used by residents. Other states are also implementing legislation to hold drug companies accountable for pricing and to allow pharmacists to inform consumers about cheaper prescription options. The United States spends more on prescription drugs than other industrialized nations, with a 34% share of global drug spending in 2016. Some states are passing legislation to allow pharmacists to inform consumers about cheaper prescription options and to hold drug companies accountable for pricing. Maine enacted a law in 2013 allowing citizens to import prescription drugs from certain countries, but it was ruled unconstitutional in 2015. The United States spends more on prescription drugs than other industrialized nations, with a 34% share of global drug spending in 2016. U.S. per capita spending for retail prescription drugs was $1,162 in 2015, compared to the OECD average of $553. The United States spends a significant amount on prescription drugs, with a 34% share of global drug spending in 2016. A study by the OECD found that U.S. per capita spending for retail prescription drugs was $1,162 in 2015, much higher than the OECD average of $553. Studies have also shown large price differences for specific drugs between the U.S. and other countries, with U.S. prices often double those in the European Union. In a recent study, researchers at the University of Liverpool found that cancer drugs in the U.S. are often priced double compared to the European Union. Reasons for higher U.S. spending include faster adoption of new drugs and market exclusivity for manufacturers. OECD countries may have government-run healthcare systems that purchase and set drug prices. The United States has patent protections for drugs and market exclusivity for manufacturers. OECD countries may have government-run healthcare systems that set drug prices using external reference pricing and value-based pricing. In Canada, the Common Drug Review evaluates new and existing drugs for reimbursement by federal, territorial, and provincial drug plans. The U.S. is exploring alternative pricing models, such as Harvard Pilgrim Health Care's deal with a private health insurer in 2016. Assessments are shared with federal, territorial, and provincial drug plans for reimbursement. U.S. government and commercial payers are experimenting with new pricing models, such as value-based purchasing. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care has a deal with drugmakers Novartis and Eli Lilly for discounts based on health improvement goals. CMS is encouraging state Medicaid programs to adopt value-based purchasing, with guidance from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) producing public reports. CMS has encouraged state Medicaid programs to move towards value-based purchasing, with guidance from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) producing public reports on the effectiveness and cost of newly approved drugs. The pharmaceutical industry has raised concerns about the potential impact on reimbursement and patient access to treatments. The pharmaceutical industry has raised concerns about research designed to limit reimbursement and patient access to treatments. ICER has refined its methodology for valuing prescription drugs, reaching out to different segments of the health care industry. The federal government focuses on basic or preclinical research, while the pharmaceutical industry concentrates more on clinical trials than on discovery activity. The pharmaceutical industry tends to focus more on clinical trials than on discovery activity. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements can be challenging, with basic research like recombinant DNA playing a crucial role in the development of new drugs. Studies have tried to quantify the contribution of publicly funded research versus private industry in the discovery of new drugs, with one study finding that only 6.7% of new drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 1999 were from publicly funded research. A study in 2003 found that only 6.7% of new drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 1999 originated from sources other than private industry. Another study in 1993 reported that 7.6% of new drugs approved from 1981 to 1990 came from nonindustry sources. These studies highlight the limited contribution of publicly funded research to the discovery of new drugs compared to private industry. A 2010 study found that 24.1% of new molecular entities (NMEs) and new biologics approved by the FDA between 1998 and 2007 originated from publicly funded research. Another study by Ashley J. Stevens et al. in 2011 provides a more comprehensive look at the contribution of publicly funded research to the discovery of new drugs. The study by Ashley J. Stevens et al. in 2011 found that 9.3% of drugs approved by the FDA from 1990 to 2007 resulted from publicly funded research. 19% of drug applications granted priority review by the FDA were from publicly funded research. The FDA granted priority review to 348 out of 1,541 drug applications, with 19% resulting from publicly funded research. Public-sector research institutions had a higher rate of priority reviews compared to private-sector research, with an increase by a factor of 2.3. Priority review is for evaluating drugs that would be significant improvements in treating serious conditions. The FDA grants priority review to drug applications that would be significant improvements in treating serious conditions. Public-sector research institutions have a higher rate of priority reviews compared to private-sector research. PSRIs tend to discover drugs with important clinical effects. The 2011 Stevens study defined PSRI participation in drug discovery research. The 2011 Stevens study defined PSRI participation in drug discovery research as creating intellectual property specific to a drug that was transferred to a company through a commercial license. The study excluded the role of PSRIs in developing platform technologies that contributed to new drug classes approved by the FDA. The study excluded platform technologies developed with public funds, such as recombinant DNA technology, bacterial production methods, antibody production methods, glycosylated protein production methods, and gene silencing methods. The study found that public funding contributed to the development of new drugs using platform technologies such as recombinant DNA, bacterial production methods, antibody production methods, glycosylated protein production methods, and gene silencing methods. This funding played a crucial role in the pharmaceutical industry's economic outlook. The pharmaceutical industry's economic outlook was significantly influenced by public funding, with a 2018 study revealing that NIH funding was associated with every new drug approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2016. This funding, amounting to about $100 billion from 2000 to 2016, supported both basic and applied research on new molecular entities (NMEs). The study found that up to 20% of the NIH budget allocation from 2000 to 2016, or about $100 billion, was associated with research contributing to new drug approvals from 2010-2016. This suggests that the NIH's contribution to new drug research is greater than previously thought. The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development estimates average spending for clinical research on new drugs based on data from 10 large drug manufacturers. Detailed information about the cost of developing specific drugs is generally not available. The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development estimates that the cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug is $2.6 billion, including $1.4 billion in clinical spending and $1.2 billion in time costs. This is based on data voluntarily provided by 10 large drug manufacturers. The cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug is estimated at $2.6 billion, with $1.4 billion in clinical spending and $1.2 billion in time costs. Tufts' 2014 study updated previous analyses, including a 2002 report that estimated the cost at $802 million. Academic and government research has raised questions about the assumptions made in the Tufts study, such as the rate of return needed to attract capital and the impact of federal tax breaks on research. The study raises questions about drug companies needing a 10.5% rate of return to attract capital during drug development, the mix of drugs sampled, and the impact of federal tax breaks on research. Estimates for drug development costs range from $1.2 billion to $2.6 billion and are sensitive to factors like development time, cost of capital, and inclusion of orphan drugs with special tax breaks. Transparency legislation is being debated in Congress. The study questions factors influencing drug development costs, including assumptions about development time, cost of capital, and the inclusion of orphan drugs with special tax breaks. Price transparency legislation aims to compel drugmakers to disclose data on research and marketing costs for high-priced drugs. Price transparency legislation assumes that research and development costs are a main factor in setting drug prices, but studies show that research cost was not a primary factor in pricing specific drugs. For example, a Senate investigation found that Gilead Pharmaceutical's pricing of hepatitis C drugs was not based on research and development costs. Gilead's pricing strategy for hepatitis C drugs was focused on maximizing revenue, not research and development costs. Pfizer's pricing of Ibrance was influenced by existing drug prices, reimbursement, and prescriber feedback. The main factors influencing Pfizer's pricing of the breast cancer drug Ibrance include existing drug prices, reimbursement, and prescriber feedback. The United States and New Zealand are the only nations allowing direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs, regulated by the FDA to ensure accuracy and balance in the information provided. Pharmaceutical companies use various marketing strategies, including direct-to-consumer advertising (DTC). DTC ads must be accurate, balanced, and relevant to the drug's intended uses. Businesses can deduct advertising expenses from their taxes. In addition to DTC ads, pharmaceutical firms also market to healthcare providers through various channels. Pharmaceutical advertising has evolved since 1962. Pharmaceutical advertising has evolved since 1962, with DTC advertising being just one facet of the industry's promotion efforts. In addition to DTC ads, pharmaceutical firms also market to healthcare providers through various channels. FDA regulations in 1969 required manufacturers to provide true and balanced information in drug advertising. In the 1980s, pharmaceutical firms began advertising to consumers, which was addressed by FDA in a 1985 notice. Since the 1980s, pharmaceutical firms have expanded advertising to consumers, with FDA regulations addressing this shift. DTC prescription drug advertising grew steadily, reaching over $5 billion in 2006. Advertising declined during the 2007 recession but rebounded by 2014. Recent data shows a rapid increase in DTC advertising in recent years. Drug advertising grew steadily over the decades, reaching over $5 billion in 2006. It dipped during the 2007 recession but rebounded by 2014. Recent data shows a rapid increase in pharmaceutical DTC advertising, with spending rising to over $6 billion from 2012 to 2015. Television and newspaper ads make up the majority of DTC advertising spending. The pharmaceutical industry saw a rapid increase in direct-to-consumer advertising spending, reaching over $6 billion from 2012 to 2015. Television and newspaper ads dominate this spending, but internet-based drug ads are growing quickly. FDA regulations require drug companies to submit ads for assessment to ensure they are fair and balanced. According to FDA regulations, drug companies must submit prescription drug ads for assessment to ensure they are fair and balanced. An FDA analysis from 2001 to 2014 shows an increase in internet drug promotions, while television promotions remain steady. Pharmaceutical advertising supporters believe it leads to more informed consumers who are proactive in their healthcare. Critics and supporters have differing views on pharmaceutical advertising. Supporters believe it leads to more informed consumers who are proactive in their healthcare, while critics argue that it may encourage inappropriate prescribing and higher drug spending. Advertising for new brand-name drugs with higher prices may lead consumers to seek brand-name products, substituting them for lower-priced brand or generic drugs or beginning a course of treatment where previously no drug had been used. Recent studies suggest a link between drug advertising and increased use of prescription drugs, with a 10% rise in drug advertising views leading to a 5.4% increase in filled prescriptions. Recent studies show a connection between drug advertising and increased prescription drug use. A 2015 study found that a 10% increase in drug advertising views resulted in a 5.4% increase in filled prescriptions. However, concerns have been raised about the lack of information on drug benefits and risks in direct-to-consumer advertisements. The public has concerns about direct-to-consumer drug advertisements, with many feeling they lack sufficient information on benefits and risks. There have been debates in Congress about restricting these ads, with the goal of protecting public health and finances. The American Medical Association and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists have recommended a ban on DTC drug ads. The American Medical Association and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists recommended a ban on direct-to-consumer drug ads to protect public health and finances. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed a moratorium on advertising for new drugs, raising constitutional issues due to First Amendment protection of commercial speech. Manufacturers are focusing ad dollars on newly introduced products, sparking concerns about promoting new drugs to consumers prematurely. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed a moratorium on advertising for new drugs, with concerns about promoting new drugs to consumers prematurely. The Institute of Medicine recommended FDA restrict DTC advertising of new drugs for two years after introduction, but Congress has not approved a moratorium on advertising for new drugs. Lawmakers also introduced legislation to disallow federal tax deductions for pharmaceutical DTC advertising. The FDA regulates the sale of pharmaceuticals in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Without an approved marketing application, a manufacturer cannot sell a drug in the U.S. market. Congress has debated legislation to restrict DTC advertising of new drugs and disallow federal tax deductions for pharmaceutical advertising. The FDA regulates the sale of pharmaceuticals in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. A manufacturer cannot sell a drug in the U.S. market without an approved marketing application, which includes clinical data on safety and effectiveness, manufacturing procedures, reporting processes, and labeling. No imported drug would technically fulfill all approval elements due to detailed requirements. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 clarified that only the manufacturer of an FDA-approved prescription drug can legally bring it back into the United States, even if it had been sold or transferred to a foreign country. The Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act (MEDS Act) of 2000 allowed pharmacists and wholesalers to import FDA-approved prescription drugs, but in practice, importation has not been allowed. The act required the HHS Secretary to certify to Congress before implementing regulations for import provisions. The MEDS Act of 2000 allowed importation of FDA-approved prescription drugs, but implementation has not occurred due to lack of necessary certifications by the HHS Secretary. The MEDS Act of 2000 allowed importation of FDA-approved prescription drugs, but implementation has not occurred due to lack of necessary certifications by the HHS Secretary. Congress included a provision in the Medicare Modernization and Prescription Drug Act of 2003, but importation has never been carried out. If implemented, companies could produce and package drugs outside the US for importation. The PDMA, MEDS Act, and MMA legislation addressed importation of FDA-approved prescription drugs by entities other than the manufacturer. Lawmakers have attempted to use the agriculture appropriations bill to bypass administrative obstacles to drug importation. Lawmakers have tried to use the agriculture appropriations bill to allow importation of prescription drugs by individuals, pharmacies, and wholesalers, bypassing FDA restrictions. FDA has been lenient in enforcing personal importation rules, allowing a small amount of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use. The FDA has chosen to be lenient in enforcing personal importation restrictions, allowing individuals to bring a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use. Individuals must affirm in writing that the drugs are for their own use and provide their treating physician's information. The intent of the FDA's personal-use import policy is to save resources and facilitate personal use importation. The FDA's personal importation policy allows individuals to bring a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use, with the intent to save resources and facilitate importation. The policy does not cover foreign-made chemical versions of drugs available in the United States. The FDA's personal importation policy allows individuals to bring a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use, with the intent to save resources and facilitate importation. Some states have tried to pass laws allowing prescription drug importation, while consumers now use the policy to seek lower prices for FDA-approved drugs available in the United States. Some states in the United States have tried to pass laws allowing prescription drug importation. Senate committees have discussed the FDA's role in the generic drug marketplace and the repercussions of Valeant Pharmaceuticals' business model on patients and the healthcare system. The Senate committees have discussed the repercussions of Valeant Pharmaceuticals' business model on patients and the healthcare system. The Senate committees have held hearings on sudden price spikes in off-patent drugs and examined the proposed Medicare Part B drug demonstration. The Senate committees have examined the proposed Medicare Part B drug demonstration and discussed the cost of prescription drugs. The Senate committees have examined the proposed Medicare Part B drug demonstration and discussed the cost of prescription drugs. The Cost of Prescription Drugs: How the Drug Delivery System Affects What Patients Pay was discussed in various sessions in 2017. The Senate committees have examined the cost of prescription drugs in various sessions, including discussions on the impact of the drug delivery system on what patients pay. The sessions include topics such as EpiPen price increases and regulatory barriers inhibiting pharmaceutical competition.
