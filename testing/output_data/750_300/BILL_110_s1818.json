    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Missing Mercury in Manufacturing Monitoring and Mitigation Act\". Congress finds that mercury and mercury compounds are highly toxic to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife. Approximately 10 percent of women of childbearing age in the United States have mercury in their bloodstreams at levels that could harm their unborn babies. Additionally, around 630,000 children born annually in the United States are at risk of neurological issues due to mercury exposure in utero. The main source of mercury exposure in the US is through consuming mercury-contaminated fish. The long-term solution to mercury pollution is essential. The significant source of mercury exposure in the United States is ingestion of mercury-contaminated fish. The long-term solution to mercury pollution is to minimize global mercury use and releases to reduce contamination levels in the environment. Additional tons of mercury are used at mercury cell chlor-alkali plants worldwide. Uncontaminated fish is a critical source of nutrition worldwide. An estimated 24,000 to 30,000 tons of mercury are used at mercury cell chlor-alkali plants globally, leading to transboundary pollution affecting bodies of water near industrial areas like the Great Lakes and remote areas like the Arctic Circle. Only 8 out of 30 chlorine plants in the US use the outdated mercury cell chlor-alkali process, with 5 plants yet to commit to phasing out mercury. These plants account for only 10% of chlorine and caustic soda production in the country. The chlor-alkali industry in the United States uses mercury in only 10% of chlorine and caustic soda production, with cost-effective alternatives available for the remaining 90%. Other countries like Japan have already banned the mercury cell chlor-alkali process due to contamination risks. Other countries, including Japan, have banned the mercury cell chlor-alkali process due to contamination risks. The chlor-alkali industry acknowledges that mercury can contaminate products and result in the release of mercury. Despite known mercury usage, neither the industry nor the EPA can account for its disposition. Despite significant mercury usage in the chlor-alkali industry, neither the industry nor the EPA can account for its disposition or accurately estimate current emissions. The United States must work aggressively to minimize mercury supply, demand, and releases domestically and internationally. Congress declares the need to develop policies to reduce mercury use and emissions in the United States, including reducing exposures to mercury for women of childbearing age and young children. Additionally, an amendment to the Toxic Substances Control Act aims to regulate the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. The Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to regulate the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. The manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States starting January 1, 2012. Reporting requirements must be met by April 1, 2008. Effective January 1, 2012, manufacturing chlorine or caustic soda with mercury cells is banned in the US. Owners of chlor-alkali facilities must report mercury waste annually to the EPA and state authorities by April 1, 2008. The report identifies the type and quantity of mercury-containing hazardous and nonhazardous waste generated by the chlor-alkali facility, the mercury content of the wastes, how each waste was managed, and the volume of mercury released into the air or water. The curr_chunk provides details on the volume of mercury released and accumulated in pipes and plant equipment at the chlor-alkali facility. The curr_chunk details the volume of mercury in equipment at the chlor-alkali facility, as well as the quantity and forms of mercury in products for sale. The Administrator may allow combining this report with others to avoid duplication. The Administrator may permit combining the report on mercury volume in equipment at chlor-alkali facilities with other required reports to avoid duplication. Additionally, for chlor-alkali facilities ceasing operations after July 1, 2008, an inventory must be submitted within 1 year of cessation. For chlor-alkali facilities ceasing operations after July 1, 2008, the Administrator must conduct a comprehensive mercury inventory within 1 year, considering mercury purchased and remaining in equipment. The comprehensive mercury inventory for chlor-alkali facilities closing after July 1, 2008 includes total mercury purchased, remaining in equipment, estimated mercury in waste generated, and aggregate mercury releases. The Administrator will obtain records and information from chlor-alkali facilities to determine mercury releases into the environment. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee is established with 9 members to determine mercury releases from chlor-alkali facilities into the environment. The `Mercury Storage Advisory Committee' consists of 9 members, with 2 members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the majority leader of the Senate. One member serves as the Chairperson of the Committee. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee consists of 9 members, including a Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, Administrator, Secretary of Defense, representative of State environmental agencies, and other representatives. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee includes 9 members, with representatives from State environmental agencies, State attorneys general, the chlorine industry, the mercury waste treatment industry, and a nonprofit environmental organization. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee consists of 9 members, including representatives from State environmental agencies, State attorneys general, the chlorine industry, the mercury waste treatment industry, and a nonprofit environmental organization. The Administrator will appoint members within 45 days of enactment, with specific representatives designated for the mercury waste treatment industry and a nonprofit environmental organization. The Committee must hold its initial meeting within 30 days after appointment. The Committee described in clauses (iv) through (viii) of subparagraph (A) shall be appointed by congressional committees. Within 30 days of all members being appointed, the Committee must hold its initial meeting. Meetings will be called by the Chairperson, with a majority of members constituting a quorum. A report must be submitted within 1 year of enactment. The Committee, appointed by congressional committees, must hold an initial meeting within 30 days of all members being appointed. A majority of members will constitute a quorum for meetings called by the Chairperson. Within 1 year of enactment, a report must be submitted describing findings and recommendations related to environmental, health, and safety requirements to prevent the release of elemental mercury into the environment and worker exposure from its storage. The report must include requirements to prevent the release of elemental mercury into the environment and worker exposure from its storage, estimated annual storage costs, and the optimal size and characteristics of Federal facilities for storing elemental mercury. The report will also cover the estimated quantity of elemental mercury resulting from discontinuing mercury cells at chlor-alkali facilities in the US and other potential supplies needing storage. The report will include the estimated quantity of elemental mercury generated from recycling unwanted products and other wastes for a 40-year period to comply with export prohibitions. The report will also address any barriers preventing the private sector from storing elemental mercury produced during the 40-year period, along with discussing the advantages and disadvantages of such storage. The report will discuss measures to address barriers in storing mercury produced by public and private sources, advantages and disadvantages of consolidating storage under public or private management, the optimal plan for storing excess mercury, and any additional research needed for long-term disposal options. The Committee will address excess mercury storage from public and private sources, including research needed for long-term disposal options. Members will be compensated accordingly. Members of the Committee who are not federal government officers or employees will be compensated at a rate equal to the daily equivalent of the annual rate of basic pay for level V of the Executive Schedule under title 5, United States Code, for each day engaged in Committee duties.
