Congress finds that United States workers at marine facilities and onboard vessels must carry a Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. Nearly two million transportation workers have obtained TWICs to date. Nearly two million transportation workers have applied for and received a TWIC, which costs $132.50 and is valid for up to five years. Workers must make multiple trips to an enrollment center to obtain and activate their TWIC, and request a new card when it expires. Workers applying for a TWIC must make multiple trips to an enrollment center, costing $132.50, valid for five years. Renewal requires another trip and payment. Many face long distances to the nearest center. The TWIC enrollment process requires multiple time-consuming trips to a center, not mandated by law but by DHS policy aligning with PIV standards. The TWIC issuance aligns with PIV standards outlined in FIPS-201, but DHS may deviate when necessary. Unlike other government credentials, TWIC serves as a work permit. The TWIC program differs from other government-issued credentials by serving as a work permit for a mobile private sector workforce. Possession of a TWIC does not automatically grant access to secure areas without authorization under a Coast Guard-approved security plan. DHS has the authority to explore alternative processes for TWIC. The TWIC program requires authorization under a Coast Guard-approved security plan for access to vessels and facilities. DHS has the flexibility to develop an alternative enrollment process that avoids multiple trips to enrollment centers. Secure identity documents, like US passports, can be mailed to applicants. Congress mandated a final rule for TWIC biometric readers. The TWIC program allows access to vessels and facilities with Coast Guard-approved security plans. Secure identity documents, including US passports, can be sent to applicants by mail. Congress required a final rule for TWIC biometric readers by August 2010, which has not been issued yet. SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. Congress emphasizes the urgent need for reforming the TWIC application process by the end of 2012 to avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens on US workers and businesses. The Secretary of Homeland Security should promptly implement regulations for TWIC readers to enhance security. The final regulations require the deployment of TWIC readers promptly to enhance security. Funds awarded for TWIC projects under the Port Security Grant Program shall not expire before the issuance of the final TWIC reader rule. The Secretary of Homeland Security will reform the TWIC application process to require only one in-person visit within 90 days of the enactment of the Act, with exceptions for extenuating circumstances. This was passed by the House of Representatives on June 28, 2012."
