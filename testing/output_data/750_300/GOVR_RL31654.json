    "content": "The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides legal protection to identified species and their habitats. Administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the ESA categorizes species as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\" based on their risk of extinction. Once listed, the ESA offers legal tools to aid in species recovery and habitat protection, including prohibiting unpermitted \"take.\" The Endangered Species Act (ESA) categorizes species as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\" based on extinction risk. Legal tools are available to aid species recovery and protect habitats, including prohibiting unpermitted \"take.\" As of August 24, 2016, 2,266 species of animals and plants were listed. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) was passed in 1973 to protect species at risk of extinction. As of August 24, 2016, 2,266 species of animals and plants were listed as endangered or threatened, with 1,593 in the United States. The ESA has been amended multiple times since its inception in 1973. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) was passed in 1973 to protect species at risk of extinction. Currently, 1,156 U.S. species have recovery plans under the ESA. The ESA has been amended several times since its inception in 1973, with funding authorization expiring in 1992 but appropriations continuing annually. The ESA's purpose is to conserve ecosystems for endangered and threatened species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to conserve ecosystems for endangered and threatened species, regardless of appropriations. It can become a battleground in debates over scarce resources, with economic interests on multiple sides of vanishing species issues. The ESA lacks strict provisions compared to laws like the ESA. Economic interests are involved in debates over vanishing species, which are often indicators of resource scarcities and ecosystem changes. Examples include the Tellico Dam and Northwest timber harvest controversies. The worldwide debate over global climate change has found an avatar in the polar bear, leading to tensions over the Endangered Species Act (ESA) as species are added to the protected list. Congress and the executive branch have grappled with balancing economic development and conservation efforts. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has become a focal point of debate as species are added to the protected list due to the growing economy and human population affecting habitats. Efforts to tailor the ESA for specific circumstances have been made by Congress and the executive branch to address tensions between species conservation and development needs. Critics argue that more needs to be done to accommodate other needs, while defenders believe the ESA balances biases towards development in other laws and policies. Critics argue that current efforts to accommodate needs other than species conservation are insufficient, while defenders of the ESA believe it balances biases towards development in other laws and policies. Debate on the ESA is divided along demographic lines, with stronger support for species conservation among urban and suburban populations compared to rural areas, and among those living along the coasts versus central and mountain states. Native Americans, who often rely on natural resources, are frequently involved in ESA issues and tend to support conservation efforts. Support for species conservation under the ESA varies among different demographic groups, with stronger backing from urban and suburban populations compared to rural areas. Native Americans, who rely on natural resources, often support conservation efforts. The debate also involves sport hunters, anglers, and groups advocating for or against strong protections for listed species, with arguments revolving around job loss and ethical considerations. Religious groups are also active participants in the discussion. The debate over the Endangered Species Act (ESA) involves various groups with differing views on conservation efforts. While some industries view the ESA as a problem, others see it as supporting their interests. The ESA provides statutory authority for certain activities and appropriations within a statute. Both sides claim ethical support for their positions, with many religious groups participating in the debate. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides statutory authority for activities and appropriations. Questions arise about the act's prohibitions and authorities, House and Senate rules on appropriations without current authorization, and the impact of funding appropriations beyond FY1992. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) raises questions about funding appropriations, including the act's prohibitions and authorities, House and Senate rules on appropriations without current authorization, and the impact of funding beyond FY1992. Despite the authorization for appropriations expiring in FY1992, agencies still have authority to carry out actions under the ESA. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is still enforceable despite the authorization for appropriations expiring in FY1992. The agencies have the authority to conduct actions and enforce prohibitions under the act, even without appropriated funds. The statutory obligations created by the ESA remain in effect, regardless of funding limitations. The Endangered Species Act remains enforceable even without appropriated funds. The statutory obligations created by the law persist, and citizens can still file civil suits for violations, regardless of agency funding. Citizens can file civil suits for violations of the Endangered Species Act under 11(g) (16 U.S.C. \u00a71540(g), regardless of agency funding. This could deter parties from carrying out prohibited acts even if FWS or NMFS lack funds for enforcement. The House and Senate have rules distinguishing between authorizations and appropriations, but these rules are for Congress's convenience and do not affect a law's validity. House Rule XXI prohibits unauthorized appropriations, while House Rule XXII prohibits conference consideration. Either chamber can choose to observe or waive its rules during the legislative process. House rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in measures, amendments, and conference reports. These rules are enforced through points of order on the floor, but the House Rules Committee can report a special rule to set procedural parameters for consideration. The House Rules Committee can report a special rule to set procedural parameters for the consideration of appropriations measures, including waiving rules prohibiting unauthorized appropriations and points of order on the floor or in conference reports. The House must adopt a special rule before considering the measure or conference report. Special rules can waive points of order against provisions in a conference report on an appropriations measure. The House must adopt a special rule before consideration. Senate rules distinguish between authorizations and appropriations, prohibiting unauthorized appropriations in committee and floor amendments. This rule can be waived by unanimous consent. The practical effects of a funding lapse would vary for supporters. The prohibition against unauthorized appropriations in conference reports can be waived by unanimous consent. A funding lapse would have mixed effects on supporters and critics of existing law, impacting activities such as interagency consultations and issuance of incidental take statements. No interagency consultations for agency actions, no incidental take statements issued, no species listed or delisted, no critical habitat designated, no issuance of incidental take permits for nonfederal actions, and reduced inspections. No critical habitat designated, potential increase in lawsuits for missed deadlines, no issuance of incidental take permits for nonfederal actions, reduced inspections of incoming cargo for CITES violations, no fulfillment of CITES obligations, no monitoring of candidate species, no federal enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or adverse modification of critical habitat. Citizen suits under the ESA still possible. No funding for ESA obligations under CITES, no monitoring of candidate species, no federal enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or modifying critical habitat, no habitat acquisition for listed species, no state grants for conservation, and no exemptions for agency actions from jeopardy opinions. Last major funding cut attempt in 104th Congress. The last major effort to end all funding for the ESA occurred in the 104th Congress, but was abandoned due to the potential negative effects. The answer to the question of funding for the ESA depends on the measurement chosen. The ESA's goal is species recovery to the point where protection is no longer needed. Only 34 species have been delisted due to recovery, with others delisted for various reasons like extinction or scientific reclassification. Since the implementation of the Endangered Species Act, several species have become extinct, been delisted due to scientific reclassification, or improved data. It can be challenging to determine if rare species are truly extinct, like the ivory-billed woodpecker and Eskimo curlew, listed as endangered with rare sightings suggesting possible extinction. Rare species like the ivory-billed woodpecker and Eskimo curlew are listed as endangered, with confirmed sightings so rare that they may be extinct. Proving their extinction is difficult due to their scarcity. Studies show that most endangered species are listed only when their populations are severely depleted. Some scientific studies suggest that the Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been effective in stabilizing or increasing populations of listed species, with 41% showing improvement. The ESA may have prevented extinctions of species like red wolves and California condors. Some species, such as red wolves and California condors, might not exist without ESA protection, showing a measure of success. Without the ESA, some species like salmon populations, Florida panthers, and California condors might have declined further towards extinction. Studies show that rare species like some salmon populations, Florida panthers, California condors, and plants with narrow ranges could have faced further decline towards extinction without the ESA. Scientific information is crucial for ESA actions, focusing on causes of extinction, normalcy of extinction, and comparing current extinction rates to background levels. The debate on extinction historically centered on losses from over-exploitation through hunting, trapping, or fishing. Until the mid-20th century, the extinction debate focused on losses from over-exploitation like hunting and trapping. However, a shift occurred in the 20th century, with the majority of species now at risk due to habitat loss. Habitats like tall-grass prairies and old growth forests have been significantly reduced. Habitat loss, exacerbated by factors like global climate change and the introduction of nonnative invasive species, is a significant threat to many species. Habitats such as tall-grass prairies, old growth forests, coral reefs, and others have been greatly reduced in size, putting species at risk of decline. The introduction of nonnative invasive species is a high-ranking factor in the demise of many species. These species can act as disease vectors, predators, or competitors, leading to a gradual homogenization of the world's flora and fauna and threatening many species with extinction. The introduction of nonnative invasive species threatens many species with extinction, such as owls in the Pacific Northwest or snakeheads in the Potomac River. The gradual homogenization of the world's flora and fauna has led to a demise of many species. Some argue that extinction is normal, but many scientists are concerned that the current rate of extinction exceeds background rates over time. Many scientists are concerned about the current rate of extinction, which may exceed background rates over time. Calculating current extinction rates is challenging due to uncertainty in the total number of species, estimated to be between 3.5 million to 100 million. Scientists use conservative assumptions to estimate extinction rates. Scientists use conservative assumptions to estimate extinction rates, with a typical estimate being 17,000 species per year. The public is generally unaware of the vast number of species in less popular groups, contributing to the astonishment at these high extinction rates. Current extinction rates are estimated to be 100 to 10,000 times higher than background rates, which are typically 1 to 10 species per 10 million species per year. This is comparable to past episodes of mass extinction. Critics often question estimates of current extinction rates, citing uncertainties in calculations based on the number of existing species. Biologists defend these estimates by pointing out that similar numbers are found in studies across different groups using various methods. Critics question extinction rate estimates due to uncertainties in calculations based on existing species numbers. Biologists defend estimates, citing similar results in studies across different groups using various methods. Once extinct, a species cannot be revived, but evolution may lead to new species better adapted to new conditions. Some scientists estimate that recovery from high extinction rates could take up to 25 million years, leading to the evolution of new species better adapted to new conditions. If current extinction and recovery rates are similar to past rates, it could take several million years to return to pre-historic species numbers. The return to pre-historic species numbers could take several million years based on past extinction and recovery rates. The Endangered Species Act defines endangered species as those in danger of extinction and threatened species as likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The ESA does not rely on a numerical standard. The Endangered Species Act defines a threatened species as likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future throughout its range. The ESA does not use a numerical standard to determine protection, considering the wide variety of species' biology. Protection under the ESA extends to all species and subspecies of animals, with additional safeguards for distinct population segments within a species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides protection to all species and subspecies of animals, with additional safeguards for distinct population segments within a species. Limited protection is available for plant species under the ESA, while organisms like Eubacteria, Archaea, and viruses are not covered. \"Take\" under the ESA includes actions like harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides protection to all species and subspecies of animals, with limited safeguards for plant species. Organisms like Eubacteria, Archaea, and viruses are not covered. \"Take\" under the ESA includes actions like harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect. The prohibition on taking may include habitat modification, as interpreted by a 1995 Supreme Court decision. The Secretary of the Interior manages most listed species through FWS. Marine species are also included in ESA protections. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides protection to all species and subspecies of animals, with limited safeguards for plant species. The inclusion of significant habitat modification where it actually kills or injures wildlife was deemed a reasonable interpretation of \"harm\" in the law by a 1995 Supreme Court decision. The Secretary of the Interior manages most listed species through FWS, while marine species and anadromous fish fall under the responsibility of the Secretary of Commerce, acting through NMFS. The law assigns the major role to the Secretary of the Interior and outlines the relationship between the two Secretaries and their respective powers. Species may be listed on the initiative of the appropriate Secretary. The Endangered Species Act assigns the major role to the Secretary of the Interior and outlines the relationship between the two Secretaries and their powers. Species may be listed by petition from an individual, group, or state agency, based on the best available scientific and commercial information. The Secretary must decide whether to list the species after ensuring public participation and collecting relevant information, without considering economic effects. The Endangered Species Act mandates the Secretary of the Interior to list species based on scientific and commercial information, with public participation and relevant data collection. Economic effects are not considered in the listing decision, as Congress intended it to be a scientific question of species endangerment. The Endangered Species Act mandates listing species based on scientific information, without considering economic effects. Species can be designated as endangered or threatened based on their decline and threats to survival. Endangered species are at risk of extinction, while threatened species are likely to become endangered in the future. The ESA defines species as a species, subspecies, or distinct population segment. The Endangered Species Act defines a threatened species as one likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. The interpretation of \"all or a significant portion of its range\" has varied, with the Department of the Interior previously requiring a species to be endangered throughout its entire range to qualify for protection. The Department of the Interior previously interpreted the phrase \"all or a significant portion of its range\" to mean a species had to be endangered throughout its entire range to qualify for protection. However, this interpretation was found to violate the Endangered Species Act by multiple courts. In 2014, FWS and NMFS issued a joint interpretation stating that a portion of a species' range is significant if the species is not currently endangered or threatened throughout its entire range. In 2014, FWS and NMFS issued a joint interpretation of the ESA, stating that a portion of a species' range is significant if its contribution to the species' viability is crucial for preventing extinction. The range of a species is defined as its current existence, not its historical range. The interpretation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) clarifies that a species' range is where it currently exists, not where it once existed historically. Listing a species as endangered or threatened must be based solely on scientific data, without reference to its past range. The 1982 amendments to the Endangered Species Act clarified that listing determinations must be made \"solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available,\" without considering economic impacts. This decision is likened to diagnosing a patient's disease strictly based on scientific evidence. The addition of the word \"solely\" emphasized the importance of making a purely scientific determination when deciding whether to list a species as endangered or threatened. The addition of the word \"solely\" in the amendments to the Endangered Species Act emphasizes making listing determinations based strictly on scientific and commercial data, without considering non-biological factors. The goal is to ensure decisions regarding the listing and delisting of species are solely based on biological criteria. The legislation amends the Endangered Species Act to require the Secretary to base listing decisions solely on scientific and commercial data, excluding non-biological factors. Economic considerations are deemed irrelevant to species status determinations. The only options for species listing are as endangered, threatened, or not listed. The Endangered Species Act mandates that listing decisions must be based solely on scientific and commercial data, excluding economic factors. The options for species listing are as endangered, threatened, or not listed. Economic considerations are not relevant to species status determinations. The Endangered Species Act emphasizes that listing decisions should be based on scientific data without economic factors. Conservation methods can be chosen to lower costs as long as conservation goals are still met. Petitions can be filed to change a species' status, subject to standards and deadlines. The Endangered Species Act requires FWS and NMFS to make an initial determination within 90 days of receiving a petition, assessing if there is substantial scientific or commercial information for a warranted action. If so, a status review of the candidate species must be conducted within 12 months. The Endangered Species Act mandates FWS and NMFS to evaluate petitions within 90 days to determine if there is enough scientific or commercial data for action. If warranted, a status review of the species must be completed within 12 months. Lawsuits have been filed against agencies for missing deadlines due to a rise in petitions. The Endangered Species Act requires FWS and NMFS to assess petitions within 90 days for scientific or commercial data. If warranted, a species status review must be done within 12 months. Lawsuits have been filed against agencies for missing deadlines due to an increase in petitions. Several lawsuits in 2011 set deadlines for listing determinations on hundreds of species. FWS received over 160 ESA petitions by August 2016, with more than 100 for listing. The federal government's responsibilities towards proposed but unlisted species may be questioned. The federal government's responsibilities towards proposed but unlisted species may be questioned, especially regarding management decisions during the time between proposal and actual listing. Agencies must consult with the appropriate Secretary on actions that could harm proposed species or critical habitat. Under current law, agencies must confer with the appropriate Secretary on actions that may harm proposed species or critical habitat. The conference process aims to resolve conflicts early in the planning stage and is less formal than the consultation process for listed species. The conference process for proposed species aims to resolve conflicts early in the planning stage and allows FWS or NMFS to advise on minimizing adverse effects. Agencies may choose a more formal process to avoid duplication of effort later. The ESA does not limit irreversible commitment of resources during the conference stage. The ESA states that during the conference stage, agencies should aim to resolve conflicts early and minimize adverse effects. Once a species is listed, agencies have specific responsibilities and may need to avoid actions that could harm the species or lead to liability. For example, agencies may choose to refrain from timber sales in areas with proposed species. The relevant Secretary must monitor candidate species. The relevant Secretary must monitor candidate species to prevent significant risks to their well-being. A candidate species is any species being considered for listing as endangered or threatened. As of August 24, 2016, there were 58 candidate species. Federal agencies and other entities may work to improve the status of candidate species to avoid potential liabilities. As of August 24, 2016, there were 58 candidate species being considered for listing as endangered or threatened. Federal agencies and nonfederal landowners may pursue conservation agreements to improve the species' status and prevent future listing proposals. Nonfederal landowners can enter into a candidate conservation agreement with assurances (CCAA) to improve species conservation. If a species is proposed for listing under the ESA, the Secretary must publish the proposed regulation in the Federal Register and notify relevant state agencies and counties for comments. As of August 24, 2016, 73 species were proposed for listing under the ESA. Federal agencies must confer with the appropriate Secretary on actions likely to jeopardize the continued existence of candidate species. The Secretary must monitor the status of candidate species and promptly list any species facing significant risks. Emergency listings may skip some steps in the normal process. Special regulations may be promulgated to conserve listed species. The Secretary can promptly list a candidate species if an emergency poses a significant risk to it. Special regulations may be issued to conserve threatened species, with tailored protections and recovery measures. Endangered and threatened species enjoy the same protections under federal regulations. The Endangered Species Act provides protections for threatened species like the northern long-eared bat and polar bear. A distinct population segment (DPS) is a genetically distinct and geographically separated portion of a listed species. Criteria for designating a DPS include being discrete and significant in terms of genetic loss. The Endangered Species Act protects threatened species like the northern long-eared bat and polar bear. A DPS must meet criteria of being discrete and significant for genetic diversity loss. The designation of a DPS may lead to special rules under Section 4(d) of the ESA, as seen in the case of the gray wolf. Court decisions have vacated DPS designations for the gray wolf since 2003 due to issues with the criteria used by the FWS. The gray wolf DPS designation has led to extensive litigation, with courts vacating DPS designations since 2003. NMFS developed ESUs to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA, identifying important groups of salmon populations. The ESU concept was developed by NMFS to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA, identifying important groups of salmon populations. As of July 25, 2016, 28 ESUs of salmon and steelhead trout along the Pacific coast were listed as either endangered or threatened under the ESA. The ESU concept was created by NMFS to identify significant groups of salmon populations under the ESA. It was chosen for policy and scientific reasons to address the impracticality of using stock or species levels. The inclusion of hatchery fish in ESUs has sparked controversy, and in 1982, Congress introduced experimental populations to the ESA for species reintroduction without strict land use restrictions. The controversial concept of experimental populations was added to the ESA in 1982 by Congress to reintroduce species without strict land use restrictions. To qualify, the population must be authorized for release and geographically separate from other animals of the same species. This separation allows for clear distinction, and the protected status of an experimental population is determined differently from a DPS. The ESA added experimental populations in 1982 to reintroduce species without land use restrictions. The population must be geographically separate from others of the same species for clear distinction. Protected status is determined differently based on the population's endangerment level. Special regulations under Section 4 of the ESA apply to these populations. Special regulations under Section 4 of the ESA apply to experimental populations, which are treated as nonessential unless in a national wildlife refuge or park. No Section 7 consultation is required for actions that may affect these populations. Critical habitat is not designated for nonessential experimental populations. Delisting, uplisting, or downlisting a species follows the same process as listing. The process for delisting, uplisting, or downlisting a species from the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants is the same as the process for listing. The Secretary of the Interior may initiate a change in the status of listed species, or review the species' status after receiving a substantive petition. The determination to delist, uplist, or downlist a species must be made solely on the basis of the best available scientific and commercial data. The Secretary of the Interior may initiate a change in the status of listed species based on scientific data. Reviews are conducted every five years to determine if a species should be removed from the list or its status changed. Critical habitat includes occupied geographic areas. The Secretary of the Interior conducts reviews every five years to assess listed species for potential status changes or removal. Critical habitat includes both occupied geographic areas and additional essential areas for species conservation. The Secretary must designate critical habitat for listed species, unless it is deemed \"not prudent\" to do so. As of July 25, 2016, critical habitat had been designated for 758 listed species, or 47.5% of the 1,596 listed domestic animal and plant species. The Secretary may choose not to designate critical habitat if it would harm the species, and may postpone designation for up to one year if the information is not determinable. Any area, whether federally owned or not, may be designated as critical habitat. Critical habitat is designated for listed species, affecting private land only if federal action is involved. Federal agencies must avoid habitat destruction. Designation is based on scientific data. Federal agencies must avoid \"destruction or adverse modification\" of critical habitat, either through their direct action or activities they approve or fund. The Secretary must designate critical habitat based on the best scientific data available, considering economic and relevant impacts. Areas may be excluded if benefits outweigh inclusion, unless scientific and commercial data suggest otherwise. The Secretary may exclude areas from critical habitat if benefits of exclusion outweigh inclusion, unless failure to designate would lead to species extinction. Economic factors are considered in critical habitat designation, but not in species listing as endangered or threatened. When designating critical habitat for endangered or threatened species, economic factors are considered, and some habitat areas may be excluded unless their designation is necessary to prevent species extinction. Adverse modification of critical habitat is primarily a concern for federal agencies, while restrictions on private land use stem from the ESA's prohibition on harming listed species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) places restrictions on private land use primarily through the prohibition on harming listed species. Critical habitat designation is a factor, but less restrictive, especially for nonfederal taking of plants. P.L. 108-136 amended the ESA to exclude Defense Department lands with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans from critical habitat designation. P.L. 108-136 amended the ESA to exclude Defense Department lands with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans from critical habitat designation, considering national security and the benefit provided by the INRMP to the lands. The ESA was amended to exclude Defense Department lands with Integrated Natural Resource Management Plans from critical habitat designation, taking national security into consideration. This change was made to address concerns about interference with military activities on designated critical habitat. Administrations and Congress have restricted FWS's ability to designate critical habitat for over 20 years. FWS states that critical habitat designation is most beneficial when it includes unoccupied areas that serve as connecting corridors. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) faces challenges in designating critical habitat under the ESA due to budget constraints. FWS prioritized critical habitat designation at the lowest level in its listing budget, citing inability to comply with all ESA demands. Conservation groups noted the contradiction between FWS's budget claims and its decision not to request increased funds for listing. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) faces challenges in designating critical habitat under the ESA due to budget constraints. Conservation groups have criticized FWS for prioritizing critical habitat at the lowest level in its listing budget and not requesting increased funds for listing. FWS has been sued frequently for its failure to designate critical habitat, with the agency consistently losing such suits. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has faced criticism for prioritizing critical habitat at a low level in its budget, leading to frequent lawsuits for failure to designate critical habitat. The agency believes critical habitat offers limited protection beyond listing, making it a poor use of resources, especially if seen as the main regulatory impact of the ESA. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has faced criticism for prioritizing critical habitat at a low level in its budget, leading to frequent lawsuits for failure to designate critical habitat. The agency believes critical habitat offers limited protection beyond listing, making it a poor use of resources, especially if seen as the main regulatory impact of the ESA. Critical habitat may provide additional protection for listed species in federal actions, but FWS previously disagreed on the extent of this extra protection. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has faced criticism for not prioritizing critical habitat in its budget, leading to lawsuits for failure to designate critical habitat. FWS previously disagreed that designated critical habitat provides additional protection from federal actions, as the jeopardy consideration would offer necessary protection. This conclusion was based on the regulatory definition of \"destroy or adversely modify\" critical habitat. The FWS previously did not prioritize critical habitat in its budget, leading to lawsuits. The regulatory definition of \"destroy or adversely modify\" critical habitat was criticized for focusing on survival rather than recovery of species. This definition was changed in February 2016 after federal courts agreed it was contrary to the ESA. The definition of \"destroy or adversely modify\" critical habitat was changed in February 2016 to focus on the recovery goal of the Endangered Species Act. Federal courts agreed that the previous definition ignored the law's emphasis on species recovery. The Services now apply the Act's definition of \"conservation\" with a focus on recovery. Destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat diminishes its value for listed species by altering essential physical or biological features. Recovery plans are required for listed species' conservation and survival. The appropriate Secretary must develop recovery plans for the conservation and survival of listed species, covering a wide range of species. However, the lack of detail in the ESA and its regulations regarding recovery plans has been criticized, as they are not binding on federal agencies or others. As of August 24, 2016, there were recovery plans for 1,156 U.S. species. Land acquisition may also be involved in conservation efforts. Recovery plans for endangered species lack detail and are not binding on federal agencies. As of August 24, 2016, there were 1,156 recovery plans for U.S. species. Land acquisition for conservation efforts can be funded by the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), which is primarily derived from offshore oil and gas leases. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is a federal fund primarily funded by offshore oil and gas leases. It is used for land acquisition by federal agencies managing most federal lands. States can receive federal funds for endangered species programs through cooperative agreements, with a minimum 25% matching amount required. The 1988 ESA amendments created a fund for state grants, including land acquisition and planning assistance. The 1988 ESA amendments established a fund for state grants to support endangered species programs, including land acquisition and planning assistance. States may receive federal funds through cooperative agreements, with a minimum 25% matching amount required. Congress appropriated $53.5 million for cooperative activities with states and territories in FY2016. Federal action agencies must complete a review if actions may adversely affect a listed species. Federal action agencies must complete a biological assessment (BA) if their actions may adversely affect a listed species. The assessment is based on the best available scientific and commercial data and is used to determine if formal consultation is necessary to ensure actions do not jeopardize endangered species or modify critical habitat. Federal agencies must ensure their actions do not harm endangered species or critical habitat through Section 7 consultation with FWS or NMFS. Consultation is required for any activity authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agency. If a federal action is mandated by statute, consultation is not needed. Federal agencies must ensure their actions do not harm endangered species or critical habitat through Section 7 consultation with FWS or NMFS. Consultation is required for any activity authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agency. If a federal action is mandated by statute, consultation is not needed. The consultation process is usually initiated at the request of the action agency or FWS Regional Director. If the proposed action is found to jeopardize a species or critical habitat, a biological opinion (BiOp) is issued with terms to avoid harm. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult with FWS or NMFS to ensure actions do not harm endangered species or critical habitat. If a proposed action jeopardizes species or habitat, a biological opinion with terms to avoid harm is issued. The BiOp must suggest reasonable alternatives to avoid harm to the species based on the best available scientific and commercial data. The BiOp is required to be based on the \"best scientific and commercial data available\" and must include a summary of the information it is based on. Most consultations result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or suggest reasonable alternatives to avoid harm to species. The relevant Secretary is generally required to complete consultation within a certain timeframe. The majority of consultations result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or suggest reasonable alternatives. The relevant Secretary must complete consultation within a specified timeframe, which can be extended with mutual agreement. Formal consultation may take a year or more if no reasonable alternatives are feasible. Formal consultation for delays in agency actions under the ESA may take a year or more. If no alternatives are feasible, the agency must forego the action, risk penalties, or apply for an exemption. The Endangered Species Act allows for exemptions to proposed agency actions that may harm species, decided by a high-level committee known as the \"God Squad\" with at least five votes required for approval. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC), also known as the \"God Squad,\" consists of six federal officials and a representative from each affected state. They decide whether to allow actions that may harm species, requiring at least five votes for approval. The ESC includes officials from the Interior, Agriculture, Army, Council of Economic Advisors, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Environmental Protection Agency. The process for applying for exemptions involves strict rules, deadlines, and a full administrative hearing. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) consists of federal officials and state representatives who decide on exemptions for projects that may harm species. The ESC must grant an exemption if the Secretary of Defense deems it necessary for national security. The President can also determine exemptions for projects in disaster areas. (Appendix provides details on when exemptions have been invoked.) The President may exempt projects for repairing or replacing facilities in disaster areas. To qualify for an exemption, federal agencies must have conducted consultations under the ESA and considered alternative actions to protect endangered species. Under Section 7 of the ESA, agencies must make a reasonable effort to consider alternatives that would not harm endangered species or critical habitats. This includes conducting biological assessments and avoiding irreversible commitments of resources. The agency must avoid irreversible commitments of resources to ensure consideration of alternatives that would not harm endangered species or habitats. The ESC will grant an exemption if the evidence supports it, with additional requirements outlined in relevant regulations. The ESC will grant an exemption for a project if it meets specific criteria, including no reasonable alternatives, clear benefits outweighing alternatives, regional or national significance, and no irreversible actions taken. Additional requirements are outlined in relevant regulations. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) will grant exemptions for projects that meet specific criteria, such as no reasonable alternatives, clear benefits outweighing alternatives, regional or national significance, and no irreversible actions taken. Special provisions apply in certain cases, including international treaty obligations, national security, and presidentially declared disasters. The ESA does not have a general provision for granting exemptions. The ESA specifies specific instances for granting exemptions, including international treaty obligations, national security, and presidentially declared disasters. The exemption process is complex and could take 280 days. Any potential exemption applicant would face challenges and must fund any necessary actions. The exemption process under the ESA is complex and could take 280 days. An applicant must fund required mitigation measures for the life of the action, shifting the burden of conservation and recovery elsewhere. The exemption process under the ESA is complex and could take 280 days. FWS or NMFS must continue to attempt to recover the species, shifting the burden of conservation and recovery elsewhere. A governor balancing state interests may find this difficult. An exemption from the ESA may not be sufficient if other statutory obligations are still required. Many parties may be reluctant to appear to side with species extinction. The consultation process under the ESA offers federal agencies opportunities to modify actions to avoid harming species or habitats while still moving forward. Parties in a dispute may be hesitant to support species extinction publicly, and the rewards of an exemption application may not outweigh the effort if the risk of extinction only provides minimal benefit for the action. The consultation process allows federal agencies to adjust actions to protect species and habitats while proceeding with their plans. Private parties can obtain permits for incidental take of listed species for lawful actions without federal involvement. The Secretary may issue permits for incidental take of listed species by private parties without federal involvement. Applicants must submit a habitat conservation plan showing impact minimization, mitigation steps, funding, rejected alternatives, and other required measures. The use of this provision expanded in the 1990s with streamlined procedures for minimal impact activities. Certain exemptions for raptors are specified. In the 1990s, the use of a provision allowing permits for incidental take of listed species by private parties expanded with streamlined procedures. The ESA specifies exemptions for raptors, regulates subsistence activities by Alaskan Natives, prohibits interstate transport and sale of listed species and parts, controls trade in parts or products of endangered species, and establishes rules for experimental populations. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits various acts such as taking endangered species, possessing or selling unlawfully taken species, and violating regulations by FWS or NMFS. Threatened species receive similar protections as endangered species unless specified otherwise. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits acts related to endangered or threatened species, with threatened species receiving similar protections. Violating the ESA's prohibitions can result in civil penalties, except for certain exceptions like incidental take permits. Section 11 of the ESA provides exceptions for civil penalties in cases where violations were based on a good-faith belief of self-defense. Violators of the ESA may face civil penalties for each violation, especially importers or exporters of fish, wildlife, or plants. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) imposes civil penalties for violations, with higher fines for knowing violators and business importers/exporters of wildlife. Criminal violations may also apply. The ESA allows lawsuits in federal court to enforce its provisions or compel the Secretary to act. The Endangered Species Act allows lawsuits in federal court to enforce its provisions or compel the Secretary to act, with the provision for litigation costs and attorneys' fees. The citizen suit provisions have been a significant force in the ESA's history. The Endangered Species Act allows lawsuits in federal court to enforce its provisions, with provisions for litigation costs and attorneys' fees. Citizen suits have been a driving force in the ESA's history, often used to push agencies to conserve species. Studies show citizen groups may drive listings of species at greater risk, especially those in conflict with development. The Endangered Species Act allows citizen suits to enforce its provisions, with a significant number of lawsuits challenging listing decisions. The ESA also implements CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention for the United States. The United States implements legislation for CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention, focusing on trade and species protection without addressing habitat loss. Violations of CITES are considered violations of U.S. law within the country's jurisdiction. The ESA focuses on trade and does not address habitat loss. Violations of CITES are violations of U.S. law within the country's jurisdiction. The United States committed to establishing nature reserves and controlling international wildlife trade through the Western Hemisphere Convention. The ESA designates the Secretary of the Interior. The ESA focuses on trade and designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority (ESSA) specified under CITES. The Secretary must ensure that international trade will not harm the species and enforce these determinations through FWS. Export determinations are based on the best available biological information. The Secretary of the Interior, as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority (ESSA) under CITES, is responsible for ensuring that international trade does not harm species. This authority is enforced through FWS, with export determinations based on the best available biological information. The Management Authority must also ensure legal export and import of specimens, as well as suitable conditions for live specimens. The Management Authority for the United States under CITES is responsible for ensuring legal export and import of specimens, as well as suitable conditions for live specimens. The ESA prohibits importing or exporting listed species, with exceptions for scientific purposes or species survival. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits importing or exporting listed species, with exceptions for scientific purposes or species survival. Importers and exporters of fish or wildlife must obtain permission from the Secretary, keep records, allow inspections, and use designated ports. The Endangered Species Act requires permission from the Secretary for importing or exporting listed species, with exceptions for scientific purposes. The construction of Grayrocks Dam in Wyoming jeopardized the habitat of whooping cranes, leading to a decision by the Endangered Species Committee. The Endangered Species Committee (ESC) granted an exemption for the Grayrocks Dam and Reservoir in Wyoming, despite the potential harm to whooping crane habitat. Mitigation measures were imposed, including the maintenance of critical crane habitat on the Platte River and the establishment of a trust fund for these activities. The Tellico Dam on the Little Tennessee River faced opposition from various groups, including local landowners and Indian tribes, after the endangered snail darter was listed. Litigation ensued, leading to the landmark Supreme Court case TVA v. Hill, which clarified the broad reach of the Endangered Species Act. After the snail darter was listed as endangered, litigation was filed to stop the construction of the Tellico Dam. The Supreme Court case TVA v. Hill clarified the broad reach of the Endangered Species Act and led to congressional passage of P.L. 95-632, which established an ESC process. Despite the ESC denying an exemption for the dam, Congress directed in P.L. 96-69 that the dam be completed. The ESC denied an exemption for Tellico dam, but Congress directed its completion in P.L. 96-69. ESC granted exemption for 13 out of 44 Oregon timber sales in habitat of northern spotted owl. The Bureau of Land Management sought exemptions for 44 Oregon timber sales in the habitat of the threatened northern spotted owl. The ESC granted exemptions for 13 of the sales, which were later withdrawn in the Clinton Administration. Additionally, the Pittston Company applied for an exemption to build a refinery in Eastport, ME, but no decision was made by the ESC. The Pittston Company applied for an exemption to build a refinery in Eastport, ME, due to concerns about threatened bald eagles and endangered whales. However, further action on this application seems to have been discontinued in 1982. Another instance involved the Consolidated Grain and Barge Company seeking to build a docking area for barges in Mound City, IL, which was habitat for an endangered mussel. After a jeopardy opinion and denial of permits by the Army Corps of Engineers, the company applied for an exemption. The Grain and Barge Company sought to build a docking area for barges at Mound City, IL, on the Ohio River, an area that was habitat for an endangered mussel. Following a jeopardy opinion and denial of permits by the Army Corps of Engineers, the company applied for an exemption but withdrew the application in 1986. The Suwanee River Authority's consulting engineer applied for an exemption to dredge Alligator Pass in Suwanee Sound, Florida, part of the habitat for the endangered manatee. The project had been denied a permit by the Army Corps of Engineers, and the engineer lacked the authority to apply on behalf of the Authority, which refused to ratify his application in 1986. The project to dredge Alligator Pass in Suwanee Sound, Florida, part of the habitat for the endangered manatee, was denied a permit by the Army Corps of Engineers. The engineer lacked the authority to apply on behalf of the Suwanee River Authority, which refused to ratify his actions and withdrew the application in 1986. The withdrawal was effective despite the engineer's attempts to continue the application."
