    "content": "The Act titled \"National Death Penalty Moratorium Act of 2000\" establishes a moratorium on the death penalty. Congress finds that death sentences are disproportionately imposed on the poor and certain racial and ethnic groups, with most individuals facing capital charges unable to afford their own attorney and no state meeting ABA standards for indigent prisoners' legal representation. Since 1976, African-Americans have accounted for a disproportionate number of executions and individuals on death row, despite only making up 13% of the population. White victims make up the majority of death penalty cases, even though they are only 50% of murder victims. In the Federal system, 67 percent of those on death row are waiting for execution. Despite only 50 percent of murder victims being white, 84 percent of victims in death penalty cases are white. A study found that 89 percent of defendants chosen for capital prosecution under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 were African-American or Hispanic American. The General Accounting Office reported racial disparities in capital prosecution under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, with a majority of defendants being African-American or Hispanic American. The Supreme Court's rulings since 1976 have limited the rights of death row prisoners, increasing the risk of imprisoning and executing innocent individuals.
