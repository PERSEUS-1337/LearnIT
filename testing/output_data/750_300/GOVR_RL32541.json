    "content": "The 9/11 Commission found that al Qaeda terrorists exploited weaknesses in aviation security, including a focus on potential bombers, lax checkpoint screening, lack of in-flight security measures, compliance with hijackers, and a lack of protocols for the Federal Aviation Administration. The 9/11 Commission identified weaknesses in aviation security, including a lack of in-flight security measures, compliance with hijackers, and a failure of imagination among senior policymakers and agencies responsible for intelligence and national defense. The 9/11 Commission found that senior policymakers and agencies responsible for intelligence, national defense, and aviation security failed to imagine the possibility of suicide hijackings, leading to a lack of specific actions taken to defend against this threat before September 11, 2001. The 9/11 Commission found that before September 11, 2001, there was a lack of specific actions taken to defend against possible hijacking scenarios, with a focus on airport congestion and passenger service by Congress. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress swiftly passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act to address aviation security weaknesses and establish the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) was passed after 9/11 to address aviation security weaknesses. It established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and implemented measures such as federal security screeners at airports, explosive detection screening for checked bags, air marshals on high-risk flights, and hardened cockpit doors. ATSA also granted TSA broad authority to assess security threats in all transportation modes. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) established the TSA with measures like federal security screeners at airports, explosive detection screening for checked bags, air marshals on high-risk flights, and hardened cockpit doors. ATSA granted TSA broad authority to assess security threats in all transportation modes. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 placed TSA within the Department of Homeland Security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and placed the TSA within it. The act also authorized arming airline pilots for additional security measures. The Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act included aviation security measures such as establishing an aviation security capital fund for explosive detection systems. Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (P.L.108-176; 117 Stat. 2490) established an aviation security capital fund for explosive detection systems and expanded the program to arm pilots of all-cargo aircraft. Despite these actions, vulnerabilities in aviation security remain, including air cargo operations, general aviation, access controls for airport employees, and screener performance. The 9/11 Commission identified vulnerabilities in aviation security, including air cargo operations, general aviation, access controls for airport employees, screener performance, and possible terrorist attacks using shoulder-fired missiles. The Commission concluded that major vulnerabilities still exist in cargo and general aviation security, along with inadequate screening and access controls, presenting ongoing challenges in aviation security. The 9/11 Commission identified vulnerabilities in aviation security, including air cargo operations and general aviation. Major challenges persist due to inadequate screening and access controls. Recommendations were made for improvements in airport passenger screening and air cargo security. No specific recommendations were issued regarding risks related to access controls in secured airport areas and general aviation operations. The Commission also noted concerns about possible shoulder-fired missile attacks on commercial airliners. The 9/11 Commission highlighted vulnerabilities in aviation security, including air cargo and general aviation operations. While recommendations were made for improvements in passenger screening and air cargo security, no specific recommendations were given for risks in secured airport areas and general aviation. Concerns about shoulder-fired missile attacks on commercial airliners were acknowledged, but no specific recommendations were provided. The Commission emphasized the need for a multi-layered security system to address various terrorist tactics. The 9/11 Commission emphasized the need for a multi-layered security system in aviation to address various terrorist tactics, consistent with ATSA and TSA's concept of \"concentric rings of security.\" This system must have effective and coordinated layers with redundancies to catch possible lapses. The 9/11 Commission focused on persisting vulnerabilities in commercial aviation and made six aviation-specific recommendations, including enhancing passenger pre-screening and improving measures to detect explosives on passengers. The final report identified six aviation-specific recommendations to enhance passenger pre-screening, improve explosives detection on passengers, address human factors at screening checkpoints, deploy in-line baggage screening systems, intensify efforts to screen dangerous cargo, and use hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft. Additionally, the 9/11 Commission recommended setting transportation security priorities based on risk and implementing cost-effective deterrents. The 9/11 Commission issued aviation-specific recommendations for transportation security policy, including setting priorities based on risk and implementing cost-effective deterrents. Passenger pre-screening on September 11, 2001 consisted of CAPPS, security questions, and photo identification. The pre-screening measures on September 11, 2001 included CAPPS, security questions, and photo identification. These measures identified over half of the hijackers, but had little consequence at the time. The purpose of the CAPPS system has since been expanded to screen for possible hijackers. The CAPPS system, originally used for pre-screening individuals to prevent bombing of passenger jets, now also screens for possible hijackers. CAPPS II, the follow-on system, has faced controversy over data protection and civil liberties concerns. The follow-on to CAPPS, known as CAPPS II, has faced controversy over data protection and civil liberties concerns. It would authenticate a passenger's identity using commercial databases and check their name against terrorist watch lists. If flagged, passengers could be denied boarding or selected for secondary screening. The 9/11 Commission recommended not delaying improved passenger pre-screening capabilities while the debate over a successor to CAPPS continues. The 9/11 Commission recommended that improved passenger pre-screening capabilities should not be delayed while the argument about a successor to CAPPS continues. The prescreening system should utilize the larger set of watchlists maintained by the federal government. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act for FY2004 and Vision 100 directed the Department of Homeland Security to address these concerns and limited implementation of CAPPS II to system testing until the Government Accountability Office verifies adequate steps. The Homeland Security Appropriations Act for FY2004 and Vision 100 directed the Department of Homeland Security to address concerns regarding CAPPS II implementation. The Government Accountability Office found that TSA had only addressed one of the eight concerns. Airlines' reluctance to provide data for testing CAPPS II has also hindered progress. The 9/11 Commission recommended that airlines should be required to supply necessary information for passenger screening. Recent media reports suggest that the CAPPS II program has been scrapped due to privacy concerns, but Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge hints at a potential replacement program. Congress is urged to move forward with implementing a passenger pre-screening system despite the lack of progress. Tom Ridge suggests a new program to replace CAPPS II. Congress may increase oversight of the Secure Flight program and debate the best way to proceed. H.R. 10 requires TSA to take over prescreening from airlines within 180 days and begin testing by November 1, 2004, aligning with administration plans. The TSA is required to take over prescreening from airlines within 180 days and start testing the system by November 1, 2004, aligning with the Secure Flight program. The 9/11 Commission highlighted al Qaeda's interest in bombing airliners, referencing Ramzi Yousef's 1994 bombing as a precursor to larger attacks. Ramzi Yousef's 1994 bombing of a Philippines Airlines flight was a precursor to the \"Bojinka\" plot to bomb multiple U.S.-bound airliners. Yousef assembled an improvised explosive device on the plane and hid it under a seat with a digital watch timer. Concerns over IEDs were raised after Richard Reid's attempt in 2001 and again in 2003 when a college student snuck banned items onto a plane. Concerns over IEDs were brought to public attention in December 2001 when Richard Reid attempted to down a transatlantic flight using explosives concealed in a shoe. In October 2003, a college student, Nathaniel Heatwole, sneaked banned items resembling plastic explosives aboard passenger jets. The 9/11 Commission acknowledged weaknesses in detecting explosives on passengers and recommended improving detection as a priority. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving the detection of explosives on passengers by prioritizing screening technologies and procedures. New technology can detect bomb-making chemicals on individuals. New technology offers the capability to detect bomb-making chemicals on individuals using trace detection methods, being tested at various airport sites. New technology at various airport sites can detect bomb-making chemicals on individuals. Methods for detecting explosives on passengers include body scan imaging and the use of bomb-sniffing dogs. Congress may debate funding for these initiatives in light of the 9/11 Commission recommendation. The 9/11 Commission recommended implementing effective passenger screening methods, including body scan imaging and bomb-sniffing dogs. Congress may debate funding for these initiatives, and the TSA was advised to conduct a study on screener performance improvement. The 9/11 Commission recommended implementing effective passenger screening methods, including body scan imaging and bomb-sniffing dogs. The TSA was advised to conduct a human factors study to improve screener performance at screening checkpoints, addressing deficiencies highlighted by a recent DHS Inspector General's audit. The TSA has launched initiatives like threat image projection (TIP) to test screener on-the-job performance. The TSA has implemented initiatives like threat image projection (TIP) to test screener performance at checkpoints and is exploring ways to enhance screener training and human factors in aviation security. Key human factors issues in aviation security include screener selection, training, fitness for duty, and interaction with screening technologies. Despite some ongoing research by universities and contractors, funding and research in this area lag behind programs in the Department of Defense and FAA. There is a lack of a comprehensive strategic plan for addressing human factors in aviation security, prompting potential oversight by Congress. In light of persisting concerns over screener performance, Congress may conduct oversight to identify areas where TSA's human factors research efforts may not be adequately addressing concerns over passenger and baggage screening performance. Congress may also consider tasking an independent body with examining human factors needs in aviation security. The National Academy of Sciences may need to examine human factors needs in aviation security, as it has not done so since 9/11. H.R. 10 includes a provision for TSA to conduct human factors studies to improve screener performance. H.R. 10 includes a provision for TSA to conduct human factors studies to improve screener performance and examine next-generation checkpoint screening technologies. Congress may debate current funding adequacy for in-line baggage screening systems recommended by the 9/11 Commission. Only $250 million was appropriated in FY2004 and requested in FY2005 for this activity, while Vision 100 authorizes up to $500 million annually for aviation security capital fund. Total cost of integrating EDS equipment at all passenger airports is estimated to exceed $4 billion, requiring several years for completion. The TSA has only appropriated $250 million in FY2004 and requested the same amount in FY2005 for integrating EDS equipment at passenger airports, which is estimated to cost over $4 billion. Letters of intent (LOIs) were issued to airports to stretch federal funding over several years for this purpose. The TSA has implemented Letters of Intent (LOIs) to convey future funding for EDS integration at airports, but currently reimburses expenses as they occur, potentially slowing progress. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the aviation industry contribute to the costs of in-line EDS deployment, but defining a fair share has been contentious. Airlines already indirectly contribute financially. The 9/11 Commission recommended that the aviation industry should pay a fair share of the costs for in-line EDS deployment. Airlines already indirectly contribute financially through security fees, with airports also sharing a portion of the costs. The TSA has proposed a scheme where large and medium-sized airports contribute 10% of the cost, while small airports contribute 5%. The TSA has proposed increasing the local share for aviation security fees at airports, with large and medium-sized airports contributing 25% and small airports contributing 10%. This proposal is opposed by airports, as the 9/11 Commission implied that the industry is not paying its fair share under the current scheme. Congress may continue to address this issue. The 9/11 Commission implied that the aviation industry is not paying its fair share for security fees, leading to debate in Congress. Legislation was introduced to adjust federal shares for airport security projects, but faced challenges during floor debate. Legislation introduced in the House (H.R. 5121) aims to increase aviation security fees designated for security capital fund and enhance TSA's flexibility in meeting baggage screening requirements by allowing multi-year contracts with airports or vendors for EDS imaging capabilities. H.R. 5121 aims to increase TSA's flexibility in meeting baggage screening requirements by allowing multi-year contracts with airports or vendors for EDS imaging capabilities. The 9/11 Commission recommended intensifying efforts to identify suspicious cargo and screen potentially dangerous cargo in aviation and maritime operations. The TSA was advised to enhance efforts in identifying and screening suspicious cargo in aviation and maritime operations. A strategic plan for cargo security was unveiled in 2003, focusing on a multi-layered risk-based approach with key objectives including enhancing shipper security, pre-screening elevated risk cargo, using technology for targeted inspections, and securing all-cargo aircraft through facility security. The TSA's strategic plan for cargo security, unveiled in 2003, aims to enhance shipper and supply chain security, pre-screen elevated risk cargo, use technology for targeted inspections, and secure all-cargo aircraft through facility security measures. Goals include pre-screening all cargo shipments, inspecting items posing elevated risk, deploying new technology solutions, and implementing operational and regulatory programs to support enhanced security measures. The 9/11 Commission recommendations support TSA's strategic plan for cargo security but suggest accelerating progress and possibly enhancing measures. Congress may further scrutinize TSA's efforts on cargo security and debate approaches for intensifying identification, tracking, and screening of cargo. The 9/11 Commission recommendations support TSA's strategic plan for cargo security but suggest accelerating progress and possibly enhancing measures. Congress may further scrutinize TSA's efforts on cargo security and debate approaches for intensifying identification, tracking, and screening of cargo, including the level of physical screening needed for cargo on passenger aircraft. The 9/11 Commission recommendations support TSA's strategic plan for cargo security, suggesting acceleration and enhancement. Congress may scrutinize TSA's efforts on cargo security, debating approaches to intensify identification, tracking, and screening of cargo on passenger aircraft. H.R. 10 and S. 2845 aim to improve cargo security, with S. 2845 specifically requiring TSA to double air cargo screening within a year. The 9/11 Commission recommended deploying hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft to carry suspicious cargo, with an estimated cost of $125 million to acquire enough containers. The National Research Council also estimated an annual industry-wide cost of $11 million due to reduced revenue payload and increased fuel burn. The Council examined the concept of deploying hardened cargo containers in 1999, estimating a cost of $125 million. They also projected an annual industry-wide cost of $11 million due to reduced revenue payload and increased fuel burn. Passenger airlines may oppose federally funding this initiative due to increased operational costs. Opponents may argue that improved cargo identification, tracking, and screening make hardened containers unnecessary. Opponents of deploying hardened cargo containers may argue that improved cargo identification, tracking, and screening make them unnecessary. Proponents, however, believe that hardened containers provide an additional layer of defense, similar to a hardened cockpit door, in line with the goal of a multi-layered security system. Using just one hardened cargo container per passenger aircraft still leaves the system vulnerable to potential risks tied to the effectiveness of risk-based assessments. The TSA aims to establish a multi-layered security system with redundancies. However, using only one hardened cargo container per passenger aircraft leaves the system vulnerable to risks related to risk-based assessments and suspicious cargo. TSA requires unvetted shippers to use all-cargo airplanes for their cargo. The TSA is working on improving its ability to detect high-risk cargo, but it is unclear how this system can be adapted to handle suspect cargo. The TSA is working on expanding its capabilities to detect high-risk cargo for all-cargo airplanes. There is uncertainty on how to assign risk levels for suspect cargo to travel in hardened cargo containers on passenger airplanes. Congress may debate the effectiveness of deploying hardened cargo containers for security against potential cargo bombings. Congress may debate the use of hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft to protect against potential cargo bombings. H.R. 10 includes a provision for a pilot program to evaluate blast-resistant containers, while S. 2845 does not have a similar provision. The 9/11 Commission recommended establishing risk-based priorities for protecting transportation assets, including evaluating blast-resistant cargo container technology for passenger airliners. The 9/11 Commission recommended establishing risk-based priorities for protecting all transportation assets, including assigning roles and missions to federal, state, and local authorities, as well as private stakeholders. This approach should be implemented through a strategic plan with a budget and funding allocation. The 9/11 Commission recommended a strategic plan for aviation security to assign roles and missions to various authorities and stakeholders. The TSA's focus post-9/11 attacks was on meeting ATSA mandates, such as deploying air marshals and federal screeners. Now, with normal operations in place, TSA should develop a unified strategic plan for aviation security. The TSA has set a strategy for aviation security post-9/11 attacks, focusing on deploying air marshals and federal screeners. With normal operations in place, TSA is now poised to develop a formal strategy for national aviation security policy, likely based on a risk-based multi-layered approach. This aligns with the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. In addressing air cargo security needs, a risk-based multi-layered approach to aviation security is likely to be the core of future policy, aligning with the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. Congress may consider tasking the TSA with developing a national strategy for aviation security, addressing funding, roles of authorities, and industry stakeholders. Some argue that existing TSA plans suffice, while others advocate for a more formal strategic planning document. A formal strategic planning document for aviation security may be needed to address challenges in defining roles and allocating resources for state, local, and industry involvement. The local role in airport security programs is tailored for each airport location, with the ultimate responsibility for physical security lying with the airport site. Challenges persist in defining roles and allocating resources for state and local participation and industry involvement in airport security. Local jurisdictions and airport operators are responsible for the physical security of airport sites, while TSA oversees security and passenger screening. Local governments and state authorities may provide law enforcement support for airport security and presence at screening checkpoints. Passenger air carriers are also required to participate in security measures. The federal government oversees aviation security, with local and state authorities providing law enforcement support at airports. Passenger air carriers are required to participate in security measures, while air cargo and general aviation rely on aircraft owners and operators for security measures. In air cargo and general aviation, security measures rely on aircraft owners and operators, with federal oversight. There is a need for a unified plan to assign roles and missions to stakeholders and improve strategic planning and resource allocation. In response to the 9/11 Commission recommendation, Congress and the TSA may consider enhancing strategic planning, resource allocation, and integration of resources for aviation security. They should also explore integrating aviation security strategies with a broader transportation security strategy covering rail, maritime, and highway security, addressing logistics, funding, and resource allocation for all modes of transportation. H.R. 10. Strategies for aviation security can be integrated into a broader transportation security strategy that includes rail, maritime, and highway security. H.R. 10 mandates the Department of Homeland Security to develop transportation security plans, including a specific plan for aviation, to prioritize risks, choose cost-effective protection methods, and assign responsibilities to various authorities and stakeholders. Congress has been focused on improving aviation security since the 9/11 Commission report. Since the 9/11 Commission report, Congress has focused on improving aviation security by setting risk-based priorities, selecting cost-effective protection methods, and assigning responsibilities to various authorities and stakeholders. The 108th Congress passed two major pieces of legislation containing numerous aviation security recommendations. The House Subcommittee on Aviation reviewed the 9/11 Commission's aviation security recommendations. The 108th Congress passed legislation addressing aviation security before and after the Commission's final report. The National Intelligence Reform Act (P.L. 108-458) was enacted in response to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. Vision 100 - Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (P.L. 108-176) included aviation security provisions before the 9/11 Commission's final report. Vision 100 established a redress process for aviation professionals and required justification to Congress for Air Defense decisions by the Federal Aviation Administration.

Vision 100 established new security training requirements for airline crew members and mandated a study by the Department of Homeland Security on the effectiveness of aviation security measures. Recommendations for improvements, including legislative changes, were to be included in the report. Vision 100 mandated a report to Congress on the effectiveness of aviation security, including recommendations for improvement and the creation of the Aviation Security Capital Fund with annual appropriations of up to $500 million. The Undersecretary for Border and Transportation Security was given the authority to issue grants to airports. The Aviation Security Capital Fund, established by Vision 100, allocated up to $500 million annually for aviation security projects. The fund required the first $250 million in aviation security fee collections to be deposited each year through FY2007. The Undersecretary for Border and Transportation Security was authorized to issue grants to airports for various security-related projects, with a federal share of costs set at 90% for large airports. Vision 100 allocated funds for aviation security projects, set federal cost shares for airports, and required security programs for air charter operators. It also mandated a review of the CAPPS II passenger prescreening system by the Government Accountability Office. Vision 100 required security programs for air charter operators with aircraft over 12,500 pounds, mandated a review of the CAPPS II system by the GAO, and delayed implementation until certain issues were addressed. The TSA has replaced CAPPS II with the \"Secure Flight\" program. The TSA addressed issues related to civil liberties, privacy, data protection, system security, and oversight by scrapping the CAPPS II program and developing \"Secure Flight.\" Vision 100 expanded the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program to include all-cargo airline crew members and required regulations for aircraft repair security. Vision 100 expanded the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program to include all-cargo airline crew members and required regulations for aircraft repair security, including background check modifications for foreign pilots seeking flight training in the United States. The act also transferred the responsibility of conducting these background checks from the Department of Justice to the DHS. Vision 100 expanded the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program to include all-cargo airline crew members and required regulations for aircraft repair security. The act transferred the responsibility of conducting background checks for foreign pilots seeking flight training in the United States from the Department of Justice to the DHS. Flight schools or instructors must provide notification and identification information for individuals seeking training in smaller aircraft, with background checks required before training in larger aircraft can begin. Fee collections are authorized to offset the costs of these background checks. The National Intelligence Reform Act (P.L. 108-458) includes provisions for aviation security, addressing concerns from the 9/11 Commission. It mandates the Department of Homeland Security to develop a National Strategy for Transportation Security and specific security plans. Fee collections are authorized to cover background check costs for pilots training in larger aircraft. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates the Department of Homeland Security to develop a National Strategy for Transportation Security and specific security plans, including a modal security plan for aviation. This plan includes a threat matrix, layers of security, and a mitigation plan for terrorist attacks. TSA is required to issue guidance for biometrics in airport access control systems. The National Intelligence Reform Act mandates the TSA to issue guidance for biometrics in airport access control systems and establish biometric technologies for aviation security. It authorizes funding for research and development of biometric technologies and a center of excellence in biometric technologies. The act authorizes $20 million for research and development of biometric technologies for aviation security, along with $1 million for a center of excellence in biometric technologies. TSA is required to start testing an advanced passenger prescreening system by January 1, 2005, and assume the role of passenger prescreening within 180 days after completing testing. Redress and remedy procedures must be established for delayed or denied passengers. The TSA must assume the role of passenger prescreening within 180 days after testing an advanced system. Redress procedures for falsely identified passengers must be established, along with safeguards for system integrity and privacy concerns. DHS must conduct prescreening for international flights to or from the United States. The TSA must establish oversight and safeguards for system security and integrity, address privacy concerns, and conduct prescreening for international flights. Individuals seeking FAA certificates and access to secure airport areas must be screened against the terrorist watch list. Air charter companies can voluntarily submit customer information. The TSA must screen individuals for access to airport secure areas against the terrorist watch list. Air charter companies can voluntarily submit customer information for prescreening on aircraft over 12,500 pounds. The Security Privacy Officer must report on the impact of selectee and no-fly lists on privacy, and the Director of National Intelligence must report on criteria for these lists. The act requires reporting on the impact of selectee and no-fly lists on privacy and civil liberties, as well as criteria for placing individuals on the screening watch list. It also mandates the development of advanced airport screening technologies for detecting weapons and explosives, along with a strategic plan for explosive detection equipment deployment.

It also authorizes expedited installation of baggage screening equipment at airports. The DHS is authorized to provide air marshal training to foreign law enforcement personnel and expedite the installation of in-line baggage screening equipment at airports. The TSA is required to establish a schedule for this activity and study cost-sharing options. The act increases the authorization for the aviation security capital fund to $400 million per year through FY2007 and directs the TSA to study the application of these funds. The act increases the authorization for the aviation security capital fund to $400 million per year through FY2007. It directs the TSA to study wireless communication technologies for cabin crew, issue tamper-resistant pilot licenses with photos, and accommodate digital photographs or biometrics for identification. The act requires the FAA to issue tamper-resistant pilot licenses with photographs and the TSA to develop standards for screener staffing levels at airports. The DHS is to study integrating screening workforce operations for increased efficiency and effectiveness. The DHS is tasked with studying the integration of screening workforce operations to improve efficiency. The act authorizes $100 million for research on improved explosive detection systems and directs the TSA to develop guidelines for their implementation. Additionally, the TSA is required to ban butane lighters and other items deemed inappropriate for carry-on luggage, while the President is urged to pursue international treaties to enhance security measures. The act mandates the TSA to prohibit butane lighters and other inappropriate carry-on items, and urges the President to pursue international treaties to limit the proliferation of MANPADS worldwide. It also requires the President to pursue arrangements for the destruction of excess MANPADS stockpiles and report on diplomatic efforts for non-proliferation. The act further directs the President to pursue international arrangements for destroying excess, obsolete, and illicit MANPADS stockpiles worldwide. It requires reporting on diplomatic efforts for MANPADS non-proliferation and annual briefings to Congress. Additionally, the FAA must establish a process for expedited certification of airworthiness for missile defense systems on commercial aircraft. The DHS is tasked with assessing aircraft vulnerability to MANPADS attacks and developing plans for securing airports and aircraft from this threat. The act mandates the establishment of a pilot program to evaluate blast-resistant cargo containers, with $2 million authorized for this purpose.

The Department of Homeland Security is directed to research, develop, and procure systems to inspect and screen air cargo on passenger aircraft to enhance aviation security. The 108th Congress enacted provisions to address concerns and recommendations for aviation security. The 108th Congress addressed aviation security concerns by enacting provisions, including increasing cargo inspections on passenger aircraft. However, some areas like general aviation security and air cargo oversight were not adequately addressed through legislation. The 9/11 Commission briefly mentioned concerns over general aviation operations but did not provide specific recommendations. During the 108th Congress, policy concerns regarding general aviation security and air cargo oversight were not adequately addressed through legislation. The 9/11 Commission briefly mentioned general aviation security concerns but did not provide specific recommendations. Legislation focused on airport and airspace restrictions, with a provision in Vision 100 requiring the development of a security plan for general aviation flights at Ronald Reagan Washington. During the 108th Congress, legislation regarding general aviation security was not as comprehensive as other security measures. The DHS was required to develop a security plan for general aviation flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, but no specific timeline was set. Temporary flight restrictions over stadiums during major sports events were made permanent. Legislation regarding general aviation security during the 108th Congress was not as comprehensive as other security measures. Concerns have been raised about the risk posed by private planes and helicopters, as highlighted in a recent assessment by the FBI and DHS. Some argue for more comprehensive legislation on air cargo security operations and oversight. Some argue that legislation on air cargo security operations was not adequately addressed during the 108th Congress, with measures passed by the Senate being stripped from the final version of the National Intelligence Reform Bill of 2004. This led to the TSA being directed to address these issues through proposed rulemaking. The 108th Congress did not adequately address legislation on air cargo security operations, with measures passed by the Senate being removed from the final version of the National Intelligence Reform Bill of 2004. The TSA was directed to address these issues through proposed rulemaking, reflecting the intent of the proposed legislation. The 109th Congress may focus on overseeing the TSA's implementation of air cargo security rules and strategic plan to ensure desired objectives are met."
