    "content": "The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 (H.R. 1627, P.L. 112-154) is an omnibus bill with provisions impacting various veterans programs. It reflects a compromise agreement by House and Senate Committees on Veterans Affairs on multiple bills reported during the 112th Congress. This report provides information on the provisions of P.L. 112-154 by program, benefit, or topic. The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 (H.R. 1627, P.L. 112-154) includes provisions from multiple bills reported during the 112th Congress. The Department of Veterans Affairs operates the nation's largest integrated health care system for veterans. Eligibility for VA medical care is based on various factors including veteran status and service-connected conditions. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates the largest integrated health care system for veterans. Eligibility for VA medical care is based on factors like veteran status, service-connected disabilities, income, and special treatment authority granted by Congress. In 1981, Congress passed legislation (P.L. 97-72) granting special treatment authority to the VA to treat veterans for disorders possibly related to Agent Orange and ionizing radiation exposure. In 1993, Congress passed P.L. 103-210 to provide additional health care authority for Persian Gulf War veterans with medical conditions possibly linked to toxic substances. In 1993, Congress passed P.L. 103-210 to provide health care for Persian Gulf War veterans with conditions possibly related to exposure to toxic substances during their service. P.L. 112-154 addressed chemical exposure at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina by providing VA health eligibility. The systems at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina were contaminated with industrial solvents TCE and PCE. P.L. 112-154 addressed the chemical exposure by providing VA health care eligibility for certain veterans and their eligible family members stationed at Camp Lejeune from 1957 to 1987. They are eligible for medical care for fifteen specified illnesses or conditions. Certain veterans and their eligible family members stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina from 1957 to 1987 are eligible for medical care for fifteen specified illnesses or conditions due to contaminated well water. The law acknowledges the lack of sufficient medical evidence to conclusively link these illnesses to military service during that period. The VA provides medical care for specified illnesses related to contaminated well water at Camp Lejeune, including hepatic steatosis, female infertility, miscarriage, scleroderma, neurobehavioral effects, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The VA is the final payer for eligible family members' health insurance. The State Veterans' Home program helps build nursing homes and provides per diem for veterans receiving care. The VA partners with states to build, modify, or acquire nursing home facilities for veterans. They provide grants and per diem payments for care in state veterans' homes. State laws govern management and admission criteria for these homes. The VA pays the full cost of care for veterans with a service-connected disability rated at 70% or more under the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-461) allowed SVHs to receive full cost of care for veterans with service-connected disabilities, equalizing the cost of nursing care. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-461) equalized the cost of nursing home care for veterans with service-connected disabilities, allowing VA to use higher per diem rates for those with a 70% service-connected disability or individual unemployability in State Veterans Homes (SVHs). SVHs reimbursed at higher rates were not eligible for funding from other federal sources like Medicare or Medicaid. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-461) equalized nursing home care costs for veterans with service-connected disabilities by allowing higher per diem rates for those with a 70% service-connected disability or individual unemployability in State Veterans Homes (SVHs). However, some SVHs reported receiving smaller reimbursements that did not cover the actual cost of care after the VA implemented this new reimbursement methodology. Section 105 of P.L. 112-154 now requires the VA to contract with SVHs to provide nursing home care for veterans with service-connected conditions or a 70% disability rating. The VA is required to contract with SVHs to provide nursing home care for veterans with service-connected conditions or a 70% disability rating. The reimbursement methodology will be developed in consultation with SVHs, and SVHs can request a contract that replicates the previous reimbursement methodology. In June 2011, the GAO reported about 300 sexual assault incidents to the VA police. The VA is required to contract with SVHs for nursing home care for veterans with service-connected conditions or a 70% disability rating. In June 2011, the GAO reported about 300 sexual assault incidents to the VA police, including rape, inappropriate touching, and other types of assaults. Many incidents were not reported to VA leadership or the VA Office of the Inspector General as required. The GAO reported numerous sexual assault incidents, including rape and inappropriate touching, to the VA police. Many incidents were not reported to VA leadership or the VA Office of the Inspector General as required by VA regulation. The VA is mandated to establish a comprehensive policy for reporting and tracking sexual assault and safety incidents at VA medical facilities. The VA is required to establish a comprehensive policy for reporting sexual assault and safety incidents at medical facilities, with reports due 60 days after implementation and annually thereafter. The policy should consider the impact on veterans' mental health and substance abuse treatments, and an interim report on progress is required within 30 days of enactment. The VA must establish a comprehensive policy for reporting sexual assault and safety incidents at medical facilities. An interim report to Congress on the progress of developing this policy is required within 30 days of enactment. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant issue in Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) due to increased blast injuries from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and other explosives. The increase in traumatic brain injuries (TBI) in Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) is attributed to blast injuries from explosives like improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Advances in protective equipment, combat medicine, and awareness among healthcare professionals have reduced fatalities from these injuries. However, accurately diagnosing TBI remains a challenge, leading to uncertainty in the total number of veterans affected. The total number of veterans with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) is unknown due to challenges in diagnosis and some veterans not accessing VA healthcare services. Concerns have been raised about the VA's interpretation of providing comprehensive care for TBI, potentially limiting rehabilitative services essential for physical and cognitive progress. The VA's interpretation of providing comprehensive care for TBI has raised concerns about limiting rehabilitative services essential for physical and cognitive progress. Section 107 of P.L. 112-154 requires the VA to provide rehabilitative care to veterans with TBI to maximize independence and improve behavioral and mental health functioning. This provision includes rehabilitative services in long-term care programs for veterans with TBI in both VA and non-VA facilities. The VA is required to provide rehabilitative care for veterans with TBI to improve their independence and mental health functioning. Telemedicine and telehealth are used for medical purposes when participants are separated by distance or time. Telehealth is defined as the use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to support long-distance clinical health care, patient and professional health-related education, public health, and health administration. It goes beyond medical encounters to include health education and related websites. Telemental health refers to behavioral health services provided remotely. Telemental health involves providing behavioral health services remotely using communication technology, including clinical assessment, psychotherapy, interventions, testing, and psychiatry. It allows clinicians to deliver mental health care to patients who are miles away. The term telemental health involves using technology to deliver mental health care remotely. The Department of Defense refers to this as telebehavioral health. The VA has been a leader in telehealth since 1977, using it to provide care to veterans in rural areas. Telehealth is commonly used in delivering healthcare to veteran patients, especially those in rural areas. Research shows that telehealth offers benefits as an alternative to in-person treatment and can be cost-effective within the VA health care system. VA is required to implement a teleconsultation program for remote mental health and TBI assessments in facilities lacking the capability without contract or fee-basis care. The VA is mandated to implement a teleconsultation program for remote mental health and TBI assessments in facilities lacking the capability without contract or fee-basis care. Additionally, VA must provide telemedicine training to medical residents in facilities utilizing telemedicine. Veterans enrolled in the VA health care system do not pay copayments for treatment related to service-connected conditions. Veterans enrolled in the VA health care system do not pay copayments for treatment related to service-connected conditions rated at 50% or more disabled. They are also not charged copayments for various outpatient services including health fairs, screenings, counseling, and care for military sexual trauma. Veterans are not charged copayments for various outpatient services including health fairs, screenings, counseling, and care for military sexual trauma. Copayments of $15 for primary care visits and $50 for specialty care visits are required for veterans with no service-connected conditions or receiving care for nonservice-connected conditions. The VA requires copayments for non-service-connected conditions, with $15 for primary care and $50 for specialty care visits. Veterans only pay one copayment per day, and copayments can be waived for telehealth consultations. The VA is authorized to provide service dogs to hearing or mobility-impaired veterans. The VA is authorized to provide service dogs to veterans with hearing or mobility impairments, as well as those with mental illnesses like PTSD. Research is being conducted to assess the benefits of using service dogs to treat veterans with physical or mental injuries. The National Defense Authorization Act authorized the VA to research the benefits of using service dogs to treat veterans with physical or mental injuries, including PTSD. Service dogs trained by accredited entities may have access to VA facilities. Congress mandated the establishment of an Office of Rural Health within the Veterans Health Administration in 2006. The Office of Rural Health (ORH) was established by Congress in 2006 within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to address disparities in service between rural and non-rural veterans. The VHA opened three Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers (VRHRCs) in FY2009 to develop special practices and products for facilities nationwide. The VHA established the ORH in March 2006 to address disparities in service between rural and non-rural veterans. In FY2009, three Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers (VRHRCs) were opened to develop special practices and products for facilities nationwide. The Centers, located in Togus, ME, Iowa City, IA, and Salt Lake City, UT, serve as field-based clinical laboratories experimenting with new outreach and care models. Section 110 of P.L. 112-154 recognizes these Centers as satellite offices of the ORH, requiring them to perform specific functions. The Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers in Togus, ME, Iowa City, IA, and Salt Lake City, UT, serve as field-based clinical laboratories experimenting with new outreach and care models. Section 110 of P.L. 112-154 requires these Centers to improve understanding of challenges faced by rural veterans, identify disparities in healthcare availability, formulate practices to enhance healthcare delivery, and develop special practices and products for rural veterans. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) gave the VHA authority to bill veterans and insurers for nonservice-connected care to help defray medical service costs. This law also established means testing for veterans seeking care for nonservice-connected conditions. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) allowed the VA to retain third-party payments for nonservice-connected care in the VA's Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) to provide medical services for veterans. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) authorized the VA to retain third-party payments in the VA's Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) for providing medical services to veterans without fiscal year limitations. This act also allowed the VA to change its basis of billing insurers from \"reasonable costs\" to \"reasonable charges\" to increase collections. The VA changed its billing basis from \"reasonable costs\" to \"reasonable charges\" to boost collections. In FY2004, the Administration proposed consolidating various medical collections accounts into the MCCF, as recommended in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004. This included funds from the Health Services Improvement Fund, Veterans Extended Care Revolving Fund, Special Therapeutic and Rehabilitation Activities Fund, Medical Facilities Revolving Fund, and Parking Revolving Fund. The VA was authorized to deposit funds from various accounts into the MCCF for medical services for veterans under P.L. 108-447. Funds deposited are available until expended, as per P.L. 112-154. The VA is required to develop a plan to identify and collect billable third-party revenue for the MCCF, including effective billing and collection procedures and employee training. Fee revenue goals are also mandated. The VA is mandated to develop a plan for identifying and collecting billable fee claims, implementing effective policies and procedures for billing and collection, training employees, setting fee revenue goals, and monitoring to ensure compliance. Additionally, the VA is required to assess the feasibility of treating Vet Centers as VA facilities for beneficiary travel purposes. The VA is mandated to assess the feasibility of treating Vet Centers as VA facilities for beneficiary travel purposes, specifically for highly rural veterans traveling to and from their nearest Vet Centers. This initiative will last for three years, with reimbursement limited to eligible veterans in highly rural areas. The VA Secretary must report to Congress within 180 days of enactment on the beneficiaries and analysis of the initiative. The VA Secretary is required to issue a report to Congress within 180 days of enactment on the beneficiaries of the initiative and an analysis of the initiative. VA is authorized to provide eligible veterans mileage reimbursement, special mode transport, and common carrier transport when traveling to and from VA or VA authorized health care. Pre-authorization is required for ambulance and common carrier expenses, except in cases of medical emergency. The VA requires pre-authorization for ambulance and common carrier expenses, except in medical emergencies. VA proposed using local Medicare ambulance rates for reimbursement to address overpayment issues. In FY2012, VA proposed using local Medicare ambulance rates to reimburse providers, aiming to save costs. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 allowed VA to pay the lesser of the actual amount charged or the Medicare rate for ambulance services, but the change did not have the desired effect. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 allowed VA to pay the lesser of the actual amount charged by ambulance providers or the Medicare rate for services, but the change did not have the desired effect due to limited applicability. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 allowed VA to reimburse ambulance providers at the lesser of the actual charge or the local Medicare rate. Section 704 of P.L. 112-154 makes a technical correction to authorize VA to reimburse ambulance providers when no contract is in place. The new reimbursement methodology applies to all ambulance transportation situations. The new reimbursement methodology for ambulance transportation under VA applies when no contract is in place with the provider. It excludes transport related to unauthorized non-VA emergency care for nonservice-connected conditions approved for payment. Veterans' household income is reported to determine eligibility for care under means testing established by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) established means testing for veterans seeking care for nonservice-connected conditions. Veterans report their household income to determine eligibility for VA health care. P.L. 112-154 authorizes the VA to use the veteran's household income for eligibility. It also makes changes to the VA's Specially Adapted Housing Program for veterans with service-connected disabilities. P.L. 112-154 amends the VA's Specially Adapted Housing Program, providing grants to veterans and servicemembers with service-connected disabilities for home purchases or remodeling. There are two grant programs within the SAH Program, one for veterans with mobility impairments and another for active duty servicemembers. The Specially Adapted Housing Program offers two grant programs: one for veterans with mobility impairments (\u00a72101(a) grant) and another for veterans who are blind or have lost the use of their hands (\u00a72101(b) grant). The dollar limit for the \u00a72101(a) grant is higher, and both grants are available to veterans with severe burn injuries. Section 202 of P.L. 112-154 expands the qualifying disabilities for the \u00a72101(a) grant. Section 202 of P.L. 112-154 expands the qualifying disabilities for the \u00a72101(a) grant to cover veterans or servicemembers who have lost use of one or more lower extremities affecting balance and propulsion, requiring aid for ambulating. Veterans or servicemembers must be approved for assistance under this provision by the end of FY2013. Section 203 of P.L. 112-154 also changes the \u00a72101(b) measure. Section 203 of P.L. 112-154 changes the measure of blindness from 5/200 visual acuity to 20/200 vision in the better eye with corrective lens. The maximum amount of assistance for grants is increased to $63,780. The VA visual impairment standard for disability compensation was changed to 20/200 as part of the Dr. James Allen Veteran Vision Equity Act. The maximum amount of assistance for grants was increased to $63,780 for \u00a72101(a) grants and $12,756 for \u00a72101(b) grants under P.L. 112-154. The VA Secretary is required to annually adjust the award limits based on a cost-of-construction index. The VA Secretary annually adjusts statutory award limits based on a cost-of-construction index. P.L. 112-154 increases the limits to $63,780 and $12,756 for FY2012. The increased grant limits take effect one year after enactment. Veterans can use grants to modify family members' homes temporarily. P.L. 112-154 increases the maximum TRA grant from $14,000 to $28,000. The Temporary Residence Adaptation (TRA) grant under Section 205 of P.L. 112-154 increases the maximum grant amounts to $28,000 for \u00a72101(a) and $5,000 for \u00a72101(b). The new limits are adjusted annually based on a cost-of-construction index and the authority for TRA grants is extended beyond December 31, 2012. The TRA grants under P.L. 112-154 have increased maximum amounts and are now subject to annual adjustment. The authority for TRA grants has been extended until December 31, 2022. The SAH law limits grant funding for adaptations to a veteran's or servicemember's home, with exceptions for homes substantially damaged in disasters. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 allows disabled veterans or servicemembers whose previously-adapted homes were substantially damaged in a disaster to receive funds for acquiring another suitable home. This assistance does not count towards their maximum benefit and the maximum benefit is determined by the cost to repair or replace the damaged property. The VA Loan Guaranty Program provides mortgage insurance for eligible veterans, guaranteeing lenders payment in case of borrower default. The program sets the maximum benefit based on the cost to repair or replace damaged property, not counting towards a veteran's maximum benefit. The VA Loan Guaranty Program offers mortgage insurance for eligible veterans, guaranteeing lenders payment in case of borrower default. Veterans pay a one-time fee based on factors like down payment amount and military service history to participate. The VA Loan Guaranty Program allows veterans to occupy a property as their home by paying a one-time fee based on factors like down payment amount and military service history. Fees may be waived for certain veterans and surviving spouses. Section 206 of P.L. 112-154 expands loan guaranty eligibility to include surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability rated totally disabling. Spouses must meet specific duration requirements for the disability. The loan guaranty eligibility for surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability rated totally disabling is expanded. Specific duration requirements for the disability must be met. Surviving spouses who qualify based on these provisions will not have to pay the guaranteed loan fee. Section 207 of P.L. 112-154 amends the housing occupancy requirement for the loan guaranty. The loan guaranty eligibility for surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability rated totally disabling is expanded. Spouses who qualify for the loan guaranty based on this provision will not be required to pay the guaranteed loan fee. P.L. 112-154 also allows the dependent child of a veteran called away for active duty to satisfy the housing occupancy requirement. Sections 208 and 209 of P.L. 112-154 make permanent the programs for guaranteeing adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgages by the VA. P.L. 112-154 expands loan guaranty eligibility for surviving spouses of veterans with totally disabling service-connected disabilities. It also allows dependent children of veterans called for active duty to meet housing occupancy requirements. Sections 208 and 209 of the law make adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage programs permanent. Section 210 modifies when veterans with service-connected disabilities can have loan guaranty fees waived. The new law under P.L. 112-154 allows veterans with service-connected disabilities to have the loan guaranty fee waived based on a pre-discharge examination or review of existing medical evidence. This change aims to expedite the disability determination process by utilizing existing medical records. Section 702 of the law also addresses guaranteed loan fees and the maximum guaranty amount for veterans. Section 702 of P.L. 112-154 extends current loan fees for dwelling units until October 1, 2017 and reinstates higher loan guaranty amounts for housing in high-cost areas. This change aims to expedite disability determinations for veterans by utilizing existing medical records. The current loan fees for loans to purchase or construct dwelling units are in effect from October 1, 2016 to October 1, 2017. The higher maximum loan guaranty amount for housing in high-cost areas has been reinstated, with limits set at 115% of the area median home price, not exceeding 150% of the conforming loan limit. The Freddie Mac statute sets the conforming loan limit at $417,000 for single-family homes, with the possibility of higher limits in high-cost areas. Temporary increases in the maximum guaranty amount were made through 2014, setting the limit at 25% of the higher of the conforming loan limit or 125% of the area median home price, not exceeding 175% of the limit determined under the Freddie Mac statute. The VA can guarantee loans up to a maximum of 175% of $625,500, or $1,094,625 in high-cost areas through December 31, 2014. The VA's authority to bundle and sell vendee loans has been extended.

Additionally, the VA's authority to bundle and sell vendee loans has been extended through December 31, 2016. The VA uses the Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) process to lease unused property for purposes that benefit veterans, including housing for homeless veterans. Fair consideration is charged for the lease, which can include in-kind payments and improvements to VA facilities. EULs can also be used for non-housing related purposes. The VA uses Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) process to lease unused property for veterans' benefit, including housing for homeless veterans. EULs can also be used for non-housing purposes like child development centers, parking facilities, golf courses, senior housing, assisted living facilities, and nursing homes. Changes in the EUL program now restrict properties to be used only for \"supportive housing\" defined as housing with supportive services for homeless or at-risk veterans or their families. The VA's Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) program now limits properties to be used exclusively for \"supportive housing,\" defined as housing with supportive services for homeless or at-risk veterans or their families. Leases entered before January 1, 2012, are subject to previous laws, and any consideration received by the VA must be in cash at fair value. The VA's Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) program limits properties to supportive housing for homeless veterans. Leases before January 1, 2012, follow previous laws. Consideration received by the VA must be cash at fair value. Annual reports on consideration for EULs are required. The Grant and Per Diem program authorizes grants for transitional housing for homeless individuals. The Grant and Per Diem program, also known as the Comprehensive Service Programs, allows the VA to provide grants to public entities or nonprofit organizations for transitional housing and services for homeless veterans. Grants are used for facility purchase or rehabilitation, while per diem covers costs of housing and support services. Grantees are reimbursed for care provided, up to a certain limit. The Grant and Per Diem program reimburses grant recipients for providing housing and supportive services to homeless veterans at a per diem rate of $38.90 per day. Grants can be used for construction of service centers and transitional housing, and grantees can also utilize Low Income Housing Tax Credits in conjunction with VA funding. The law allows grantees to use funds from public and private sources for construction of service centers and transitional housing. Grantees can also combine Low Income Housing Tax Credits with VA Grant and Per Diem funding. Private nonprofit organizations can include for-profit limited partnerships or limited liability companies with a nonprofit as the sole general partner or manager. The definition of private nonprofit organization now includes for-profit limited partnerships or limited liability companies with a nonprofit as the sole general partner or manager, commonly used in LIHTC-financed developments. The VA Grant and Per Diem program was authorized at $250 million for FY2013 and $150 million for subsequent fiscal years, targeting homeless veterans with special needs. The VA Grant and Per Diem program was initially authorized at $250 million for FY2013 and $150 million for subsequent years to assist homeless veterans with special needs. In 2001, Congress expanded the program's eligibility to include male veterans with dependent children, removed the requirement for grantees to already be providers, allowed funds to be used for services to dependents, and extended the authorization level. The VA Grant and Per Diem program assists homeless veterans with special needs by providing outreach, care for medical and psychiatric disorders, and supportive services. The program now allows funds to be used for services to dependents of homeless veterans and extends the authorization level. The VA Grant and Per Diem program assists homeless veterans with medical, psychiatric, and substance use disorders, and refers them to supportive services. P.L. 112-154 expands eligibility for the HCHV program to all homeless veterans, not just those with serious mental illnesses. HUD-VASH is a collaborative program between the VA and HUD that provides housing vouchers for homeless veterans. HUD-VASH is a collaborative program between the VA and HUD that provides housing vouchers for homeless veterans. Section 304 of P.L. 112-154 requires the VA to consider contracts with other entities to help veterans find suitable housing and connect them with eligible services. The VA may enter contracts with outside entities to assist veterans in finding housing and connecting them with services. This can occur when there is a shortage of affordable housing, a veteran is far from a VA facility, or local veterans struggle to find housing. Section 305 of P.L. 112-154 extends this authorization. Section 305 of P.L. 112-154 extends the authorization for programs that serve homeless veterans, including the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP) and Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF). HVRP helps homeless veterans find employment, while SSVF assists very low-income veterans and their families in transitioning. The HVRP, administered by the Department of Labor, aids homeless veterans in finding employment. P.L. 112-154 extends HVRP authorization through FY2013 at $50 million per year. The SSVF program supports very low-income veterans and their families transitioning from homelessness to housing or relocating. P.L. 112-154 authorizes SSVF for FY2013 at $300 million, up from $100 million in FY2012. The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program (DEA) provides educational aid to dependents of servicemembers disabled, delayed, or deceased due to military service. The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program (DEA) provides educational aid to dependents of servicemembers disabled, delayed, or deceased due to military service. DEA participants are entitled to 45 months of benefits, with an option to combine benefit programs for up to 81 months of entitlement. The amendment takes effect on October 1, 2013, and applies to entitlement not exhausted before that date. The Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 and the All-Volunteer Force Educational Assistance Program provide educational aid to eligible servicemembers and veterans. An amendment allows combining benefit programs for up to 81 months of entitlement, effective October 1, 2013. The All-Volunteer Force Educational Assistance Program (MGIB-AD; Title 38 U.S.C., Chapter 30) primarily provides educational assistance to eligible members of the Armed Forces who entered active duty for the first time after June 30, 1985. Section 402 of P.L. 112-154 requires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on the Post-9/11 GI Bill and requires the VA Secretary to report to Congress on the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the DEA. The reports are due annually, starting no later than November 13, 2013, through January 1, 2021. The VA Secretary and Defense Secretary must report annually to Congress on the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The reports include information on benefit levels, recruitment, education costs, active duty eligibility, and recommendations for changes. The VA Secretary and Defense Secretary report annually to Congress on the Post-9/11 GI Bill, including benefit levels, recruitment, education costs, active duty eligibility, and recommendations for changes. The VA report must also include information on the usage of Post-9/11 GI Bill and DEA benefits, program expenditures, student outcomes, and recommendations for administrative and legislative changes. Section 402 repeals the requirement for biennial reports on the MGIB-AD. Claimants appealing a decision on benefits can submit additional evidence. Section 402 repeals the biennial reporting requirement for the MGIB-AD. Claimants appealing benefit decisions can submit additional evidence, which may cause delays as the BVA waits for the local VA office to review it. The BVA may experience delays in reaching a decision on an appeal as it waits for the local VA office to review newly submitted evidence, unless the claimant waives this right. Section 501 of P.L. 112-154 allows for automatic waiver of the local VA office's initial review of evidence, unless requested by the claimant, with the BVA providing the review instead. This provision takes effect 180 days after the law's enactment in August 2012. Section 502 of P.L. 112-154 grants the VA authority to allow court-appointed representatives, caregivers, or authorized agents to sign applications on behalf of claimants for benefits adjudication. This provision will be effective 180 days after the law's enactment on August 6, 2012. Section 502 of P.L. 112-154 authorizes the VA to permit designated individuals to sign benefit claim applications on behalf of claimants. This provision complements the VA's duty to assist claimants in obtaining medical records. Section 505 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to waive its duty to assist requirement if there is enough evidence to award the maximum benefit. It also encourages claimants to submit relevant private medical records to prevent unnecessary time and resources being spent on locating records that may not change benefit amounts. Section 507 of P.L. 112-154 clarifies that if a veteran receiving VA benefits dies, the surviving spouse is entitled to the benefits for the entire month of the veteran's death. If a pending compensation claim is granted after the veteran's death, the surviving spouse can receive the additional benefits for that month. The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA; P.L. 106-475) requires the VA to notify claimants of evidence needed for their claims and how the VA can help gather it. The written VCAA notice, provided after a claim is filed, includes information on disability compensation. Section 504 of P.L. 112-154 removes the requirement for the VCAA notice to be sent only after a claim is filed, allowing the VA to print the notice on claims forms. Section 504 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to send VCAA notices on claims forms, remove the requirement for subsequent notices within a year, use electronic communications for notifications, and waive notification requirements based on available evidence. The VA can use electronic communications for notifications and waive VCAA notification requirements based on available evidence. The Fully Developed Claim (FDC) process was developed to expedite disability claims processing. Effective date of a claim is when VA receives the application, and claims generally expire after one year.
