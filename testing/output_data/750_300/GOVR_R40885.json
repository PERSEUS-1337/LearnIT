    "content": "H.R. 3962, Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, is based on H.R. 3200. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would reduce federal deficits by $109. The CBO estimates that H.R. 3962 would reduce federal deficits by $109 billion over 10 years and insure 96% of the non-elderly, legally present U.S. population by 2019. The total cost of Exchange subsidies, increased federal Medicaid expenditures, and tax credits for small employers would be $1.052 trillion. The net cost of the coverage provisions, including Exchange subsidies, federal Medicaid expenditures, and tax credits for small employers, would be $891 billion over 10 years. This cost would be offset by other spending changes, resulting in a reduction of federal deficits by $109 billion. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, includes provisions to reduce the number of uninsured, restructure the private health insurance market, set minimum health benefit standards, and provide financial assistance. The bill is estimated to save $427 billion through spending changes and increase federal revenues by $574 billion through an income tax surcharge on high-income individuals and other provisions. The Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, focuses on reducing the number of uninsured, restructuring the private health insurance market, setting minimum health benefit standards, providing financial assistance, and implementing market reforms such as modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal. Individuals and employers would be required to maintain health insurance or pay a payroll assessment, with some exceptions. Employers and individuals would need to maintain health insurance or pay a payroll assessment under the Care for America Act. Market reforms like modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal would be implemented. Acceptable health insurance coverage would be linked to the mandates, meeting minimum standards and incorporating market reforms. Coverage could be under a qualified health benefits plan offered through the Exchange, grandfathered employment-based plans, grandfathered nongroup plans, or other options. The bill mandates maintaining health insurance or paying a payroll assessment. Market reforms like modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal would be implemented. Acceptable coverage includes plans under a qualified health benefits plan (QHBP) offered through the Exchange, grandfathered employment-based plans, nongroup plans, Medicare, and Medicaid. The Exchange, under the Health Choices Administration, would offer private plans and a public option. Subsidies for individuals below 400% of the federal poverty level would be available only through the Exchange. The Exchange, headed by a Commissioner, would offer private plans alongside a public option. Individuals below 400% of the federal poverty level could qualify for subsidies towards premium costs and cost-sharing, available only through the Exchange. Plans in the individual market could be grandfathered indefinitely with no changes to terms, conditions, benefits, or cost-sharing. The bill would establish a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program to encourage not-for-profit, member-run plans. The bill would establish a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program to encourage the creation of not-for-profit, member-run health insurance cooperatives that would operate in the Exchange. Revenues would be raised by limiting employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modifying tax-advantaged accounts currently used for health care spending and coverage, among other provisions.

The report summarizes key provisions affecting private health insurance in Division A of H.R. 3962, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009. The report summarizes key provisions affecting private health insurance in Division A of H.R. 3962, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, including reforms to alter how current private health insurance markets function. H.R. 3962 includes provisions to change private health insurance markets, such as not excluding enrollees based on pre-existing conditions to prevent adverse selection and higher premiums. In a system where individuals voluntarily choose health insurance, adverse selection can lead to higher premiums and uninsurance. Insurers guard against this by excluding preexisting conditions. AHIP suggests requiring individuals to purchase coverage to prevent only the sick from enrolling. AHIP proposes mandatory health insurance to prevent adverse selection and ensure a balanced risk pool. Premium subsidies may be necessary to make the individual mandate practical and facilitate market reforms. The government and/or employers provide practical health insurance options to fulfill the individual mandate, essential for market reforms. Premium subsidies without cost-sharing may offer unaffordable health insurance. Private health insurance provisions in H.R. 3962 include individual and employer mandates. The private health insurance provisions in H.R. 3962 include individual and employer mandates, private health insurance market reforms, immediate reforms, Health Insurance Exchange with public option, subsidies, CO-OP Program, revenue provisions, and other provisions like abortion and end-of-life care. In 2008, 60% of the U.S. population had employment-based health insurance, obtained either through employers or in the nongroup market. Americans can also get health coverage through publicly funded programs like Medicare or Medicaid. Other provisions include abortion, medical malpractice, and end-of-life care. In 2008, 60% of the U.S. population had employment-based health insurance, obtained either through employers or in the nongroup market. Approximately 46 million Americans were estimated to be uninsured in 2008. Individuals and employers choosing to purchase health insurance in the private market fit into one of the three segments of the market\u2014the large group (large employer) market, the small group market, and the individual market. In 2008, 46 million Americans were estimated to be uninsured. Large employers can obtain lower premiums for health insurance due to economies of scale and a larger risk pool of enrollees. Employers offer large subsidies towards health coverage. Large employers have a more attractive insurance package than small employers and individuals seeking nongroup coverage due to economies of scale and a larger risk pool of enrollees. Employers offer subsidies towards health insurance, making it more appealing for both healthier and sicker workers to enter the pool. States have tried to create a single site for comparing insurance plans and pooling risk, with past experiments like California's PacAdvantage failing. States have experimented with creating a single site for comparing insurance plans and pooling risk, learning from past failures like California's PacAdvantage. Private-sector companies also help individuals and small groups compare health insurance plans, with some states having more regulations than others. Less than half of small employers offer health insurance. Companies like eHealthInsurance help individuals and small groups compare health insurance plans in most states. Less than half of small employers offer health insurance due to cost concerns and the limited ability to spread risk in small pools. Insurers view small firms as less stable than larger ones due to the impact of one or two employees moving in or out of the pool. Small firms face challenges in providing health insurance due to their limited ability to spread risk across a small pool. Factors such as being medically underwritten, having little market power, and lacking economies of scale contribute to this issue. Allowing these firms to purchase insurance through a larger pool, such as an Association, could help address these challenges. Small groups face challenges in negotiating benefits and rates with insurance carriers due to their limited market power. Purchasing insurance through a larger pool could lower premiums for high-cost employees. State laws may allow rejection or higher premiums based on health status in the nongroup market, leading to lower premiums for the healthy but higher for the sick. Reforms in premium ratings could address these issues. In the nongroup market, individuals may face rejection or higher premiums based on their health status, leading to lower premiums for the healthy but higher for the sick. Reforms in premium ratings could impact premiums based on age, health, behaviors, and other factors. States primarily regulate the private health insurance market, with some federal regulations applying to employer-sponsored health insurance. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates that coverage sold to small groups must be offered on a competitive basis. Regulations in the private health insurance market primarily affect employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI). The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires small group coverage to be sold on a guaranteed issue basis. States mandate issuers to offer policies to small groups and self-employed individuals on a guaranteed issue basis. In the small group market, 13 states require issuers to offer policies on a guaranteed issue basis to self-employed \"groups of one.\" In the individual market, 15 states require issuers to offer some insurance products on a guaranteed issue basis to non-HIPAA eligible individuals. Most states impose premium rating rules on insurance carriers in both markets, ranging from pure community rating to no restrictions. In the small group and individual markets, states impose premium rating rules on insurance carriers. Existing state rating limitations vary from pure community rating to adjusted community rating, to rate bands, to no restrictions. Pure community rating means all enrollees pay the same premium regardless of health or age. Adjusted community rating prohibits pricing based on health factors but allows it for other factors like age or gender. Rate bands also allow for pricing variations. Only New York imposes pure community rating rules in the small group market, while adjusted community rating prohibits pricing based on health factors but allows it for age or gender. Rate bands limit premium variation based on health within a specified range set by the state. Federal law mandates group health plans to restrict the period of rating adjustments. Federal law requires group health plans and health insurance issuers to limit the period of time when coverage for preexisting health conditions may be excluded. In the small group market, 21 states have rules providing consumer protection above the federal standard, while in the individual market, 42 states limit the exclusion period for preexisting conditions. In December 2008, 42 states in the individual market limit the period for excluding coverage of preexisting health conditions for certain enrollees. There are over 2,000 state-imposed benefit mandates for health insurance, with some considering a publicly sponsored health insurance plan as part of market reform. The issue receiving congressional attention is whether a publicly sponsored health insurance plan should be offered as part of insurance market reform. Proponents argue that a public option could be less expensive and provide additional choice and competition. Opponents question whether this would give the government an unfair advantage in setting prices. The public plan in health insurance reform may increase competition by offering lower provider payments and premiums, leading to concerns about unfair advantages for the government. Studies suggest that non-profit health insurance organizations perform better in quality compared to for-profit ones. Some studies suggest that non-profit health insurance organizations outperform for-profit ones in terms of quality. Research has shown that non-profit health maintenance organizations scored higher on quality measures compared to for-profit counterparts. Non-profit health insurance organizations have been shown to outperform for-profit ones on quality measures, scoring higher on all 14 HEDIS quality measures studied. Studies have also highlighted the success of health insurance co-operatives, such as Group Health Cooperative of Seattle and HealthPartners of Minnesota. As of 2008, 47% of private health plan enrollment was in non-profit organizations. Advocates argue for incentivizing the creation of new health insurance co-operatives, emphasizing benefits like lower premiums, cost-sharing, expanded benefits, and innovative programs. Opponents question the effectiveness of co-operatives. Advocates support health insurance co-operatives investing earnings back into the plan or enrollees for lower costs and innovative programs. Opponents doubt co-operatives' success and affordability impact. Some bill provisions would be implemented before January 1, 2013, focusing on administrative steps. Prior to the full implementation on January 1, 2013, some provisions of the bill would take effect. These include prohibiting postretirement reductions in retiree health benefits, allowing individuals to keep COBRA coverage until the Exchange is operational, and establishing a temporary national high-risk pool program to provide health benefits. The Secretary would establish a temporary national high-risk pool program to provide health benefits to eligible individuals until the Health Insurance Exchange is established. Health insurance issuers must provide a rebate if their coverage has a medical loss ratio below a specified level. This provision applies to both the small and large group markets and will sunset once plans are offered via the Exchange. The bill includes provisions for health insurance issuers to provide rebates if their coverage has a medical loss ratio below a specified level, not less than 85%. This applies to both group and individual markets, with the provision sunsetting once plans are offered via the Exchange. Additionally, individuals up to age 26 can remain on their parents' plans at their discretion. Insurers must justify any premium increases to the Secretary and states before implementation. The bill allows individuals up to age 26 to stay on their parents' insurance plans. It reduces the look-back period for pre-existing conditions from 6 months to 30 days and shortens the exclusion period for certain benefits. Acts of domestic violence cannot be considered pre-existing conditions. Plans must cover benefits for a dependent child's congenital conditions. The bill prohibits domestic violence from being treated as a pre-existing condition and mandates coverage for a dependent child's congenital conditions. It also prohibits lifetime limits on benefits and sets guidelines for rescission of health insurance policies. Additionally, a temporary reinsurance program will be established. The Secretary will issue guidance to limit insurer rescission of health insurance policies. A temporary reinsurance program will assist employment-based plans with health benefits. H.R. 3962 mandates individuals to have health insurance with penalties for noncompliance. H.R. 3962 mandates individuals to have health insurance, with penalties for noncompliance. Acceptable coverage includes qualified health benefits plans, employment-based plans, Medicare, Medicaid, military coverage, veteran's health care program, and coverage determined by the Secretary. Individuals must maintain acceptable coverage for themselves and their dependents. Individuals who do not maintain acceptable health insurance coverage may face an additional tax, calculated as 2.5% of their modified adjusted gross income or the national average premium for coverage. Subsidies may be provided to help with premium and cost-sharing expenses. The individual mandate requires individuals to have acceptable health insurance coverage or face an additional tax. Subsidies may be provided to help with premium and cost-sharing expenses for those eligible. Exemptions include nonresident aliens, individuals residing outside the US, and those with qualified religious exemptions. H.R. 3962 would require employers to offer health insurance or pay into the Exchange, with exceptions for certain entities. Employers, including private-sector employers, churches, and government entities, would be required to offer health insurance to their employees or contribute a set amount to the Exchange. They could offer employment-based coverage or coverage through an Exchange plan. Current health plans would be grandfathered for five years, after which they would need to meet the essential benefits package requirements. Employers must offer health insurance to employees or contribute to the Exchange. Current health plans can be grandfathered for five years, after which they must meet essential benefits package requirements. Employers need to contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost QHBP or current plan offered, prorated for part-time employees. Salary reductions cannot offset required contributions. Employees are automatically enrolled in the plan with the lowest premium unless they choose a different plan. Employers must provide health insurance or contribute to the Exchange. Salary reductions cannot offset required contributions. Employees are automatically enrolled in the plan with the lowest premium unless they opt out. Employers must give written notice of auto enrollment and provide information to show compliance with health participation requirements. Employers must provide information to show compliance with health participation requirements for auto enrollment in a QHBP or current employment-based plan. The Secretary of HHS can terminate an employer's election to provide health insurance for substantial noncompliance. The Secretary of HHS, in coordination with the Commissioner, could terminate an employer's election to provide health insurance if the employer was in substantial noncompliance with the health coverage participation requirements. Employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 not offering coverage would be subject to an 8% excise tax. Employees could choose to enroll in a plan through the Exchange even if their employer offers coverage. Beginning in 2014, employers with aggregate wages above $750,000 would be assessed 8% of average wages if an employee declines the employer's qualifying coverage. Employees can enroll in a plan through the Exchange instead, but may be responsible for the full premium. Small employers would also face similar adjustments in payroll assessments. This assessment would not apply to employees covered as spouses or dependents in an Exchange plan. Employees who opt for Exchange coverage instead of their employer's qualifying coverage may be assessed 8% of average wages. Small employers would also face similar adjustments in payroll assessments. This assessment would not apply to employees covered as spouses or dependents in an Exchange plan. Full-time employees offered employer's qualifying coverage may not be eligible for premium or cost-sharing credits. They would be responsible for 100% of the premium if they opt for Exchange coverage. Small businesses could receive a 50% credit towards qualified employee health coverage for up to two taxable years, phased out as average employee compensation and number of employees increase. Employees must have received at least $5,000 to be counted for the credit. The proposed credit for small businesses would cover qualified employee health coverage for up to two taxable years, with a phase-out as employee compensation and number of employees increase. Employees must have received at least $5,000 in compensation to be eligible, and the credit would not apply to highly compensated employees. Adjustments for inflation would be made starting in tax year 2013. The small business credit for employee health coverage would be subject to inflation adjustments and limited to average employee compensation and non-highly compensated employees. It would be part of the general business credit and not refundable, available only to businesses with tax liability. H.R. 3962 introduces new federal health insurance standards for qualified health benefits plans (QHBPs), including market reforms. Non-profit organizations would not be eligible for the small business credit. The bill introduces new federal health insurance standards for qualified health benefits plans (QHBPs), including market reforms such as prohibiting coverage exclusions for pre-existing conditions.

Coverage must be offered on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis. The bill introduces new federal health insurance standards for qualified health benefits plans (QHBPs), including requiring coverage to be offered on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis. This provision applies to all individual and group health plans, whether offered in or out of the Exchange. The bill introduces new federal health insurance standards for qualified health benefits plans (QHBPs), including guaranteed issue and renewal. Premiums would be determined using adjusted community rating rules, allowing variation based only on age and premium rating area. Under H.R. 3962, premiums for qualified health benefits plans would be allowed to vary based only on age, premium rating area, and family enrollment. New non-discrimination and adequacy standards would be imposed on insurers' networks of providers, with existing mental health parity rules also applying. Coverage must provide the policyholder with certain options. H.R. 3962 would require new non-discrimination standards and adequacy standards for insurers' networks of providers, including doctors, and apply existing mental health parity rules. It would also mandate coverage to offer the option of keeping qualified dependent children on the family's policy up to age 27, require notification of any coverage changes at least 90 days in advance, and require QHBPs to cover certain benefits and prohibit cost-sharing on preventive services. H.R. 3962 mandates notification of coverage changes 90 days in advance, requires QHBPs to cover specific benefits, limit out-of-pocket spending, and comply with network adequacy standards. New individual policies after 2013 must be Exchange plans, while existing group plans must transition to QHBP standards. H.R. 3962 mandates that new individual policies issued in 2013 or after must be offered only as Exchange plans, while existing group plans need to transition to QHBP standards by 2018. Existing nongroup insurance policies can be grandfathered as long as there are no changes to the coverage terms, including benefits and cost-sharing. States can form Health Care Choice Compacts to facilitate the sale and purchase of individual policies. H.R. 3962 allows states to create Health Care Choice Compacts for selling individual health insurance plans across state lines, with coverage subject to the laws of one primary state but with secondary states retaining enforcement authority for specific rules. The Health Care Choice Compacts under H.R. 3962 allow coverage sold in multiple states to be subject to the laws of one primary state while preserving the authority of secondary states to enforce specific rules. The Secretary would provide grants to states for regulating health insurance in secondary states, with QHBPs required to cover essential benefits and could offer additional benefits. The essential benefits package includes specified items and services, limits on cost-sharing for preventive services, annual out-of-pocket spending, and prohibits annual and lifetime benefit limits on covered healthcare. The essential benefits package would cover specified items and services, prohibit cost-sharing on preventive services, limit annual out-of-pocket spending, and comply with network adequacy standards. It must be equivalent to the average employer health plan in 2013 and cover hospitalization, outpatient services, and emergency department services. The essential benefits package, as certified by the Office of the Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, includes coverage for hospitalization, outpatient services, physician services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, mental health and substance use disorder services, and certain preventive services. The essential benefits package includes coverage for appropriate settings, prescription drugs, rehabilitative and habilitative services, mental health and substance use disorder services, certain preventive services, maternity care, well baby and well child care, and durable medical equipment. The annual out-of-pocket limit in 2013 would be no more than $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family. The essential benefits package includes coverage for appropriate settings, prescription drugs, rehabilitative and habilitative services, mental health and substance use disorder services, certain preventive services, maternity care, well baby and well child care, and durable medical equipment. The annual out-of-pocket limit in 2013 would be no more than $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family, adjusted annually for inflation. Cost-sharing levels would be established using copayments and not coinsurance, covering an average of 70% of covered health care claims. Plans offered through the Exchange would adhere to these guidelines. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee and the HHS Secretary would specify the essential benefits package to cover 70% of health care claims. Plans offered through the Exchange could have richer benefit packages as Enhanced, Premium, and/or Premium-Plus plans. Employer plans could offer less cost-sharing than the essential benefits package. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee would recommend cost-sharing levels for employer plans, excluding grandfathered or Exchange plans, to align with actuarial values for different tiers. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee would develop cost-sharing structures for plans offered through the Health Insurance Exchange, incorporating innovation in healthcare and reducing health disparities. The Secretary would need to adopt the benefit standards recommended by the Committee within 45 days. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee would develop benefit standards to reduce health disparities and allow public input. The Secretary must adopt the standards within 45 days or provide reasons for not doing so. Initial benefit standards must be adopted within 18 months, federalizing private health insurance standards. H.R. 3962 would require the Secretary to adopt an initial set of benefit standards within 18 months, federalizing private health insurance standards. It would also establish a Health Insurance Exchange to facilitate the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans by individuals and small businesses. The Exchange would not be an insurer but provide access to insurers' plans similar to online travel booking platforms. The Health Insurance Exchange under H.R. 3962 would facilitate the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans for individuals and small businesses. It would not be an insurer but provide access to insurers' plans, similar to online travel booking platforms like Travelocity or Expedia. The Exchange would also negotiate with plans, enforce requirements, determine eligibility, and administer credits under a new independent federal agency. The Exchange under H.R. 3962 would be established by a new federal agency, the Health Choices Administration, overseeing plan requirements, eligibility, and credits. Costs would be covered by a Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund funded by taxes, penalties, and payroll assessments. The Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund, funded by taxes, penalties, and payroll assessments, would cover credits for acceptable coverage. Only one Exchange per state would be allowed, with approval required by the Commissioner for state-based Exchanges meeting specific criteria. The Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund would cover credits for acceptable coverage, funded by taxes, penalties, and payroll assessments. Only one Exchange per state would be allowed, with approval required by the Commissioner for state-based Exchanges meeting specific criteria. State-based Exchanges would be funded through a federal matching grant to states. If a state was operating an Exchange before January 1, 2010, and sought to operate a state-based Exchange under this section, the Commissioner would presume the Exchange meets the required standards. Beginning in 2013, new nongroup coverage could only be obtained through the Exchange, which also offers the public health insurance option and income-based premium and cost-sharing credits for certain individuals. Small employers could contribute toward coverage through the Exchange. The public health insurance option and income-based credits are available only through the Exchange. By 2019, 30 million people are estimated to have Exchange coverage, with 6 million enrolling in the public health insurance option. Individuals can access Exchange coverage unless already enrolled in a group plan through a full-time employee. In 2013, individuals can enroll in Exchange coverage unless already covered by a group plan through a full-time employee, Medicare, or Medicaid. Eligibility for Exchange coverage ends once eligible for Medicare Part A or Medicaid, except for specific circumstances determined by the Commissioner. Once enrolled in an Exchange plan, individuals remain eligible until they discontinue enrollment. Once individuals enroll in an Exchange plan, they generally lose eligibility once eligible for Medicare Part A, Medicaid, or other circumstances as determined by the Commissioner. An annual open-enrollment period would be held from September to November, lasting at least 30 days, with special enrollment periods for specific circumstances. Exchange-eligible employers can meet the employer mandate by offering and contributing towards employees' enrollment through the Exchange. Employers meeting requirements of the employer mandate by offering and contributing towards employees' enrollment through the Exchange. Exchange-eligible employers can continue to be Exchange eligible if they enroll their employees through the Exchange. Eligibility criteria for Exchange-eligible employers based on the number of employees: 25 or fewer in 2013, 50 or fewer in 2014, and 100 or fewer in 2015. In 2013, employers with 25 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible. In 2014, employers with 50 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible. In 2015, employers with 100 or fewer employees would be Exchange-eligible. Larger employers could be permitted to participate in the Exchange starting in 2015. Exchange plans must meet federal requirements and be QHBPs. Exchange plans must meet federal requirements and be QHBPs. Plans would be standardized into four cost-sharing/benefit tiers, with one Basic plan and one Enhanced plan allowed per service area. The Basic plan in the service area must meet minimum requirements of the essential benefits package with an actuarial value of approximately 70%. An Enhanced plan with lower cost-sharing (actuarial value of approximately 85%) can be offered if a Basic plan is available. Similarly, a Premium plan with even lower cost-sharing (actuarial value of approximately 95%) can be offered if an Enhanced plan is available. The entity may offer a Premium plan with lower cost-sharing (actuarial value of approximately 95%) in a service area. This plan can be accompanied by one or more Premium-Plus plans, which offer additional benefits like adult oral health and vision care. Cost-sharing levels for each benefit category in the essential benefits package would be specified by the Secretary, with plans allowed to vary up to 10% from the specified levels. Under H.R. 3962, the Secretary of HHS would establish a public health insurance option through the Exchange, with plans permitted to vary cost-sharing levels by up to 10%. State requirements for additional benefits beyond the essential package would apply to Exchange plans if the state reimburses the Commissioner for any resulting increase in premium credits. The public health insurance option under H.R. 3962 would be available through the Exchange, with eligibility for income-based premium and cost-sharing credits. The public option must meet all requirements for Exchange plans, including benefits, provider networks, consumer protections, and cost-sharing. It would offer Basic, Enhanced, and other plan options. The public option under H.R. 3962 would offer Basic, Enhanced, and Premium plans, with geographically adjusted premiums to cover costs. Limited start-up funding available, to be repaid within 10 years. The public option under H.R. 3962 would have rules set by the Commissioner to cover expected costs, with limited start-up funding available. The Secretary would negotiate payment rates for healthcare providers and services, with rates not allowed to be lower than Medicare or higher than other qualified entities. The public option under H.R. 3962 would set payment rates for healthcare providers, including prescription drugs, within limits. Providers would be Medicare-participating unless they opt out through a process established by the Secretary. Physicians could be preferred or non-preferred providers, with preferred physicians prohibited from balance-billing. Physicians in the public option can be preferred or non-preferred providers, with preferred physicians not allowed to balance-bill. Non-physician providers are also prohibited from balance-billing. The Secretary has the authority to use innovative payment methods and must implement successful payment and delivery system reforms. The Secretary can use innovative payment methods under the public option, implement successful reforms, and enter into no-risk contracts for administration. Administrative functions include payment determination, beneficiary education, and provider services. The Secretary can enter into contracts for Medicare program administration, including payment determination, beneficiary education, provider services, and cost collection from VA facilities. Public option enrollment is voluntary for all, including Members of Congress. The bill allows individuals, including Members of Congress, to enroll in public health insurance through any Exchange plan, with the responsibility of paying 100% of the premium. The Secretary can contract for Medicare program administration and cost collection from VA facilities. The bill mandates that individuals, including Members of Congress, who opt for an Exchange plan over employer-sponsored insurance must pay 100% of the premium. It also establishes a CO-OP program to support the creation of non-profit, member-run health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange, with $5 billion authorized for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 for start-up and solvency costs. The bill authorizes $5 billion for the establishment of non-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange, with loans and grants for start-up and solvency. Conditions include being a non-profit, member organization and not offering insurance before July 16, 2009. The bill authorizes $5 billion for non-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange, with conditions including not offering insurance before July 16, 2009 and incorporating ethical standards to protect against industry interference. The cooperative, not sponsored by a state government, issues QHBPs through the Health Insurance Exchange. It is licensed to offer insurance in each state and governed by a majority vote of its members. Operating with a consumer focus, any profits made are protected against industry interference. The cooperative, governed by a majority vote of its members, operates with a strong consumer focus and uses profits to benefit members. Grants and loans prioritize cooperatives with statewide operations, integrated delivery systems, or significant financial support from nongovernmental sources. The CO-OP program gives priority to cooperatives operating statewide, with integrated delivery systems or significant financial support. Violations may result in repayment of loans or grants with interest. Cooperatives can integrate across state lines and individuals may receive premium credits based on income for health insurance purchases. Individuals eligible for premium credits towards health insurance purchases may also need subsidies to afford cost-sharing. H.R. 3962 allows for cost-sharing credits for those eligible for premium credits, starting in 2015 for Basic plans sold through the Exchange. Under H.R. 3962, eligible individuals can receive subsidies for cost-sharing along with premium credits for health insurance plans sold through the Exchange starting in 2015. Under H.R. 3962, Exchange-eligible individuals could receive a credit in the Exchange if they meet certain criteria, including being lawfully present in the United States, having a MAGI of less than 400% of the FPL, and not being enrolled in certain other healthcare coverage options. The premium credit in the Exchange is available to individuals with a MAGI of less than 400% of the federal poverty level who are not eligible for certain healthcare coverage options. The credit is based on an affordable premium amount relative to individuals' income. For more details, refer to CRS Report R40878, Health. The affordable premium amount for individuals is based on a percentage of income relative to the poverty level. The Commissioner would adjust percentages to maintain government versus enrollee premium payment ratios. The reference premium for credits would be based on the three lowest-priced Basic plans in the area. For more details, refer to CRS Report R40878, Health Insurance Premium Credits Under H.R. 3962. The premium calculation for affordability credits is based on the reference premium, which is determined by the three lowest-priced Basic plans in the area. The affordability premium credit is the lesser of how much the enrollee's premium exceeds the affordable premium amount or how much the reference premium exceeds the affordable premium amount. Premium percentage limits are established by the Commissioner to ensure a linear increase for individuals with family incomes between specified tiers. The Commissioner would set premium percentage limits on a sliding scale based on family income tiers. Affordable premium credit would be calculated monthly, and assistance would be provided for cost-sharing. The Commissioner would specify reductions in cost-sharing amounts and annual out-of-pocket maximums under a Basic plan to align with actuarial values for each income tier. The out-of-pocket limits for individuals would be adjusted by the Commissioner to meet these values. The House bill includes provisions to raise revenues for expanded health insurance coverage, including adjusting out-of-pocket maximums and cost-sharing amounts based on actuarial values for different income tiers. Family coverage would have doubled out-of-pocket limits, and future increases would be tied to premium growth for Basic plans. Insurers would receive additional payments to cover reduced cost-sharing for credit-eligible individuals. The House bill includes provisions to raise revenues for expanded health insurance coverage by adjusting out-of-pocket maximums and cost-sharing amounts based on income tiers. Insurers would receive additional payments to cover reduced cost-sharing for credit-eligible individuals. Additionally, the bill includes provisions that limit employer deductions for certain health insurance plans and modify tax-advantaged accounts used for health care spending. These provisions are detailed in Table 4, along with their effective date and revenue estimates over a 10-year period by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). The curr_chunk discusses provisions related to health insurance and tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. It includes details on employer subsidies for retiree prescription drug coverage. These provisions are not directly related to health insurance. H.R. 3962 would require employers to coordinate the subsidy and the deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage, reducing the deduction amount by the federal subsidy received. H.R. 3962 would reduce the deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage by the federal subsidy received, raising $2.2 billion over 10 years. Tax-advantaged accounts and deductions for health care spending will be affected by the revenue provisions in the bill. Under current law, tax deductions for health care spending and coverage, including flexible spending accounts (FSAs), health spending accounts (HSAs), health reimbursement accounts (HRAs), and Medical Saving Accounts (MSAs), will be affected by the revenue provisions in H.R. 3962. Health FSAs are employer-established benefit plans that reimburse employees on a pre-tax basis for specified health care expenses. About one-third of workers in 2007 had access to an FSA, which is generally funded through the employee's election amount for salary reduction. H.R. 3962 would limit annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per person starting in 2013, indexed to inflation in subsequent years, raising $13.3 billion over 10 years. HSAs are also tax-advantaged accounts. The provision in H.R. 3962 would cap annual FSA contributions at $2,500 per person from 2013 onwards, indexed to inflation. HSAs, on the other hand, allow individuals to fund unreimbursed medical expenses on a pre-tax basis and can be rolled over with distributions for qualified medical expenses not taxed. H.R. 3962 increases the penalty on non-qualified distributions from HSAs to 20% of the disbursed amount, raising $1.3 billion over 10 years according to the JCT. H.R. 3962 modifies tax-advantaged plans by increasing penalties on non-qualified distributions. It also changes the definition of qualified medical expenses, restricting coverage of over-the-counter medications unless prescribed by a physician. This provision is projected to raise revenues according to the JCT. H.R. 3962 restricts coverage of over-the-counter medications in tax-advantaged accounts unless prescribed by a physician, projected to increase revenues by $5.0 billion over 10 years. State laws on abortion coverage/funding and federal conscience protection laws would not be affected by the measure. H.R. 3962 would prohibit discrimination against health care entities that do not provide or support abortions, without affecting federal conscience protection and antidiscrimination laws. H.R. 3962 prohibits discrimination against health care entities that do not provide, pay for, or refer for abortions. It also restricts the adoption of standards related to abortion in the essential benefits package. QHBP can still provide coverage for elective abortions or abortions permitted by federal funds appropriated for HHS. The Stupak Amendment, passed by a vote of 240-194, imposes additional restrictions on the use of funds authorized or appropriated by H.R. 3962 regarding abortion coverage. The Stupak Amendment, adopted by a vote of 240-194, added restrictions on the use of funds for abortion coverage under H.R. 3962. Funds cannot be used for abortion unless the woman's life is in danger, or in cases of rape or incest. The Stupak Amendment added restrictions on abortion coverage under H.R. 3962, allowing funds only for cases of danger to the woman's life, rape, or incest. It permits separate supplemental coverage for elective abortions, but must be paid for with nonfederal funds. The Stupak Amendment prohibits the use of funds authorized by H.R. 3962 for supplemental coverage or plans that include elective abortions. Premiums for such coverage must be paid with nonfederal funds. The Stupak Amendment prohibits the use of funds authorized by H.R. 3962 for coverage or plans that include elective abortions. Premiums must be paid with nonfederal funds, and Exchange plans cannot discriminate against healthcare providers or facilities. H.R. 3962 requires health benefits plans to offer an identical plan without coverage for elective abortions. Exchange plans cannot discriminate against healthcare providers unwilling to provide, pay for, or refer for abortions. States can receive incentive payments for implementing alternative medical liability laws compliant with the bill. The bill requires states to implement alternative medical liability laws that meet specific criteria to be considered compliant. The effectiveness of the law is determined by its impact on the medical liability system, including dispute resolution, error disclosure, and insurance affordability. The law must include an \"early offer\" system. The state law must ensure a reliable medical liability system by promoting dispute resolution, error disclosure, and insurance access. It should include an \"early offer\" system allowing defendants to offer periodic payments for economic losses within 180 days of a claim being filed. The state law includes an \"early offer\" system where defendants can offer periodic payments for economic losses within 180 days of a claim being filed. If the claimant declines the offer and proceeds with litigation, the standard of misconduct and proof are raised. The state law includes an \"early offer\" system where defendants can offer periodic payments for economic losses within 180 days of a claim being filed. If the claimant declines the offer and proceeds with litigation, both the standard of misconduct and standard of proof are raised. Additionally, a certificate of merit program requires claimants to include testimony from a qualified medical expert when filing a medical malpractice suit to establish merit. States receiving incentive payments must use them to improve healthcare, with the bill authorizing necessary appropriation but not providing funds directly. The bill authorizes appropriation for incentive payments to improve healthcare in the state, without directly providing funds. It clarifies that state laws on medical malpractice cases will not be affected. Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) must disseminate end-of-life planning information and offer options for advance directives and life-sustaining treatment. Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) must provide end-of-life planning information, offer advance directives and life-sustaining treatment options, and present other planning tools, while being prohibited from promoting suicide or hastening death."
