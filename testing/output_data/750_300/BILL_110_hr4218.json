A certified diabetes educator, often a nurse, assists patients in identifying barriers, problem-solving, and developing coping skills. Diabetes self-management training, provided by certified diabetes educators, helps patients with diabetes identify barriers, facilitate problem-solving, and develop coping skills to effectively manage their condition and reduce risks and complications. Diabetes self-management training is effective in reducing risks and complications of diabetes. A study in 2002 showed that lifestyle changes can decrease the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58 percent. Participants at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes reduced their risk by 58% through lifestyle changes. This intervention was particularly effective for those aged 60 and older, with a 71% reduction in diabetes development. Patients under the care of a certified diabetes educator also showed improved diabetes control and health status. Studies have shown that patients under the care of certified diabetes educators have better control of their diabetes and improved health status. Lifestyle changes taught by these educators lead to improved glycemic control and reduced complications from diabetes, with the potential for preventing serious medical complications by up to 90% (blindness), 85% (amputations), and 50% (heart disease and stroke) through proper medical treatment and self-management.
