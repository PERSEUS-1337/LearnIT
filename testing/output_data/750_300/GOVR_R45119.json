    "content": "The U.S. EPA proposed to repeal the controversial Clean Power Plan (CPP) in October 2017. The CPP aimed to limit CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants but faced legal challenges and has not been implemented. Disagreements revolve around the rule's legal basis, design, and cost-benefit analysis. The Clean Power Plan (CPP) aimed to limit CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants under the Clean Air Act Section 111(d). Stakeholders disagreed on the rule's legal justification, design, and cost-benefit analysis. States had two compliance choices: a \"rate-based\" or \"mass-based\" approach to achieve emission goals. The Clean Power Plan (CPP) offered states two compliance options: a \"rate-based\" or \"mass-based\" approach to achieve emission goals, providing flexibility to minimize costs. Emission reductions depended on states' compliance choices and factors like fuel sources and electricity generation. EPA considered the CPP economically significant. The EPA's analysis of the Clean Power Plan projected a 32% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030. The proposed repeal of the CPP signifies a significant policy shift from the previous administration. EPA's decision to repeal the CPP was based on a change in the agency's interpretation of its authority. The proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) by the EPA in 2030 marks a significant policy shift from the previous administration. The repeal is based on the agency's interpretation that the CPP exceeds its legal authority under the Clean Air Act. The EPA proposed repealing the Clean Power Plan in 2030, citing that it exceeds its legal authority under the Clean Air Act. The agency set CO2 emission goals for existing power plants that require measures outside the plants' \"fence line.\" A benefit-cost analysis was conducted, revealing methodological changes despite the Trump EPA's stance that the benefits and costs are not relevant to the repeal decision. The EPA proposed repealing the Clean Power Plan in 2030, stating it exceeds its legal authority under the Clean Air Act. Despite the current legal interpretation, the benefit-cost analysis of the repeal reveals methodological changes that may impact future regulations. Members of Congress are interested in understanding these changes, with a group of 19 Senators requesting more information from the EPA. Members of Congress are interested in understanding EPA's analysis of the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan, specifically the changes in benefit-cost comparisons from 2015 to 2017. A group of 19 Senators has requested more information about the benefit-cost analysis, including changes in how benefits and costs are estimated. These changes in EPA's analysis could influence how federal agencies consider climate and human health benefits when creating regulations to limit greenhouse gases or conventional pollutants. The EPA's 2017 analysis of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) may impact how federal agencies consider climate and human health benefits in regulations. The report summarizes the analysis conducted for the CPP's impacts and compares the economic analysis of the 2017 proposed repeal with the 2015 final rule. The report compares the economic analysis of the 2017 proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan with the approach used in developing the 2015 final rule by the EPA. It discusses changes in the 2017 analysis, such as estimating climate benefits, considering human health co-benefits, and accounting for energy savings impact. The report compares the economic analysis of the 2017 proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan with the approach used in developing the 2015 final rule by the EPA. It discusses changes in the 2017 analysis, including estimating climate benefits, considering human health co-benefits, and accounting for energy savings impact. EPA prepares benefit-cost analyses for significant regulatory actions in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and OMB Circular A-4. EPA Proposes to Repeal the Clean Power Plan, by [author name scrubbed]. EPA prepares benefit-cost analyses for significant regulatory actions, such as the CPP, in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and OMB Circular A-4. E.O. 12866 directs federal agencies to examine the benefits and costs of significant regulatory actions to ensure that the benefits justify the costs. The development and review of federal regulations outlined in E.O. 12866 require agencies to assess the benefits and costs of significant regulatory actions. Significant regulatory actions are defined as rules that have an annual impact on the economy of $100 million or more, create inconsistencies with other agency actions, alter budget impacts, or raise novel legal or policy issues. Rules that meet the criteria for significant regulatory actions must undergo a detailed regulatory analysis, as outlined in E.O. 12866. Additionally, OMB Circular A-4 provides guidance on what constitutes a good regulatory analysis and how to develop one. OMB Circular A-4 elaborates on the principles of regulatory analysis outlined in E.O. 12866, defining a good regulatory analysis as one that states the need for the proposed action, analyzes alternative approaches, and assesses benefits and costs. It aims to standardize the measurement and reporting of benefits and costs for significant regulatory actions across federal agencies. The OMB Circular A-4 aims to standardize the measurement and reporting of benefits and costs for significant regulatory actions across federal agencies, in line with E.O. 12866. It emphasizes the need for good regulatory analysis to assess whether the benefits of an action justify the costs, even if not all impacts can be quantified. When promulgating the CPP in 2015, EPA determined the rulemaking was economically significant and prepared a regulatory analysis in accordance with E.O. 12866 and Circular A-4, which recognize the challenges in quantifying all benefits and costs of a regulatory proposal. Agencies are directed to quantify benefits and costs whenever possible and identify non-quantified impacts that are important for regulatory decisions. When promulgating the CPP in 2015, EPA determined the rulemaking was economically significant and prepared a regulatory analysis in accordance with E.O. 12866 and Circular A-4. EPA identified non-quantified impacts that are important for regulatory decisions, emphasizing the flexibility states have in implementing the CPP. EPA calculated state-specific emission rate goals for the rate-based scenario and state-specific emission goals for the mass-based scenario. EPA characterized the scenarios as illustrative, noting states' flexibility in implementing the CPP. The agency estimated emission reductions and compliance costs using the Integrated Planning Model. Compliance costs were reported as the additional cost of complying with emission goals. EPA estimated emission reductions and compliance costs under different scenarios using the Integrated Planning Model (IPM) for the U.S. power sector. Compliance costs were calculated based on changes in capital investment, operating costs, fuel shifts, energy efficiency measures, and other actions for CPP compliance. The EPA estimated emission reductions and compliance costs for the Clean Power Plan (CPP) by considering new generating sources, heat rate improvements, ongoing costs of pollution controls, fuel shifts, energy efficiency measures, and other compliance actions. The estimates included costs for monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping. The CPP was expected to reduce CO2 and non-GHG emissions, with the EPA using the IPM model to estimate CO2 reductions and applying the social cost of carbon (SCC) to assess the economic value of climate benefits. The EPA used the IPM model to estimate reductions in CO2 emissions and applied the social cost of carbon (SCC) to determine the economic value of climate benefits, including human health co-benefits from reductions in non-GHG emissions. The EPA estimated human health benefits from reductions in non-GHG emissions, such as SO2 and NOx, by using a \"benefit-per-ton\" approach for PM and ozone exposure. The EPA monetized human health benefits from reduced exposure to PM and ozone using a \"benefit-per-ton\" approach. They calculated average estimates in three regions for the CPP analysis, representing the value of reductions in premature deaths and illnesses associated with exposure to PM and ozone. PM health effects accounted for most of the monetized health benefits. The EPA calculated the value of reductions in premature deaths and illnesses associated with exposure to PM and ozone in three regions for the CPP analysis. PM health effects accounted for most of the monetized health co-benefits estimates, with SO2 emission reductions contributing significantly to the estimated dollar value of human health co-benefits. Most of the estimated PM health co-benefits value came from reductions in SO2 emissions, accounting for 80-85% of the dollar value of human health co-benefits in 2030 scenarios. Ozone health effects contributed a smaller share, roughly 6-12% of the estimated value. Two years after finalizing the CPP, the EPA, under the Trump Administration, proposed to repeal it and began the same rulemaking process. EPA is required to follow Clean Air Act Section 307(d). After finalizing the CPP, EPA proposed to repeal it under the Trump Administration, following the same rulemaking process. Clean Air Act Section 307(d) mandates EPA to adhere to the same process for promulgating, revising, or repealing rules. The requirements include summarizing data and specifying the methodology used for analysis. EPA's proposed repeal was based on a change in legal interpretation of Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan based on a change in legal interpretation of the Clean Air Act. The regulatory analysis for the repeal focused on summarizing data and methodology used for analysis, following guidelines for economic analyses. The benefits of repealing a rule include avoiding costs associated with implementing the rule. EPA prepared a regulatory analysis for the proposed CPP repeal, defining benefits as avoided compliance costs and costs as forgone emissions reductions. The EPA defined benefits of the proposed CPP repeal as avoided compliance costs and costs as forgone emissions reductions. EPA used existing power sector projections for benefit-cost estimates and plans to conduct updated modeling using IPM for public comment before finalizing the repeal. The EPA plans to conduct updated modeling using IPM for public comment before finalizing the proposed repeal of the CPP. Benefit-cost estimates were based on power sector projections, with the first set using 2015 modeling results and the second set using more recent data. The EPA used power sector projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook 2017 to estimate compliance costs and emissions reductions under the CPP mass-based scenario for monetizing avoided costs and benefits of the proposed repeal. The EPA used power sector projections to estimate compliance costs and emissions reductions under the CPP mass-based scenario. EPA changed the accounting treatment of cost savings from energy efficiency measures, counting them as a positive benefit of the CPP. This means that energy efficiency savings would be a forgone benefit if the CPP is repealed. EPA's 2015 analysis concluded that the monetized benefits of the CPP include avoided compliance costs and emissions reductions. EPA's 2015 analysis found that the benefits of the CPP, including energy efficiency savings, outweighed the costs. The 2017 analysis showed less favorable benefit-cost comparisons. Net benefits occur when benefits exceed costs, while net costs occur when costs exceed benefits. The 2015 analysis of the CPP showed net benefits, with estimates ranging from $25 billion to $45 billion in 2030. In contrast, the 2017 analysis ranged from net costs to net benefits, with estimates ranging from $28.3 billion in net costs to $14 billion in net benefits in 2030. The 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal showed a shift from net costs to net benefits, with estimates ranging from $28.3 billion in costs to $14 billion in benefits in 2030. The agency did not explicitly state whether the benefits of the repeal are likely to outweigh the costs. The benefit-cost estimates for the proposed repeal of the CPP in 2015 and 2017 analyses showed a range of net costs and benefits. Half of the comparisons indicated net benefits, while the other half showed net costs. The estimates for 2030 ranged from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits. The AEO-based estimates for the proposed repeal in 2030 ranged from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits. Changes in the power sector projections may impact the benefit-cost estimates, as noted by the EPA. The AEO 2017 projections showed changes in the power sector, with a shift to lower-emitting sources. This could result in potentially lower CO2 emissions and compliance costs under the CPP compared to 2015 estimates. EPA did not specify if these trends would affect their benefit-cost analysis. The AEO 2017 projections indicated a shift to lower-emitting sources in the power sector, potentially leading to lower CO2 emissions and compliance costs under the CPP. EPA plans to update its modeling and seek public feedback before finalizing the proposed repeal. The projections also suggested greater SO2 reductions and higher human health co-benefits compared to EPA's 2015 estimates. The AEO 2017 projections showed higher human health co-benefits and greater SO2 reductions under the CPP compared to EPA's 2015 estimates. A study by Resources for the Future found a significant reduction in coal emissions by 2030 under the CPP in the AEO 2017 projections, raising questions about the differences between models used in the 2015 RIA projections and the 2017 AEO projections. The study compared the CPP in 2030 to EPA's 2015 estimates, noting uncertainties in the differences between models used. EPA revised SCC estimates, excluded international impacts, discounted future benefits, assumed no health co-benefits below pollution thresholds, and counted energy efficiency in benefit-cost comparisons. The EPA's 2017 analysis of the CPP made changes by excluding international impacts of U.S. emissions, discounting future CO2 reduction benefits, and not considering human health co-benefits below pollution thresholds. Energy efficiency savings were counted as benefits. These changes led to different conclusions compared to the 2015 analysis. The EPA's 2017 analysis of the CPP made changes to the separate estimates of compliance costs and benefits. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is used to value climate benefits of CO2 reductions, representing the monetary value of impacts from changes in CO2 emissions. This includes impacts on agricultural productivity, property damage, and energy system costs. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) values the impacts of CO2 emissions changes, including effects on agriculture, property damage, and energy costs. SCC estimates are used to calculate the monetary value of climate benefits associated with emissions reductions. EPA estimated the climate benefits of the CPP in 2015 using SCC values developed by an interagency working group. In 2015, EPA estimated the climate benefits of the CPP using SCC values developed by an interagency working group. The SCC values measured the global value of CO2 reductions, ranging from $17 to $160 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030. The Trump Administration withdrew these SCC estimates in 2017. In 2017, the Trump Administration withdrew the Interagency Working Group's Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) estimates and disbanded the IWG as part of Executive Order 13783. This order directed federal agencies to review certain requirements related to domestic energy development and instructed agencies to ensure that new estimates are consistent with OMB Circular A-4 guidance. The Trump Administration withdrew the Interagency Working Group's Social Cost of Carbon estimates in 2017 through Executive Order 13783. This order directed agencies to value climate change impacts in regulatory analysis, following OMB Circular A-4 guidance. EPA developed new interim SCC values based on the order, using domestic focus and discount rates of 3% and 7%. EPA developed new interim SCC values based on Executive Order 13783, using domestic focus and discount rates of 3% and 7%. The agency used models and assumptions similar to the Interagency Working Group but adjusted global values to domestic values for SCC estimates. EPA approximated the domestic SCC as 10% of the global values from the DICE 2010 model. The EPA used models to calculate domestic SCC estimates, adjusting global values to domestic values based on the DICE 2010 model. The interim domestic SCC estimates are $7 and $1 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 at discount rates of 3% and 7%. The United States emits CO2 and other GHGs, contributing to global GHG concentrations and affecting the global climate. The United States emits CO2 and other GHGs, contributing to global GHG concentrations and affecting the global climate. Stakeholders disagree on whether federal agencies should use domestic or global SCC values. In 2010, the IWG recommended global values due to most GHGs contributing to damages worldwide. The SCC is $1 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 at discount rates of 3% and 7%. Some stakeholders disagree on whether federal agencies should use domestic or global SCC values. The IWG recommended global values in 2010, stating that most GHGs contribute to damages worldwide. EPA agreed with this rationale in 2015, emphasizing the interconnected global economy and potential spillover effects in areas like national security and public health. In 2015, stakeholders supported the use of global SCC estimates due to the interconnected global economy and potential spillover effects in national security, international trade, and public health. Some argued that a domestic SCC would underestimate benefits to the United States as climate impacts outside U.S. borders could still affect the economy. Some stakeholders recommend using global social cost of carbon (SCC) estimates as climate impacts outside U.S. borders can affect the U.S. economy. Others argue for domestic SCC estimates to focus on U.S. benefits and costs, in line with OMB Circular A-4 guidance. Some stakeholders recommend using global social cost of carbon (SCC) estimates for U.S. climate regulations, while others argue for domestic SCC estimates to focus on U.S. benefits and costs. Critics believe using a global SCC overstates the benefits of country-specific rulemaking by including non-U.S. populations in the benefit-cost comparison. The EPA focused on domestic SCC estimates in the 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal, citing direction in E.O. 13873 and OMB Circular A-4. Circular A-4 emphasizes benefits and costs for U.S. citizens and residents, but does not prohibit consideration of global values. Circular A-4 allows for consideration of global values in regulatory analysis, but emphasizes focusing on benefits and costs for U.S. citizens and residents. EPA included global estimates in a sensitivity analysis in the 2017 regulatory analysis, without comparing them to the avoided costs of the proposed repeal. Developing accurate estimates of the domestic Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) poses challenges, as discussed by EPA in their 2017 analysis. Experts and the National Academies of Sciences acknowledge challenges in accurately estimating the domestic Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), particularly in capturing relevant regional interactions such as global migration, economic destabilization, and political destabilization. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) and experts acknowledge challenges in estimating the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), noting the impact of global migration, economic destabilization, and political destabilization. OMB Circular A-4 discusses discount rate selection for benefit-cost analysis, recommending rates of 3% and 7% based on scenarios affecting consumer spending or private capital. The OMB Circular A-4 recommends discount rates of 3% and 7% for benefit-cost analysis based on scenarios affecting consumer spending or private capital. The 3% rate, known as the \"consumption rate,\" is the real rate of return on long-term government debt, while the 7% rate corresponds to the growth rate of federal spending. Discounting in the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) calculation involves estimating climate change impacts up to 2100 and beyond, then adjusting the future value of those impacts to the year of CO2 emission using a 3% or 7% discount rate based on the opportunity cost of capital. This allows for comparing economic impacts occurring at different times in benefit-cost analysis. The selection of a discount rate for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) calculation is challenging due to the intergenerational aspect of climate change. The current generation must choose a discount rate on behalf of future generations without their input, impacting how much the current generation values future climate change impacts. The current generation must choose a discount rate for future generations' climate change impacts, raising questions about accounting for future preferences. Different discount rates affect present values, with no consensus on the appropriate rate in an intergenerational context. The choice of discount rate for future generations' climate change impacts is crucial, as higher rates result in lower present values and vice versa. SCC estimates are highly sensitive to discount rate selection, with intergenerational rates in the 1990s ranging from 1% to 3%. OMB Circular A-4 recommends considering lower discount rates in sensitivity analysis, acknowledging ethical implications when comparing benefits and costs across generations. The OMB Circular A-4 recommends sensitivity analysis with lower discount rates for benefits and costs spanning generations. The Council of Economic Advisers suggested reducing the 3% rate to at most 2% and lowering the 7% rate as well. Stakeholders have differing views on discount rate selection. The council recommended lowering the 3% discount rate to 2% and reducing the 7% rate. Stakeholders have varied opinions on discount rate selection for the SCC, with environmental groups advocating for lower rates and industry groups preferring higher rates. Studies in climate change often use lower discount rates. The majority of climate change impact studies use discount rates of no more than 5%, with the IWG applying rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 5% for the SCC. Industry groups recommend higher rates, while environmental groups advocate for lower rates. The IWG did not apply the 7% rate for discounting the SCC, instead using rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 5%. Academics and the NAS have recommended different approaches to calculating discount rates to better capture uncertainty over long periods of time. The NAS recommended a new approach for calculating discount rates to capture uncertainty over long periods of time, suggesting that the OMB Circular A-4 guidance is insufficient for choosing SCC discount rates. EPA estimated the forgone climate impacts. The OMB Circular A-4 guidance is inadequate for selecting SCC discount rates as it does not address discounting over long horizons or the effect of uncertainty on rates, which impact SCC estimates. EPA used interim SCC estimates for the proposed repeal, resulting in lower benefit estimates compared to the 2015 analysis. The 2017 analysis applied lower SCC values, leading to reduced climate benefit estimates under the CPP. The EPA used lower SCC values in the 2017 analysis, which reduced the estimates of climate benefits under the CPP. They acknowledged limitations and conducted a sensitivity analysis using global values and an alternative discount rate. The EPA conducted a sensitivity analysis on the interim SCC estimates, using global values and a 2.5% discount rate. The 2017 analysis excluded human health co-benefits from some benefit-cost comparisons, diverging from the 2015 analysis. The EPA's 2017 analysis diverged from the 2015 analysis by excluding forgone human health co-benefits from some benefit-cost comparisons. Different comparisons either counted all, partially reduced, or completely excluded the health co-benefits. This approach was seen as inconsistent with OMB's Circular A-4 guidance. The EPA's 2017 analysis excluded forgone human health co-benefits from some benefit-cost comparisons, focusing on the \"targeted pollutant\" CO2. This approach was considered inconsistent with OMB's Circular A-4 guidance, but EPA defended it as a way to evaluate regulatory actions more cost-effectively. EPA's rationale for focusing on a targeted pollutant in regulatory actions is to achieve cost-effective reductions in pollutants. Stakeholders have raised concerns about the consideration of co-benefits in analyzing regulations targeting other pollutants. EPA is seeking public comment on the balance between benefits and costs in decision-making processes. The rationale for focusing on a targeted pollutant in regulatory actions is to achieve cost-effective reductions. Some stakeholders have concerns about considering co-benefits in analyzing regulations targeting other pollutants, such as reduced exposure to PM. Stakeholders criticized EPA's 2015 analysis for including monetized co-benefits, making it challenging to understand the impact on CO2. Questions were raised about potential double counting of PM benefits attributed to the CPP. EPA's 2015 analysis stated that human health co-benefits were incremental to existing regulations of PM and emissions. EPA's 2015 analysis included human health co-benefits that were incremental to existing regulations of PM and emissions. Consideration of co-benefits is consistent with federal guidance to quantify and monetize indirect impacts in benefit-cost analysis. The OMB Circular A-4 and EPA's Guidelines emphasize the importance of quantifying and monetizing co-benefits and adverse impacts in rulemaking. OMB reports show that EPA's Clean Air Act analyses include co-benefits in the total benefits estimate. The OMB's reports to Congress on federal regulations note that EPA's Clean Air Act analyses monetize co-benefits, mainly from reducing public exposure to fine particulate matter. This approach is in line with standard accounting practices and OMB Circular A-4 requirements. EPA includes some health co-benefits in benefit-cost comparisons, but not all, applying a threshold to forgone health co-benefits. The EPA's Clean Air Act analyses monetize co-benefits, mainly from reducing public exposure to fine particulate matter, in line with standard accounting practices and OMB Circular A-4 requirements. The EPA includes some health co-benefits in benefit-cost comparisons but applies a threshold to forgone health co-benefits, diverging from past practice by using a threshold to calculate PM mortality. The EPA diverged from past practice by using a threshold to calculate PM mortality impacts. They based the thresholds on the federal air quality standard for PM and the \"lowest measured level\" from long-term studies. This approach assumed no deaths attributable to PM below these thresholds. The EPA used thresholds based on the federal air quality standard for PM and the \"lowest measured level\" from long-term studies to estimate deaths related to PM. They assumed no deaths below these thresholds, impacting benefit-cost comparisons of the proposed repeal. The EPA used thresholds based on the federal air quality standard for PM and the \"lowest measured level\" from long-term studies to estimate deaths related to PM. The PM air quality standard threshold lowered the forgone co-benefit estimates more than the LML threshold did, affecting benefit-cost comparisons of the proposed repeal. EPA explained the use of these thresholds to enhance transparency and provide insight into the level of uncertainty in estimated PM benefits at lower levels. The EPA used thresholds based on the federal air quality standard for PM and the \"lowest measured level\" from long-term studies to estimate deaths related to PM. EPA justified the use of these thresholds to enhance transparency and provide insight into the uncertainty in estimated PM benefits at lower levels. EPA referenced its 2012 analysis of the rule updating the federal air quality standard for PM, which found greater uncertainty in estimating the health risks below the standard. The agency also justified the use of the LML threshold to examine uncertainty in the distribution of PM-related mortality benefits. EPA justified using the LML threshold to examine uncertainty in PM-related mortality benefits, citing scientific evidence that provides no clear dividing line for setting a threshold. The agency referenced peer-reviewed studies and the NAS to support this approach. The EPA's 2015 analysis acknowledged lower confidence in benefits from reductions at lower concentrations of PM but did not apply a threshold, stating that federal air quality standards are not \"risk-free.\" EPA's 2015 analysis acknowledged lower confidence in benefits from reductions at lower concentrations of PM but did not apply a threshold, stating that federal air quality standards are not \"risk-free.\" EPA's 2017 analysis asked for comment on estimating and reporting PM impacts in this way and described plans for further research. EPA plans to systematically evaluate the uncertainty of the benefit-per-ton approach for estimating health impacts of changes in pollutants like PM. They intend to conduct detailed air quality modeling to inform threshold-based analysis of PM benefits. EPA changed the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings in their analysis, treating them as a benefit rather than a cost, citing OMB guidance. This shift in accounting practice aims to better reflect the true benefits of energy efficiency measures. EPA's 2017 analysis treated energy efficiency savings as a benefit, following OMB guidance. The proposed repeal removed energy savings from cost estimates, increasing both costs and benefits estimates. EPA's accounting shift aims to reflect the true benefits of energy efficiency measures. The EPA's proposed repeal shifted energy savings from cost estimates to benefits estimates, resulting in higher estimates of both costs and benefits for the CPP. This accounting change did not alter the net impact of the repeal, as the difference between benefits and costs remained the same. The EPA's accounting change in the cost analysis of the proposed repeal of the CPP resulted in higher estimates of both costs and benefits. This change, made under E.O. 13771, did not affect the net impact of the repeal. The EPA's analysis under E.O. 13771 for the proposed repeal of the CPP focused on cost savings but omitted the benefits. Compliance costs for 2020-2033 were calculated, excluding demand-side energy efficiency savings. The EPA's analysis under E.O. 13771 for the proposed repeal of the CPP focused on cost savings by calculating compliance costs for 2020-2033. The agency did not include demand-side energy efficiency savings in the cost analysis, as they were considered benefits in a previous analysis. This cost analysis exceeded the compliance costs considered in the 2015 benefit-cost analysis, highlighting the importance of benefit-cost analysis in informing policy decisions. Benefit-cost analysis informs policy decisions by evaluating potential effects of regulatory options, but it does not solely determine decisions. Qualitative impacts and various factors are also considered in determining if benefits justify costs. Benefit-cost analysis does not drive regulatory decisions alone. Qualitative impacts and various factors, such as legal, technical, and ethical considerations, are also taken into account when developing regulatory proposals. EPA's proposed CPP repeal was based on a legal interpretation change and adherence to rulemaking procedures. Quantifying and monetizing benefits and costs is just one aspect of the decision-making process. The EPA's proposed CPP repeal was based on a legal interpretation change and adherence to rulemaking procedures under the Clean Air Act. Quantifying and monetizing the benefits and costs of regulations involves complex tasks drawing upon scientific data and policy decisions. Changes in policy priorities and technical information can influence the estimation of benefits. The EPA's 2017 benefit-cost analysis of the CPP repeal differed from the 2015 analysis due to changes in estimating economic impacts, including new SCC estimates lowering climate benefits and thresholds reducing human health co-benefits. Members of Congress have varying views on EPA regulatory policy. The EPA's 2017 benefit-cost analysis of the CPP repeal differed from the 2015 analysis due to changes in estimating economic impacts, including new SCC estimates lowering climate benefits and thresholds reducing human health co-benefits. Members of Congress have varying views on EPA regulatory policy, particularly regarding GHG-related regulations. Congressional oversight may consider policy priorities influencing regulatory decisions that impact major industries and the health of U.S. citizens. The EPA's assessment of the benefits and costs of the CPP changed between the Trump and Obama Administrations, reflecting differences in policy priorities. The 2017 analysis used interim SCC estimates, diverging from the previous IWG SCC estimates. The EPA's 2017 analysis used interim SCC estimates that differed from the previous IWG SCC estimates, impacting the estimated climate benefits of the CPP repeal. Congress may need to consider the withdrawal of the IWG SCC estimates in federal agencies' valuation of GHG impacts. The 7% rate reduction in interim SCC estimates lowered estimated CPP climate benefits. Congress may need to address potential differences in federal agencies' decisions on GHG-related regulations due to the withdrawal of IWG SCC estimates. EPA's 2017 analysis lacked details on next steps for the SCC and its implications for federal analyses. The EPA provided interim SCC estimates for regulatory analyses without a timeline for updates. It is uncertain if other agencies will use these estimates. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management followed a similar approach, while the Department of Energy used IWG SCC estimates in one rulemaking. The EPA provided interim SCC estimates for regulatory analyses, with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management following a similar approach. The Department of Energy used IWG SCC estimates in one rulemaking. Congress may consider EPA's changes to health co-benefits analysis as setting a precedent for future air pollution rulemakings. EPA's 2017 analysis reflected different policy determinations than the 2015 analysis. The EPA's 2017 analysis on air pollution rulemakings set a precedent for future regulations, with different policy determinations than the 2015 analysis. The 2017 analysis used a threshold to calculate PM mortality impacts, unlike previous analyses. The 2017 EPA analysis on air pollution rulemakings departed from the 2015 analysis by using a threshold to calculate PM mortality impacts and excluding health co-benefits from one of the benefit-cost comparisons."
