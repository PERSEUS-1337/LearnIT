    "content": "Economics is the study of efficiently using scarce resources and trade benefits countries by allowing them to produce more efficiently through comparative advantage. Trade also boosts consumer welfare by enabling the importation of goods and services. Trade allows a country to import goods and services to boost consumer welfare by accessing products that cannot be produced domestically or are more cost-effective to import. Many U.S. imports contain components or raw materials made in the U.S. through global value chains. Imports are brought in because they are produced more efficiently by foreign firms, often containing U.S.-made components or raw materials. Trade allows consumers to access a wider variety of goods at lower prices, improving purchasing power and controlling inflation. Producers benefit from lower-cost inputs, enhancing global competitiveness through exports to overseas markets. Trade allows consumers to access a wider variety of goods at lower prices, improving purchasing power and controlling inflation. Producers benefit from lower-cost inputs, enhancing global competitiveness through exports to overseas markets. Trade also leads to greater competition, innovation, and investment in research and development, supporting increased productivity and economic growth. Trade leads to greater competition, innovation, and investment in research and development, supporting increased productivity and economic growth. Economist David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage explains how countries trade today, emphasizing specialization and mutual benefits even if one country is more efficient in producing all goods. Ricardo argued that resources, especially labor, are immobile between countries, influencing trade dynamics. David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage emphasizes specialization and trade based on opportunity cost rather than absolute production costs. Countries with differing opportunity costs have a comparative advantage in different goods, leading to gains from trade. The theory of comparative advantage, based on opportunity cost, states that countries should specialize in goods they can produce well and trade for goods they produce less efficiently. Ricardo's theory predicts gains from trade through specialization. Subsequent economic theories have built upon and refined the concept of comparative advantage. Subsequent economic theories have expanded on and qualified the theory of comparative advantage, examining complex trade patterns in the 21st century with global value chains, services, digital trade, and cross-border flows of data and technology. Differences in comparative advantage between countries may arise due to variations in factor endowments like labor and physical capital. The theory of comparative advantage explains how countries may have different advantages in trade due to their factor endowments like labor, physical capital, human capital, and technology. For example, the United States has a relative abundance of high-skilled labor and a scarcity of low-skilled labor, giving it a comparative advantage in certain activities. Countries have comparative advantage in activities that utilize their abundant factors of production. The United States, for instance, has a relative abundance of high-skilled labor and scarcity of low-skilled labor, leading to a comparative advantage in high-skilled labor-intensive goods production. Technological differences among countries can also impact efficiency and comparative advantage, with the ICT revolution and digital trade platforms facilitating technology and knowledge-flows globally. The ICT revolution and digital trade platforms have facilitated technology and knowledge-flows globally, impacting efficiency and comparative advantage among countries. Governments can influence comparative advantage through policies that indirectly nurture advantages or directly target specific industries. Policies can influence comparative advantage through indirect measures like eliminating corruption and promoting mass education, or direct support for strategic industries with potential for economic growth. Protectionist policies, such as subsidies or tariffs, aim to promote strategic industries needing government support to achieve economic goals. Debate exists on their impact, with some economists warning of trade distortion and reduced efficiency. Global trade often involves countries exchanging goods within the same industry. Protectionist policies like subsidies or tariffs aim to support strategic industries, but they can distort trade and reduce efficiency. Global trade involves intra-industry exchanges, indicating trade based on economies of scale rather than just comparative advantage. Trade patterns suggest that economies of scale play a significant role in international trade, leading to specialization among countries in producing and trading specific goods. This specialization occurs due to countries not having the productive capacity to produce the full range of goods optimally. Trade patterns show that countries specialize in producing and trading specific goods due to the lack of productive capacity to produce a full range of goods optimally. This specialization leads to more efficient resource use, increased competition, economies of scale, and consumption benefits such as lower prices and more choices. Overall, trade is considered to have a positive impact on a country's economic well-being, driving changes in employment, wages, income distribution, and standard of living. Trade overall has a net positive effect on a country's economic well-being by increasing competition, efficiency gains, and consumer welfare. Liberalizing trade globally has reduced extreme poverty by half in the past 25 years. However, the benefits of trade are not evenly distributed within an economy and can lead to disruptions in some sectors. Liberalizing trade globally has reduced extreme poverty by half in the past 25 years, but the benefits are not evenly distributed. Trade can disrupt certain sectors, leading to job losses and stagnant wages in specific regions and industries. The economic impact of trade on jobs and wages is debated due to various factors, including technological changes. The challenge lies in reaping the gains from trade while addressing the needs of those adversely affected. Economists argue that policies facilitating adjustment and compensating for losses from trade are more cost-effective than protective measures. Adjustment assistance for displaced workers is crucial for maintaining political support. Trade creates job churn and affects workers in different occupations, requiring adjustment assistance for displaced workers to maintain political support for free trade. Policymakers debate the effectiveness of existing policies in helping communities affected by trade. Trade creates job churn and affects workers in different occupations, leading to disruptions in the economy. Trade liberalization can cause jobs to shift between industries based on comparative advantage, impacting workers within the same industry differently. Trade liberalization can lead to job shifts within industries based on comparative advantage, potentially causing job displacement for some workers. Estimates show that job loss due to trade is a small percentage of overall job losses annually. Between 2001 and 2016, over 150,000 U.S. jobs were lost annually due to expanded trade in manufactured goods, accounting for 1% of layoffs. While some workers may find new employment, others face substantial challenges in switching occupations or industries, leading to reduced wages. Import competition from China has particularly impacted local labor markets and manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Studies suggest that increased import competition from China negatively affected U.S. local labor markets and manufacturing jobs, leading to reduced wages. Most economists argue that equating net imports with unemployment is questionable. U.S. global trade has historically expanded during economic growth, with the trade deficit and unemployment rate moving in tandem. During economic growth, U.S. global trade expands, leading to a trade deficit and unemployment rate moving together. GDP growth reduces unemployment but increases demand for imports and capital inflows, contributing to the trade deficit. The impact of international trade on worker wages and income inequality remains debated. Trade can impact worker wages positively or negatively, with no consensus on its effect on U.S. workers' wages and income inequality. Studies suggest that factors like technological change have a larger influence on wages. In economic theory, trade tends to benefit capital and high-skilled workers while reducing returns for low-skilled labor in the U.S. Trade tends to increase returns for capital and high-skilled workers in the U.S., while decreasing returns for low-skilled labor. Imports from countries like China can negatively impact wages of low-skilled U.S. workers in import-sensitive industries. Global value chains have increased competition for U.S. low-skilled workers from lower-cost producers in developing countries. U.S. low-skilled workers face competition from lower-cost producers in developing countries, leading some U.S. multinational corporations to shift labor-intensive production overseas. However, high-end services jobs in the U.S. often require high levels of education and skills. Workers in export-oriented industries earn more on average than those in non-exporting industries. The United States focuses on high-end services jobs that require education and skills, with workers in export-oriented industries earning more than those in non-exporting industries. Economic globalization involves trade, financial flows, technology transfer, and integration of national economies. Globalization involves increasing integration of national economies through trade, financial flows, technology transfer, and labor migration. Periods of economic globalization have been followed by periods of deglobalization. Global trade as a percentage of global GDP increased from 25% to 57% between 1960 and 2017. The period of economic globalization following World War II saw a significant increase in global trade as a percentage of global GDP, growing from 25% to 57% between 1960 and 2017. The integration of the world economy was facilitated by advances in transport and communication, reducing geographic barriers. Global foreign direct investment also grew substantially, from 6% of global GDP in 1980 to 39% in 2017. Foreign direct investment (FDI) increased from 6% of global GDP in 1980 to 39% in 2017, facilitated by technical advances in transport and communication. Globalization has been driven by reduced natural and man-made barriers to international exchange since World War II. Economists debate the inclusivity and distribution of benefits from greater economic integration. Globalization has led to the rise of global value chains (GVCs) organized by multinational corporations (MNCs), allowing products to be produced by assembling parts from multiple countries. This has sparked a debate on the inclusivity and distribution of benefits from economic integration. The rise of global value chains (GVCs) organized by multinational corporations (MNCs) has transformed the way products are produced and delivered to consumers. More than half of global manufacturing imports and over 75% of global services imports consist of intermediate goods and services traveling within supply chains. Data from the OECD shows that a significant portion of national exports include foreign content in the form of imported inputs. The OECD data shows that over a quarter of national exports include foreign content, with the United States experiencing an increase in foreign value-added share in exports from 1995 to 2011. Global value chains (GVCs) are crucial for globalization, driving trade with advanced economies, emerging markets, and developing countries. The growth of global value chains (GVCs) has facilitated lower trade barriers, technological advances, and faster international transport, blurring the distinction between domestic and foreign trade activities. This has made it challenging to determine who benefits from global trade and interpret bilateral trade balances. The growth of global value chains has blurred the distinction between exports and imports, making it difficult to understand who benefits from global trade. Trade in intermediates means imports are essential inputs into exports, affecting policies and trade balances. Analysts predict shifts in GVCs will shape globalization and future policy challenges. Analysts highlight fundamental shifts in global value chains (GVCs) shaping globalization and future policy challenges. Foreign direct investment (FDI) drives trade as multinational corporations (MNCs) source production globally within their networks. This has led to the majority of trade occurring within MNCs. Foreign direct investment (FDI) supports global value chains by multinational corporations (MNCs), leading to trade within MNCs. FDI facilitates inter- and intra-firm trade between parent companies and their foreign affiliates, as well as between affiliates of foreign firms and the foreign parent company. U.S. firms invest abroad primarily to sell goods. In 2016, 11% of sales from U.S. foreign affiliates went to U.S. parent companies, while 59% went to the local market of the host country. U.S. firms invest abroad to sell goods and services to foreign markets, aiming to understand different consumer preferences. In 2016, 11% of sales from U.S. foreign affiliates went to U.S. parent companies, while 59% went to the local market of the host country. Foreign firms invest in the United States to access the consumer market, high-skilled labor, and resources. Foreign firms invest in the United States to access the consumer market, high-skilled labor, and resources. Global integration through trade and investment flows can disrupt markets, leading to concerns about offshoring and outsourcing. U.S. multinational corporations focus on high-end activities like research and development, while outsourcing production to countries with lower labor costs. Some U.S. multinational corporations outsource production to countries with lower labor costs, focusing on high-end activities like research and development. Globalization and trade liberalization may not impact overall U.S. employment rate, but could lead to greater income volatility and shifts in employment sectors. Manufacturing assembly moving abroad may reduce U.S. manufacturing jobs but increase service-related jobs. The impact of globalization on U.S. worker incomes and employment includes greater volatility and shifts in sectors. Manufacturing assembly moving abroad may reduce some jobs but boost service-related jobs. Wealth distribution is affected by globalization through dampening wages for lower-skilled workers and increasing returns to capital. Globalization has contributed to declining labor share in national income, with 10-20% of rising U.S. wage inequality attributed to it. Most-favored-nation treatment is a key principle in the multilateral trading system. Globalization has marginally contributed to rising U.S. wage inequality by 10-20%. Most-favored-nation treatment (MFN) is a key principle in the World Trade Organization (WTO), requiring equal treatment among member countries. Exceptions to MFN treatment are permitted. Most-favored-nation treatment (MFN) in the World Trade Organization (WTO) requires equal treatment among member countries, with exceptions permitted for trade agreements and special treatment for developing countries. National treatment is another key principle of nondiscrimination in the trading system. \"National treatment and most-favored nation status ensure nondiscriminatory treatment in the trading system, with special considerations for developing countries.\" Most-favored nation (MFN) trade status, also known as permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) in U.S. law, ensures nondiscriminatory treatment of trading partners. Countries with PNTR status receive lower duty rates on imports compared to those without the status. Cuba and North Korea do not have PNTR with the United States, and Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 prohibits the President from granting PNTR status to any country. Countries with PNTR status receive lower duty rates on imports compared to those without that status. The Trade Act of 1974 prohibits granting PNTR status to countries not receiving such treatment at the time of the law's enactment. The Jackson-Vanik amendment further denies PNTR status for countries restricting freedom of emigration. The United States, as a WTO member, must extend MFN treatment to all WTO members immediately and unconditionally. The Jackson-Vanik amendment denies PNTR status for countries restricting freedom of emigration. As a WTO member, the US must extend MFN treatment to all members. PNTR had to be established for countries like China, Vietnam, and Russia upon their WTO accession. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule determines tariffs on imported goods based on commodity codes. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) determines tariffs on imported goods using standard commodity codes and descriptions developed by the World Customs Organization (WCO). The HTS groups products into 96 chapters and 5,000 separate groups at the 6-digit level, with more detailed categories at higher digits. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) categorizes goods into 96 chapters and 5,000 groups at the 6-digit level, with more detailed categories at higher digits. Each heading is further divided into product subheadings at different levels, with HS codes standard worldwide up to the 6-digit level. The HTSUS also subdivides each product subheading into unique 8-digit and 10-digit tariff lines specific to the United States. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) categorizes goods into 96 chapters and 5,000 groups at the 6-digit level, with HS codes standard worldwide up to the 6-digit level. The U.S. International Trade Commission publishes the HTS and keeps it up to date. U.S. Customs and Border Protection enforces the tariff code, while Rules of Origin (ROO) determine the \"nationality\" of imported products for various purposes. Rules of origin (ROO) are crucial for determining the nationality of imported products, assessing duty rates, and establishing eligibility for trade programs. In today's global economy, determining a product's origin can be complex due to parts sourced from multiple countries. The United States negotiates different ROO within its free trade agreements to ensure only eligible trading partners receive tariff benefits. In the global economy, determining the origin of products can be complex as they are assembled with parts from various countries. The United States negotiates rules of origin (ROO) in its free trade agreements to ensure only eligible partners receive tariff benefits. The \"yarn-forward\" rule in apparel requires yarn and fabric to come from FTA partners for assembly. Some argue this rule is strict compared to other countries' rules. The yarn-forward rule in apparel mandates that yarn and fabric used must originate from FTA partners for assembly. Congress debates the strictness of this rule, with some arguing it is crucial for the U.S. industry's survival. Global trade has significantly increased since 1960, with trade reforms linked to higher growth in productivity and reduced poverty worldwide. Global trade as a share of global GDP has risen from 25% in 1960 to about 57% in 2017. Trade reforms have been linked to higher productivity, real incomes, and reduced poverty worldwide. However, recent years have seen a slowdown in trade growth due to factors such as weak import demand, exchange rate fluctuations, and falling commodity prices. In 2016, trade growth was at its slowest pace since 2009, attributed to weak import demand, exchange rate fluctuations, and falling commodity prices. Factors like investment slowdown and China's shift towards a consumption-driven economy also played a role. However, trade growth rebounded in 2017, increasing to over 5%, driven by increased investment and consumption expenditure. The IMF and WTO are optimistic about the global economic outlook. Trade growth rebounded in 2017, increasing to above 5%, driven by cyclical factors like increased investment and consumption expenditure. The IMF and WTO projected a rebound in trade growth for 2018 and 2019, but now expect it to slow due to rising trade tensions and policy uncertainty. Analysts suggest that restrictive trade measures imposed by the United States and its major trading partners are affecting trade flows and prices in targeted sectors. The IMF and WTO expect global trade growth to slow due to heightened trade policy uncertainty, with restrictive measures impacting trade flows and prices. Recent policy announcements have harmed businesses' outlooks and investment plans, raising concerns over disruptions to supply chains and potential trade restrictions. The top-five largest trading economies in 2017 were the United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. In 2017, the top-five largest trading economies were the United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. The EU would be the largest trading economy if treated as a single bloc. China was the largest exporter, while the United States was the largest importer. The U.S. was the largest importer and second-largest exporter in goods trade, and both the largest importer and exporter in services trade. In 2017, the United States was the largest importer and second-largest exporter in goods trade, and both the largest importer and exporter in services trade. The U.S. share of global goods exports fell from 15% in 1960 to 9% in 2017, while the U.S. export share of global services is 14%. U.S. exports and imports of goods and services combined were equivalent to 27% of GDP in 2017. The U.S. export share of global services is 14%. In 2017, U.S. exports and imports of goods and services combined were equivalent to 27% of GDP. The United States ranked first in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index. In 2017, the U.S. exported $2.4 trillion in goods and services and imported $2.9 trillion. The United States ranked first in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index. In 2017, the U.S. exported $2.4 trillion in goods and services and imported $2.9 trillion. U.S. exports have grown more than 40% over the past decade, while imports have grown more than 20%. Trade relative to GDP has increased significantly since 1960, with exports as a percent of GDP expanding from 5% to 12% in 2017, and imports expanding from 4% to 15% of GDP. China was the top U.S. trading partner in 2017, with $712 billion in total goods and services trade. In 2017, U.S. exports as a percent of GDP increased from 5% to 12%, while imports increased from 4% to 15%. China was the top U.S. trading partner with $712 billion in total trade, followed by Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany. The EU is the largest export destination and source of imports for the United States. About 65% of U.S. global trade is with countries without a free trade agreement. The United States has significant trade relationships with countries like China, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany. The EU is a major export destination and import source for the US. Around 65% of US global trade is with nations lacking free trade agreements, leading to challenges in interpreting trade data due to global value chains and intra-firm trade. The growth of global value chains and intra-firm trade has complicated the interpretation of trade data for the U.S. economy. Traditional trade statistics do not fully reflect the true source of resources used in production or who benefits from trade. For example, products like iPhones, developed in the U.S. but assembled in China with components from various countries, lead to misattributed values in trade data. Products like iPhones, developed in the U.S. but assembled in China with components from various countries, lead to misattributed values in trade data. Apple benefits the most from the sale of its products, with the majority of high-wage functions and employment occurring in the United States. U.S. imports from China actually consist of imports from multiple countries, but the full value is attributed to China. The U.S. benefits the most from products like iPhones, with high-wage functions and employment mainly in the United States. U.S. imports from China actually come from various countries, leading to an inflated trade deficit. \"Trade in value-added\" aims to identify the origin of value added in goods and services. According to TiVA estimates, the U.S. trade deficit with China would have been reduced by one-third. TiVA, a joint initiative by the OECD and WTO, identifies the origin of value added in goods and services. The U.S. trade deficit with China would have been reduced by one-third in 2011 if bilateral trade flows were measured this way. The trade deficit refers to the balance of trade in goods and services, and the current account. The trade balance is the difference between a country's exports and imports of goods and services, leading to a deficit when imports exceed exports. The United States has consistently run trade deficits post-WWII, with a global trade deficit of $552.3 billion in 2017, driven by goods trade. The United States has a trade deficit in goods and services, with a deficit of $552.3 billion in 2017. The deficit is mainly driven by goods trade, while the U.S. usually runs surpluses in services. In 2017, the U.S. had a services trade surplus of $255.2 billion. In 2017, the United States had a $449.1 billion current account deficit, down from its peak of $806 billion in 2006. The shrinking deficit was due to the economic slowdown following the global financial crisis in 2008, reducing demand for imports. The United States had a $449.1 billion current account deficit in 2017, down from its peak of $806 billion in 2006. The decrease was attributed to the economic slowdown after the 2008 global financial crisis, which led to lower demand for imports. The trade deficit reflects that the U.S. consumes more than it produces and imports more than it exports, mainly due to macroeconomic policies. The trade deficit in the United States is largely due to an imbalance between domestic savings and total investment, leading to a reliance on borrowing from countries like China. This borrowing allows for higher economic growth, boosting consumption and demand for imports. Americans borrow from countries like China to fuel economic growth, leading to a trade deficit. Factors like economic growth disparities and the role of the dollar also impact the size of the deficit. The U.S. trade deficit is sustained by the role of the dollar as a global reserve currency, allowing foreign investors to provide funds to finance the deficit by buying U.S. Treasury securities. This deficit can be examined over time relative to the size of the economy. The U.S. trade deficit is sustained by foreign investors buying U.S. Treasury securities to finance the lack of savings in the economy. The deficit can be analyzed over time relative to the size of the economy, with the current account deficit reaching a high of 5.8% of GDP in 2006 and declining to 2.3% in 2017. Selected economies' current account balances as a percentage of GDP are shown in Table 2. In 2017, the U.S. current account deficit was 2.3% of GDP, similar to the mid-1980s trend. The United States, United Kingdom, and Canada had the largest deficits, while the Netherlands, Germany, and South Korea had surpluses. Countries with ratios below 100 are net borrowers. In 2017, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States had the largest current account deficits as a percent of GDP, while the Netherlands, Germany, and South Korea had the largest surpluses. Some policymakers believe U.S. trade deficits with countries like China indicate unfair trade practices. The U.S. trade deficit is largely due to low savings, not unfair trade practices like tariffs and trade barriers. While reducing protectionist measures in certain countries could increase U.S. exports, without changes in consumption and savings behavior, the deficit would persist. The reduction of protectionist trade measures in certain countries may boost U.S. exports, but without changes in consumption and savings behavior, the overall trade deficit would remain unchanged. Bilateral trade balances offer insight into U.S. trade relationships with specific countries, but are influenced by various factors beyond trade. Bilateral trade balances provide a snapshot of the U.S. trade relationship with a country, influenced by factors like economic development, raw materials, and technological change. Trade deficits with certain partners reflect complex supply chain relationships, where one country serves as the final assembly point or a supplier of inputs for products like iPhones. Bilateral trade deficits with certain trading partners often indicate complex supply chain relationships, where one country, like China, serves as the final assembly point or a supplier of inputs for products such as iPhones. This imbalance can lead to adjustments in a country's exchange rate and cause a surplus of U.S. dollars to flow abroad, impacting the value of the dollar relative to other currencies. Net imports can cause a surplus of U.S. dollars to flow abroad, affecting the value of the dollar relative to other currencies. This can make imports more expensive for Americans and exports cheaper for foreign buyers, potentially reducing the trade deficit. However, the dollar's special status in global financial markets as a reserve currency and safe haven for investments complicates this adjustment process. The dollar's special status in global financial markets as a reserve currency and safe haven for investments complicates the adjustment process, leading to a smaller trade deficit. Foreigners exchanging their currency for U.S. dollars to buy U.S. Treasury securities appreciates the dollar, making U.S. exports more expensive. Foreign governments intervene to keep their currency from appreciating relative to the dollar by buying dollars and investing them back in the United States. The dollar's appreciation makes U.S. exports more expensive. Foreign governments intervene to prevent their currency from appreciating relative to the dollar by buying dollars and investing in the U.S. This intervention has hindered the realignment of global trade balances, leading to concerns about debt accumulation from sustained trade deficits. The appreciation of the dollar hampers global trade balance realignment, causing concerns about debt accumulation from trade deficits. Borrowing to finance imports depends on whether funds are used for productive investments or current consumption. Borrowing to finance imports can either be for productive investments or current consumption. If used for productivity-enhancing products, borrowing can lead to higher economic growth in the long run. However, borrowing for consumer purchases may burden future generations with repayments without improving the ability to finance them. Some economists caution that a growing U.S. trade deficit could cause a sharp decline in the dollar's value, potentially leading to financial turmoil. Some economists warn that a rising U.S. trade deficit could lead to a sharp decline in the dollar's value, risking financial turmoil. Attempting to reduce the deficit without addressing underlying macroeconomic imbalances may negatively impact the economy and do little to improve the trade balance in the long run. Many economists argue that reducing the U.S. trade deficit without addressing macroeconomic imbalances could harm the economy by reducing growth. Ways to reduce the current account deficit include increasing domestic savings, realigning exchange rates, and ensuring other countries do not devalue their currencies. Trade policies are not seen as the most effective tools for this. In 2017, the United States had a merchandise trade deficit of $698 billion, with manufactured goods accounting for 56% of total exports and 70% of total imports. Manufacturing exports have decreased by 4 percentage points over the past decade. The growth of global value chains has transformed U.S. manufacturing in certain industries, with the expansion of production that requires advanced technology but relatively less labor. Top U.S. exports and imports by subsector include transportation equipment, computer and electronic products, chemicals, and machinery. The growth of global value chains has reshaped U.S. manufacturing in industries like transportation equipment, computer products, chemicals, and machinery. Labor-intensive tasks have moved overseas, while design and distribution now drive production. Factory closures and layoffs, along with labels indicating foreign-made goods, contribute to the perception of a shrinking U.S. manufacturing sector. The U.S. manufacturing sector has seen factory closings and layoffs, with merchandise made in foreign countries contributing to the perception of shrinkage. Despite a decline in manufacturing employment, output has increased due to higher productivity. The United States has experienced a long-term decline in manufacturing employment, but manufacturing output has increased due to higher productivity. While the sector's importance relative to the economy has decreased, it remains a significant component. From 1980 to 2017, U.S. manufacturing real output increased over 80%, and since 2009, it increased by about 20%. However, the value-added of manufacturing as a share of GDP has decreased, accounting for 11% in 2017 compared to 21% in 1980, while services increased from 55% to 70% of GDP. Since 2009, U.S. manufacturing output has increased by about 20%, while the value-added of manufacturing as a share of GDP has decreased to 11% in 2017 from 21% in 1980. Employment in manufacturing has declined from 19.4 million in 1979 to 12.4 million in 2017, but has been rising annually since 2010. In 2017, manufacturing employment accounted for 8.5% of total nonfarm employment, down from 20.7% in 1980, while services employment has increased by 20 percentage points over the same period. Employment in manufacturing has been rising annually since 2010, accounting for 8.5% of total nonfarm employment in 2017 compared to 20.7% in 1980. The services sector has seen a significant increase in employment over the same period. Changes in manufacturing are not unique to the United States and are influenced by technology, consumer preferences, and macroeconomic factors. Trade's role in these changes is widely debated. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment in the 2000s was influenced by factors like technology, consumer preferences, and trade. Some argue that increased imports from China played a significant role, while others believe job losses were offset by gains in services due to global exports. Automation and other factors also contributed to the restructuring of the manufacturing sector. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment in the 2000s was influenced by technology, consumer preferences, and trade. Some argue that increased imports from China played a significant role, while others believe job losses were offset by gains in services due to global exports. A fundamental restructuring of the U.S. manufacturing sector was underway for more than two decades prior to China joining the World Trade Organization (WTO). Manufacturing activity measurement is challenging, and existing data may not fully capture changes in manufacturing, employment sources, and value creation. Manufacturing remains a significant component of the U.S. economy, with U.S. manufacturers accounting for nearly 70% of all private-sector research. Manufacturing is a significant component of the U.S. economy, with U.S. manufacturers accounting for nearly 70% of private-sector research and development (R&D) and nearly 60% of exports. The U.S. remains a top global manufacturer, with a trade surplus of $17 billion in agricultural goods in 2017. Agricultural exports accounted for 6% of total U.S. exports and 4% of imports. In 2017, the United States had a trade surplus of $17 billion in agricultural goods, accounting for 6% of total exports and 4% of imports. Agriculture's export share has slightly decreased below the 8% average over the past decade, but remains a significant component of the U.S. agricultural sector, representing about 20% of total farm production by value. Trade in agricultural goods is significant for the U.S., with exports making up about 20% of total farm production value. Foreign markets play a major role in absorbing U.S. wheat and cotton output. Imports of products like coffee, cocoa, spices, fish, and juices contribute significantly to U.S. food consumption. Services, including various economic activities like audiovisual, construction, and financial services, are also expanding. Imports of products like coffee, cocoa, spices, fish, and juices, along with services such as audiovisual, construction, computer, energy, express delivery, e-commerce, financial, retail, transportation, tourism, and telecommunications, have played a significant role in U.S. food consumption and economic activities. Services not only serve as end-use products but also support the overall economy by facilitating the movement of goods and providing essential credits for manufacturing. The economy relies on various services like transportation, telecommunications, and financial services to move products and support manufacturing. Barriers to services trade differ from those for goods, often occurring within the importing country. Barriers to services trade are different from those for goods, often occurring within the importing country as \"behind the border\" barriers. Restrictions may favor domestic service providers over foreign ones, hindering the establishment of a commercial presence or temporary movement of companies. In 2017, the United States had a trade surplus of $255 billion in services, with exports totaling $798 billion and imports at $542 billion. Services trade accounted for 34% of total U.S. exports and 19% of total U.S. imports, playing a significant role in the economy. In 2017, the United States had a trade surplus of $255 billion in services, accounting for 34% of total U.S. exports and 19% of total U.S. imports. Services trade plays a crucial role in the U.S. economy, contributing to 79% of GDP and 82% of private sector full-time employment. Unlike goods trade, the U.S. consistently exports more services than it imports, helping to offset trade deficits in goods. The United States has a trade surplus in services, which partially offsets trade deficits in goods. Trade data may underestimate services trade as it does not measure on a value-added basis. Services inputs in manufacturing and agriculture include R&D, design, engineering, and business services. Trade in value-added statistics can capture the independent value of these services. Digital trade encompasses a wide range of services that support economic activities, such as online shopping, business operations management, and online health or educational services. These services play a crucial role in enhancing productivity and competitiveness in manufacturing and agriculture, which are becoming more complex and technologically advanced. The value of these services can be captured in trade in value-added statistics. Digital trade includes online shopping, business operations management, online health or educational services, email communication, and financial services for e-commerce. ICT services are growing faster than trade in ICT goods. Digital trade barriers can be tariff or nontariff, affecting firms' market offerings and operations due to its intangible nature. Digital trade barriers, whether tariff or nontariff, restrict the flow of commercial data, affecting firms' market offerings and operations. This includes localization requirements that hinder cross-border data flows essential for digitally delivered exports and services, as well as data-dependent sectors like agriculture. Farmers, for instance, utilize real-time satellite data to enhance crop and soil productivity. Data transfer regulations that restrict cross-border data flows, known as data localization barriers, can limit the services a firm can offer and hinder communication with subsidiaries or headquarters abroad. These restrictions may also impede the entry of cloud-computing providers into a market. The United States plays a significant role in this digital trade landscape. The United States, as a key architect of the global economic order post-World War II, has historically focused on trade policies that support economic growth and job creation. This includes liberalizing markets, reducing trade barriers through agreements, enforcing trade commitments, and providing temporary relief. U.S. trade policy historically focused on supporting economic growth and jobs through trade, liberalizing markets, enforcing trade commitments, and advancing strategic goals. Key objectives are outlined in an annual trade policy agenda by the U.S. Trade Representative. The U.S. trade policy aims to support economic development, strengthen alliances, and extend U.S. influence abroad. Key objectives include supporting national security, negotiating better trade deals, enforcing trade laws, and reforming the multilateral trading system. The U.S. trade policy focuses on sovereignty, negotiating new trade deals, enforcing trade laws, and reforming the multilateral trading system. Key functions include formulating trade policy, negotiating agreements, enforcing laws, and administering trade programs. Congress collaborates with the executive branch on trade agreements. The USTR and multiple U.S. agencies work together to implement trade policy, with interagency coordination being crucial. The USTR serves as the President's main trade policy advisor and negotiator, while other agencies like the Commerce Department have specific roles in trade operations. The USTR is the President's main trade policy advisor and negotiator, with other agencies like the Commerce Department having specific roles in trade operations. The U.S. Constitution designates Congress as the primary authority over trade policy. The U.S. Constitution designates Congress as the primary authority over trade policy, granting Congress the power to regulate commerce and make necessary laws. Congress exercises this power through tariff schedules, trade remedy laws, and reciprocal trade agreements, all based on statutory authorities passed by Congress. U.S. trade policy is shaped by Congress through various statutory authorities, including laws on tariffs, nontariff barriers, trade remedies, and import/export policies. Congress also establishes trade negotiating objectives through trade promotion authority (TPA) and requires consultation from the executive branch on trade matters. Congress delegates powers to the President for trade negotiations and agreements through the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 delegated powers to the President to negotiate trade agreements and reduce tariffs. Congress renewed this authority periodically until the 1960s, and later expanded it with the Trade Act of 1974 to include opening markets and addressing nontariff barriers. The Trade Act of 1974 expanded the President's authority to negotiate trade agreements and address nontariff barriers. The House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee have primary responsibility for trade matters, with dedicated subcommittees for trade issues. Other committees may also be involved in trade agreements and policies within their jurisdiction.

Other committees may also have a role in trade agreements and policies within their jurisdiction. Congressional Advisory Groups on Negotiations (CAGs) provide advice to USTR before and during trade agreement negotiations. The Congressional Advisory Groups on Negotiations (CAGs) consult and advise USTR during trade agreement negotiations. Separate CAGs exist for each house: House Advisory Group on Negotiations (HAG) and Senate Advisory Group on Negotiations (SAG). Members influence trade policy through voting and committee participation. Individual Members can influence trade policy through various means such as voting, committee participation, providing testimony, and writing letters to the USTR. Trade promotion authority (TPA) is the process for approving and implementing most trade agreements negotiated by the President. Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" allows for expedited consideration of trade agreements by Congress without amendments. This authority ensures that trade agreements requiring changes in U.S. law are implemented through legislation with a guaranteed up-or-down vote. The agreement must meet specific requirements and be negotiated, concluded, and notified to Congress within a certain timeframe. Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" allows for expedited consideration of trade agreements by Congress without amendments. A trade agreement must meet specific requirements and reflect negotiating objectives specified in the TPA statute. Negotiations must be conducted in conjunction with notifications and consultations with Congress and other stakeholders. TPA defines how Congress exercises its authority over trade policy and gives the President added negotiating credibility. Trade promotion authority (TPA), also known as \"fast track,\" allows for expedited consideration of trade agreements by Congress without amendments. TPA defines how Congress exercises its authority over trade policy and gives the President added negotiating credibility. The most recent TPA legislation was signed into law on June 29, 2015 (P.L. 114-26) and applies to concluded trade agreements notified to Congress before July 1, 2021. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) has been renewed four times, with the most recent legislation signed into law on June 29, 2015 (P.L. 114-26).

The USTR has primary responsibility for trade negotiations and policy decisions, coordinating with other departments as needed. The USTR is primarily responsible for trade negotiations and policy decisions, coordinating with other Cabinet-level departments. Congress established the Trade Policy Committee, chaired by USTR and including key department heads. Sub-Cabinet groups like the TPRG and TPSC were subsequently formed to implement the interagency process. The USTR coordinates with other Cabinet-level departments and established sub-Cabinet groups like the TPRG and TPSC to implement trade policy decisions. The President influences trade legislation and specific decisions on U.S. trade policies. The President plays a key role in influencing trade legislation, signing it into law, and making specific decisions on U.S. trade policies. This includes requesting TPA, initiating trade remedy cases, and communicating with foreign leaders to influence trade relations. The President plays a crucial role in influencing trade legislation, signing it into law, and making decisions on U.S. trade policies, including requesting TPA and initiating trade remedy cases. The private sector and stakeholders contribute to U.S. trade policy through a three-tiered committee system established by Congress in the Trade Act of 1974. The advisory system for U.S. trade policy consists of 28 committees with about 700 citizen advisors, administered by USTR's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs & Public Engagement. It includes the President's Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, five general policy advisory committees, and 20 technical advisory committees in industry and agriculture. Committees ensure U.S. public and private sector views are considered. The U.S. trade policy advisory system consists of 28 committees with 700 citizen advisors, including the President's Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, general policy advisory committees, and technical advisory committees in industry and agriculture. These committees ensure that U.S. public and private sector views are considered in trade policies and programs. Private sector, NGOs, and labor groups also influence U.S. trade policy through various channels such as testifying before congressional committees. Private sector, NGOs, labor groups, and other stakeholders influence U.S. trade policy by testifying before congressional committees and government bodies, providing assessments of trade negotiations, and submitting comments on trade initiatives through Federal Register notices. Trade is a crucial part of the U.S. economy, with various industries and sectors providing assessments on trade negotiations. Stakeholders, including private sector, NGOs, and labor groups, influence trade policies by lobbying Congress and the executive branch. Agricultural, manufactured goods, and services are all tradeable commodities. Trade is vital to the U.S. economy, with goods and services being tradeable commodities. Implementing trade policy can impact a wide range of interests in the United States, affecting industries, firms, and workers. Congressional decisions on trade agreements and antidumping cases can influence employment and economic growth. Trade policy in the United States can impact various interests such as industries, firms, and workers, affecting employment, economic growth, product choices, and prices for consumers. Stakeholder groups seek greater market access in different countries, with trade agreements now addressing nontariff issues like intellectual property rights and labor and environmental protections. This broadens the scope of interests represented by businesses, farmers, workers, consumers, and public interest groups. The focus of trade agreements has expanded to include nontariff issues like intellectual property rights and labor and environmental protections, leading to increased stakeholder interest. Various groups, including businesses, farmers, workers, consumers, and public interest groups, strive to ensure their views are represented in trade policy decisions. Legal challenges in federal court may be brought by importers, exporters, manufacturers, and other parties to appeal governmental actions related to trade. Legal challenges in federal court allow importers, exporters, manufacturers, and other parties to appeal governmental actions and decisions concerning trade, such as customs classification, antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings, national security investigations, and state economic sanctions. The federal government can also enforce customs laws and statutory restrictions on imports and exports through legal proceedings. Some trade statutes may limit judicial review, especially in preliminary determinations and governmental actions. The federal government can enforce customs laws and statutory restrictions on imports and exports through legal proceedings, which may preclude judicial review in some trade statutes. Court decisions, including those from the U.S. Court of International Trade, can significantly impact U.S. trade policy. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) in New York City has exclusive jurisdiction over trade law cases, which can also be filed in other federal courts. Court decisions can impact U.S. trade policy by examining agency interpretations, deference to executive branch actions, and trade statute constitutionality. The U.S. Court of International Trade (USCIT) in New York City, formerly known as the Customs Court, has exclusive jurisdiction over trade-related matters, including customs decisions, trade remedy determinations, import embargoes, and recovery of customs duties and penalties. It consists of nine judges with limits on political affiliation.

The court consists of nine judges with limits on political affiliation, appointed by the President with Senate approval. USCIT decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and possibly to the U.S. Supreme Court. Statutory provisions related to the USCIT can be found in specific sections of the U.S. Code. The United States negotiates trade agreements for economic, commercial, foreign policy, and national security reasons. Objectives include reducing tariffs, nontariff barriers, and gaining competitive advantages for U.S. firms in third country markets. This is governed by statutory provisions in the U.S. Code. The United States negotiates trade agreements to reduce tariffs and nontariff barriers, gain competitive advantages for U.S. firms in third country markets, increase market access, and strengthen alliances. The United States participates in trade agreements to enhance economic efficiency, global integration, and strengthen alliances. These agreements include multilateral agreements negotiated in the World Trade Organization, free trade agreements negotiated outside the WTO, and bilateral or regional FTAs involving multiple countries. The WTO categorizes trade agreements based on the number of participants. Bilateral FTAs involve two countries, while regional FTAs involve three or more countries in a specific geographic region. Plurilateral agreements involve more than two countries but not all WTO members and focus on specific sectors. The United States has 14 FTAs covering 20 countries, and globally, nearly 300 trade agreements are in force. The United States currently has 14 FTAs in force, covering 20 countries. Globally, nearly 300 trade agreements have been notified to the WTO and are in force as of late 2018. While U.S. FTAs cover some major trading partners, only 35% of total U.S. trade is with FTA partners. More than 99% of U.S. trade is with WTO member countries, with 65% of U.S. trade being with WTO members without an FTA. Under the Trump Administration, U.S. trade policy has shifted towards bilateral negotiations, withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and renegotiating existing FTAs. The majority of U.S. trade is with WTO member countries, not FTA partners. Under the Trump Administration, U.S. trade policy has shifted towards bilateral negotiations, withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and renegotiating existing FTAs. President Trump has renegotiated two U.S. FTAs and proposed new negotiations, including the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and amendments to the U.S.-South Korea FTA (KORUS). The renegotiations were conducted under Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) procedures, potentially allowing for expedited consideration by Congress. The United States has negotiated amendments to the U.S.-South Korea FTA (KORUS) without TPA procedures, including the delayed reduction of the U.S. light truck tariff on imports from South Korea. Additionally, under TPA procedures, USTR notified Congress of its intent to negotiate new trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom in early 2019. The United States notified Congress of its intent to negotiate new trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom in early 2019. U.S. FTAs are often more comprehensive than those negotiated among other countries, covering tariff reductions, services trade barriers, foreign investment rules, and intellectual property. The United States' Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) go beyond WTO rules, including tariff elimination, services trade barriers reduction, foreign investment rules, intellectual property protection, government procurement market opening commitments, and enforceable labor and environmental standards. Recent trade negotiations focus on new trading rules like digital trade and state-owned enterprises. Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs) are established between the U.S. and other countries or groups. The United States has more than 50 Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs) with developing countries, which are nonbinding agreements aimed at promoting trade and investment. The U.S. lead representative in TIFA talks is the USTR, and joint ministerial-level councils and issue-oriented working groups can be established with TIFA partners for consultations. The United States has over 50 TIFAs with developing countries, establishing joint ministerial-level councils and issue-oriented working groups for consultations. TIFAs are nonbinding agreements that do not require congressional approval and have led to FTA or BIT negotiations in some cases. GATT was created in 1947 as part of post-WWII efforts to build a stable international economic framework. The GATT was established in 1947 after WWII to create an international economic framework. It governed international trade for 47 years until the WTO was formed in 1995. The core principles of the GATT focused on lowering tariffs and applying them in a nondiscriminatory manner. The GATT, established in 1947 after WWII, continues to be applied today. It committed signatories to lower tariffs and apply them in a nondiscriminatory manner. Despite its enforcement mechanism being viewed as ineffective, it led to a significant reduction in tariffs and trade barriers. The WTO, formed in 1995, administers trade rules and agreements to eliminate barriers and create nondiscriminatory trade rules. The WTO, established in 1995, is a 164-member international organization that aims to reduce tariffs and trade barriers, create nondiscriminatory trade rules, and facilitate trade liberalization negotiations and dispute settlement resolution. It succeeded the GATT, which was established in 1947 after WWII and also focused on reducing tariffs and promoting nondiscriminatory trade practices. The WTO, established in 1995, encompasses various trade agreements resulting from multilateral negotiations. It administers agreements for trade in goods, services, intellectual property rights, and oversees negotiations among subsets of members. The WTO oversees multilateral and plurilateral negotiations among subsets of members, including the Government Procurement Agreement and Information Technology Agreement. The Doha Development Agenda, which began in 2001, faced challenges due to differences among the US, EU, and developing countries on various issues. The agenda has been on hold since the WTO Nairobi Ministerial in 2015. The WTO's negotiating body has faced challenges since the collapse of the Doha Round in 2015. Members are working on issues like agriculture, industrial tariffs, services, and trade remedies. Some progress has been made in talks on fisheries subsidies and e-commerce, but other areas remain stalled. The effectiveness of the WTO in trade liberalization and dispute resolution is under scrutiny. The WTO's negotiating body is facing challenges post the collapse of the Doha Round in 2015. Members are working on various issues, with some progress in talks on fisheries subsidies and e-commerce, while other areas remain stalled. Reforms are being explored to enhance the WTO's role in global trade, including improvements to the dispute settlement system. The Trump Administration is withholding approval for appointments to the WTO Appellate Body amid concerns over \"judicial overreach.\" Reforms aim to improve the WTO's dispute settlement system. The Trump Administration is withholding approval for appointments to the WTO Appellate Body amid concerns over \"judicial overreach.\" If new appointments are not approved, the dispute settlement system could cease to function by late 2019. The WTO dispute settlement process involves challenging trade practices that violate WTO agreements through consultations, dispute panels, and appeals to the WTO Appellate Body. If a member is found in violation, they must remove the measure or face retaliatory actions. Since 1995, there have been 575 dispute settlement complaints. The member must remove the challenged measure within a compliance period or face temporary retaliatory action authorized by the WTO, such as increased tariffs or seeking compensation. The United States has been heavily involved in WTO dispute settlement cases, with several pending disputes related to recent tariff measures imposed by the Trump Administration. The United States has been heavily involved in WTO dispute settlement cases, with pending disputes related to recent tariff measures imposed by the Trump Administration. WTO decisions do not directly impact U.S. law, requiring legislative action for implementation of findings. Compliance actions are determined by USTR if administrative actions are successfully challenged. The United States generally seeks to comply with WTO decisions through U.S. legislative action. USTR decides on compliance actions if administrative actions are challenged, which may include amending regulations or issuing new determinations. In some cases, compensation may be paid to the complainant country instead of changing U.S. rules. The United States may pay compensation to the complainant country instead of changing U.S. rules. U.S. FTAs have procedures to resolve disputes, aiming to comply with WTO decisions. Disputes can be resolved through consultations or by requesting a panel to adjudicate. Non-compliance can lead to possible suspension of trade benefits. U.S. FTAs aim to resolve disputes through consultations or panel adjudication, with possible trade benefit suspension for non-compliance. State-state dispute settlement is not common under U.S. FTAs, with most disputes resolved via consultations or under WTO rules. The United States has rarely used settlement under its FTAs, with most disputes resolved through consultations or WTO rules. NAFTA has had three cases decided under it, and there was one FTA labor dispute with Guatemala under CAFTA-DR. Most U.S. FTAs also have a separate dispute system for investment-related provisions, known as investor-state dispute settlement. NAFTA and the proposed USMCA have a unique binational panel system for reviewing trade remedy laws. The US has rarely used settlement under its FTAs, with disputes mostly resolved through consultations or WTO rules. NAFTA has had three cases decided under it, and there was one FTA labor dispute with Guatemala under CAFTA-DR. Trade preference programs provide duty-free access to the US market for selected exports from eligible developing countries. Congress has created six programs since 1974. The US has six trade preference programs: GSP, APTA, CBERA, CBTPA, AGOA, and HOPE. GSP is the largest program, covering 120 countries and territories, providing duty-free treatment to thousands of products. In 2016, Nepal was granted country-specific trade preferences. In 2017, imports under these programs totaled $21 billion. The GSP is the largest U.S. trade preference program, covering 120 countries and territories. It provides duty-free treatment to thousands of products imported from beneficiary developing countries. In 2017, $21 billion imports entered the U.S. under the program. Countries must meet specific criteria to be eligible, including protections for intellectual property and worker rights. Currently, the USTR is reviewing the eligibility of countries like India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Turkey. The USTR is conducting eligibility reviews of GSP beneficiary countries like India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Turkey. Trade capacity building (TCB) involves U.S. assistance in funding, training, and technical expertise to support developing countries' integration in international trade. In FY2016, the U.S. invested $1.2 billion in 651 TCB activities across 134 countries. In FY2016, the United States invested $1.2 billion in 651 TCB activities across 134 countries to help developing countries negotiate trade agreements, implement reforms, and improve their capacity to benefit from increased trade. USAID typically receives the most funding for TCB activities, with no single agency responsible for coordination. The United States invests in Trade Capacity Building (TCB) activities to help developing countries improve labor and environment protections, meet export standards, and comply with phyto-sanitary rules. Various agencies, including USAID, MCC, Departments of Agriculture, Labor, and State, and the Trade and Development Agency, have TCB responsibilities. Congress has the power to set tariffs, which has been partially delegated to the President. Tariffs were historically used for government revenue collection, but today serve other purposes. The United States invests in Trade Capacity Building (TCB) activities to help developing countries improve labor and environment protections, meet export standards, and comply with phyto-sanitary rules. Congress has the power to set tariffs, which has been partially delegated to the President. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) administers the collection of tariffs at U.S. ports of entry. The United States has used tariffs to encourage global trade liberalization and reduce tariffs through trade negotiations and agreements since 1934. In 2016, CBP collected $32 billion in tariffs, which accounted for just 1% of total federal revenue. Since 1934, the United States has used tariffs to promote global trade liberalization and reduce tariffs through negotiations and agreements. By 2016, U.S. tariffs averaged 3.3%, the lowest among top global economies, with 70% of products entering duty-free. The Trump Administration has criticized low-tariff policies. The U.S. tariffs averaged 3.3%, the lowest among top global economies, with 70% of products entering duty-free. The Trump Administration has criticized low-tariff policies and increased tariffs on certain goods. U.S. trade laws include antidumping and countervailing duty laws to address unfair trade practices. The United States uses antidumping and countervailing duty laws to address unfair trade practices, administered by the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration and the U.S. International Trade Commission. Other trade remedy laws focus on import surges of fairly traded goods. The United States uses antidumping and countervailing duty laws to address unfair trade practices, administered by the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration and the U.S. International Trade Commission. Other trade remedy laws include Section 201, Section 301, and Section 337, which focus on import surges, violations of trade agreements, and patent/copyright infringements respectively. All laws must comply with U.S. WTO obligations. The United States uses antidumping and countervailing duty laws to address unfair trade practices, including import surges, violations of trade agreements, and patent/copyright infringements. These laws must comply with U.S. WTO obligations, such as the Antidumping Agreement, Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and the Agreement on Safeguards. Supporters argue that trade remedies are necessary to protect U.S. industries and workers, while others fear they may lead to disguised protectionism and inefficiencies in the global trading system. Antidumping (AD) is a commonly used U.S. trade remedy law that addresses unfair competition by penalizing exporters who sell goods at lower prices in one market than in others. Concerns exist about AD/CVD actions being seen as protectionism and causing inefficiencies in the global trading system. Antidumping (AD) measures penalize exporters who sell goods at lower prices in one market than in others to gain market share or eliminate overcapacity. U.S. law allows for AD duties when foreign goods are sold at \"less than fair value\" and cause injury to a U.S. industry. AD orders are subject to annual and sunset reviews. As of mid-December 2018, the U.S. had 354 AD orders in place. After AD laws, countervailing duty (CVD) is the most frequently used U.S. trade remedy law. CVD law aims to offset injurious competitive advantage foreign manufacturers might have over U.S. producers due to subsidies. Countervailing duties are designed to offset the net amount of the foreign subsidy. Countervailing duties (CVD) aim to offset competitive advantages foreign manufacturers may have over U.S. producers due to subsidies. CVD laws are designed to counteract foreign subsidies and are imposed on imports of subsidized goods into the United States. The U.S. had 113 CVD orders in place as of mid-December 2018, with nearly half directed at China. Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 authorizes the President to restrict CVDs. The United States had 113 CVD orders in place as of mid-December 2018, with nearly half against China. Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to restrict imports causing serious injury to domestic industry, without requiring allegations of unfair trade practices for safeguard investigations. The Trade Act of 1974 allows for safeguard investigations to provide relief to domestic industries facing import competition. The ITC conducts investigations based on petitions from trade associations, companies, or unions. If imports are found to cause serious injury, the ITC makes recommendations to the President for temporary relief. In 2017, two safeguard investigations were initiated under the Trump Administration. In 2017, two safeguard investigations were initiated under the Trump Administration. The President imposed safeguard measures on imports of solar cells and large residential washing machines in 2018. The ITC conducted 73 investigations from 1975 to 2001, with 19 cases resulting in safeguard measures imposed by the President. The ITC conducted 73 investigations from 1975 to 2001, with 19 cases resulting in safeguard measures imposed by the President under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. This section is known as the \"national security clause\" and allows the President to restrict imports that threaten national security. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the President to impose restrictions on imports that threaten national security. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security conducts investigations, consulting with the Secretary of Defense and other agencies. The President can impose tariffs, quotas, or other measures based on the findings to offset any adverse effects. This section has been invoked infrequently, with about 28 investigations conducted. In February 2018, Commerce completed two Section 232 investigations and found that U.S. steel and aluminum imports posed a national security threat. As a result, the President imposed a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports. Currently, investigations are ongoing for uranium imports and autos/auto parts under Section 232. The President imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in March 2018 to address national security concerns. The Administration is also investigating uranium, autos, and auto parts imports under Section 232. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the US to enforce trade agreements and respond to unfair barriers, such as inadequate protection of intellectual property rights. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 addresses unfair barriers to U.S. exports, specifically focusing on inadequate protection of intellectual property rights. It allows the USTR to initiate cases against foreign acts, policies, or practices that violate trade agreements or restrict U.S. commerce. Resolution involves seeking a negotiated settlement with the trading partner or using formal dispute settlement proceedings for trade agreement cases. The USTR addresses unfair barriers to U.S. exports under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, focusing on intellectual property rights protection. It seeks resolution through negotiation or formal dispute settlement proceedings, and may retaliate with tariffs if necessary. Additionally, the \"Special 301\" provision requires annual reporting on countries with inadequate IPR regimes. The USTR reports annually to Congress on countries with inadequate IPR regimes, issuing a three-tier list based on U.S. concern levels. A \"Priority Foreign Country\" designation indicates serious practices, leading to Section 301 investigations. Since 1974, 125 cases have been initiated, with retaliation in 16 instances. In 2017, an investigation was launched into China's IPR technology policies, and in March 2018, USTR found certain issues. In 1974, USTR initiated 125 Section 301 cases, retaliating in 16 instances. In 2017, a new investigation of China's IPR technology policies was launched. In March 2018, USTR found certain Chinese policies to be unreasonable or discriminatory. This led to increased tariffs on $250 billion worth of U.S. imports from China by the Trump Administration. China responded with tariffs on $110 billion worth of U.S. products. Both sides have pursued dispute cases at the WTO. China has responded to increased tariffs on $250 billion worth of U.S. imports by imposing tariffs on $110 billion worth of U.S. products. Both countries have pursued dispute cases at the WTO. In November 2018, USTR reported that China has not changed its unfair practices. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to start negotiations on IP, technology, and agriculture issues. At the 2018 G-20 Leaders' Summit, President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to start negotiations on \"structural changes\" regarding IP, technology, agriculture, and services within 90 days. China agreed to make significant purchases of U.S. products, while the U.S. agreed to suspend planned tariff increases from 10% to 25% on January 1, 2019, contingent on reaching an agreement. The United States agreed to suspend planned tariff increases from 10% to 25% on January 1, 2019, contingent on an agreement within 90 days. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits unfair acts in importing goods or selling imports in the U.S., including infringement of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and design rights. Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits imports that infringe U.S. patents, copyrights, trademarks, and design rights. The import or sale of infringing products is illegal without proof of injury, and the ITC handles investigations. If a violation is found, exclusion or cease-and-desist orders may be issued. As of 2018, there were 130 active Section 337 investigations.

While trade liberalization can benefit trade partners, it may create adjustment problems for workers and businesses facing import competition. TAA is justified for its role in facilitating economic efficiency, equity, and generating support for those impacted by trade liberalization. Justification for Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) includes arguments for economic efficiency, equity, and generating support for international trade. TAA skeptics argue that assistance is costly, reduces incentives to adjust to competition, and may not be equitable for all affected groups. The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program is debated for its cost and inefficiency, impact on worker and firm incentives, and lack of equity. Some argue that TAA programs are not extensive enough to be effective. Despite disagreements, Congress has maintained the program for over five decades.

International investment agreements (IIAs) establish binding rules on investment protections, serving as the primary vehicle for promoting investment. While WTO agreements address some investment issues, there are no comprehensive multilateral rules on investment. Jobs in specific companies and sectors can be affected when decisions are made to produce similar products abroad.
