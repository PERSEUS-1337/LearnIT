    "content": "The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) was established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to protect pensions of participants in private sector defined benefit plans. PBGC insures single-employer and multiemployer pension plans, providing a specified monthly benefit at retirement. Defined contribution plans like 401(k) are uninsured. PBGC insures single-employer and multiemployer pension plans separately. In FY2018, PBGC insured 25,000 DB pension plans for 37 million people and paid benefits to 1.4 million individuals. PBGC is the trustee of 4,919 single-employer plans and provided financial assistance to 78 multiemployer pensions. In FY2018, PBGC insured 25,000 DB pension plans for 37 million people and paid benefits to 1.4 million individuals. PBGC is the trustee of 4,919 single-employer plans and provided financial assistance to 78 multiemployer pensions. Among terminated multiemployer plans, 49% have benefits below the PBGC maximum guarantee and 51% have benefits larger than the guarantee. Among participants in terminated multiemployer plans likely to need financial assistance in the future, 49% have benefits below the PBGC maximum guarantee, while 51% have benefits larger than the guarantee. PBGC, a government-owned corporation, is administered by a three-member board of directors chaired by the Secretary of Labor, with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Treasury as other members. The Director of PBGC is appointed by the President with Senate approval, and ERISA also establishes a seven-member Advisory Committee appointed by the President for staggered three-year terms. The Director of PBGC is appointed by the President with Senate approval, and ERISA also establishes a seven-member Advisory Committee appointed by the President for staggered three-year terms. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141) altered some governance structures of PBGC, including setting the Director's term at five years and requiring the Board of Directors to meet at least four times. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141) made changes to the governance structures of PBGC, including setting the Director's term at five years, requiring the Board of Directors to meet at least four times a year, and establishing a Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate within PBGC. PBGC is self-supporting and does not receive appropriations from general revenue. PBGC is self-supporting and does not receive appropriations from general revenue. Its main source of revenue is premiums set by Congress and paid by private-sector employers sponsoring DB pension plans, along with assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from underfunded pension plans. Congressional reluctance exists towards providing financial assistance to PBGC. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is funded by premiums paid by private-sector employers sponsoring DB pension plans, assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from underfunded plans. PBGC's receipts and disbursements are included in federal budget totals as required by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980. Premiums paid by sponsors of single-employer and multiemployer pension plans vary, with additional premiums for underfunded single-employer plans based on the amount of underfunding. The sponsors of single-employer and multiemployer pension plans pay various premiums to PBGC. Single-employer plans pay a flat-rate per-participant premium, with underfunded plans paying an additional premium based on underfunding. Terminated plans pay a per-participant premium for three years post-termination. In 2019, single-employer plans pay an annual flat-rate premium of $80 per participant, with underfunded plans paying an additional variable-rate premium. The sponsors of single-employer DB pension plans pay various premiums to PBGC. This includes a flat-rate premium of $80 per participant, an additional variable-rate premium for underfunded plans, and a termination premium of $1,250 per participant per year for three years post-termination. Multiemployer plans also pay a flat-rate premium. The sponsors of single-employer DB pension plans pay a termination premium of $1,250 per participant per year for three years following plan termination. Multiemployer plans pay a flat-rate premium of $29 per participant in 2019. PBGC only covers DB plans that meet qualification requirements of Section 401 of the IRC. DC plans like 401(k) and 403(b) plans are not insured by PBGC. PBGC covers only DB plans meeting IRC Section 401 requirements for tax benefits. DC plans like 401(k) are not insured. Contributions are tax-deductible, and income is taxed when received. Pension plans are tax-deductible business expenses with contributions and earnings not taxed. When participants receive income, it is taxed as ordinary income. Plans must meet specific requirements to be qualified under the IRC. The PBGC insures pension plans that meet certain requirements, excluding governmental, church, and certain professional plans. Single-employer and multiemployer programs are operated separately with distinct reserve funds. PBGC operates single-employer and multiemployer insurance programs separately with distinct reserve funds. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes trustee of terminated underfunded plans, while in the multiemployer program, PBGC provides loans to plans. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes the trustee of terminated underfunded plans, while in the multiemployer program, PBGC provides loans to insolvent plans. An employer can voluntarily terminate a single-employer plan, and PBGC may involuntarily terminate an underfunded plan if the sponsor cannot meet pension obligations. An employer can voluntarily terminate a single-employer plan in either a standard or distress termination. PBGC may involuntarily terminate an underfunded plan if the sponsor is unable to fund its pension obligations. A company may end its pension plan if the plan's assets cover benefit liabilities. PBGC confirms termination requirements are met but does not pay benefits to participants. Benefit liabilities include all earned benefits, vested and nonvested. The role of PBGC is to confirm termination requirements for a pension plan. Benefit liabilities include all earned benefits, vested and nonvested, early retirement supplements, and subsidies. Assets must cover benefit liabilities for the plan to distribute benefits to participants through annuity contracts or other means. The plan distributes benefits to participants by purchasing annuity contracts or providing lump-sum distributions. Assets exceeding benefit liabilities may be recovered by the employer through an asset reversion, subject to a nondeductible excise tax of 20%. Liabilities can be recovered by the employer through an asset reversion, subject to a 20% excise tax if certain conditions are met. If the plan terminates in distress, PBGC takes over as trustee and assumes responsibility for liabilities, making payments with plan assets. In distress or involuntary termination, the plan goes into PBGC receivership. PBGC becomes the trustee, takes control of plan assets, and pays benefit liabilities from recovered assets and PBGC's funds. Employer can only terminate plan in distress if specific criteria are met. In distress terminations, the employer can only terminate the plan if specific criteria are met, such as filing for bankruptcy or similar insolvency proceedings. The PBGC pays benefits to beneficiaries from its revolving funds in these cases. The employer can terminate the plan in distress situations by meeting specific criteria, such as filing for bankruptcy or similar insolvency proceedings. PBGC may determine termination is necessary to allow the employer to pay its debts or avoid burdensome pension costs. The Single Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1986 (SEPPAA) and subsequent acts added requirements for plan termination in distress situations, ensuring that underfunded plan liabilities remain the responsibility of the employer unless specific criteria are met. The Single Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1986 (SEPPAA) and subsequent acts, such as the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 and the Retirement Protection Act of 1994, ensure that underfunded plan liabilities remain the responsibility of the employer unless specific criteria are met. PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if it has not met minimum funding standards and will be unable to pay benefits when due. PBGC may terminate a plan either by agreement with the plan sponsor or pursuant to a federal court order if the plan has not met minimum funding standards, will be unable to pay benefits when due, has a substantial owner who received a distribution over $10,000, or if the long-run loss to PBGC is expected to increase unreasonably. A federal court may also order plan termination to protect participants' interests and avoid unreasonable deterioration. The PBGC may terminate a plan if it cannot pay benefits when due or if there is a risk of unreasonable increase in PBGC's liability. A federal court can also order termination to protect participants' interests. PBGC became trustee of 4,769 single-employer DB pension plans from FY1974 to FY2016. Since 1974, PBGC became trustee of 4,769 single-employer DB pension plans due to terminations. Most terminations are standard, but following distress or involuntary termination, the plan sponsor and their controlled group are liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall. Following distress or involuntary termination, the plan sponsor and their controlled group are jointly and severally liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall. The shortfall is calculated as the plan's liabilities minus its assets at the termination date. Payment is typically required in cash or negotiable securities on the termination date, and failure to do so may result in a lien on the employer's property. Following distress or involuntary termination, the plan sponsor and their controlled group are jointly and severally liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall, which must be paid in cash or negotiable securities. Failure to pay may result in a lien on the employer's property. If the plan sponsor is in bankruptcy, PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited. PBGC's benefits upon plan termination depend on the statutory limit on guaranteed benefits. When an underfunded plan terminates, PBGC's ability to recover assets is limited as it has the same legal standing as other creditors of the plan sponsor. The benefits PBGC will pay depend on the statutory limit on guaranteed benefits, the terminated plan's assets, and recoveries from the employer. PBGC guarantees retirement benefits that were vested on the termination date, excluding benefits that vest solely due to termination, as well as death, survivor, or disability benefits owed or in payment status at termination. PBGC guarantees retirement benefits that were nonforfeitable on the date of plan termination, excluding benefits that vest solely due to termination. It also guarantees death, survivor, or disability benefits that were owed or in payment status at the date of plan termination. Only monthly installment retirement benefits are guaranteed, and benefits starting before the plan's normal retirement age are covered if they meet other guarantee conditions. Contingent benefits are guaranteed only under certain conditions. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) guarantees retirement benefits that were nonforfeitable on the date of plan termination, excluding benefits that vest solely due to termination. It also guarantees death, survivor, or disability benefits that were owed or in payment status at the date of plan termination. Only monthly installment retirement benefits are guaranteed, and benefits starting before the plan's normal retirement age are covered if they meet other guarantee conditions. Contingent benefits are guaranteed only under certain conditions, with a maximum benefit amount set by ERISA for single-employer pension plans. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) guarantees retirement benefits that were nonforfeitable on the date of plan termination, excluding benefits that vest solely due to termination. It also guarantees death, survivor, or disability benefits that were owed or in payment status at the date of plan termination. The maximum pension guarantee is $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans that terminate in 2019, adjusted annually for national wage growth. This amount decreases if a participant begins receiving the benefit before age 65 or if the pension plan provides benefits in a form other than equal monthly payments for life. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) guarantees retirement benefits that were nonforfeitable on the date of plan termination. The maximum pension guarantee is $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans that terminate in 2019, adjusted annually for national wage growth. Benefits are decreased if received before age 65 or in a form other than equal monthly payments for life. Benefits increase if received after age 65. Table 3 shows examples of PBGC's annual maximum benefit for different ages and annuity types. Table 3 provides examples of PBGC's annual maximum benefit for individuals starting benefits at ages 60, 65, or 70 with different annuity options. The reduction in the maximum guarantee for benefits paid before age 65 is 7% for the first 5 years, 4% for the next 5 years, and 2% for the following 10 years. Reductions for benefits in forms other than straight-life annuity depend on the type of benefit and survivor's benefit percentage. The PBGC guarantees basic benefits for retirees starting at normal retirement age, certain early retirement and disability benefits, and benefits for survivors of deceased plan participants. Only vested benefits are insured, with an average monthly benefit of $606 in FY2015. A study in 2008 showed that over 80% of PBGC recipients in single-employer plans received benefits. In FY2015, PBGC insured retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for plan participants. The average monthly benefit for retirees was $606. A 2008 study found that over 80% of PBGC recipients in single-employer plans received their full benefits, with an average reduction of 28% for those whose benefits were reduced. Terminated plan assets are allocated to pay benefits based on a priority schedule, with some nonguaranteed benefits paid before guaranteed benefits. In FY2015, PBGC insured retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for plan participants. Benefits are allocated based on a priority schedule, with some nonguaranteed benefits paid before guaranteed benefits. PBGC also pays a portion of unfunded, nonguaranteed benefits based on assets recovered from the employer. In multiemployer plans, PBGC insures plan insolvency rather than termination. PBGC pays a portion of unfunded, nonguaranteed benefits based on assets recovered from the employer. In multiemployer plans, PBGC insures plan insolvency rather than termination. PBGC may provide loans to a plan when it is unable to pay benefits, with the loans rarely being repaid. If the plan recovers, it must repay the loans on reasonable terms. Only one multiemployer plan has repaid any of its loans. PBGC may provide loans to multiemployer plans, which are rarely repaid. If a plan recovers, it must repay the loans on reasonable terms. Only one multiemployer plan has repaid any financial assistance. PBGC guarantees benefits to multiemployer plans with a different guarantee ceiling than single-employer plans. Benefits are determined by multiplying a flat dollar rate by years of service, tying the benefit guarantee ceiling to this formula. The benefit guarantee limit for participants in multiemployer plans is based on years of service multiplied by 100%. PBGC estimated in 2015 that 79% of participants in multiemployer plans that receive financial assistance received their full benefit, with a guaranteed limit of $12,870 for a participant with 30 years of service. This benefit formula is not adjusted for increases in the national wage index. PBGC estimated in 2015 that 79% of participants in multiemployer plans receiving financial assistance got their full benefit, with a $12,870 limit. In plans needing future assistance, only 49% would receive full benefits. Ongoing plans have almost double the average benefit compared to terminated plans, indicating potential benefit reductions for participants in plans requiring future PBGC assistance. The PBGC's net financial position at the end of FY2018 was -$51.4 billion, with assets of $112.3 billion and liabilities of $163.7 billion. Plans receiving PBGC financial assistance may see benefit reductions due to the PBGC maximum guarantee level. PBGC's assets at the end of FY2018 were $112.3 billion, liabilities were $163.7 billion, resulting in a net financial position of -$51.4 billion. The trust fund and revolving funds are PBGC's main assets, while future benefit payments in the single-employer program are its main liabilities. PBGC's main assets include the trust fund and revolving funds, while its main liabilities are future benefit payments in the single-employer program and financial assistance to insolvent plans in the multiemployer program. PBGC has had a deficit at the end of each fiscal year since FY2002, attributed to large plan terminations in industries like steel and airlines in 2001. Since FY2002, PBGC has consistently had year-end deficits due to costly plan terminations in industries like steel and airlines. By the end of 2004, the single-employer program had a $23.3 billion deficit. However, in FY2018, the program showed a surplus for the first time since FY2001, partly due to increased employer premiums. The multiemployer program had surpluses from FY1982 to FY2002 but has reported deficits since then. PBGC projects that the multiemployer program may become insolvent by FY2025 with less than a 1% chance of survival. The PBGC program had a surplus in FY2018, the first time since FY2001, due to increased employer premiums. The multiemployer program had surpluses from FY1982 to FY2002 but has reported deficits since then. PBGC projects that the multiemployer program may become insolvent by FY2025 with less than a 1% chance of survival. Approximately 825,000 participants received monthly payments from PBGC in FY2015, with an average monthly payment of $536 and a median monthly payment of $279. Table 5 shows that around 825,000 participants received monthly payments from PBGC in FY2015, with an average monthly payment of $536. Among retiree payees, the average monthly benefit was $606, and among beneficiary payees, it was $307. Approximately 40,000 participants received a lump-sum payment in FY2015, with an average amount of $2,054. Figure 1 displays the net financial position of PBGC's single-employer program from FY1980 to FY2018, showing a surplus in FY1996 for the first time in history. In FY2015, around 40,000 participants received a lump-sum payment with an average amount of $2,054. The net financial position of PBGC's single-employer program showed a surplus of $2.44 billion in FY2018, attributed to factors like investment income and increased premium income. The PBGC's single-employer program showed a surplus of $2.44 billion in FY2018 due to factors like investment income and increased premium income. In FY2018, 78 multiemployer plans received financial assistance, benefiting approximately 62,300 participants. The financial assistance provided to multiemployer plans increased from FY1995 to FY2018. In FY2018, 78 plans received assistance, benefiting around 62,300 participants. The deficit in the multiemployer insurance program worsened from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $65.1 billion in FY2017, decreasing to $53.8 billion in FY2018. The deficit in the multiemployer insurance program increased significantly from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $65.1 billion in FY2017, before decreasing to $53.8 billion in FY2018. This rise was due to the likelihood of insolvency in several distressed pension plans. PBGC's budget relies on premium and interest income, benefit outlays, and fund interactions. The PBGC's budget flows are based on premium income, interest income, benefit outlays, and fund interactions. Trust funds hold pension plan assets, while revolving funds contain premiums and transfers for benefits. Transfers to the trust fund are nonbudgetary and do not appear in the federal budget. The PBGC becomes trustee of terminated pension plans, transferring assets to a nonbudgetary trust fund managed by private-sector money managers. The trust fund's assets are not included in the federal budget or balance sheet, with investments totaling $70.2 billion in FY2018. The investment policy allocates 30% to equities and 70% to fixed income assets. The PBGC's investment policy allocates 30% to equities and 70% to fixed income assets, with trust fund investments totaling $70.2 billion at the end of FY2018. ERISA authorized seven revolving funds for PBGC, but only three have been used. Revolving funds contain premiums, returns on investments, and transfers from the trust fund to pay benefits. Each year, funds are transferred from the trust fund to revolving funds for participants' benefits. The PBGC transfers funds from the trust fund to revolving funds to pay for participants' benefits. The revolving funds' assets at the end of FY2018 were $33.2 billion, invested exclusively in U.S. Treasury securities. Increases or decreases in the revolving funds appear as on-budget federal receipts and outlays. The PBGC has $2.1 billion in Fund 2 and $29.3 billion in Fund 7, totaling $33.2 billion in revolving funds. These funds are on-budget accounts, with increases or decreases reflected in federal receipts and outlays. Gross outlays include benefit payments and administrative expenses, while receipts consist of premiums, interest on securities, and trust fund reimbursements. Some stakeholders criticize premium increases, arguing they are used to offset federal spending rather than improving PBGC's financial condition. Some stakeholders and policymakers criticize PBGC premium increases, feeling they are used to offset federal spending rather than improving PBGC's financial condition. PBGC projected deficits in its single-employer and multiemployer programs, with the latter expected to run out of money by FY2025. The single-employer program was projected to emerge from deficit by FY2018. The report projected a $26 billion surplus for the single-employer program in 10 years, with a 90% chance of the multiemployer program becoming insolvent before FY2025 and a 99% chance by 2026 due to the likely insolvency of large pension plans. The PBGC's FY2018 Annual Report projected a $53.8 billion exposure for the multiemployer program, indicating a high likelihood of insolvency for several large pension plans. Premium levels may not be sufficient to provide ongoing financial assistance, potentially leading to the exhaustion of PBGC's ability to guarantee benefits. Once resources are depleted, insolvent plans may need to reduce benefits to sustainable levels. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows insolvent plans to reduce benefits to sustainable levels without needing financial assistance from PBGC. Insolvent plans have no assets to pay benefits, and reducing benefits can help prevent the need for PBGC assistance. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows insolvent plans to reduce benefits to prevent the need for PBGC assistance, improving PBGC's financial condition. There is uncertainty in how benefit suspensions and plan partitions will be used, but it is estimated that MPRA will not change PBGC's future solvency projections. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created a Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans to address concerns of policymakers and stakeholders regarding the provisions of the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act. The Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans was tasked with improving pension plan solvency and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. However, they did not release recommendations or legislative language by the deadline. Historical data on single-employer and multiemployer program premium levels is provided in tables A-1 and A-2."
