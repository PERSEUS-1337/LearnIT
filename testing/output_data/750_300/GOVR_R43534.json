    "content": "In 1978, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to address electronic surveillance abuses by the executive branch. FISA established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review government applications for electronic surveillance. Concerns arose in 2013 about the FISC's orders, leading to proposals to amend FISA or the FISC's practices. Many proposals have been introduced to amend the process for selecting judges on the FISA courts, aiming to address concerns about the FISC's orders and the executive branch's intelligence gathering practices. Federal judges presiding over Article III courts have life tenure. The judicial power in the United States includes rendering final judgments in cases and controversies. Federal judges in Article III courts have life tenure and their salaries cannot be reduced during their terms. The purpose is to ensure independence from political interference for an impartial administration of laws. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) was established by Congress under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) as an Article III court authorized to issue orders. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) operates independently to ensure impartial administration of laws. Established under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), FISC can issue orders for foreign intelligence investigations, including electronic surveillance and access to business records. FISA also created the FISA Court of Review to review FISC denials. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) established the FISA Court of Review to review denials by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). The FISC is composed of 11 district court judges serving seven-year terms, selected from at least seven regional judicial circuits. The FISA Court of Review consists of three judges. The FISA Court of Review consists of three judges selected from district or circuit courts. Criticisms have been raised about the selection process being too partisan and solely controlled by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Bills in the 113th Congress aim to change the selection process. Several bills in the 113th Congress aim to change the process for selecting FISA judges, with proposals including transferring selection authority to chief judges of circuit courts, authorizing the President to choose FISA judges with Senate advice and consent, or placing selection authority with congressional leadership. The 113th Congress has proposed bills to change the process for selecting FISA judges, including transferring selection authority to chief judges of circuit courts, authorizing the President to choose FISA judges with Senate advice and consent, or placing selection authority with congressional leadership. The main issue raised is the constitutionality of designating judges by a specific branch of government, with concerns expressed by the judicial branch in January 2014. The judicial branch expressed concern in January 2014 about proposals to change the selection process for FISA judges, including shifting authority away from the Chief Justice. The report discusses the constitutional method for appointing Article III judges, the process of \"designation\" by Congress, and how a reviewing court might assess the constitutionality of proposals to shift designation authority to other officials within the branches of government. The report discusses proposals to shift designation authority for appointing Article III judges away from the Chief Justice to other officials in the branches of government. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution outlines the process for appointing principal officers, including judges of the Supreme Court, who must be appointed by the President with Senate approval. The Supreme Court has also deemed all other Article III judges as principal officers. The Supreme Court has ruled that judges of the Supreme Court and other Article III judges are principal officers who must be appointed by the President with Senate approval. If Congress expands the duties of an office requiring constitutional appointment, a second appointment may not be necessary for the incumbent. The Supreme Court has ruled that judges of the Supreme Court and other Article III judges are principal officers who must be appointed by the President with Senate approval. If Congress expands the duties of an office requiring constitutional appointment, a second appointment may not be necessary for the incumbent, as seen in Weiss v. United States where military officers could serve on a military court without a second appointment. The Weiss Court reaffirmed that Congress can increase the duties of an existing office without requiring a second appointment, as long as the new duties are related to the original position. This principle, established in Shoemaker v. United States, allows for the designation of federal judges to serve in separate but related capacities without violating the Appointments Clause. The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of designating federal judges to serve in related Article III capacities, citing Congress's long history of using designations for Article III courts. The Chief Justice has been given authority to temporarily assign federal judges to other federal courts, including specialized tribunals. The creation of the now-defunct Commerce Court is an early example of this practice. The Chief Justice has authority to designate federal judges to serve on other federal courts, including specialized tribunals. The now-defunct Commerce Court was one of the earliest instances where this authority was used. The Chief Justice-based designation process for the Commerce Court became a model for future specialized courts. The Chief Justice has authority to designate federal judges to serve on other federal courts, including specialized tribunals. This process became a model for future specialized courts, with Congress also granting lower federal court judges designation authority. The Supreme Court has upheld designations within the judicial branch, as seen in McDowell v. United States. In McDowell v. United States, the Supreme Court upheld the power of Congress to designate one District Judge to temporarily discharge duties in another district, stating it involves statutory construction and does not infringe on executive appointment powers. District Courts are created by statute and under the control of Congress. The Supreme Court upheld Congress's power to designate district judges in McDowell v. United States, stating it does not infringe on executive appointment powers. Courts have also dismissed constitutional challenges to the Chief Justice's designation authority for district court judges. The Court rejected the defendant's argument that the FISA judges' designation violated the Appointments Clause, citing previous cases that upheld the constitutionality of the process. The Ninth Circuit also rejected a similar argument, stating that judges designated by the Chief Justice do not violate the Appointments Clause. The FISC violates the Appointments Clause as judges are designated by the Chief Justice, not appointed by the President with Senate confirmation. The Ninth Circuit found this argument foreclosed by Lamar v. United States, which upheld the temporary assignment of district court judges by the Chief Justice. District courts have also upheld the FISA designation process, noting that FISA judges are not distinguishable from other federal judges designated to serve on specialized courts. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act (S. 1460) would maintain designation authority within the judicial branch but disperse the selection process for the FISC among the 13 chief judges of the circuit courts. The central issue raised by proposals to alter who selects FISA judges is whether designation by certain individuals within the branches of government would be constitutionally permissible. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act (S. 1460) proposes dispersing the selection process for the FISC among the 13 chief judges of the circuit courts, increasing the number of FISC judges from 11 to 13. The Chief Justice would designate the district court judge proposed by the chief judge of the circuit with a vacancy. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act (S. 1460) proposes involving chief judges of circuit courts in selecting FISC judges. The Chief Justice would designate a district court judge proposed by the chief judge of the circuit with a vacancy. At least five Supreme Court associate justices must concur in the Chief Justice's designation for the FISA Court of Review. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act proposes involving chief judges of circuit courts in selecting FISC judges. The Chief Justice would designate a district court judge proposed by the chief judge of the circuit with a vacancy. At least five Supreme Court associate justices must concur in the Chief Justice's designation for the FISA Court of Review. Justices of the Supreme Court would have a role in the designation process, but the Chief Justice would make the final decision. Limited judicial precedent suggests that authorizing others in the judicial branch to designate FISA judges could be constitutional. The McDowell Court suggested that Congress has the power to determine how and where a judge may exercise jurisdiction, including allowing one District Judge to temporarily discharge duties in another district. This principle is based on Congress's authority to establish courts and the lack of constitutional restrictions on a District Judge's territorial limits. Based on Congress's power to establish courts and the absence of constitutional restrictions on a District Judge's territorial limits, a reviewing court may find that nothing prevents Congress from giving chief judges broad authority to designate judges within their circuits to serve on FISA courts. However, the McDowell ruling was based on an 1871 statute that may not align with modern statutes limiting chief judges' designation authority. Congress has consistently regulated chief judges in this manner, suggesting a reviewing court could find this practice permissible. The McDowell ruling was based on an 1871 statute that may not align with modern statutes limiting chief judges' designation authority. Congress has consistently regulated chief judges in this manner, suggesting a reviewing court could find this practice permissible. Other proposals would shift authority to designate FISA court judges to the President, such as the Presidential Appointment of FISA Court Judges Act (H.R. 2761). The Presidential Appointment of FISA Court Judges Act (H.R. 2761) would authorize the President to \"designate\" judges for the FISC and FISA Court of Review, potentially constituting a second constitutional appointment. This arrangement would comply with the Appointments Clause but could raise questions about the FISA courts' status as Article III courts. A separate constitutional appointment for FISA judges could raise questions about their status as Article III courts. While Article III judges have life tenure, FISA judges serve seven-year terms. However, precedent suggests that life tenure protects a judge's overall position on the federal judiciary, not the specific court they are appointed to. Just as judges on special panels for a limited time do not lose their Article III status, a reviewing court could likely interpret the same for FISA judges. Tenure protects a judge's overall position on the federal judiciary, not the specific court they are appointed to. A proposal to allow the President to select existing federal judges for FISA courts could raise separation-of-powers concerns. The proposal to allow the President to select existing federal judges for FISA courts could raise separation-of-powers concerns, as it may constitute executive encroachment upon the judiciary's province. However, Mistretta v. United States established that the President can appoint judges to the U.S. Sentencing Commission without violating the separation-of-powers doctrine. The Mistretta v. United States case determined that the President can appoint judges to the U.S. Sentencing Commission within the judicial branch without violating the separation-of-powers doctrine. The President's power is limited in removing judges from the commission, and he cannot influence Article III judges' tenure, compensation, or coerce them in their judicial duties. This ruling suggests that the President may not have the authority to remove a federal judge from serving on the FISA courts before the end of their term. The President's power to appoint judges to the U.S. Sentencing Commission was upheld in Mistretta v. United States, with limitations on removal and influence over Article III judges. However, concerns may arise if the President alone selects FISA judges, as they exercise judicial powers on an Article III court. The selection of FISA judges by the President alone may raise separation-of-powers concerns if the President's power to remove judges could compromise their impartiality. Proposals suggest vesting designation authority with congressional leadership, as seen in the FISA Court Accountability Act (H.R. 2586). The FISA Court Accountability Act (H.R. 2586) proposes vesting designation authority with congressional leadership for FISC and FISA Court of Review appointments, which may raise separation-of-powers concerns under the Appointments Clause. Congress has authority to select individuals for entities aiding in legislative functions, but cannot directly appoint individuals with significant authority under the Appointments Clause. Congressional designations may raise legal concerns under principles from I.N.S. v. Chadha, requiring compliance with bicameralism and presentment requirements of the Constitution. Congressional designations made to the judiciary by the leadership of each house must comply with the bicameralism and presentment requirements of the Constitution, as established in Chadha."
