    "content": "This report, General Management Laws: Major Themes and Management Policy Options, is a companion to CRS Report RL30795, General Management Laws: A Compendium. The reports aim to identify and describe major general management laws for the executive branch, assist Congress in overseeing executive branch management, and help in considering potential changes to management laws and other legislation. The compendium includes profiles of selected general management laws. The compendium in the report contains profiles of selected \"general management laws\" that regulate the activities of executive branch agencies. These laws are crucial for maintaining accountability to Congress, the President, and the public, and influence the effectiveness of federal agencies in implementing and evaluating public policies. The report focuses on major themes and management policy options for Congress related to general management laws, which are crucial for maintaining accountability of the executive branch to Congress, the President, and the public. These laws also impact the effectiveness of federal agencies in implementing and evaluating public policies. The compendium includes over 90 entries describing general management laws for the executive branch, organized into seven functional categories. It reflects the status of these laws at the end of the first session of the 108th Congress and will be updated to include actions taken through the close of the Congress. The compendium contains over 90 entries of general management laws for the executive branch, categorized into seven functional areas. These include Information and Regulatory Management, Strategic Planning, Performance Measurement, Financial Management, Organization, Procurement and Real Property Management, Intergovernmental Relations Management, and Human Resources Management and Ethics. Functions in management refer to specific business areas requiring related skills and tasks. The compendium contains over 90 entries of general management laws for the executive branch, categorized into seven functional areas. These include Information and Regulatory Management, Strategic Planning, Performance Measurement, Financial Management, Organization, Procurement and Real Property Management, Intergovernmental Relations Management, and Human Resources Management and Ethics. Most entries profile specific laws, presented according to their codification in Title 5 of the United States Code. Each entry includes a brief history of the law. The compendium presents civil service laws from Title 5 of the United States Code, with brief histories, major provisions, key developments, and source readings. This report provides historical background on Congress and the President's roles in managing the executive branch, and discusses management in public and private sectors. The report provides historical background on the roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch. It also discusses the comparison of management in public and private sectors. The report analyzes major themes in general management laws and explores potential policy options for management. Scholars debate the constitutional roles of the President and Congress in managing federal agencies. The roles of Congress and the President in managing the executive branch have been debated by scholars. The U.S. Constitution established a system of separated powers and checks and balances, with both branches having a role in managing federal agencies. Justice Robert Jackson highlighted the integration of dispersed powers to secure liberty. The Constitution established separated powers and checks and balances, with Congress and the President sharing power in managing the executive branch. Justice Robert Jackson emphasized the integration of dispersed powers for securing liberty. Congress has the authority to establish administrative agencies and determine their operations. The Constitution established separated powers and checks and balances, with Congress and the President sharing power in managing the executive branch. Congress has the authority to establish administrative agencies and determine their operations. The Constitution grants Congress the power to make laws necessary for executing its powers, while also giving the President authority to manage the executive branch and ensure laws are faithfully executed. This power is limited, with the President's duty being to ensure officials follow Congress's instructions. Section 3 of the Constitution states that the President must ensure laws are faithfully executed, but this power is limited. The President's duty is to ensure officials obey Congress's instructions, and the 'take Care' clause in Article II does not grant unlimited power to frustrate congressional intention. Article II only explicitly mentions executive departments in two instances, stating the President may require written opinions from department heads on matters relating to their duties and outlining the President's appointment authority. In September 1789, Congress enacted laws establishing the Treasury Department and setting annual salaries for Secretaries of the Departments of the Treasury, State, and War. The President can require written opinions from department heads on matters related to their duties and has appointment powers over department heads. In September 1789, Congress established the Treasury Department and set annual salaries for Secretaries of the Departments of the Treasury, State, and War. The federal government's financial management system was also outlined, including provisions for warrants, accounts, and audits. By the end of the 18th century, only these three departments, the Navy Department, the office of Attorney General, and the Post Office had been created. Elected officials faced challenges in administering the growing nation, with the Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, playing a significant role. After the nation's founding, elected officials faced challenges in administering the growing federal government. The Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton, established an administrative system with an independent chief executive, effective delegation of authority, and a fiscal system. The Democratic-Republicans, under Thomas Jefferson, largely accepted this framework after coming to power in 1801. After coming to power in 1801, the Democratic-Republicans, led by Thomas Jefferson, accepted the Federalist framework for government administration. Congress became more involved in the administrative system, as the country grew in size and population. By the late 1820s, both Presidents and department heads were overwhelmed with official work, but failed to delegate or provide administrative assistants. By the late 1820s, the country was growing in size and population, leading to an increase in federal employment from 4,837 employees in 1816 to 36,672 in 1861. The structure of executive departments also became more complex over time. The structure of executive departments became more complex over time, with departments in 1860 consisting of the Secretary, bureaus handling routine business, and a field service. Post-Civil War developments such as industrialization and the Progressive Movement further impacted the government. The rise of the administrative state after the Civil War led to significant challenges in managing the executive branch. By 1946, Congress had delegated much of its legislative authority to administrative agencies, shifting policy-making and budgeting initiatives to the executive branch. By 1946, Congress had delegated legislative authority to administrative agencies, leading to challenges in managing the executive branch. Observers noted that agencies sometimes exercised legislative powers, prompting Congress to expand general management practices to improve executive branch management. Observers noted that agencies sometimes exercised legislative powers, prompting Congress to expand general management laws to improve executive branch management. This included legislation such as the Administrative Procedure Act (1946), the Freedom of Information Act (1966), and the Federal Advisory Committee Act (1972) to increase transparency and oversight. Congress further enhanced transparency and oversight of the executive branch by passing additional legislation, including the establishment of inspectors general in 1978 and the Congressional Review of Regulations Act. Additionally, Congress aimed to reassert influence over the budget process with the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act in 1974. The Government Performance and Results Act (1993) and the Chief Financial Officers Act (1990) were passed by Congress to improve oversight and financial management in agencies. These laws, along with others, were part of legislative actions to bring disciplined management to agencies. The compendium's more than 90 entries illustrate the debate over general management laws - are they necessary for disciplined management or do they stifle flexibility? The conclusion likely depends on the viewpoint of the questioner and the situation at hand. The debate over general management laws revolves around whether they narrow agency discretion or help motivate changes in agency behaviors. Scholars and practitioners question the extent to which management practices in the public and private sectors can be compared. Numerous controversial issues remain for Congress to consider. Scholars and practitioners debate the comparison of management practices in public and private sectors. They see similarities but also emphasize the need to recognize key differences. Caution is recommended before applying private-sector management principles to government agencies. Management and public administration scholars caution against applying private-sector management principles to government agencies, citing key differences in their operating environments and legal frameworks. Public administration scholar Wallace Sayre famously stated that \"public and private management are fundamentally alike in all unimportant respects.\" One significant difference between public-sector agencies and private-sector companies is the distinct legal frameworks they operate under. Public-sector agencies are governed by laws that regulate their behavior and grant them coercive power, while private-sector companies operate under different laws. The Constitution establishes checks and balances to prevent the arbitrary exercise of government power, ensuring that federal government agencies act within the authority provided by public law. The Constitution establishes checks and balances for federal government agencies, ensuring they act within public law authority. Public-sector agencies operate under laws regulating their behavior, while private companies follow laws that create a functioning market economy. Laws for agencies authorize their mission and operations, while laws for companies generally do not prescribe their actions. Private sector companies operate under laws that regulate a functioning market economy, such as antitrust and financial reporting laws. These laws do not dictate the company's actions or operations, with the company being primarily accountable to its owners or shareholders. Differences between government agencies and private sector organizations include restrictions on retaining earnings for private benefit and allocating resources. Government agencies differ from private sector organizations in that they cannot retain earnings for private benefit, allocate resources according to their preferences, or choose their own goals. Control over revenues, resources, and goals is largely in the hands of external entities like legislatures, courts, politicians, and interest groups, requiring agency managers to consider their demands. Government agencies must consider the demands of external entities such as legislatures, courts, politicians, and interest groups, as they have control over revenues, resources, and goals. The difficulty in measuring agency performance and differences between public and private sector management practices raise public policy issues for general management laws and specific agencies. The differences between management practices in the public and private sectors raise public policy issues for general management laws and specific agencies. The compendium of general management laws may prompt questions about how much discretion Congress should leave for the executive branch. The debate over how much discretion to give the executive branch in implementing general management laws has been a longstanding issue for Congress. Giving flexibility to agencies allows for tailored implementation of laws, but the extent of this discretion is heavily debated. The debate over giving discretion to the executive branch in implementing laws has been ongoing. Some argue it allows for flexibility and quick responsiveness, especially in scientific or technical matters. However, others are concerned about the potential drawbacks of excessive discretion. Many argue that executive discretion allows for quicker decision-making in scientific or technical matters, even if it goes against Congress or key stakeholders' views. This can lead to actions that may not have been supported during the legislative process. During the legislative process, the President's or an agency's differing views from Congress and stakeholders can lead to actions without timely intervention. Granting executive discretion can place key decisions in the hands of unelected officials, raising concerns about transparency and accountability. Congress grappled with this tension in 2002 and 2003 regarding flexibility and accountability in general management laws. The tension between flexibility and accountability in general management laws was evident in Congress in 2002 and 2003 when considering granting discretion to DHS and DOD for their HRM systems. Similar situations arose in 1993 with the NPR and FASA. In 1993, the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review recommended ways to streamline procurement policy, leading to the passage of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994. Scholars have identified four options for Congress to address delegation situations and balance flexibility with accountability in regulatory matters. Congress can address delegation situations by using contract design to set conditions for authority delegation, ensuring its intentions are carried out by the executive branch and reducing the risk of adverse consequences. This can include establishing goals, sanctions, probation periods, sunsets, pilot projects, or profit-sharing relationships to incentivize agencies to benefit both the agency and the government as a whole. Congress can address delegation situations by using contract design to set conditions for authority delegation, ensuring its intentions are carried out by the executive branch and reducing the risk of adverse consequences. This can include establishing goals, sanctions, probation periods, pilot projects, or profit-sharing relationships to incentivize agencies to benefit both the agency and the government as a whole. Screening and selection mechanisms can also be implemented to avoid poor performance by agencies. To avoid poor performance by agencies, Congress can use screening and selection mechanisms to assess an agency's capacity and management skills before delegating authority. This can involve convening hearings to analyze the agency's problem-solving abilities and organizational capacity. Additionally, Congress can increase accountability by requiring agencies to report on their activities and programs. To increase accountability and transparency, Congress can require agencies to report their actions, milestones, and obtained information. Information technology and the Web enable real-time and frequent updates for monitoring agency actions. The advent of information technology and the Web allows for real-time reporting of agency actions, making it easier for Congress and stakeholders to access information. Institutional checks, such as involving additional agencies in decision-making, can help ensure accountability when authority is delegated to an agency. When authority is delegated to an agency, Congress can involve other agencies to veto or block actions, ensuring accountability. This can be done through joint regulation promulgation, notice and comment requirements, sequential funding with conditions, independent studies, or committee vetoes. The tension between standardization and customization of management laws for agencies frequently arises for Congress. Should laws be standardized or agency-specific, or a mix of both approaches? The tension between standardization and customization of management laws for agencies is a frequent issue for Congress. Standardization can improve transparency and accountability in the executive branch, as seen in the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946. Standardization in the executive branch, such as through the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946, can enhance transparency and accountability. The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 and the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 mandated audited financial statements for major agencies, promoting accountability. The CFO Act of 1990 and the GMRA of 1994 required audited financial statements for executive departments and agencies, leading to clean opinions in FY2002. The Accountability of Tax Dollars Act extended these requirements to other agencies. Standardization promotes accountability by requiring agencies to justify exceptions, while customization aids in effective management. The Accountability of Tax Dollars Act (116 Stat. 2049) promotes accountability by requiring agencies to justify exceptions. Customization aligns agency management with internal and external environments. Congress uses various mechanisms to direct agency actions, including authorizing statutes and appropriations. Congress uses authorizing statutes, appropriations, and reports to direct agency actions, including customization in management laws. For example, small agencies were not required to prepare audited financial statements until recently, and the CFO position at DHS was initially exempt from CFO Act requirements. DHS and DOD were granted authority to customize certain HRM practices in the last two years. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established a new agency with a CFO position not subject to CFO Act requirements. DHS and DOD were granted authority to customize certain HRM practices, moving towards a mixed approach of standardization and customization in management laws. The mixed approach in management laws involves balancing standardization with customization. An example is the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, which required agencies to develop strategic plans within a general framework provided by Congress. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) mandated executive branch agencies to create strategic plans, with a balance between standardization and customization. Standardization can be rigid, while customization may hinder transparency and accountability if not reported in real-time. Customization can reduce transparency and accountability if not reported in real-time, leading to agencies working at cross-purposes and budget pressures. Mixed approaches can suffer from these problems, highlighting the importance of finding a balance between standardization and customization. In addition to the three general approaches outlined, Congress has policy options to avoid problems related to customization and standardization. Decision-making depends on various factors, including the nature of the problem, stakeholders involved, and historical context. Regular examination of increased customization or standardization is recommended to maintain balance and prevent issues like budget pressures and agencies working at cross-purposes. One option is to regularly assess the need for increased customization or standardization in general management law for better transparency, accountability, efficiency, or effectiveness. Analytical support can be obtained from various sources such as agency management, program evaluations, inspectors general, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and external evaluators. Another option is to consider customization in areas like human resources laws where it is prevalent. One option to enhance transparency and accountability is to require the executive branch to maintain real-time descriptions of current affairs and updated comparisons across agencies, drawing on various sources like agency management, program evaluations, inspectors general, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and external evaluators. This approach can reduce the analytical burden for Congress and stakeholders in monitoring situations, especially in areas with widespread customization like human resources laws. The compendium aims to provide real-time descriptions and comparisons across agencies, highlighting the challenges posed by the increasing fragmentation of civil service laws. Reporting requirements in customized areas can help reduce the analytical burden for Congress and the public. The establishment of reporting requirements in areas of widespread customization, such as pay, performance management, and adverse actions, can help reduce the analytical burden for Congress and the public. Central management agencies like OMB, OPM, GSA, FMS, or others could report on management policies in real-time on the Web. Central management agencies like OMB, OPM, GSA, and FMS could report customized management policies in real-time on the Web, facilitating government-wide analysis. This may incur costs for reporting agencies, as general management laws are categorized into functions like financial management, human resources, and procurement. Functional orientation or structures are common in both private and public sector organizations, even when structured around customers or taxpayer groups. This perspective is valued for its efficiency through specialization and centralized control over strategic decisions. \"Functional orientation in organizations can lead to efficiency through specialization and centralized control over strategic decisions. However, if too inward-looking, it can hinder organization-wide coordination and development of general managers, leading to functional silos.\" The internal development of general managers can be hindered by functional silos operating in isolation. Management literature emphasizes the importance of an integrated, general management perspective to avoid missed opportunities or organizational problems. Background and experiences shape individuals' assumptions when approaching problems or decisions. An integrated, general management perspective is crucial to avoid missed opportunities or organizational problems. Background and experiences shape individuals' assumptions when approaching problems or decisions, leading to a limited view of the whole story. The importance of developing a general management perspective is highlighted in marketing, focusing on integrating multiple functional perspectives to understand problems or opportunities fully. This approach helps avoid limited views based on individual experiences and assumptions. The general management perspective integrates multiple functional perspectives to understand problems fully. An example is using information technology to improve human resources and financial management. This approach provides a toolbox of options for addressing executive branch management problems. The general management laws focus on improving executive branch management in various functional areas like agency finances, technology procurement, and human capital. These laws can be integrated to provide mutual support and address management problems collectively. Integration can involve changes to general management laws, agency statutes, and operations. Integration of general management laws can provide mutual support and address management problems collectively through changes to laws, agency statutes, and operations. For example, leveraging the E-Government Act of 2002 for more timely financial and performance reporting by utilizing the Federal Enterprise Architecture. The E-Government Act of 2002 aims to improve financial and performance reporting by utilizing the Federal Enterprise Architecture for real-time results. It also directs appropriations to hire contract oversight specialists to better manage contracts. The appropriations aim to hire, train, and retain contract oversight specialists to help agencies manage contracts better. This includes restructuring budget accounts to align resources with programs and conducting program evaluations for better resource allocation. Additionally, the Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002 may be leveraged to ensure agencies dedicate sufficient staff resources. The curr_chunk discusses leveraging different functional perspectives, such as performance measurement, human resources, acquisition, and program evaluation, to align resources with results and improve contract management and oversight. These options could be applied generally to many agencies or specific agencies. The curr_chunk discusses various functional perspectives in general management, including information policy, regulation, strategic planning, performance measurement, program evaluation, auditing, investigation, financial management, budgeting, accounting, organization, acquisition management, real property management, intergovernmental relations, human resources management, and ethics. The history of federal government management reform shows efforts to improve agencies' performance. The history of federal government management reform includes efforts to improve agencies' performance in various functional perspectives such as information policy, regulation, strategic planning, performance measurement, program evaluation, auditing, investigation, financial management, budgeting, accounting, organization, acquisition management, real property management, intergovernmental relations, human resources management, and ethics. Despite numerous attempts by both legislative and executive branches to enhance agency management practices, progress has been challenging to achieve. Congress faces significant hurdles in overseeing executive branch management and ensuring agencies improve their practices. Despite efforts to improve federal government management, progress has been difficult to achieve. Congress faces challenges in overseeing executive branch management, particularly in measuring agencies' progress in improving their practices. Management literature emphasizes the importance of measurement as a motivator for action. Measurement is a strong motivator for action, as emphasized in management literature. It can drive organizational behavior but may also lead to perverse incentives. For example, rewarding short-term profits over long-term development can hinder overall performance. Employees may show less interest in longer-term performance if they are only rewarded based on short-term profits. Achieving clean financial audits may not indicate good fiscal management if done through brute force. Inspectors general and the GAO have reported major management problems in the executive branch over the last 25 years. In the last 25 years, agency inspectors general and the GAO have reported persistent major management problems in executive branch agencies, including financial management, acquisition, information technology investment, human resources, and strategic planning. Beginning in 1992, the GAO released reports on high-risk areas and management challenges in government agencies. Progress was noted, but significant work remained. Various management reform initiatives were pursued by presidential administrations during this period. During this period, management reform initiatives were pursued by presidential administrations, including President Ronald Reagan's Reform '88, President George H. W. Bush's efforts on financial and information management, and President William Clinton's NPR. Concerns about government management were frequently expressed by Congress and committee staff, with recommendations made in 1992 to improve central management, procurement, and information resources management. During the 1990s and early 2000s, concerns were raised by Congress and committee staff about government management. Recommendations were made to improve central management, procurement, information resources management, financial management, and human resources management. Senator Fred Thompson highlighted urgent federal government management problems during the administration of President George W. Bush. The Affairs Committee report highlighted urgent federal government management problems during the administration of President George W. Bush, including workforce, financial management, information technology, and overlap and duplication issues. President George W. Bush's Office of Management and Budget released the President's Management Agenda (PMA) in August 2001, with five government-wide initiatives to address these issues. Under the PMA, OMB conducts quarterly evaluations of agencies to assess their progress. The President's Management Agenda (PMA) introduced five initiatives to address federal government management problems: Strategic Management of Human Capital, Competitive Sourcing, Improved Financial Performance, Expanded Electronic Government, and Budget and Performance Integration. OMB evaluates agencies quarterly based on \"stoplight scores\" to measure progress. Green status indicates meeting all success standards, yellow indicates partial success. The PMA evaluates agencies based on stoplight scores for five initiatives. Green status means meeting all success standards, yellow indicates partial success. OMB assesses progress on a case by case basis against agreed deliverables and timelines. Green on progress means implementation is proceeding as planned, yellow indicates some issues requiring adjustment. The five government-wide PMA initiatives are evaluated based on stoplight scores, with green indicating progress according to plans, yellow showing some slippage or issues, and red signaling serious jeopardy. OMB stated that the initiatives would be mutually reinforcing. The five government-wide PMA initiatives are categorized into functional categories and utilize general management laws to achieve their goals. For example, the Competitive Sourcing initiative leverages the FAIR Act of 1998, and the Improved Financial Performance initiative leverages various financial management laws. The Competitive Sourcing initiative utilizes the FAIR Act of 1998; the Improved Financial Performance initiative leverages various financial management laws; the Expanded Electronic Government initiative leverages the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, E-Government Act of 2002, and FISMA of 2002; and the Strategic Management of Human Capital and Budget and Performance Integration initiatives leverage the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. The PMA leverages various government acts and initiatives to drive progress, but there are concerns about transparency in evaluation practices outside the executive branch. PMA evaluation practices lack transparency outside the executive branch, unlike OMB assessments using the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) which are more transparent. Detailed rationales and worksheets behind PMA grades are not publicly available. The Budget and Performance Integration initiative under the PMA lacks transparency compared to OMB's PART assessments. OMB provided detailed evidence and worksheets for agency program assessments, increasing transparency. Subjectivity may be a challenge due to stoplight scoring criteria for some initiatives. For example, success standards for the Expanded Electronic Government initiative require \"acceptable\" IT business cases for a green status. Similarly, the Strategic Management of Human Capital initiative necessitates succession strategies leading to desired outcomes. To achieve green status for the Expanded Electronic Government initiative, agencies need \"acceptable\" IT business cases. For the Strategic Management of Human Capital initiative, succession strategies must result in a leadership talent pool. Independent evaluation organizations have not verified agency stoplight scores. The PMA's scope may not cover all important management laws, such as Competitive Sourcing. The PMA does not cover all important management laws, such as contract oversight and small business concerns, as highlighted by GAO and outside observers. Real property management issues are also not explicitly addressed by the PMA. The PMA does not cover all important management laws, such as contract oversight and small business concerns. The executive branch, nongovernmental organizations, and Congress have tried to influence agencies to improve management practices. Agency IGs and GAO focus on specific problems, while OMB and GAO created \"high risk\" programs for troublesome areas. Some in Congress have also measured compliance with general management laws across agencies. Some in Congress have undertaken measurement efforts to assess agency compliance with management laws. Representative Stephen Horn and Adam Putnam issued letter grades for financial management and information security performance. Senator Fred Thompson also graded agency annual performance reports. Representative Adam Putnam and Senator Fred Thompson have graded agency performance in financial management and information security. Congress is exploring options to ensure agencies comply with management laws and improve practices. Congress is considering ways to measure and monitor executive branch agencies' compliance with general management laws and improvement in practices. Options include using existing oversight tools like GAO and agency IGs to selectively monitor progress while allowing executive branch discretion. Congress could utilize existing oversight tools such as GAO and agency IGs to monitor the executive branch's efforts in improving agency management practices. This option would involve minimal cost and would not overly restrict executive branch activities. Critics, however, argue that Congress does not effectively utilize these tools. Another option is for Congress to direct GAO and agency IGs to systematically verify and validate PMA stoplight scores and corresponding agency actions. Critics argue that Congress does not effectively use oversight tools like GAO and agency IGs. Congress could increase confidence by verifying PMA stoplight scores, but this may be seen as micromanagement by the executive branch. Another option is to secure access to final PMA stoplight worksheets for transparency. Congress could enhance oversight by securing access to final PMA stoplight worksheets from OMB or agencies, allowing for independent measurement of agency progress in improving management practices. This option may lead to increased transparency but could be perceived as increasing costs and managerial workloads by the executive branch. Congress could direct GAO or IGs to develop measures to systematically measure agency progress in improving management practices, which could be compared easily across agencies. This option may increase workload and costs for GAO, IGs, and agencies, but would make management improvement measurement more systematic. Congress could potentially direct GAO or IGs to develop measures to systematically measure agency progress in improving management practices, which could be compared easily across agencies. This may increase workload and costs for GAO, IGs, and agencies, but would make management improvement measurement more systematic. Additionally, Congress could consider amending GPRA to require agencies to address major management problems and high-risk areas in their strategic plans, annual performance plans, and annual performance reports, including establishing milestones and timelines for improvement. The curr_chunk discusses the potential for Congress to require the President to address management improvement issues in the government-wide performance plan. This could involve making management improvement measurement more systematic but may increase workload for agencies and OMB personnel. Additionally, it mentions the increasing number of agency \"chief officer\" positions. The curr_chunk discusses the expanding set of agency \"chief officer\" positions, including inspectors general and chief financial officers, established by statute. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of various chief officer positions within branch agencies, including inspectors general, chief financial officers, chief information officers, chief human capital officers, and chief acquisition officers. Key details about each officer position are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 summarizes key information about various chief officer positions within branch agencies, including their functions, laws establishing the positions, statutory provisions, appointment rules, and reporting structure. Some officers are presidentially appointed with Senate confirmation, while others may be appointed by agency heads. Positions can be filled by political or career employees, with CAOs and certain CFOs required to be appointed. Some chief officers in branch agencies are presidentially appointed with Senate confirmation, while others are appointed by agency heads. CAOs and certain CFOs must be political appointees. Reporting relationships vary, with IGs, CFOs, and CIOs required to report directly to the agency head. The history behind the creation of these positions is not covered in this report. The creation of chief officer positions in executive branch agencies aimed to address the lack of attention to functional perspectives by senior managers. Observers believed that elevating these perspectives within agency management ranks would help solve long-standing problems. Reporting relationships for CHCOs and CAOs are at the discretion of agency heads. Many observers believed that functional perspectives needed to be elevated within agencies' management ranks to address long-standing problems. Chief officers were placed into interagency councils by statute or executive order. Table 2 summarizes key information about each council. Four interagency councils were established either by law or executive order, with varying memberships. The Office of Management and Budget's deputy director for management chairs or vice-chairs each council, allowing the Executive Office of the President to influence their activities. The President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) was established by President Ronald Reagan in 1981 through an executive order. The council, consisting of agency IGs, was tasked with coordinating government-wide efforts to combat fraud and waste in government programs. The Office of Management and Budget's deputy director for management chairs or vice-chairs the council, allowing the Executive Office of the President to direct or influence its activities. The PCIE, established in 1981 by President Reagan, aimed to coordinate government-wide efforts to combat fraud and waste. It provided leverage for IGs to secure resources and enhance lobbying power, fostering informal networks for organizational learning. Standing committees were formed to facilitate idea-sharing and collaboration among IGs. The PCIE, established in 1981 by President Reagan, aimed to coordinate government-wide efforts to combat fraud and waste. It provided leverage for IGs to secure resources and enhance lobbying power, fostering informal networks for organizational learning. Standing committees were formed to facilitate idea-sharing and collaboration among IGs, leading to positive innovation and close relationships among colleagues. The PCIE, established in 1981 by President Reagan, aimed to coordinate government-wide efforts to combat fraud and waste. It provided a unique mechanism for IGs to work together and develop work plans. The Council was praised for its value in addressing fraud, waste, and abuse issues across the Government. However, it was also criticized as a \"trade union\" for IGs in the late 1980s. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush established two IG councils, the PCIE for presidentially appointed IGs and the ECIE for IGs. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush established two IG councils, the PCIE for presidentially appointed IGs and the ECIE for IGs typically appointed by agency heads. The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Council was also created by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, which established the deputy director for management (DDM) position in the President's Office of Management and Budget. The CFO Act gave the DDM chairperson status over the CFO Council and overall responsibility for establishing ways to grow. The CFO Act of 1990 established the deputy director for management (DDM) position in the President's Office of Management and Budget, giving the DDM chairperson status over the CFO Council. The DDM was responsible for establishing general management policies in areas such as financial management, procurement policy, and human resources management. In 1994, council members recommended actions to energize the CFO Council. The CFO Council, established by the CFO Act of 1990, oversees financial management, procurement policy, human resources management, and program evaluation. In 1994, council members recommended actions to energize the council, including broadening membership and setting their own agenda. OMB supported these recommendations, and the CFO Council formed committees for special emphasis areas. The CFO Council, established by the CFO Act of 1990, broadened membership and set their own agenda with support from OMB. The council formed committees for special emphasis areas and served as a model for other interagency efforts. Congress later established the CIO Council, CHCO Council, and CAO Council. The CFO Council, established by the CFO Act of 1990, served as a model for other interagency efforts. Congress later established the CIO Council, CHCO Council, and CAO Council. These chief officer positions have been successful in bringing focus to their functional perspectives, despite facing some difficult challenges. The chief officer positions (CIO, CHCO, CAO) have been successful in bringing focus to their functional perspectives. However, challenges such as high turnover, change management difficulties, and performance measurement hinder their efforts to improve agency management practices. Agencies still face persistent management difficulties due to budget pressures and lack of attention from political appointees. Some commentators argue that agencies continue to face management difficulties due to budget pressures and lack of attention from political appointees. Management scholars are cautious of functional silos that hinder a more integrated general management perspective. Interagency councils of chief officers have shown varying levels of effectiveness over time. Interagency councils of chief officers have been beneficial, with observers noting periods of effectiveness. Public management scholars emphasize the potential benefits of interagency collaboration, as highlighted in congressional testimony. Interagency councils, such as the Chief Human Capital Officers Council, play a crucial role in improving federal management by facilitating knowledge sharing and best practices among different government agencies. Having human capital officers from different parts of the Federal Government meet regularly to share information and approaches is crucial for organizational performance. Knowledge management is emphasized in management literature and many companies and government agencies, but it's important to avoid a narrow functional perspective to address agencies' problems effectively. Some scholars and practitioners suggest re-thinking the structure and role of OMB within the Executive Office of the President to improve federal executive branch management. Congress may need to consider questions regarding chief officers and interagency councils in executive branch agencies. Re-thinking the structure and role of OMB within the Executive Office of the President is necessary for improving federal executive branch management. Congress should consider questions about chief officers and interagency councils in executive branch agencies, including the need for additional chief officers, preserving institutional memory for political appointees, making councils statutory, funding, and accountability to Congress. In considering the structure and role of OMB within the Executive Office of the President, Congress should address questions about chief officers and interagency councils in executive branch agencies. This includes the need for additional chief officers, making councils statutory, funding, and accountability to Congress. One proposal is to establish agency \"chief security officers\" (CSOs) to ensure government services are available in emergencies and address security risks. In the context of addressing security risks and ensuring government services are available in emergencies, the question arises whether Congress should establish agency \"chief security officers\" (CSOs). A 2002 news report found that many corporate chief executive officers had designated CSOs, with some focusing solely on information technology while others handled all security responsibilities. However, concerns exist that creating statutory CSO positions could lead to conflicts with existing roles like Chief Information Officers (CIOs). Establishing statutory CSO positions could lead to conflicts with existing roles like CIOs, but it may bring a more integrated approach to security and risk management at federal agencies. Some argue that requiring an additional chief officer for agencies would be excessive due to the increasing number of chief officers. Many federal agencies may already have systems to address issues, but observers argue that adding a \"chief program evaluation officer\" could improve program evaluation efforts due to lack of capacity, management attention, and resources. Congress could establish \"chief program evaluation officer\" (CPEO) positions in major agencies to bring more attention to program evaluation efforts, addressing issues such as lack of capacity, management attention, and resources. This could create a \"seat at the table\" for program evaluation in agency senior management teams, aiding in improving performance and coordinating programs with overlapping functions. Establishing chief program evaluation officer positions in major agencies could provide a \"seat at the table\" for program evaluation in agency senior management teams, aiding in improving performance and coordinating programs with overlapping functions. Critics may argue that creating additional chief officer positions would be excessive. Congress has various options for appointing chief officers, as shown in Table 1. Establishing chief program evaluation officer positions in major agencies could provide a \"seat at the table\" for program evaluation in agency senior management teams. Political appointees can ensure functional perspective consideration, while career officials offer continuity and institutional knowledge. Regarding the proposed CHCO positions, witnesses had differing opinions. Political appointees can provide a functional perspective but turnover frequently, while career officials offer continuity and institutional memory. Similar arguments were made for CAOs. CFOs and CIOs must report directly to the agency head, as per Table 1. In enacting the CFO Act, Congress reflected perspectives on CFOs and deputies. CFOs are political, deputies are career. Reporting relationships vary for CHCOs and CAOs. Direct reporting to agency head ensures accountability and management effectiveness. The appropriateness of reporting relationships to agency management needs and progress in addressing major management problems is questioned. Direct reporting to agency heads ensures access for chief officers but could lead to a large span of control. The role of IG councils in interagency coordination is highlighted for Congress to consider. The appropriateness of reporting relationships to agency management needs and the potential impact of additional direct reports on span of control are discussed. Congress is urged to consider making IG councils statutory for better interagency coordination. The vice chair of the PCIE believes codification of executive order would require \"modest appropriations\" but improve training, strengthen IG-Congress relationship, and enhance coordination between IG offices. Some argue it may reduce Presidential control. Funding options for interagency councils are discussed. The compendium discusses how funding for interagency councils, such as the IG councils, is self-financed through MOUs instead of appropriations or transfers. This change could potentially reduce Presidential control. Funding for interagency councils like the IG offices is self-financed through MOUs, reducing Presidential control. Operations for the CHCO Council are funded by the Office of Personnel Management, while the CFO, CIO, and Procurement Executives Council are funded through interagency transfers or reimbursements. The CFO, CIO, and Procurement Executives Councils have been funded through interagency transfers or reimbursements. Congress could maintain the status quo or consider separate appropriations for each council, potentially limiting Presidential discretion. Congress could consider making separate appropriations for each interagency council, potentially limiting Presidential discretion while giving Congress more control. This could improve institutional memory and continuity between administrations. Additionally, Congress could alter reporting and strategic planning requirements for the councils to enhance oversight and accountability. Congress could consider changing reporting and strategic planning requirements for interagency councils to enhance oversight and accountability. Some councils currently lack these requirements, such as the CFO, CIO, and CAO Councils. They could be mandated to submit plans or reports to the President or Congress. The PCIE and ECIE report only to the President, while the CFO, CIO, and CAO Councils lack statutory requirements to report to Congress or prepare strategic plans. Congress could mandate these councils to submit plans or reports to the President or Congress, increasing transparency and accountability.OMB could be required to lead the interagency chief officer councils and submit an overall plan as part of the government-wide performance plan. The government-wide performance plan required by GPRA may increase transparency and accountability for interagency councils. However, it could limit the President's discretion and raise costs for the councils or OMB."
