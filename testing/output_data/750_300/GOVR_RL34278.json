    "content": "During the first session of the 110th Congress, the Administration requested $196.5 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY 2008, with $189.3 billion for military operations, $6.9 billion for international affairs, and $325 million for other purposes. Congress had approved $86.8 billion for defense and $1.5 billion for international affairs by December 2007. $102.5 billion for defense and $5.4 billion for international affairs are still pending approval. These remaining requests are expected to be considered in a spring 2008 supplemental appropriations bill. In spring 2008, Congress is expected to consider the remaining emergency requests of $102.5 billion for defense and $5.4 billion for international affairs. The Administration had initially requested emergency funding for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere in February 2007, followed by additional requests for MRAP vehicles in July 2007 and a budget amendment for emergency defense and international affairs funding in October 2007. In 2007, additional requests were made for emergency funding for MRAP vehicles and defense and international affairs. Congress approved the FY2008 defense appropriations act in November, allowing the Army and Marine Corps to finance both peacetime activities and war-related operations. The regular FY2008 defense appropriations act, P.L. 110-116, approved by Congress in November, provided funding for the Army and Marine Corps for day-to-day activities and war-related operations. Due to the high pace of operations in Iraq, the base budget for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance was quickly depleted. Administration officials warned that without supplemental funding, the Army would run out of money by February and the Marine Corps by early April. The Army and Marine Corps faced funding shortages without supplemental funding, risking operations by February and early April. Options included fund transfers or slowing operations. A $70 billion \"bridge fund\" from Congress temporarily resolved the issue. The $70 billion \"bridge fund\" approved by Congress temporarily resolved funding shortages for the Army and Marine Corps, providing about 37% of the total amount requested by the Administration for military operations. This funding included most of what the Defense Department had requested for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance, as well as military personnel accounts in the consolidated FY2008 appropriations act, P.L. 110-161. Defense officials estimate that funding from FY2008 appropriations will last until mid-June for personnel and end of June or early July for operation and maintenance. The Defense Department could extend operations by slowing obligations, transferring funds, or invoking the Feed and Forage Act. Up to $11.4 billion in transfer authority is available. The Defense Department could extend operations further by slowing obligations, transferring funds, or invoking the Feed and Forage Act. Up to $11.4 billion in transfer authority is available. The Administration requested $141.7 billion in emergency supplemental funding for the Defense Department, $3.3 billion for the State Department and international affairs, and $325 million for other agencies. The Administration requested $141.7 billion in emergency supplemental funding for the Defense Department, $3.3 billion for the State Department and international affairs, and $325 million for other agencies as part of the regular FY2008 budget. This request complied with Section 1008 of the FY2007 national defense authorization act, which required a detailed justification of the funds for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The authorization act (P.L. 109-364) required the President's budget to include estimated full year costs of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department estimated the costs based on 2006 operations, but the budget did not reflect the proposed troop surge in Iraq. The Administration was expected to provide revised cost projections later. The Administration proposed a surge in troops to Iraq not reflected in the budget. An additional $5.3 billion was requested for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, and $45.9 billion for military operations and reconstruction assistance in ongoing conflicts in Iraq. The White House requested an additional $45.9 billion for military operations, reconstruction assistance, and embassy security in ongoing conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. This included $42.3 billion for the Department of Defense and $3.6 billion for international affairs programs in the FY2008 budget amendment sent to Congress. The total emergency supplemental appropriations requested for FY2008 were $195.6 billion, mainly for military operations and related foreign affairs programs. The Administration requested $195.6 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations for FY2008, mainly for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and related foreign affairs programs. Congressional debate focused on supplemental appropriations for FY2007, with a revised request submitted in March and a compromise bill approved in May. In May, Congress approved a compromise FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 2206, providing funding for defense, international affairs, and domestic programs. The President signed the bill into law, P.L. 110-28, on May 25, allocating $99.5 billion for the Department of Defense, $6.1 billion for international affairs, and $14.5 billion for domestic programs. The FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill allocated $14.5 billion for domestic programs. Congress also included a $70 billion \"bridge fund\" in the regular FY2007 defense appropriations act. Congressional action on FY2008 emergency supplemental funding began in September and was finalized shortly before Christmas. Funds were quickly provided for MRAP vehicles, and various measures were debated for partial year funding for overseas operations. Congress included $5.2 billion for MRAP vehicles at the end of September. Congress quickly provided funds for MRAP vehicles in September and debated measures for partial year funding for overseas operations. $5.2 billion was included for MRAP vehicles in the FY2008 continuing resolution, signed by the President on September 29, 2007. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill was approved by the House and Senate on November 8, 2007, and signed into law shortly after. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill, H.R. 3222, provided $460 billion for Defense Department activities, including $27.4 billion for Army and $4.8 billion for Marine Corps operations. An additional $11.6 billion was allocated for MRAP vehicles. The FY2008 defense appropriations bill, H.R. 3222, allocated $27.4 billion for Army and $4.8 billion for Marine Corps operations, with an additional $11.6 billion for MRAP vehicles. The bill also provided $50 billion for U.S. military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, but did not cover all ongoing military operation costs. The bill, H.R. 4156, allocated $50 billion for U.S. military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. It required the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days and limited the mission of remaining forces to force protection, training, and pursuit of international terrorists. The legislation allocated $50 billion for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. It required withdrawal of troops from Iraq within 30 days, limited the mission of remaining forces, and extended prohibitions on torture to all U.S. government agencies. The Senate failed to pass the bill, effectively killing it. The Senate refused to close debate on a motion to proceed to consideration of H.R. 4156, effectively killing the measure. They also rejected a motion to proceed to consideration of H.R. 2340, a substitute offered by Senator McConnell for $70 billion for the Defense Department without requiring withdrawal from Iraq. Ultimately, the McConnell amendment was approved with some revisions in the allocation of funds. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned that without additional funding, the Army and Marine Corps would have to limit operations, potentially leading to furloughs of government employees and contractors. The Defense Department announced plans to implement these measures by mid-December. The Defense Department announced plans to cease operations at all Army bases by mid-February 2008, leading to furloughs of government employees and contractors. Additional funding was needed to avoid halting essential operations. The Defense Department warned of halting essential operations at Army and Marine Corps bases by mid-February 2008 without additional funding. The House approved amendments to the foreign operations appropriations bill, H.R. 2764, to address FY2008 appropriations. The House approved two amendments to the Senate-passed bill, providing $485 billion in regular and emergency appropriations for programs covered by all regular appropriations bills except for defense. Another amendment allocated $31 billion in emergency defense appropriations, mainly for Operation Enduring Freedom. The second amendment, approved by a vote of 206-201, provided $31 billion in emergency defense appropriations, mostly for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The Senate later adopted an amendment to delete the $31 billion for OEF and instead provide $70 billion for Department of Defense overseas operations without limits. On December 19, 2007, the House approved a motion to agree to the Senate amendment to the House-passed bill, clearing the measure for the President. The President signed the consolidated appropriations bill into law, P.L. 110-161, on December 26, 2007. The House approved a motion to agree to the Senate amendment, clearing the bill for the President who signed it into law as P.L. 110-161 on December 26, 2007. Congress allocated $70 billion for overseas military operations, resolving a funding dispute that could have led to Army and Marine Corps shutdowns in early 2008. The Defense Department announced plans to shut down Army and Marine Corps operations in early 2008 due to a lack of supplemental appropriations. Secretary of Defense Gates warned of furloughs for 100,000 civilian and contractor personnel. However, the $70 billion allocated in the consolidated appropriations act averted the shutdown until at least June 2008, providing $35.2 billion for the Army and $4.0 billion for the Marine Corps. The $70 billion in the consolidated appropriations act prevented the shutdown of Army and Marine Corps operations in early 2008, avoiding furloughs for 100,000 civilian and contractor personnel. It provided $35.2 billion for the Army and $4.0 billion for the Marine Corps, sustaining operations until June and August 2008 respectively. The Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-116) provided supplemental funding to sustain Army operations until the end of June 2008 and Marine Corps operations until the end of August 2008. The Army is projected to exhaust funds in its military personnel account by mid-June, before running out of operation and maintenance money. The Defense Department may extend operations by transferring funds from other accounts to the Army and Marine Corps. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for fund transfers between accounts to extend Army and Marine Corps operations. This includes $3.7 billion in general transfer authority from the FY2008 defense appropriations act and $3.7 billion from the Iraqi Freedom Fund. Operations can be extended by transferring funds or slowing down the pace of operations. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for fund transfers to extend Army and Marine Corps operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Transfers could potentially prolong operations by up to a month but would limit financial flexibility for other needs. The Defense Department has $11.4 billion available for fund transfers to extend Army and Marine Corps operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Transfers could potentially prolong operations by up to a month without slowing down operations, but would limit financial flexibility for other needs. Congress's agreement to provide a $70 billion FY2008 bridge fund temporarily resolved the debate, but the underlying controversy remains regarding the Defense Department's flexibility to delay or avoid shutting down operations. In FY2008, Congress provided a $70 billion bridge fund to temporarily resolve the debate over Defense Department flexibility in delaying or avoiding shutdowns. Without supplemental appropriations, the Defense Department may exhaust funds for Army and Marine Corps operations by February and early April, respectively. In FY2008, the Defense Department projected that funds for Army and Marine Corps operations would be exhausted by February and early April, respectively. DOD proposed a $4.1 billion transfer to the Army to extend operations by two to three weeks. Without supplemental appropriations, operations could be sustained for about another month by transferring limited additional amounts and slowing down spending. The Defense Department could have extended operations for about another month by transferring limited additional amounts to the Army and Marine Corps and by slowing down spending. Alternative measures like invoking the Feed and Forage Act or assigning the Navy and Air Force to pay for Army support operations abroad could have also sustained operations longer, but each has limitations and disadvantages. The Defense Department could have extended operations by transferring limited additional funds to the Army and Marine Corps, but this would reduce financial flexibility. Using alternative funding sources like the Feed and Forage Act or Navy and Air Force funds for Army operations may disrupt day-to-day operations and weaken congressional controls on fund usage. The potential disruptive effects of these measures must be weighed against the possibility of furloughing personnel sooner. The FY2008 state department, foreign operations appropriations bill is one of 11 regular FY2008 appropriations bills that were incorporated into the consolidated appropriations act, H.R. 2764 , P.L. 110-161.

Table 2 summarizes FY2008 defense supplemental appropriations proposals, including the Administration request, House-passed bills, and the final enacted amount in the McConnell $70 billion bridge fund. The FY2008 consolidated appropriations bill included a $70 billion bridge fund for Iraq policy with no changes. The original House-passed bill required a plan to withdraw most U.S. military forces from Iraq by December 2008. Various reporting requirements were included in the final emergency funding legislation. The original House-passed bill included a $50 billion bridge fund for Iraq policy, requiring the President to begin withdrawing troops within 30 days and aiming for complete withdrawal by December 2008. A residual force was allowed for mission protection, training, and targeted attacks on terrorists. The House bill aimed to withdraw troops from Iraq within 30 days and complete the withdrawal by December 2008. It allowed a residual force for mission protection, training, and targeted attacks on terrorists. The bill also extended prohibitions on torture to all government agencies. H.R. 4156 aimed to end the war in Iraq quickly and safely, bring troops home, extend prohibitions on torture to all government agencies, require certification for deploying units abroad, and start an immediate redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days. It also called for a comprehensive strategy to bring stability with the help of neighbors and the international community. The President was required to begin an immediate redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq within 30 days. The withdrawal should be accompanied by a comprehensive strategy to bring stability to Iraq with the help of neighbors and the international community. The goal was to transition U.S. armed forces to a limited presence by December 15, 2008, with restricted missions focused on protecting U.S. facilities, providing training to Iraqi security forces, and engaging in targeted counter-terrorism operations. Restricted missions post-transition include protecting U.S. facilities, armed forces, and civilians, providing limited training to Iraqi security forces, and conducting targeted counter-terrorism operations. Quarterly reports on transition plans and regional stability are required, with additional funding contingent on the first report. The Senate required a comprehensive regional stability plan for the Middle East by February 15, 2008, along with quarterly reports on military and political stability in Iraq. Senators proposed an amendment to shift the U.S. mission in Iraq by the end of 2008. Senators proposed an amendment to shift the U.S. mission in Iraq by the end of 2008 to focus on training, equipping, and supporting Iraqi security forces, as well as counterterrorism operations. The Senate failed to approve a proposal to transition the U.S. mission in Iraq to focus on counterterrorism operations, training Iraqi forces, and force protection by the end of 2008. The vote reflected ongoing Senate support and opposition to the war in Iraq. The Senate failed to approve a measure to withdraw troops from Iraq within 90 days and cut off funding for operations after nine months. The vote reflected no change in Senate support for or opposition to the war in Iraq. The Senate rejected an amendment to withdraw troops from Iraq within 90 days and cut off funding for operations after nine months. Instead, a $70 billion \"bridge fund\" was approved for FY2008 without requiring troop withdrawal. The Secretary of Defense was mandated to provide reports on Iraq's stability every 60 days. The Senate rejected an amendment to withdraw troops from Iraq within 90 days and cut off funding for operations after nine months. Instead, Section 609 of the measure required the Secretary of Defense to provide reports on Iraq's stability every 60 days. The Administration interpreted these reporting requirements as being fulfilled by ongoing quarterly reports on stability and security in Iraq, including criteria for withdrawing U.S. forces. The Administration requested $196.5 billion in additional appropriations for military operations. The Administration requested $196.5 billion in additional appropriations for military operations in FY2008, including funds for international affairs and other agencies.

Additionally, a budget amendment asked for an extra $45.9 billion for military operations abroad and international affairs programs. The Administration requested $325 million for other agencies in FY2008, including funds designated as \"emergency\" spending to bypass spending caps. The FY2008 budget resolution allows emergency funds to bypass spending caps, but there are restrictions on what qualifies as emergency spending. The FY2008 budget resolution exempts emergency funds from spending caps but has restrictions on what qualifies as emergency spending, allowing adjustments of up to $124.2 billion for overseas deployments and related activities. This designation may permit some requested spending without exceeding budget limits in the Senate. The FY2008 budget resolution exempts emergency funds from spending caps but has restrictions on what qualifies as emergency spending, allowing adjustments of up to $124.2 billion for overseas deployments and related activities. Supplemental appropriations bills often provide more funding than requested by the White House and can include significant legislative initiatives. For example, the FY2007 supplemental bill included funds for disaster relief, farm programs, low-income energy assistance, SCHIP children's health insurance program, and a measure to increase the minimum wage. The FY2007 supplemental bill, H.R. 2206, P.L. 110-28, included funds for disaster relief, farm programs, low-income energy assistance, and the SCHIP children's health insurance program, as well as a measure to increase the minimum wage. Appropriators decided to address hurricane recovery and other issues by providing funding for non-defense programs in the FY2008 supplemental appropriations bill. The second FY2008 continuing resolution (CR) provided funding for non-defense programs, including $2.9 billion for veterans health programs and $3 billion for community development funds for Louisiana.

The total amount for DOD, including war-related funds, has grown significantly since FY2003. The funding for military operations has increased significantly since FY2003, with investments in repairing and upgrading equipment being major contributors to the rising costs. Troop levels have remained relatively stable despite fluctuations in deployments. Despite stable troop levels, there has been a surge in investments for repairing and upgrading military equipment, particularly in weapons procurement which has seen a significant increase in funding. Additionally, there has been a rise in funding for training and equipping Afghan and Iraqi military forces. Funding for military operations has increased, with a focus on repairing equipment and training Afghan and Iraqi military forces. There have also been investments in reorganizing the Army and increasing troop numbers. The Defense Department has seen large increases in funding for force protection and reconstitution, with Congress insisting on adding funds for new equipment. The Defense Department received increased funding for force protection and reconstitution. Secretary Rumsfeld preferred the term \"reset\" over \"reconstitution\" to describe restoring the force to its planned condition before conflict. The Defense Department received increased funding for force protection and reconstitution. Secretary Rumsfeld preferred the term \"reset\" to describe returning the force to its planned condition before conflict, without necessarily adding to funding requirements. The concept of reconstitution now encompasses more than just restoring the force. The Defense Department has resumed using the term \"reconstitution\" to describe substantial upgrades to the Army and Marine Corps, including fixing equipment shortfalls, adding transportation and communications equipment, and fully equipping deploying units with theater-used equipment. The Defense Department has resumed using the term \"reconstitution\" to describe upgrades to the Army and Marine Corps, including fixing equipment shortfalls, adding transportation and communications equipment, and fully equipping deploying units with theater-used equipment. Congress has generally supported these steps to upgrade the force, which explain much of the increase in spending. The Defense Department has resumed using the term \"reconstitution\" to describe upgrades to the Army and Marine Corps, including fixing equipment shortfalls and adding transportation and communications equipment. Congress has generally supported these steps to upgrade the force, explaining much of the increase in spending. Legislators have questioned only a small share of requested increases in equipment funding. In a war supplemental, questions arose about the need for new aircraft to replace those lost in combat operations. The Administration withdrew the requests for F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and a V-22 tilt rotor aircraft, reallocating funds for the troop surge. The amended defense request prioritizes funding for MRAPs, with Congress approving most of the requested money. The budget amendment included $6.3 billion for the costs of the troop surge.

Two-thirds of the State Department request is for Diplomatic and Consular Program funding for Iraq Operations. The Bush Administration has increasingly requested emergency supplemental funds for international affairs budgets, with nearly half allocated for assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some critics argue that relying too heavily on supplementals, particularly for Iraq and Afghanistan, should be incorporated into the regular budget. The Bush Administration has faced criticism for relying heavily on emergency supplemental funds for international affairs budgets, with some arguing that expenses for Iraq and Afghanistan should be included in regular appropriations. In February 2007, the Administration requested $1.882 billion for Diplomatic and Consular Programs in Iraq.
