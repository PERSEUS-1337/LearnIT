    "content": "The federal parity law aims to ensure that coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services are no more restrictive than those for medical and surgical services. It consists of two laws: the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 and the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008. These laws require certain coverage terms to be equal between mental health services and medical services. The federal mental health parity requirements ensure that coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services are on par with medical and surgical services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 did not modify these specific coverage terms. The ACA did not change federal mental health parity requirements, which ensure equal coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services compared to medical and surgical services. Parity law applies to insurers covering these services and certain plan types, including large fully insured and self-insured plans, Medicaid managed care plans, and CHIP plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include Qualified Health Plans (QHPs), individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include three types of plans: Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) offered through Exchanges, plans in the individual market, and Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans. QHPs must comply with federal parity law to the same extent as other health insurance issuers and group health plans. The ACA expands federal mental health parity requirements to include Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) offered through Exchanges, individual market plans, and Medicaid benchmark plans. QHPs must comply with federal parity law like other health insurance issuers and group health plans. Medicaid can be traditional state plan benefits or state-specified groups in benchmark coverage. The ACA requires Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans to partially comply with federal parity law, ensuring equal treatment for mental health and substance use disorder services and medical and surgical services. This can be provided through managed care plans. Medicaid benchmark and benchmark-equivalent plans are required to partially comply with federal parity law, ensuring equal treatment for mental health and substance use disorder services and medical and surgical services. Managed care plans are responsible for this compliance, while fully insured and self-insured small plans are exempt. Traditional fee-for-service Medicaid and Medicare are not covered by federal parity law. Federal parity law exempts small plans, including those of small employers with 2-50 employees, from compliance. This exemption also applies to \"groups of one\" in states where they are considered small employers. The ACA did not change this exemption, so it remains in effect. Additionally, federal parity law does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicare. The ACA did not amend the small employer exemption, which applies to small plans with 2-50 employees and \"groups of one\" in some states. Federal parity law does not extend to traditional fee-for-service Medicaid or Medicare. Federal parity law does not apply to traditional fee-for-service Medicare, but federal law requires copayments for covered Medicare Part B outpatient mental health services to be 20% of the Medicare-approved amount by 2014. The law aims to reduce disparities in coverage terms between mental health services and medical services. Federal parity law aims to address disparities in coverage terms for mental health and substance use disorder services compared to medical and surgical services. While the law does not mandate coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services, it requires parity with medical and surgical services if they are covered, known as a mandated offering parity approach. The ACA did not change the mandated offering parity approach of federal parity law, which requires parity with medical and surgical services if mental health and substance use disorder services are covered. However, the ACA introduced broader changes that include requirements for the coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services. This impacts the establishment of Exchanges and the coverage of these services. The ACA introduced changes requiring coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services in health insurance plans offered in the Exchanges. This includes the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) which defines the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) and specified tiers of coverage. The Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) under the ACA includes a minimum set of benefits, such as Essential Health Benefits (EHB) and specified tiers of coverage. The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) defines the items and services included in the EHB, which must cover 10 categories of services, including mental health and substance use disorder services. These benefits must be of \"equal scope\" to those offered under a standard plan. The Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) under the ACA includes a minimum set of benefits, such as mental health and substance use disorder services, required to be of \"equal scope\" to those offered under a standard plan. The Department of Labor conducted a survey of employer-sponsored coverage to determine these benefits. The Department of Labor conducted a survey of employer-sponsored coverage to determine the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) under the ACA. The report found that most health plans offer inpatient and outpatient mental health and substance use disorder treatment, although specific services included in the EHBP will be determined through the rulemaking process. The EHBP under the ACA will include specific mental health and substance use disorder services determined through the rulemaking process. The HHS Secretary has discretion to add benefits beyond the 10 required categories. HHS released an informational bulletin in December 2011 outlining their approach to rulemaking for the EHB. In December 2011, HHS released an informational bulletin outlining a proposal for states to define essential health benefits using benchmark health insurance plans. States would choose from four possible options for the benchmark plan. The HHS proposal allows states to choose a benchmark health insurance plan from four options, with benefits comparable to a typical employer plan. The designated plan would determine the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP) for the state. The HHS proposal allows states to select a benchmark plan similar to a typical employer plan to determine the Essential Health Benefits Package (EHBP). The HHS Secretary requested the Institute of Medicine to study and make recommendations on the criteria for determining the EHB, with the IOM releasing a report on the topic. The IOM released a report on essential health benefits, not recommending specific services for inclusion. The ACA mandates coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services. Plans are required to offer either the EHBP or EHB, including QHPs and other plans. The ACA mandates that QHPs, new plans in the small and individual markets, and Medicaid benchmark plans offer either the EHBP or EHB. Medicaid benchmark plans must cover the EHB. The ACA requires QHPs, new plans in the small and individual markets, and Medicaid benchmark plans to include coverage of the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) by January 1, 2014. Grandfathered and large group plans outside of the Exchanges are not mandated to offer the EHB. The health reform law is expected to impact access to mental health and substance use disorder services. The health reform law requires plans to cover mental health and substance use disorder services on par with medical and surgical services, potentially leading to voluntary coverage by plans. The health reform law mandates coverage for mental health and substance use disorder services, potentially prompting plans to voluntarily offer these services to stay competitive in the private market."
