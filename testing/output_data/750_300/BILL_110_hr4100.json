    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section on Instructional Level Assessment Pilot Program. This program aims to assess students' instructional levels. The Secretary will award grants to up to ten State educational agencies for pilot programs to assess students with disabilities below grade-level proficiency and provide quality instruction. Grants will be for a 3-year period, and States must submit an application for the grant. The grants described in the previous paragraph will be awarded for a 3-year period. States must submit an application to be eligible for the grant, and they must not need intervention in implementing the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The Secretary will determine if an agency is not in need of intervention in implementing the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The agency must have developed alternate assessments and identified at least 5 local education agencies to participate in the pilot. The agency has identified 5 local education agencies for a pilot program, providing guidance on student selection, assessment tools, and data collection. The pilot program requires valid assessment tools, data collection, assurance of response to intervention approach, and monitoring of local education agencies. The pilot program requires quality instruction in grade-level content and oversight of local education agencies to ensure appropriate student identification for participation. The pilot program requires appropriate student identification for participation, limiting student participation to 0.5 percent of the total population assessed in each local educational agency. The student's IEP Team must determine if the alternate assessment to modified achievement standards is suitable and obtain parental consent. The pilot program requires the student's IEP Team to determine if the alternate assessment to modified achievement standards is appropriate and obtain parental consent. Students must receive quality instruction in grade-level content, and the IEP Team must examine the student's testing data. The pilot program ensures students receive data-driven, quality instruction in grade-level content. The IEP Team examines testing data, formative assessments, student work, IEP progress notes, and other data to determine if the student is performing significantly below grade level in reading or math. The pilot program requires assessing the student's instructional level in reading and math to determine if they are performing three or more grade levels below their current grade. This assessment should be based on scientifically-valid and reliable instruments. The pilot program involves assessing students' instructional levels in reading and math to identify gaps in knowledge. The data from these assessments should not be used to determine proficiency levels. Targeted interventions will be developed based on the assessment results to address identified gaps. The data from instructional level assessments should not be used to determine proficiency levels or school progress. Each local education agency participating in the program will provide reports. The local education agency participating in the pilot program will compile a report documenting progress on each student's instructional level proficiency and progress towards grade level proficiency. The pilot program aims to help students reach grade level proficiency through alternate or regular academic assessments and instructional level assessments. State education agencies must submit annual reports on student participation and progress in closing the proficiency gap. Data collected will inform the Secretary's report. The pilot program aims to close the gap between students' current grade level proficiency and instructional level proficiency. Data collected will inform the Secretary's report to Congress on student participation and changes in proficiency levels. $5,000,000 is authorized for grants under this program for fiscal year 2008."
