    "content": "Each year, Congress funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to renew over 2.1 million Section 8 vouchers, which are rental subsidies for low-income families in the private market. These vouchers help cover the difference between rent and the tenant's contribution (30% of adjusted income). The Section 8 voucher program provides rental subsidies for low-income families in the private market. The cost of a voucher to a Public Housing Agency (PHA) is the difference between the tenant's actual rent or the maximum subsidy level set by the PHA and 30% of the tenant's income. Cost fluctuates with changes in tenant incomes, rents, and payment standards. Congress and HUD have made changes to the program in recent years. In recent years, Congress has made changes to the Section 8 voucher program, leading to funding uncertainty for many Public Housing Agencies (PHAs). This has put pressure on Congress to adopt a permanent funding formula, possibly through Section 8 voucher reform legislation. The report discusses the renewal funding formula changes enacted by Congress starting in FY2003. The report discusses changes to the Section 8 voucher program funding formula enacted by Congress starting in FY2003, aiming to address funding uncertainty for Public Housing Agencies. Despite receiving full funding, few Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) were able to lease 100% of their authorized vouchers. Low utilization rates, below the expected 95%, were a concern for Congress in FY2000 and FY2001, with national voucher utilization rates just over 91%. This led to low budget utilization as PHAs were not utilizing all of their vouchers. In FY2000 and FY2001, national voucher utilization rates were just over 91%, below the expected 95%. PHAs had low budget utilization due to not using all vouchers, resulting in excess funds in their budgets. HUD would reconcile budgets at year-end and recapture excess funds from PHAs' reserves using a standard formula. HUD and PHAs reconciled budgets annually, with HUD recapturing excess funds from PHAs' reserves. Funding for tenant-based Section 8 vouchers was determined using a formula based on actual costs and inflation. PHAs could use excess funds to create new vouchers, leading to increased funding with rising costs. Unused funds recaptured from PHAs were made available to Congress for rescission. The funding system for PHAs allowed them to use excess funds to create new vouchers, known as maximized leasing. Congress provided more funds for voucher renewals than needed, recapturing unused funds the following year. In FY2003, Congress changed PHAs' funding to limit recaptures and better reflect actual usage. In FY2003, Congress changed the funding system for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to reduce recaptures of unspent funds and better reflect actual voucher usage. PHAs were now funded based on their average annual per-voucher cost from the previous year, adjusted for inflation, and multiplied by the expected number of leased vouchers. The appropriations bill changed the funding system for Public Housing Authorities in FY2003. PHAs are now funded based on their average annual per-voucher cost from the previous year, adjusted for inflation, and multiplied by the expected number of leased vouchers. The law stated that expiring section 8 tenant-based annual contributions contracts would be renewed based on the total number of unit months under lease reported in the agency's financial statement. HUD implemented a provision in P.L. 108-7 to base PHAs' budgets on their utilization rates and costs from their end-of-year statements or more recent data, adjusted for inflation and local factors. HUD implemented a provision in P.L. 108-7 to base PHAs' budgets on their utilization rates and costs from their end-of-year statements or more recent data, adjusted for inflation and local factors. Renewal calculations for voucher funding will be based on total unit months under lease and actual cost data reported on the PHA's most recent year-end settlement or submitted to HUD. Funding increments will generally be renewed for three months. HUD implemented a provision in P.L. 108-7 to base PHAs' budgets on utilization rates and costs from their end-of-year statements or recent data, adjusted for inflation and local factors. Renewal calculations for voucher funding will be based on total unit months under lease and actual cost data. Funding increments will generally be renewed for three months. Congress also created a Central Reserve fund for PHAs to replenish one-month reserves if needed. Congress created a Central Reserve fund for PHAs to replenish reserves in case of increased costs or utilization. The Secretary can use the fund for contract amendments due to higher voucher costs or increased unit months under lease. The bill introduced amendments to address increased costs or utilization of vouchers by PHAs. It also imposed restrictions on maximized leasing to prevent over-leasing by PHAs. This caused challenges for PHAs that had exceeded their authorized leasing levels. The FY2004 appropriations law continued the trend from FY2003, funding PHAs based on actual voucher utilization and restricting funds for maximized leasing to address over-leasing issues. The conference report expressed concerns about cost increases in the voucher program. The FY2004 appropriations law continued funding PHAs based on voucher utilization and restricted funds for maximized leasing. The conference report expressed concerns about cost increases in the voucher program and expected the Secretary to control costs. The language was changed to emphasize the Secretary's authority to control rising costs. The FY2004 appropriations law emphasized the Secretary's authority to control costs of renewing expiring annual contributions contracts (ACC) for public housing agencies based on unit months under lease. (H.Rept. 108-235, Title II) The FY2004 appropriations law gave the Secretary authority to control costs of renewing expiring annual contributions contracts for public housing agencies based on unit months under lease. The Central Reserve fund could be used to replenish PHA reserves depleted by increased utilization rates or costs. In FY2004, the Central Reserve fund could only be used to replenish reserves depleted due to increased utilization, not increased costs. HUD implemented this change in April 2004. HUD implemented a change in April 2004 allowing the Central Fund to be used for increased per-unit costs. PHAs' budgets were based on utilization rates and costs from end-of-the-year statements as of August 1, 2003, adjusted by the annual adjustment factor. PHAs could appeal to the Secretary if they could document rental cost discrepancies. The notice in August 2003 stated that PHAs could appeal to the Secretary if they could prove rental costs had risen higher than the inflation factor adopted by HUD. Some housing advocates argued for a broader measure of inflation. HUD granted appeals requests of 380 PHAs on August 31, 2004. HUD granted appeals requests of 380 PHAs on August 31, 2004, distributing $160 million from the Central Reserve. The final FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed funding based on PHAs' voucher costs and utilization rates as of May-July 2004. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed funding for PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates as of May-July 2004, with adjustments for new tenant protection vouchers. If data was unavailable, funding was based on earlier data or year-end financial statements as of March 31, 2004. If insufficient, the Secretary was directed to prioritize funding. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed funding for PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates from February-April 2004 data. If data was unavailable, funding was based on year-end financial statements as of March 31, 2004. The Secretary was directed to prorate agency budgets if the amount provided was insufficient. PHAs were expected to manage their voucher programs within their budgets for CY2005, with flexibility to adjust payment standards and portability policies as necessary. Agency reserves were reduced from one-month to one-week level. The FY2005 appropriations act made changes to PHAs' voucher renewal funding, shifting from federal fiscal year to calendar year funding. Additionally, agency reserves were reduced, and flexibility was given to adjust payment standards and portability policies as needed. The FY2005 appropriations act changed PHAs' voucher renewal funding from federal fiscal year to calendar year, leading to budget adjustments and guidance from HUD. HUD implemented guidance on December 8, 2004, for PHAs' voucher renewal funding transitioning to a calendar-year cycle. Agencies were notified of preliminary budget levels on December 17, 2004, with a deadline to report data errors. Appeals were limited to data errors only, not the budget calculation formula. Final budget calculations, including a proration factor, were published on January 21, 2005, with agencies funded at 4.03% less than their actual cost and utilization levels from May-July 2004, plus the 2005 AAF. The final calculations for PHAs' voucher renewal funding were published on January 21, 2005. Agencies were funded at 4.03% less than their actual cost and utilization levels from May-July 2004, plus the 2005 AAF. The proration factor of just under 96% was implemented due to insufficient funding from Congress. The median change in PHA renewal budgets from FY2004 to FY2005 was an increase of 0.17%, with a wide variance ranging from a 12% decrease to a 14% increase. HUD published Notice PIH 2005-9 on February 25, 2005, providing PHAs with options to lower costs in 2005, such as lowering payment standards, reducing utility assistance, and reviewing rents for market reasonableness. Options available to PHAs to lower costs in 2005 included lowering payment standards, reducing utility assistance, restricting portability, reviewing rents for market reasonableness, suspending voucher reissuance, restricting bedroom sizes, instituting minimum rents, monitoring income eligibility more strictly, and terminating assistance to families with insufficient funds. Funding in FY2006 was distributed using a similar formula as FY2005. In FY2006, HUD distributed renewal funding to PHAs based on CY2005 eligibility, adjusted for inflation and additional vouchers. The act also provided $45 million for budget adjustments for agencies with low leasing or costs in CY2005. In FY2006, HUD distributed renewal funding to PHAs based on CY2005 eligibility, adjusted for inflation and additional vouchers. The act provided $45 million for budget adjustments for agencies with low leasing or costs in CY2005. PHAs were funded at about 94% of their eligibility due to insufficient funding from Congress. In FY2006, HUD distributed renewal funding to PHAs based on CY2005 eligibility, adjusted for inflation and additional vouchers. PHAs were funded at about 94% of their eligibility due to insufficient funding from Congress. Changes enacted up through FY2006, particularly in FY2005 and FY2006, incentivized PHAs to reduce costs, reversing the cost growth trend seen in 2003. Average annual per voucher costs remained flat from calendar year 2004 to 2005 and declined by about 1.5%. In FY2006, HUD distributed renewal funding to PHAs based on CY2005 eligibility, adjusted for inflation and additional vouchers. PHAs were funded at about 94% of their eligibility due to insufficient funding from Congress. Changes enacted up through FY2006 incentivized PHAs to reduce costs, reversing the cost growth trend seen in 2003. Average annual per voucher costs remained flat from calendar year 2004 to 2005 and declined by about 1.5% from calendar year 2005 through September 2006. Utilization also declined, from a peak of over 98% in 2004 to around 90% as of September 2006, resulting in nearly 100,000 fewer households receiving assistance in 2006 compared to 2004. PHAs had accumulated reserve funds as most were not spending all of their funding. In 2006, there was a decrease in households receiving assistance compared to 2004. PHAs had accumulated reserve funds as they were not spending all of their funding. Budget utilization dropped nationally from over 98% in 2003 to under 92% in 2006. The debate in FY2007 continued between a \"budget-based\" and \"unit-based\" funding formula for PHAs. In FY2007, the debate continued between a budget-based and unit-based funding formula for PHAs. President Bush requested Congress to fund the voucher program using a budget-based formula similar to FY2005 and FY2006. He also asked Congress to lift the prohibition on maximized leasing due to some PHAs receiving more funding than they can use. In FY2007, President Bush requested Congress to fund the voucher program using a budget-based formula similar to previous years. Congress rejected the proposal and adopted a formula based on how much funding PHAs were using. In FY2007, Congress rejected President Bush's proposal to fund the voucher program based on a budget formula. Instead, they adopted a formula based on how much funding PHAs were using, similar to the FY2004 formula. PHAs received funding based on leasing and cost data from the most recent 12 months, adjusted for various factors, and prorated to fit within the appropriated amount. The law (P.L. 110-28) adjusted leasing and cost data for PHAs over the most recent 12 months, factoring in first-time renewal of tenant protection and HOPE VI vouchers, AAF inflation, and prorating to fit within the appropriated amount. It included a central reserve fund for adjustments due to unforeseen circumstances or formula shifts, while continuing the prohibition on over-leasing. The law (P.L. 110-28) adjusted leasing and cost data for PHAs over the most recent 12 months, factoring in first-time renewal of tenant protection and HOPE VI vouchers, AAF inflation, and prorating to fit within the appropriated amount. It included a central reserve fund for adjustments due to unforeseen circumstances or formula shifts, while continuing the prohibition on over-leasing. Additionally, the act provided exceptions for certain PHAs affected by Hurricane Katrina and those at risk of losing funding under the FY2007 formula. Agencies were funded based on FY2007 formula or FY2006 amounts, with exceptions for those under receivership or spending more in FY2006. PHAs were funded based on FY2006 usage, not received amounts, except for specific cases. Under the FY2007 formula change, PHAs were funded based on their FY2006 usage, not received amounts. Those with higher costs and utilization rates did better under the new formula, while those with lower costs did worse. Funding was sufficient to cover all PHAs at more than 105% of their eligibility. Bush's proposed FY2007 formula funded PHAs based on their FY2006 usage, with higher costs and utilization rates benefiting more. Funding was enough to cover all PHAs at over 105% of their eligibility, ensuring agencies could maintain or increase services within their caps. The formula combined unit-based and budget-based elements, allocating funds based on voucher usage and imposing caps. The FY2007 funding formula for PHAs was a combination of unit-based and budget-based elements, with funding allocations based on voucher usage and capped at a fixed budget. President Bush's FY2008 budget proposal also aimed for a strictly \"budget-based\" voucher funding formula. Bush's FY2008 budget request proposed a budget-based voucher funding formula for agencies based on their eligibility in 2007, adjusted for various factors. The President planned to update the formula with more recent data in the future, possibly in FY2009. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) adopted a cost and utilization-based funding formula for agencies, similar to FY2007. It funded agencies based on leasing and costs from the prior year, adjusted for various factors. A central reserve fund was provided for adjustments to agency budgets. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) adopted a cost and utilization-based funding formula for agencies, similar to FY2007. It funded agencies based on leasing and costs from the prior year, adjusted for various factors. A central reserve fund was provided for adjustments to agency budgets. The FY2008 Act included a rescission that reduced each PHA's funding level based on their unusable reserves exceeding 7% of the total they received in FY2007. The FY2008 Act included a rescission that reduced each PHA's funding level by the amount of their unusable reserves exceeding 7% of the total they received in FY2007, totaling $723 million in FY2008 renewal funding. The FY2008 Act rescinded $723 million in renewal funding to PHAs, freeing up unusable reserves above 7% of their funding. This allowed Congress to reduce new appropriations for voucher renewals without decreasing overall funding available to PHAs. President Bush also proposed a budget-based funding formula for FY2009. The FY2008 Act rescinded $723 million in renewal funding to PHAs, allowing Congress to reduce new appropriations for voucher renewals without decreasing overall funding available to PHAs. President Bush proposed a budget-based funding formula for FY2009, but Congress rejected it. The FY2009 omnibus funding bill directed HUD to fund PHAs based on a hybrid, cost and utilization-based formula adopted in FY2008. The FY2009 omnibus funding bill directed HUD to fund PHAs based on a hybrid, cost and utilization-based formula adopted in FY2008. PHAs were allocated funding based on leased vouchers and costs from FY2008, adjusted for inflation and other factors. The allocation was then prorated based on HUD's estimate of their Net Restricted Assets. PHAs were expected to supplement their funding with unused NRA and there was a $100 million renewal set-aside for adjustments under certain circumstances. The FY2009 omnibus funding bill directed HUD to fund PHAs based on a hybrid, cost and utilization-based formula adopted in FY2008. PHAs were allocated funding based on leased vouchers and costs from FY2008, adjusted for inflation and other factors. The allocation was then prorated based on HUD's estimate of their Net Restricted Assets. The aggregate NRA offset equaled the amount rescinded ($750 million). PHAs were expected to supplement their allocations of new funding with their unused NRA. Additionally, there was a $100 million renewal set-aside for adjustments under certain circumstances. HUD based CY2009 allocations on utilization and cost data submitted by PHAs for FY2008. HUD based CY2009 allocations on PHAs' utilization and cost data from FY2008. However, inaccuracies in estimates of costs, utilization, and NRA balances occurred due to inaccurately reported data or significant changes in agency conditions between FY2008 and CY2009. Some PHAs faced funding shortfalls in CY2009 due to inaccurate estimates from FY2008 data or changes in agency conditions. HUD estimated that 15% of PHAs administering the voucher program experienced these shortfalls. Assistance was provided through additional funding from the FY2009 renewal set-aside or administrative fee funding. As many as 15% of PHAs administering the voucher program faced funding shortfalls in CY2009. HUD worked with agencies to identify those in need and provided assistance through additional funding from the FY2009 renewal set-aside or administrative fee funding. HUD also advised agencies on cost-cutting measures to manage their budgets effectively. If a PHA lacks sufficient funding to renew all vouchers, they may have to stop issuing vouchers, potentially leading to families losing assistance. HUD urged agencies facing shortfalls to contact them before terminating assistance to families. In response to funding shortfalls in CY2009, HUD provided additional funding (up to $200 million) to PHAs at risk of terminating assistance to families. This policy change increased the set-aside renewal funding to adjust agencies' budgets. HUD urged agencies facing shortfalls to contact them before terminating assistance. In CY2009, HUD provided extra funding to PHAs to prevent assistance termination due to budget shortfalls. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget requested a funding formula similar to previous years, based on PHAs' costs and utilization. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget requested a funding formula similar to previous years, based on PHAs' costs and utilization. The biggest difference was the request for the authority to offset agencies' budgets for excess reserves and reallocate that funding to high-performing agencies or those in need. The budget also asked for the prohibition on over-leasing to be lifted. The final FY2010 funding law adopted a similar funding formula. The final FY2010 funding law (P.L. 111-117) adopted a funding formula similar to the one requested by the Administration, based on FY2009 cost and leasing data, adjusted for inflation and other factors. However, it did not provide the Secretary with the authority to offset agency budgets based on reserves or lift the prohibition on over-leasing. Unlike FY2008 and FY2009, the FY2010 allocation formula included no offset for unspent agency reserves. The FY2010 funding law did not give the Secretary authority to offset agency budgets based on reserves or lift the prohibition on over-leasing. The allocation formula included no offset for unspent agency reserves. In FY2011 and FY2012, Congress directed HUD to allocate Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher renewal funding to PHAs based on their costs and utilization. The FY2011 law contained no offset from PHA reserves, while the FY2012 law included a rescission of $650 million to be offset from allocations to PHAs with reserves above a certain level. Following funding formula changes between FY2003 and FY2006, Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) served fewer families and spent a smaller share of federal funding. Low utilization of funding and vouchers was common after the formula changes. Since the funding formula changes between FY2003 and FY2006, Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) have seen an increase in utilization, serving over 150,000 more families by the end of 2009. The shift to a hybrid cost and utilization-based model has led to improved funding utilization, reaching 95% by the end of 2009. Utilization patterns of PHAs have changed, with funding utilization increasing from 91% in 2006 to 95% by the end of 2009. By 2009, PHAs were serving over 150,000 more families than in 2006, surpassing the previous high point in families served in 2003. Reserves accumulated during budget-based formula days were spent down by the end of FY2009 due to rescissions in FY2008 and FY2009. Per voucher costs, which remained flat in CY2005 and CY2006, began rising again in CY2007 and continued through CY2009. By the end of FY2009, reserves accumulated during budget-based formula days of 2005 and 2006 had been spent down due to rescissions in FY2008 and FY2009. Per voucher costs, which remained flat in CY2005 and CY2006, started rising in CY2007 and continued through CY2009. Recent years have seen Members of Congress introducing voucher reform legislation with changes to the funding formula, similar to recent appropriations acts. The Section 8 voucher program underwent changes to the funding formula, resembling recent appropriations acts. However, the Appropriations Committees could still override the formula with a different allocation in the annual appropriations act. Prior to FY2003, the program was funded like an entitlement program with Congress determining the amount based on a formula. In FY2003, Congress enacted funding changes for the Section 8 voucher program to gain more control over cost growth, moving away from the previous entitlement-like funding formula. In FY2003, Congress enacted funding changes for the Section 8 voucher program to gain more control over cost growth. The changes converted the program's funding structure to a fixed sum model, giving Congress greater budget control but making it more challenging for PHAs to administer due to limited cost control. Many Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) faced challenges with the changes in the Section 8 voucher program's budget control. PHAs had limited control over costs due to set subsidies, but made adjustments in areas like payment standards and family selection. Some PHAs reduced payment standards, affecting future families in the program. Many PHAs adjusted payment standards and family selection for the Section 8 voucher program. Some lowered payment standards to 100% or less of local fair market rents, leading to rent reductions for landlords. PHAs could choose higher-income families from waiting lists but still had to target 75% of vouchers to low-income families. This resulted in intentional reductions in utilization rates. PHAs had the option to select higher-income families from waiting lists, but still had to target 75% of vouchers to low-income families. Some PHAs intentionally reduced utilization rates to save money, leading to budget constraints in the following year. This resulted in fewer households receiving assistance. In FY2005, PHAs faced budget constraints due to capped budgets based on costs and utilization rates from the previous year. This led to a decrease in households receiving vouchers as costs stabilized and utilization rates dropped. Some agencies received more funding than allowed, causing financial issues. In FY2005, PHAs faced budget constraints due to capped budgets based on costs and utilization rates from the previous year. HUD data shows a 1.5% decline in average voucher costs and over 2% decline in average utilization. Some agencies received more funding than allowed, leading to financial issues. Budget-based funding formulas did not decrease funding for PHAs even if costs decreased, resulting in some PHAs having funds they were not permitted to spend. Some PHAs had funds they couldn't spend due to budget constraints and capped budgets. Low-income housing advocates criticized the funding formula changes, calling for a return to an actual-cost and unit-based formula. PHA advocacy groups felt constrained by the current formula. The FY2007 funding bill reversed recent trends by enacting a voucher. The FY2007 funding bill reversed recent trends by enacting a voucher renewal funding formula similar to the one that was in place when the changes first began. PHAs were funded based on the amount of funding they were using in the previous year, rather than the amount of money they had received in the previous year. This change affected PHAs with large funding surpluses, making them eligible for less funding in FY2007. The FY2007 funding bill implemented a voucher renewal formula based on previous year's usage, impacting PHAs with large surpluses. Funding was sufficient for all PHAs to serve families, with FY2008 and FY2009 formulas closely following suit. Rescissions and offsets were included for agencies with excess reserve funding. The FY2008 and FY2009 formulas closely followed the FY2007 formula, with reductions in agency budgets for those with excess reserve funding. Rescissions and offsets made unused funding usable, reducing the appropriations needed. FY2010 and FY2011 formulas were similar, without reductions related to reserves. In FY2012, agency reserves were used to offset renewal costs. The funding model has shifted to a cost and utilization-based approach, incentivizing PHAs to increase utilization and spend all funds. In FY2012, agency reserves were used to offset renewal costs. The funding model has shifted to a cost and utilization-based approach, incentivizing PHAs to increase utilization and spend all funds. Rising costs and utilization may pressure policymakers to contain program costs, which could reduce the number of families served. Rising costs in the program may pressure policy makers to find ways to contain costs while maintaining services to families. Proposed Section 8 voucher reform aims to maximize families served without capping cost growth. Proposed Section 8 voucher reform legislation aims to serve more families while controlling cost growth, but future appropriations could override these changes."
