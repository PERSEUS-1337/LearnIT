The amended Section 65961 of the Government Code in California prohibits cities or counties from imposing new conditions on residential subdivisions within five years of final map approval. However, they are not prohibited from enforcing previously approved conditions. Local agencies can impose conditions on building permits for health and safety reasons or to comply with state or federal law. They can also withhold permits if necessary for legal compliance. The local agency can impose conditions on building permits to comply with state or federal law, assure zoning ordinance compliance, and withhold permits if necessary for legal compliance. This also applies to cities incorporating areas after January 1, 1985. The section applies to cities incorporating areas after January 1, 1985, and ensures compliance with zoning ordinances. It clarifies that conditions imposed by the city post-incorporation are those the county could have imposed if there was no incorporation. For tentative subdivision maps or parcel maps extended under specific sections, the five-year period is reduced to three years. For extended tentative subdivision maps or parcel maps, cities and counties can levy fees at the amount in effect upon building permit issuance, including fees not in zoning ordinances. Section 66452.25 is added to the Government Code. Section 66452.25 of the Government Code extends the expiration date of approved tentative maps, vesting tentative maps, or parcel maps within specific counties by 24 months if approved between January 1, 2002, and July 11, 2013. Section 66452.25 of the Government Code allows for a 24-month extension of approved tentative maps, vesting tentative maps, or parcel maps in certain counties if the application is filed at least 90 days before the expiration date. The legislative body or advisory agency can approve or conditionally approve tentative maps for a 24-month period if they are consistent with zoning and general plan requirements. If not consistent, they may deny or conditionally approve an extension. An extension can be automatically granted for 60 days or until the expiration date upon application by the subdivider. The advisory agency can deny or conditionally approve an extension for a 24-month period. If a subdivider applies for an extension before the expiration of a tentative map, it will be automatically extended for 60 days or until the application is approved, conditionally approved, or denied. If the extension is denied, the subdivider can appeal to the legislative body within 15 days. In a county, this section applies if the annual mean household income is less than 80% of the statewide annual mean income based on the federal American Community Survey. The community revitalization plan requires the annual nonseasonal unemployment rate to be at least 2.75 percent higher than the statewide rate and the poverty rate to be at least 4 percent higher than the statewide median. The extension of expiration dates for development projects is provided in addition to any existing extensions. Legislative, administrative, or other approvals by state agencies related to a development project will be extended by 24 months if not expired before the effective date of the act. The provisions of Section 65961 regarding conditions for building permits for residential subdivisions are modified for tentative maps extended under this section. No reimbursement is required for this act as local agencies can levy charges to cover mandated services. This act is an urgency statute allowing cities and counties to preserve development applications set to expire due to economic conditions in the construction industry."
