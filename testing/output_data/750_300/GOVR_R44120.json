    "content": "The House and Senate Armed Services Committees annually review national defense authorization bills with provisions affecting military personnel, retirees, and their families. Differences between the two versions are resolved by a conference committee before enactment. Congressional staff receive numerous requests for information on these bills. This report focuses on personnel-related provisions. The report highlights personnel-related issues in the House and Senate versions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. It compares differences between the two versions and summarizes selected highlights of the bill. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (FY2016 NDAA) was passed by the House of Representatives on November 5, 2015, and signed by the President on November 25, 2015. The initial bill, H.R. 1735, was passed by both the House and the Senate after the President vetoed an earlier version on October 22, 2015. The President objected to the bill providing more funding for defense-related activities than allowed under spending caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The President vetoed the NDAA on October 22, 2015, citing concerns about exceeding defense spending caps set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. He later signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, which raised spending caps for both defense and nondefense categories. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 raised spending caps for both defense and nondefense categories, allowing similar budgetary leeway. The revised FY2016 NDAA was passed by the House and Senate after modifications to comply with the new spending caps. The revised FY2016 NDAA was passed by the House and Senate after modifications to comply with new spending caps. The Congressional Budget Office issued cost estimates for the bills, and related CRS products provide detailed background information and analysis. Some issues previously addressed in the report were also discussed in the Carl Levin. In 2015, CRS products are referenced for detailed background information and analysis of issues. Contact information for CRS analysts is provided. Some issues were previously addressed in the Carl Levin and Howard P. 'Buck' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. Background information includes authorized active duty end-strengths. The Defense Authorization Act addresses military personnel issues, including authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 and subsequent increases in Army and Marine Corps personnel in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel strength. However, these increases were reversed due to the withdrawal of U.S. forces and budget constraints. End-strengths for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force have been fluctuating since 2001, with the Army having the highest authorized end-strength in FY2015. The Army and Marine Corps are planning to reduce their active personnel strength due to budget constraints and the Budget Control Act of 2011. The Army aims to decrease its active personnel to 420,000-450,000 by FY2017, while the Marine Corps plans to reduce theirs to 175,000-182,000 in the FY2017-2019 timeframe. The Administration request proposed a reduction in Army strength by 15,000 compared to FY2015. The Administration request proposed reducing Army strength by 15,000 compared to FY2015, while the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force strengths are either level or increasing. The final bill's authorized end-strengths align with the Administration's request, except for the Air Force, which is 3,715 higher. Section 402 of the initial Senate-passed bill aimed to repeal 10 U.S.C. 691, setting minimum end-strengths. The final bill's authorized end-strengths align with the Administration's request, except for the Air Force, which is 3,715 higher. Section 402 of the initial Senate-passed bill aimed to repeal 10 U.S.C. 691, setting minimum end-strengths and allowing the Secretary of Defense to reduce personnel numbers. Section 402 of the initial Senate-passed bill (H.R. 1735) aimed to allow the Secretary of Defense to reduce personnel numbers in active and reserve components by certain percentages. Section 402 of the final bill (P.L. 114-92 / S. 1356) adjusted minimum end-strengths downward by up to 10% and expanded the Secretary of Defense's authority to decrease personnel numbers by up to 2% below authorized levels. This change allows for greater flexibility in managing military personnel. The final bill adjusted minimum end-strengths downward by up to 10% and expanded the Secretary of Defense's authority to decrease personnel numbers by up to 2% below authorized levels. The overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 5% over the past 14 years. The overall authorized end strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 5% over the past 14 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. Between FY2001 and FY2015, the authorized end strengths for the Selected Reserves have seen significant shifts, with the Navy Reserve experiencing the largest decrease of -31,600 (-35.5%), followed by the Air Force Reserve with -7,258 (-9.8%), and the Coast Guard Reserve with -1,000 (-12.5%). Smaller changes were observed in the Air National Guard, Army Reserve, Army National Guard, and Marine Corps. For FY2016, the Administration proposed reductions in authorized Selected Reserve end strength for three reserve components: Army National Guard (-8,200), Army Reserve (-4,000), and Marine Corps Reserve (-300). Navy Reserve saw a proposed increase of 100. The proposed changes in Selected Reserve end strength for FY2016 include reductions for Army National Guard, Army Reserve, and Marine Corps Reserve, and increases for Navy Reserve, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve. Coast Guard Reserve's authorized strength remains unchanged. The enacted bill matched the Administration's request. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) matched the Administration's request for changes in Selected Reserve end strength for FY2016. Concerns about military personnel costs and the need to recruit and retain high-quality personnel have focused attention on the military pay raise. Section 1009 of Title 37 provides for an automatic annual increase. The military pay raise is a focus due to concerns about personnel costs and the need to recruit and retain high-quality personnel. Section 1009 of Title 37 provides for an automatic annual increase in basic pay indexed to the Employment Cost Index. The FY2016 President's Budget requested a 1.3% raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.3%. The FY2016 President's Budget requested a 1.3% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.3%. Department of Defense plans to limit pay increases through FY2020, with projected increases of 1.3% in FY2017, 1.5% in FY2018 and FY2019, and 1.8% in FY2020. The DOD Budget Request Overview stated that pay raises will be limited through FY 2020, with increases of 1.3% in FY 2017, 1.5% in FY 2018 and FY 2019, and 1.8% in FY 2020. The initial House bill did not specify the rate of increase in basic pay but supported a 2.3% military pay raise for fiscal year 2016. The committee supports a 2.3 percent military pay raise for fiscal year 2016 to keep pace with private sector pay increases, as measured by the Employment Cost Index. The initial Senate version contained a provision setting the pay increase at 1.3% for servicemembers below the O-7 paygrade. Cost Index. The final bill contained no general pay raise provision, leaving the 1.3% increase in place for servicemembers below the O-7 paygrade. President Obama invoked 37 U.S.C. 1009(e) to set the pay raise for 2016 at 1.3%, ensuring no increase in basic pay for general or flag officers. President Obama invoked 37 U.S.C. 1009(e) to set the pay raise for 2016 at 1.3%, ensuring no increase in basic pay for general or flag officers. The final bill froze the basic pay of generals and admirals at 2014 levels. The military retirement system is a funded, noncontributory, defined benefit system that provides a monthly annuity to servicemembers after 20 years of qualifying service. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 established a Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission to review military compensation and retirement systems. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) was established by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 to modernize pay and benefits for servicemembers. The Commission delivered its final report to Congress on January 29, 2015, with many proposed changes included in the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356). The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission delivered its final report and recommendations to Congress on January 29, 2015. Congress has included many proposed changes in the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356), which will transition the military retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with government matching contributions through the Thrift Savings Plan. The bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) will transition the military retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service. Existing servicemembers and those entering the military before January 1, 2018 will be grandfathered into the current system. The bill transitions the military retirement system to a blended defined-benefit, defined-contribution system with reduced benefits and continuation pay at 12 years of service. Existing servicemembers and those entering the military before January 1, 2018 will be grandfathered into the current system. Cost of Living Allowance adjustments enacted in 2013 are repealed. The issue of sexual assault in the military has received significant attention in recent years. Congress has made changes in previous NDAAs, but challenges persist. The final version of the bill addresses this issue. The FY2014 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military highlighted the prevalence of unwanted sexual contact among military personnel, with 4.3% of women and 0.9% of men experiencing such incidents in 2014. Social retaliation was reported by 53% of those who experienced unwanted sexual contact. The FY2014 DOD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military found that 4.3% of women and 0.9% of men in the military experienced unwanted sexual contact in 2014. Of those who reported unwanted sexual contact, 53% faced social retaliation, including adverse administrative action, professional retaliation, and punishment for reporting. The Government Accountability Office identified a need for the DOD to improve care for male sexual assault victims. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses concerns about retaliation and male victims of sexual assault, enhancing the Special Victims' Counsel Program and modifying requirements for judicial proceedings, reporting, and sentencing in sex-related offenses. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) addresses concerns about retaliation and male victims of sexual assault, enhancing the Special Victims' Counsel Program and modifying requirements for judicial proceedings, reporting, and sentencing in sex-related offenses. On January 24, 2013, the Department of Defense rescinded the 1994 Direct Combat Exclusion Rule to allow women in combat roles. By December 3, 2015, all military occupations were open to women with no exceptions. On December 3, 2015, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced that all military occupations were open to women with no exceptions, following the removal of the 1994 Direct Combat Exclusion Rule. Congress has established requirements for \"gender-neutral\" occupational performance standards in subsequent years. The FY2015 NDAA emphasized that DOD standards for measuring performance must be related to actual duties in a specific military occupation and measure individual capabilities. The FY2016 NDAA added criteria for developing performance standards related to combat unit readiness. The FY2016 NDAA added criteria for developing performance standards related to combat unit readiness, requiring DOD to validate unit-level performance. Changes to assignment policies for females must be notified to Congress under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7652, with a 30-day review period before implementation. The FY2016 NDAA shortened the waiting period for Congress to review changes to assignment policies for females from 30 days in continuous session to 30 calendar days. This change provides a more definitive timeline for DOD implementation and reduces the amount of in-session time needed for Congress to review and act on proposed changes. The FY2016 NDAA shortened the waiting period for Congress to review changes to assignment policies for females from 30 days in continuous session to 30 calendar days, reducing the in-session time needed for Congress to review and act on proposed changes.

The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC) found weaknesses in financial literacy programs for military servicemembers, potentially affecting servicemembers, military families, and overall readiness. Improving financial literacy could save the DOD between $13 million and $137 million annually and reduce troops involuntarily separated due to financial distress. Changes to the military retirement system could offer more options for retirement savings. Improved financial literacy could save the DOD between $13 million and $137 million annually and reduce troops involuntarily separated due to financial distress. The enacted bill includes provisions for financial literacy training at various points in a servicemember's career. Financial literacy training is required for servicemembers at different career points due to life changes or transitions. Statutory requirements for enlistment differ between active and reserve components. Contact [author name scrubbed] at x[phone number scrubbed] for more information. Enlistment in the reserve components requires individuals to be a national of the United States, a lawful permanent resident, or a person described in the Compact of Free Association. Exceptions can be made if enlistment is deemed vital to the national interest. The Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) program allows exceptions for enlistment in the reserve components if deemed vital to national interest. Enlistees must be a US citizen, lawful permanent resident, or have previous military service. Section 513 of the initial Senate-passed bill linked eligibility requirements for enlistment in the reserve component. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) did not include the provision linking eligibility requirements for enlistment in the reserve component with the active component. In 2004, Congress established the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) to provide enhanced educational benefits to reservists called to active service in response to a war or national emergency. Four years later, the Post\u20109/11 GI Bill was approved, offering more generous benefits than REAP. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission recommended terminating REAP, allowing current recipients to exhaust their entitlement. The initial Senate-passed bill adopted these recommendations. The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission recommended terminating the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP), allowing current recipients to exhaust their entitlement. The Senate-passed bill established a sunset date for REAP four years after the date of enactment, with only those using REAP in the enrollment period prior to enactment eligible to continue. The enacted bill contained the Senate provision. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 stipulated that only those using REAP in the enrollment period prior to the date of enactment could continue to use the program. Reference(s): For more information on REAP and the Post 9/11 GI Bill, see CRS Report RL30802 and CRS Report R42785. The Senate passed bill (H.R. 1735) would entitle individuals undergoing discharge to receive an official identification card to verify their past military service. Contact [author name scrubbed] at x[phone number scrubbed] for more information. The Senate passed bill (H.R. 1735) would entitle individuals undergoing discharge to receive a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" to verify their past military service. This card must identify the bearer as a veteran and include their name and a photograph. The Act also authorizes the Secretary of Defense to negotiate with national retail chains for discounts on services and consumer products. The Act entitles discharged individuals to a \"Recognition of Service ID Card\" to verify military service. The card must identify the bearer as a veteran with their name and photo. The Secretary of Defense can negotiate discounts for veterans with national retail chains. The enacted bill did not include the ID card provision, suggesting veterans can use state-issued ID cards to show their status. An alternative option for honorably discharged veterans is to use state-issued ID cards that designate veteran status. Veterans in 44 states and the District of Columbia can apply for a driver's license or state ID card with veteran status. Additionally, since January 2014, separated members of the Uniformed Services can obtain an ID card through the DOD-VA eBenefits web portal. President Obama signed the Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015 into law on July 20, 2015, requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide an identification card to veterans. President Obama signed the Veterans Identification Card Act of 2015 into law on July 20, 2015, requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide an identification card to veterans who demonstrate their military service with a DD-214 or other official document. This law aims to assist in recruiting and retaining high-quality personnel for the armed forces. Congress has an ongoing interest in recruiting and retaining high-quality personnel for the armed forces. The use of recruiting bonuses and incentives, such as educational benefits, helps attract well-qualified applicants. Section 531 of the House-passed bill would authorize service secretaries to provide additional recruitment incentives for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel. Section 531 of the House-passed bill authorizes service secretaries to develop recruitment incentives for officers, warrant officers, and enlisted personnel, subject to congressional review. When reservists are called into active federal service, they are eligible for legal protections, including the right to reemployment under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994. This act grants reemployment rights to those who leave civilian jobs for military service. The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994 grants reservists the right to reemployment after military service, with a five-year limit on cumulative service. Certain types of duty, such as reservist activations under specific authorities, are exempt from this limit. In 2011, Congress introduced new mobilization authorities for reservists in the National Defense Authorization Act. In 2011, Congress created new mobilization authorities for reservists in the National Defense Authorization Act, allowing 120-day activations for disaster response and 365-day activations for preplanned missions. These activations are not exempt from the five-year cumulative limit set by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act. The new mobilization authorities allow reservists to be activated for disaster response and preplanned missions for up to 365 days. Activations under these authorities are not exempt from the five-year cumulative limit. Section 565 of the House-passed bill exempts military duty under these authorities from counting towards the cumulative limit for reemployment protection under USERRA. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) includes provisions for reemployment protection under USERRA. A veteran is defined as someone who served in the military and was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable. For more information, refer to CRS Report RL30802. Contact [author name scrubbed] at x[phone number scrubbed]. A veteran is defined as a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service, and was discharged under conditions other than dishonorable. Active service refers to full-time service in specified branches or organizations. Active service refers to full-time service in specified branches or organizations, including the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It also includes periods of active duty for training where injuries or diseases were incurred in the line of duty, as well as inactive duty for training resulting in disabilities or deaths from injuries or certain health conditions. Members of the National Guard and reserves who are not activated for active duty military service do not meet the statutory definition of veteran, even if they qualify for reserve retirement after 20 years of service. Reservists who qualify for reserve retirement after 20 years of service may not necessarily be considered veterans unless they have completed the required active service as well. The initial House-passed bill (H.R. 1735) proposed to honor these reservists as veterans, but this designation would not grant them any additional entitlements. Reservists who qualify for reserve retirement may not be considered veterans unless they have completed the required active service. The House-passed bill proposed to honor these reservists as veterans, but this designation would not provide additional benefits. The curr_chunk provides information on various reports related to veterans' benefits, burial benefits, and retirement benefits for the Reserve Component. It also includes contact information for CRS Point of Contacts. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 established a pilot Career Intermission Program (CIP) allowing military personnel to take up to 3 years off for personal reasons or career development. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) allows military personnel to take up to 3 years off to address work/life balances or pursue broadening opportunities without negatively impacting their military career progression. The program aims to provide career flexibility for high-performing servicemembers and increase retention rates. The Career Intermission Program (CIP) was initiated by DOD to provide career flexibility for high-performing servicemembers and increase retention rates. Participants accept additional service obligations, with DOD required to report to Congress by March 1, 2016. The enacted bill would remove prohibitions on program participation. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) would remove restrictions on the Career Intermission Program (CIP) participation by members of the Armed Forces. Section 523 removes limits on the number of participants in the program. Congress has been focused on improving recruitment, retention, and career management for acquisition. Over the past few years, Congress has been concerned with improving recruitment, retention, and career management for the acquisition workforce. Some suggest additional incentives for high-performing military personnel in acquisition roles and enhanced professional military education in this area. Military acquisition professionals oversee billions of dollars for defense programs, with interest from Congress and DOD in ensuring quality. Military acquisition professionals oversee billions of dollars for defense programs, with interest from Congress and DOD in ensuring a cadre of high-performing and qualified personnel for acquisition duty assignments. The Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 created incentives for officers to be educated and experienced in joint matters, tying joint professional military education and service in joint assignments to promotions and advancement to general/flag officer ranks. Provisions in the enacted bill extend joint duty credit to include personnel seeking acquisition assignments. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) extends joint duty credit to include service in acquisition-related assignments and allows officers to pursue a dual career track in combat arms and acquisition fields. NDAA conferees encourage including acquisition matters in Phase II joint professional military education for successful performance in acquisition roles. The NDAA extends joint duty credit to include acquisition-related assignments and allows officers to pursue dual career tracks in combat arms and acquisition fields. The Secretary of Defense is encouraged to include acquisition matters in Phase II joint professional military education for successful performance in acquisition roles.

Background: Section 1585 of Title 10, United States Code authorizes the Secretary of Defense to prescribe policy and regulations regarding the carrying of firearms for DOD civilian employees and military servicemembers on military bases. Current DOD policies limit the carrying of government-issued firearms on military installations to personnel engaged in assigned duties. Military servicemembers are prohibited from carrying personal firearms on military bases and installations while on duty and under most other circumstances. Following recent active shooter incidents on military installations, questions have been raised about the adequacy of force protection measures and the need to potentially modify current DOD policies to broaden servicemembers' authority regarding carrying personal firearms on bases. The 2013 Washington Navy Yard shooting raised concerns about force protection measures at military installations. The enacted bill would give commanders more flexibility to authorize servicemembers to carry firearms for protection. The bill provides flexibility for commanders to establish protocols for servicemembers to carry firearms for force protection. The Purple Heart is awarded to Armed Forces members injured or killed in action. The Purple Heart is awarded to Armed Forces members injured or killed in action, including those wounded in terrorist attacks. However, servicemembers injured in the Oklahoma City bombing are ineligible for the Purple Heart. The Oklahoma City bombing in downtown Oklahoma City killed 168 people and injured over 650, including servicemembers from the Army Recruiting Battalion and Marine Corps Recruiting office. There is a debate over whether these servicemembers should be eligible for the Purple Heart due to the nature of the attack being domestic terrorism. Eligibility for the Purple Heart was expanded in 2015 to include servicemembers wounded and killed in the 2009 terrorist attacks at Little Rock, AR and Fort Hood, TX. Some argued that these acts should be considered terrorism due to the Muslim perpetrators' anger over U.S. actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. The eligibility for the Purple Heart was expanded in 2015 to include servicemembers wounded and killed in the 2009 terrorist attacks at Little Rock, AR and Fort Hood, TX. Section 571 of the NDAA for FY2015 redefined what should be considered an attack by a \"foreign terrorist organization\" for purposes of determining eligibility for the Purple Heart. The eligibility for the Purple Heart was expanded in 2015 to include servicemembers wounded and killed in terrorist attacks. The law specifies that an event should be considered an attack by a foreign terrorist organization if the perpetrator was in communication with the organization before the attack and if the attack was inspired or motivated by the organization. However, servicemembers who were victims of the Oklahoma City bombing will not be eligible for the Purple Heart under the enacted bill. Servicemembers who were victims of the Oklahoma City bombing will not be eligible for the Purple Heart under the enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356). The issue of military working dogs (MWDs) has received congressional and media attention over the years, leading to laws and provisions in the NDAA related to the transfer and adoption of MWDs. In November 2000, Congress passed \"Robby's Law\" (P.L. 106-446) to end the euthanizing of MWDs at the end of their useful working life and facilitate their adoption by law enforcement agencies, former handlers, and other capable individuals. The NDAA for FY2012 expanded eligibility to adopt military working dogs, including handlers, family members, and limited liability claims. Military working dogs were classified as \"equipment\" and adopters paid for transportation. The NDAA for FY2013 allowed for the transfer of retiring military working dogs for adoption, but current law does not require DOD to bring retired MWDs back to the United States. The NDAA for FY2013 allowed the transfer of retiring military working dogs for adoption, but current law does not mandate DOD to bring retired MWDs back to the United States. Section 342 of the enacted bill requires DOD to transfer retiring MWDs located overseas to the United States and prioritize adoption for former handlers. This does not change existing military policy allowing law enforcement agencies to adopt military working dogs. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires DOD to transfer retiring military working dogs located overseas to the United States and prioritize adoption for former handlers. Advocates believe changing \"may\" to \"shall\" will ensure all MWDs are retired only after being returned to the US, facilitating domestic adoption. Opponents argue that the lack of appropriated funds for the transfer will make it costly. The enacted bill requires DOD to transfer retiring military working dogs located overseas to the United States for adoption. Opponents argue that the lack of appropriated funds for the transfer will make it costly. The President's FY2015 budget proposed $1 billion in cuts to the Defense Commissary System, starting with a $200 million reduction in FY2015. However, funding was fully restored in the FY2015 NDAA, adding $100 million to the budget and requiring a study of cost reductions. The President's FY2015 budget proposed $1 billion in cuts to the Defense Commissary System, starting with a $200 million reduction in FY2015. However, funding was fully restored in the FY2015 NDAA with an additional $100 million added to the budget. The President's FY2016 budget request suggested cutting $300 million in subsidies for commissaries, reducing the budget from $1.3 billion to $400 million in three years, affecting only stateside commissaries. This could lead to reduced operating days and hours for patrons and potentially increased costs for goods and services. The FY2016 budget proposed cutting $300 million in subsidies for commissaries, reducing the budget to $400 million in three years. This could lead to reduced operating days and hours for patrons and increased costs for goods and services. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, retired personnel, disabled veterans, and DOD civilians stationed overseas. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report by March 1, 2016, outlining a plan to achieve budget-neutrality for the DeCA and military exchange system by October 1, 2018. The plan must meet benchmarks for customer service satisfaction, product quality, and discount savings for eligible patrons. The report must detail achieving budget-neutrality for the military exchange system by October 1, 2018, including potential modifications like privatization or closure of commissaries, pricing strategies, and impact on MWR programs. The Defense Secretary must analyze pricing options for commissaries, considering budget-neutrality for the military exchange system by October 1, 2018. This includes reviewing different pricing structures, potential impacts on MWR programs, and previous reports like Section 634 of P.L. 113-291. Section 634 of P.L. 113-291 required a review of management, food, and pricing options for DeCA, including using variable pricing in commissary stores, implementing a program for more private label products, converting the defense commissary system, and reducing second-destination funding. Section 652 of P.L. 114-92 requires a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program. The enacted bill requires a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program to be submitted to the Committees on Armed Services within 180 days. The FY2015 Carl Levin and Howard \"Buck\" McKeon National Defense Authorization Act includes provisions related to TRICARE, a health care program for military personnel and their families. The Administration proposed changes in the FY2016 budget request. In its FY2016 budget request, the Administration proposed changes to TRICARE, a health care program for military personnel and their families. This included replacing multiple health plan options with a consolidated plan, increasing copays for pharmaceuticals, and establishing a new enrollment fee for future enrollees in the TRICARE-for-Life program. The Administration proposed changes to TRICARE in its FY2016 budget request, including replacing multiple health plan options with a consolidated plan, increasing pharmaceutical copays, and introducing an enrollment fee for future TRICARE-for-Life enrollees. However, none of the Administration's proposals were adopted, and recommendations for TRICARE changes from the Military Compensation and Retirement Compensation Modernization Commission were not endorsed by the President or included in the House- or Senate-passed versions of H.R. 1735. Congress may still consider major TRICARE benefit changes in the future. The President did not endorse the recommendations from the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission for TRICARE changes in H.R. 1735. Congress may consider major TRICARE benefit changes in the future, but the committee feels a deliberate approach is necessary to understand the implications and unintended consequences of any reform. The committee recommends a deliberate approach to TRICARE reform legislation to understand implications and unintended consequences. Provisions in the Act aim to improve access to care, health outcomes, beneficiary experience, and control costs, laying the foundation for future comprehensive modernization. The joint explanatory statement further supports these efforts. The enacted bill (P.L. 114-92, S. 1356) supports comprehensive reform of the military health care system to improve access, quality, and experience of care for beneficiaries, maintain medical readiness, and ensure cost effectiveness. The military healthcare system is undergoing comprehensive reform to improve access, quality, and experience of care for beneficiaries, maintain medical readiness, and ensure cost effectiveness. Reevaluating all elements of the current system and implementing fee and co-pay increases are seen as necessary steps for modernization and improvement. To modernize and improve the military healthcare system, reevaluation of all elements is necessary, including fee and co-pay increases. TRICARE beneficiaries have access to a pharmacy program for outpatient prescriptions. The Senate pharmacy provision is discussed separately. Authorization Act: Selected Military Personnel Issues. TRICARE beneficiaries can access a pharmacy program through military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order pharmacy, and TRICARE retail network pharmacies.
