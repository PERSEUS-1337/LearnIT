    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act\". Congress finds that approximately 500 bird species in the United States migrate among countries, with many neotropical migratory bird populations in decline, jeopardizing their long-term survival. These species provide valuable benefits to the environment, economy, recreation, and aesthetics of the United States and the Western Hemisphere. Neotropical migratory bird populations are declining due to habitat loss and degradation, posing a threat to their long-term survival. Conservation efforts require the commitment of all countries along their migration routes. Conservation of neotropical migratory birds requires international cooperation due to their migration across borders. Initiatives to protect these birds and their habitats can be more effective with increased coordination. The purposes of this Act are to perpetuate healthy populations of neotropical migratory birds, support conservation initiatives in the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and provide financial resources for international cooperation. The Act defines \"Account\" as the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Account and \"conservation\" as methods to ensure the long-term viability of neotropical migratory bird species through population protection, habitat management, research, monitoring, and law enforcement. The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act focuses on protecting and managing bird populations, habitat maintenance and restoration, research, monitoring, law enforcement, and community outreach and education. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 5. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.
