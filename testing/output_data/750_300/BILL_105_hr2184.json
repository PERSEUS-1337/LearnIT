    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Private Security Officer Quality Assurance Act of 1997\". Congress finds that private security officers in the United States are growing rapidly and function as an adjunct to public law enforcement. The industry provides opportunities for entry-level job applicants and protects individuals and property. Private security officers protect individuals and property in various operations such as banks, hospitals, airports, and residential properties. Sworn law enforcement officers provide essential services in public areas, supplemented by private security officers. Private security officers provide prevention and reporting services in support of sworn law enforcement officers in public areas. With the growth of private shopping malls, the public is more likely to interact with private security personnel than sworn police officers. The reduction in public shopping streets has led to more contact with private security personnel than sworn law enforcement officers. The growth of security services has increased as the number of public sector law enforcement officers has decreased, serving public policy goals in combating serious crimes. Private security personnel growth serves public policy goals by providing more officers to combat serious crimes. The public struggles to differentiate between sworn law enforcement officers and private security personnel, but demands well-trained security personnel as a supplement, not a replacement for law enforcement. Private security personnel should be thoroughly screened, especially since many of them carry weapons, to meet the demands of the American public as a supplement to, not a replacement for, sworn law enforcement officers.
