    "content": "More than 53,000 commercial vessels travel the world's waters, regulated by international protocols and U.S. laws to prevent pollution and protect marine resources. However, there are gaps in regulations, enforcement concerns, and varying jurisdictional definitions. The cruise industry, representing a small fraction of the global shipping industry, has drawn public attention to environmental impacts. Passenger ships make up 13% of the world shipping fleet as of October 2010. The cruise industry, comprising a small fraction of the global shipping industry, is a significant contributor to the U.S. economy, providing $40 billion in benefits in 2009 and creating over 357,000 U.S. jobs. The industry has faced scrutiny for its environmental impacts, with the worldwide cruise ship fleet consisting of more than 230 ships hosting an estimated 14.3 million passengers in 2010. Since 1990, the worldwide cruise industry has seen significant growth, with an average annual growth rate of 7.4% in the number of passengers. The fleet consists of over 230 ships, mostly foreign-flagged, with Liberia and Panama being popular flag countries. Foreign-flag cruise vessels owned by six companies dominate U.S. waters, accounting for nearly 95% of passenger ships. The industry continues to add larger, more luxurious ships each year, increasing the average ship size over the past two decades. The cruise industry has been growing significantly since 1990, with over 230 ships, mostly foreign-flagged, dominating U.S. waters. New ships are added each year, increasing in size and luxury. The average ship size has been increasing by roughly 90 feet every five years, with ships over 1,050 feet long and weighing more than 130,000 tons entering the market from 2008 to 2011. Safety and health are key concerns for the industry, as cruise ships are compared to \"floating cities\" carrying thousands of passengers and crew. The cruise ship industry faces the challenge of proving its safety and health standards to the public and visited communities. Large cruise ships can generate significant amounts of sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, solid waste, and oily bilge water during a one-week voyage. The cruise ship industry generates large amounts of sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, solid waste, and oily bilge water during voyages, posing risks to human health and the environment. Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of laws for managing these wastes, with weak enforcement noted in a 2000 GAO report. The 2000 GAO report highlighted issues with cruise ships' compliance with environmental regulations, revealing 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters between 1993 and 1998. 83% of these cases involved oil or oil-based product discharges, ranging from a few drops to hundreds of gallons. During a six-year period, GAO reviewed waste streams from cruise ships, finding that 83% of cases involved oil or oil-based product discharges, with volumes ranging from a few drops to hundreds of gallons. 72% of the discharges were accidental, 15% intentional, and 13% undetermined. Cruise ships accounted for 4% of the 2,400 illegal discharge cases by foreign-flag ships during the study period. The GAO found that cruise ships accounted for 4% of the 2,400 illegal discharge cases by foreign-flag ships over six years. Despite being a small percentage, some cruise ship pollution cases have resulted in criminal prosecutions and large fines. Environmental groups petitioned the EPA in 2000 to address pollution from cruise ships. In 2000, environmental groups petitioned the EPA to investigate pollution from cruise ships, leading to the agency issuing a background document and later a cruise ship discharge assessment report in December 2008. In response to a petition from environmental groups in 2000, the EPA issued a background document and a cruise ship discharge assessment report in December 2008. The report summarized waste streams and findings from data collection on cruise ship pollution, including options to address ship discharges. This report provides information on cruise ship pollution, including the various waste streams and contaminants generated by cruise ships. It discusses the complex body of international and domestic laws addressing this issue, with some wastes covered by international standards and others subject to U.S. law. The report also highlights federal and state legislative activities related to cruise ships in Alaskan waters and other states. The report discusses federal and state legislative activities regarding cruise ships in Alaskan waters and other states. Cruise ship companies have implemented waste management plans to prevent illegal waste discharges, with environmental critics calling for stricter regulations. Environmental groups supported the Clean Cruise Ship Act in the 109th and 110th Congresses to enforce higher standards for waste disposal. Environmental groups have petitioned the federal government for stronger regulation of cruise ship waste, endorsing legislation for stricter standards in controlling wastewater and other discharges. Cruise ships generate various waste streams, including sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, oily bilge water, ballast water, and solid waste, as well as emitting air pollutants. Legislation introduced in the 111th Congress aimed at addressing these issues, but no action was taken. Cruise ships produce various waste streams such as sewage, graywater, hazardous wastes, oily bilge water, ballast water, and solid waste, along with emitting air pollutants. Improper treatment and disposal of these wastes can pose risks to human health and aquatic life. Despite this, it is important to note that cruise ships are a small part of the international shipping industry. Cruise ships, while a small part of the international shipping industry, produce various waste streams that can threaten human health and damage aquatic life. Specific types of waste, such as sewage, graywater, and solid waste, are of greater concern for cruise ships due to the large numbers of passengers and crew they carry. Additionally, cruise ships tend to concentrate their activities in specific coastal areas and visit the same ports repeatedly. Cruise ships, with their large numbers of passengers and crew, produce significant amounts of waste, including blackwater which contains harmful bacteria and viruses. The cumulative impact of their activities in specific coastal areas can be significant. Large-volume releases of blackwater, which is sewage containing harmful bacteria and viruses, can contaminate fisheries and shellfish beds, posing risks to public health. Nutrients in sewage can lead to excessive algal growth, depleting oxygen in the water and causing harm to aquatic life. Cruise ships generate significant amounts of sewage, with a large ship producing up to 15,000 gallons per day. Cruise ships generate large amounts of sewage, including graywater with various pollutants like bacteria, detergents, and oils. This can lead to excessive algal growth, oxygen depletion, and harm to aquatic life. Untreated graywater from cruise ships contains a variety of pollutants, including fecal coliform bacteria, detergents, oil, grease, metals, organics, petroleum hydrocarbons, nutrients, food waste, and medical/dental waste. EPA and Alaska state sampling found that levels of fecal coliform bacteria in cruise ship graywater can be one to three times higher than in untreated domestic wastewater. Cruise ships generate an average of 67 gallons/day/person of graywater, compared to 51 gallons/person/day for residential graywater. Cruise ships generate a large amount of graywater, which contains pollutants such as nutrients and oxygen-demanding materials. Graywater is the main liquid waste produced by cruise ships, making up 90%-95% of the total waste. Solid waste generated on ships includes glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, steel cans, and plastics, which can be hazardous. Solid waste entering the ocean can harm marine life. Solid waste generated on cruise ships includes glass, paper, cardboard, aluminum, steel cans, and plastics, which can be hazardous. It may become marine debris, posing a threat to marine life, humans, and coastal communities. Cruise ships manage solid waste through source reduction, waste minimization, and recycling, but up to 75% is incinerated on board, with the ash discharged at sea. On cruise ships, solid waste is managed through source reduction, waste minimization, and recycling. However, up to 75% of solid waste is incinerated on board, with the ash typically discharged at sea. This disposal method can harm marine life like mammals, fish, sea turtles, and birds. Each cruise ship passenger generates around two pounds of non-hazardous solid waste per day, resulting in a significant amount of waste being generated daily on large cruise ships. Large cruise ships generate massive amounts of solid waste, with each passenger producing two pounds of non-hazardous waste per day. About 8 tons of solid waste are generated during a one-week cruise on a large ship. Cruise ships contribute to 24% of the solid waste generated by vessels worldwide. Most cruise ship garbage is treated on board, but when off-loaded, they can strain port reception facilities. Cruise ships generate hazardous waste from various activities onboard, including photo processing and equipment cleaning. This waste includes chemicals, medical waste, batteries, fluorescent lights, and paints. Port reception facilities can be strained when cruise ships off-load waste that cannot be treated onboard. Cruise ships generate hazardous waste from activities like photo processing and equipment cleaning, which include discarded chemicals, medical waste, batteries, fluorescent lights, and paints. These wastes contain substances like hydrocarbons, heavy metals, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. The toxicity of these wastes to marine organisms can be significant if not managed carefully. Hazardous waste on cruise ships, such as batteries and pharmaceuticals, can be toxic to marine organisms. Oil leaks from engine spaces can harm fish and wildlife, posing threats to human health. Bilge water in ships can contain harmful substances like oil, gasoline, and pollutants that can harm marine life and pose risks to human health. Chemicals in the water, including detergents and degreasers, can be toxic to marine organisms if discharged. The amount of pollutants varies depending on the size of the ship, with larger vessels often having additional waste streams. Large vessels, like cruise ships, generate significant amounts of oily bilge water containing harmful substances like oil and pollutants. To maintain ship stability and prevent hazards, bilge spaces need to be flushed and pumped dry periodically. Chemicals used for cleaning the engine room can be toxic to marine organisms if discharged, posing a threat to the environment. To maintain ship stability and prevent hazards, bilge spaces on large vessels need to be flushed and periodically pumped dry to eliminate oily bilge water. The extracted oil can be reused, incinerated, or off-loaded in port. If a separator is faulty or bypassed, untreated oily bilge water could be discharged into the ocean, causing damage to marine life. EPA states that bilge water is the most common source of oil pollution. Cruise ships and other large vessels use ballast water to stabilize during transport. Bilge water, if untreated and discharged into the ocean, can harm marine life. EPA identifies bilge water as a major source of oil pollution from cruise ships, leading to environmental violations for some cruise lines. Cargo ships, tankers, and bulk carriers rely on ballast water to stabilize the vessel during transport by compensating for changes in weight as cargo is loaded or unloaded. However, the discharge of ballast water often contains various biological materials, including plants, animals, viruses, and bacteria. Ballast water discharge from ships contains a variety of biological materials, including non-native species that can harm aquatic ecosystems. This poses risks to public health, the environment, and industries such as water utilities, fisheries, agriculture, and tourism. Cruise ships are a major source of invasive species in U.S. marine waters, leading to public health, environmental, and economic risks. The introduction of pest mollusks alone costs about $2.2 billion per year to aquatic ecosystems. Further research is needed to understand the role of cruise ships in introducing non-native species. Air pollution from cruise ships is a significant issue, with diesel engines burning high sulfur fuel and emitting harmful pollutants. EPA classifies diesel exhaust as a likely human carcinogen, contributing to air quality problems and visibility degradation. Further study is needed to determine the impact of cruise ships on introducing non-native species. EPA classifies diesel exhaust from marine diesel engines as a likely human carcinogen, contributing to air quality issues such as visibility degradation, haze, acid deposition, and water pollution. Ocean-going vessels are significant contributors to nitrogen oxide, particulate, and sulfur dioxide emissions in the United States. Ships are a major source of emissions, including nitrogen oxides, particulates, and sulfur dioxide in the United States. International shipping also contributes to global carbon dioxide emissions and emits black carbon and nitrogen oxides, impacting climate change. Shipping, including maritime vessels, contributed 2.7% of global carbon dioxide emissions in 2007. Vessels also emit significant amounts of black carbon and nitrogen oxides, impacting climate change. Environmental pressures on maritime vessels have come from states and localities assessing their contribution to regional air quality problems. Vessel emissions occur at sea but can impact areas far inland. Cruise ship emissions, although a small fraction of the world shipping fleet, may have a significant impact. Cruise ship emissions, although a small fraction of the world shipping fleet, may exert significant impacts on specific coastal areas. Shipboard incinerators burn large volumes of waste, producing ash that must be disposed of and may release toxic emissions. Various waste streams on cruise ships are regulated by international protocols and U.S. laws. Incinerators on cruise ships burn waste, producing ash that needs disposal and may release toxic emissions. Waste streams on cruise ships are regulated by international protocols and U.S. laws, with oversight from the International Maritime Organization. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) sets international maritime vessel safety and marine pollution standards. Cruise ships flagged under MARPOL signatory countries must comply with its requirements, regardless of where they sail. Member nations are responsible for vessels registered under their nationalities. Ships flagged under MARPOL signatory countries must comply with its requirements, regardless of where they sail. Member nations are responsible for vessels registered under their nationalities. The Convention's Annexes cover various sources of pollution from ships, but ratification and implementation by sovereign states are necessary to protect the marine environment. Annex I to VI of MARPOL cover regulations for preventing pollution by oil, noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage, and garbage from ships. Sovereign states must ratify and implement these regulations to protect the marine environment. Annex I to VI of MARPOL regulate pollution prevention from ships, including sewage and garbage disposal. Annex VI limits emissions from marine vessels and prohibits ozone-depleting substances. Compliance is voluntary unless ratified by a majority of member countries based on gross tonnage. Amendments can be proposed by ratified parties. The MARPOL Convention requires ratification by member countries representing at least 50% of the world's gross tonnage for amendments to be binding. All six Annexes have been ratified, with the most recent being Annex VI in 2005. The United States has ratified Annexes I, II, III, V, and VI but has not taken action on Annex IV. Flag states are responsible for certifying ships' compliance with MARPOL regulations. The United States has ratified Annex VI of the MARPOL Convention, which took effect in May 2005. The country where a ship is registered is responsible for certifying compliance with pollution prevention standards. IMO has established various conventions addressing issues like ballast water management and passenger safety. Each signatory nation must enact domestic laws to implement the convention and comply with related laws of other nations. The United States ratified Annex VI of the MARPOL Convention in May 2005, implementing guidelines for passenger safety and pollution prevention. Each signatory nation enacts domestic laws to comply with the convention and related laws of other nations. In April 2006, the Senate ratified Annex VI, regulating air pollution, and in July 2008, Congress took further action. In April 2006, the Senate ratified Annex VI of MARPOL, regulating air pollution. In July 2008, Congress approved legislation to implement the standards through EPA regulations in consultation with the U.S. Coast Guard. The United States also participated in negotiations to strengthen Annex VI, resulting in amendments in October 2008. The United States ratified Annex VI of MARPOL in April 2006 to regulate air pollution. In October 2008, amendments were made to Annex VI through international negotiations. The APPS legislation applies to all U.S.-flagged and foreign-flagged vessels in U.S. waters, with the Coast Guard responsible for enforcing regulations. The regulatory mechanism under APPS for MARPOL implementation is separate from other federal environmental laws. The Coast Guard enforces regulations under APPS for MARPOL implementation in U.S. waters. The international nature of maritime shipping poses challenges in enforcing MARPOL. The U.S. can take enforcement action against foreign-flagged ships for pollution discharge incidents. The United States can enforce international standards on ships and detain noncompliant vessels. Enforcement actions can be taken under U.S. laws for pollution incidents within U.S. jurisdiction, while cases outside U.S. jurisdiction are referred to flag states. Coordination between the Coast Guard, State Department, and flag states is crucial, with a poor response rate from flag states noted in a 2000 GAO report. The United States enforces international standards on ships and detains noncompliant vessels. Coordination between the Coast Guard, State Department, and flag states is crucial, with a poor response rate from flag states noted in a 2000 GAO report. Multiple federal agencies have jurisdiction over cruise ships in U.S. waters, with the U.S. Coast Guard, EPA, and Department of Justice playing key roles in regulation and enforcement. The U.S. Coast Guard, EPA, and Department of Justice have key regulatory responsibilities for enforcing federal laws on ships. The Department of State represents the U.S. at international meetings and treaty negotiations. Other agencies like NOAA and APHIS have limited roles in reporting on marine debris and ensuring quarantine inspection. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) collaborates with the Coast Guard and EPA to monitor marine debris effects. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) oversees quarantine inspection and disposal of food-contaminated garbage. States and localities may also have responsibilities. U.S. laws and regulations, including the Clean Water Act, govern cruise ship discharges to protect water bodies. The Clean Water Act (CWA) is a key U.S. law regulating pollutant discharges, including those from cruise ships. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program controls discharges from point sources like vessels. Sewage discharges from cruise ships are exempt from certain regulations under the act. In accordance with the NPDES program, pollutant discharges from vessels are prohibited without a permit. Sewage discharges from cruise ships are exempt from this rule but are prohibited from dumping untreated sewage within 3 miles of shore under Section 312 of the Clean Water Act, enforced by the EPA and Coast Guard. Under Section 312 of the Clean Water Act, cruise ships are prohibited from dumping untreated sewage within 3 miles of shore. The EPA and Coast Guard enforce this regulation, requiring vessels with installed toilets to have marine sanitation devices (MSDs) to prevent discharge of untreated sewage. EPA sets performance standards for MSDs, while the Coast Guard oversees MSD design, operation regulations, and compliance certification. The EPA and Coast Guard regulate marine sanitation devices (MSDs) on cruise ships to prevent discharge of untreated sewage. MSDs are designed to hold or treat sewage before discharge, with Type II MSDs treating waste chemically or biologically to meet specific limits. Large vessels, including cruise ships, use Type II or Type III MSDs for compliance with regulations. Large vessels, including cruise ships, use Type II or Type III MSDs for sewage treatment. Type II MSDs treat waste chemically or biologically to meet specific limits, while Type III MSDs store waste for later treatment onshore or outside U.S. waters. Type I MSDs disinfect sewage with chemicals and are mainly found on recreational vessels. Type I MSDs use chemicals to disinfect raw sewage before discharge, meeting a fecal coliform bacteria standard of 1,000 per 100 milliliters and no visible solids. These MSDs are mainly on recreational vessels under 65 feet. Regulations, unchanged since 1976, lack requirements for sampling, monitoring, or reporting effluent discharges. Critics note deficiencies in regulating cruise ships and large vessels, as MSD rules only cover bacterial contaminants and suspended solids. Critics highlight issues with the regulatory structure for cruise ships and large vessels. MSD regulations only address bacterial contaminants and suspended solids, while NPDES permits cover a wider range of pollutants. NPDES permit holders must adhere to sampling, monitoring, and reporting requirements, unlike MSD rules. The Coast Guard, responsible for enforcing MSD compliance, has faced criticism for its oversight. The Coast Guard, responsible for enforcing MSD compliance, has been criticized for poor enforcement of Section 312 requirements. In a 2000 report, the GAO highlighted that inspectors rarely have time to inspect sewage treatment equipment on cruise ships for proper functioning. Various factors limit the ability of Coast Guard inspectors to detect violations of environmental laws and rules. The GAO reported limitations in Coast Guard inspectors' ability to detect violations of environmental laws, including focus on safety, large ship size, limited time and staff for inspections, and lack of surprise element in inspections. The Coast Guard has a wide range of responsibilities including homeland security and non-homeland security tasks. Since the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Coast Guard has shifted focus to homeland security activities, reducing resources for vessel inspections for environmental compliance. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from ships. Less Coast Guard time and resources available for vessel inspections for MSD or environmental compliance due to focus on security activities. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from vessels, requiring sewage treatment plants or holding tanks. US has not ratified Annex IV, making its requirements not mandatory in US waters. Annex IV of MARPOL regulates sewage discharges from vessels, requiring sewage treatment systems or holding tanks. While not mandatory in U.S. waters due to non-ratification, ships must comply within three miles of shore with certified treatment systems, and between three and 12 miles with maceration or chlorination. Annex IV of MARPOL mandates sewage treatment for vessels within three miles of shore using certified systems, and between three and 12 miles with maceration or chlorination. Beyond 12 miles, sewage discharges are unrestricted, with the option for vessels to follow less stringent requirements in certain jurisdictions. In U.S. waters, ships must adhere to Clean Water Act regulations, with some cruise ships using Advanced Wastewater Treatment systems, especially in Alaskan waters. In U.S. waters, cruise ships must comply with Clean Water Act regulations, including Section 312 which addresses sewage treatment. Some ships in Alaskan waters use Advanced Wastewater Treatment systems for improved sewage treatment, but they are only moderately effective in removing dissolved metals and nutrients. Section 312 of the Clean Water Act regulates sewage treatment on cruise ships in U.S. waters. Advanced Wastewater Treatment systems are effective in removing various substances from sewage, but less so for dissolved metals and nutrients. States can establish no-discharge zones to prohibit sewage discharge from vessels with installed toilets within their jurisdiction. EPA approval is required for creating these zones to protect waters from sewage discharges. To create a no-discharge zone for sewage from vessels with installed toilets, states must apply to the EPA under specific categories based on environmental protection needs. This designation has been used for waters in 26 states, including inland areas, to ensure adequate pumpout facilities for safe sewage removal. No-discharge zones (NDZ) are designated for various environmental protection needs, including special waters like shellfish beds or drinking water intake zones. These zones prohibit the discharge of sewage from vessels and ensure pumpout availability. NDZ have been established in 26 states, including inland areas, to protect environmentally sensitive areas. The NDZ designation has been used to protect specific areas like state waters within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the Boundary Waters Canoe area of Minnesota. It prohibits sewage discharge into drinking water intake zones without the need to prove pumpout availability. The Hudson River in New York is also protected under this designation. The EPA has suggested various options in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report to address sewage from cruise ships, including revising discharge standards, restricting discharge within a certain distance from shore, and requiring wastewater sampling and testing. Several options to address sewage from cruise ships include revising discharge standards, restricting discharge within a certain distance from shore, requiring wastewater sampling and testing, and imposing uniform requirements on all ships as a condition of port entry and within U.S. waters. Graywater is not defined as a pollutant under current federal law, and there are no separate federal effluent standards for graywater discharges. Under current federal law, graywater is not defined as a pollutant, and there are no separate federal effluent standards for graywater discharges. The Clean Water Act includes graywater in its definition of sewage for regulating commercial vessels in the Great Lakes. In Alaska, graywater must be treated before discharge into state waters. EPA issued a general permit in 2008. The rules in Alaska and under the EPA's general permit prescribe limits for bacterial contaminant content and total suspended solids in graywater. Graywater must be treated before discharge into Alaska's waters, and similar restrictions apply to large commercial vessels, including cruise ships. NOAA can designate National Marine Sanctuaries where graywater discharges may be restricted to protect sensitive ecosystems. The National Marine Sanctuaries Act authorizes NOAA to designate areas where graywater discharges may be restricted to protect sensitive ecosystems. NOAA regulations restrict such discharges in specific marine sanctuaries like Monterey Bay and Florida Keys. EPA identified options for addressing graywater discharges in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report. In the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report, EPA outlined options for addressing graywater discharges, including setting standards, geographic restrictions, monitoring, and penalties. Cruise ship waste discharges are regulated by the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act, which prohibits dumping garbage into ocean waters without a permit. The Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) prohibits cruise ships from dumping garbage into ocean waters without a permit. EPA issues permits for regulating disposal at sea, excluding dredged material disposal which is managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. No MPRSA permit is needed for cruise ships outside U.S. jurisdiction. The Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) requires permits for regulating disposal of materials at sea, excluding dredged material disposal managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Cruise ships do not need an MPRSA permit for discharging solid waste outside U.S. jurisdiction. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) also applies to cruise ships, prohibiting garbage discharge within 3 nautical miles of shore. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) prohibits garbage discharge from cruise ships within certain distances from shore, including plastic waste. It applies to all vessels in U.S. navigable waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), enforced by the Coast Guard through inspection programs. The Coast Guard enforces the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) in U.S. navigable waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to prevent garbage discharge from cruise ships. The EPA has identified discharges of solid waste and plastic from cruise ships, leading to evaluations by the IMO to amend Annex V of MARPOL. Possible solutions include enhancing on-board garbage handling technologies and implementing stronger waste management plans for the cruise industry. Possible options to address solid waste from cruise ships include increasing the use of on-board garbage handling technologies, implementing stronger waste management plans, prohibiting discharge of incinerator ash into U.S. waters, expanding port reception facilities, and enforcing no discharge of solid waste into the marine environment through monitoring and sanctions. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) governs hazardous waste management. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) is the primary federal law governing hazardous waste management, controlling waste from generation to disposal. Hazardous waste is defined as ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic, or listed industrial process waste streams and commercial products. Treatment, storage, and disposal are regulated under this act. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulates hazardous waste management for generators, transporters, and disposal facilities. Hazardous waste is defined as ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic, or listed industrial process waste streams and commercial products. Treatment, storage, and disposal facilities must have permits and comply with EPA regulations. Cruise ship operators may be subject to RCRA rules as generators or transporters of hazardous waste. Issues for the cruise ship industry include proper identification and handling of hazardous waste. Issues that the cruise ship industry may face regarding RCRA rules include identifying hazardous waste generated onboard, determining the roles of parties involved, and ensuring compliance with RCRA requirements for storage and offloading of hazardous waste. Various activities on cruise ships produce hazardous wastes and toxic substances that are typically regulated under RCRA. Cruise ships generate hazardous wastes and toxic substances during activities like cleaning, painting, and passenger services. These wastes need to be offloaded for recycling or disposal in accordance with RCRA regulations, but it is unclear which rules apply to their management and disposal. Chemicals used for ship maintenance and passenger services create hazardous wastes. Regulations for managing and disposing of these wastes are unclear, especially for cruise ships. RCRA rules are less stringent for small-quantity generators (100-1,000 kg/month) compared to large-quantity generators (>1,000 kg/month). Cruise companies argue they generate less than 100 kg/month, potentially falling into a third category. Some cruise companies argue they generate less than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste per month, potentially falling into a third category with less rigorous requirements. The release of hazardous substances by cruise ships could trigger environmental laws like CERCLA, but it has not been used in response to cruise ship releases. A release of hazardous substances by a cruise ship could potentially trigger the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), requiring immediate notification of any release above regulatory thresholds into US waters. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) mandates notification for releases of hazardous substances above regulatory thresholds into US waters. EPA has identified 500 wastes as hazardous substances and set rules for reportable quantities, including releases as small as 1 pound of certain substances. EPA may require notification for releases that could pose a substantial danger to public health, welfare, or the environment. The CERCLA authorizes the President to take remedial action for releases of hazardous substances, including those as small as 1 pound. Hazardous waste discharges from cruise ships are also regulated under the Clean Water Act. EPA identified options for addressing hazardous wastes in a 2008 report. In the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report, EPA identified options for addressing hazardous wastes, including establishing standards or BMPs to decrease contaminants in hazardous wastes, prohibiting discharge of hazardous materials into U.S. waters up to the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone, increasing inspections on cruise ships, and inspecting authorized facilities receiving cruise ship hazardous wastes under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of hazardous materials into U.S. waters up to the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone. Coast Guard regulations also prohibit oil discharge within 12 miles from shore. Coast Guard regulations prohibit oil discharge within 12 miles from shore, unless passed through a 15-ppm oil water separator and without causing a visible sheen. Beyond 12 miles, oil can be discharged if the content is less than 100 ppm while en route. Vessels must maintain an Oil Record Book for disposal of oily residues and bilge water. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) implements MARPOL Annex I regulations on oil pollution for all U.S. flagged and foreign flagged vessels in U.S. waters. Coast Guard regulations prohibit oil discharge within 12 nautical miles of land, except if oil content is less than 100 ppm while en route. Vessels must keep an Oil Record Book for disposal of oily residues and bilge water. The Coast Guard implements regulations under the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) to prohibit oil discharge within 12 nautical miles of land for vessels in U.S. waters. However, these regulations have limited applicability to cruise ship operations due to most cruise lines being foreign registered. The APPS regulations have limited applicability to cruise ship operations. Most cruise lines restrict discharges of machinery space waste within three miles from shore. EPA identified options for addressing oily bilge water from cruise ships in the 2008 Discharge Assessment Report, such as establishing standards, researching alternative lubricants, treating effluents to meet standards, establishing penalties for noncompliance, banning discharge into U.S. waters, or revising inspection practices. Clean Water Act regulations had exempted since the 1970s. In response to the growing issue of invasive species introduced into U.S. waters via ballast water, in January 1999, various organizations petitioned the EPA to repeal the exemption for ballast water discharge from NPDES permit requirements. In January 1999, organizations petitioned the EPA to repeal the exemption for ballast water discharge from NPDES permit requirements, citing concerns about invasive species. EPA rejected the petition in September 2003, maintaining that ballast water is excluded from the Clean Water Act's Section 402 permit program. The EPA rejected a petition in September 2003 to repeal the exemption for ballast water discharge from NPDES permit requirements. The agency cited the \"normal operation\" exclusion as a long-standing policy that Congress has supported twice. Efforts to limit ballast water discharges have become mandatory since 2004. Efforts to limit ballast water discharges by vessels became mandatory in 2004. Environmental groups filed a lawsuit to rescind the regulation exempting ballast water discharges from CWA permitting. A federal court ruled in favor of the groups in 2005, ordering the regulation to be set aside by September 30, 2008. The ruling was upheld on appeal in July 2008. In 2005, a federal court ruled in favor of environmental groups challenging EPA's permitting exemption for ballast water discharges. The court ordered the regulation to be set aside by September 30, 2008, which was upheld on appeal in July 2008. The ruling applies to other vessel discharges covered by the exemption for \"discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels,\" including graywater and bilge water. EPA was mandated to rescind the exemption in response to the court's order. EPA will rescind the exemption for vessel discharges, including graywater and bilge water, following a court order. In December 2008, EPA issued the Vessel General Permit (VGP) for large recreational and commercial vessels, including tankers, freighters, barges, and cruise ships. The VGP applies to pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels. The VGP applies to pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels that are 79 feet or more in length, and to ballast water discharges from commercial vessels of less than 79 feet and commercial fishing vessels of any length. It covers discharges into U.S. waters in all states and territories up to the 3-mile territorial limit, identifying 26 types of waste streams from vessel operations. The VGP applies to pollutant discharges from non-recreational vessels over 79 feet in length, including ballast water discharges from smaller commercial vessels and fishing vessels. It covers discharges into U.S. waters up to the 3-mile territorial limit, addressing 26 types of waste streams from vessel operations, including aquatic nuisance species, nutrients, pathogens, oil, grease, metals, and toxic pollutants. Best management practices described in the permit help control most waste streams. The VGP primarily relies on existing Coast Guard requirements to control ballast water discharges and provides BMPs for controlling bilge water discharges. Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements apply. The VGP provides BMPs for controlling bilge water discharges in Pacific nearshore areas. Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements apply. The permit does not cover sewage discharges regulated under CWA Section 312 or toxic wastes from passenger services on cruise ships. Cruise ships have more detailed requirements for certain discharges like graywater and pool/spa water. The VGP imposes strict regulations on cruise ships, including detailed requirements for discharges like graywater and pool/spa water. It also includes operational limits on graywater discharges in nutrient-impaired waters. Toxic wastes from passenger services on cruise ships are not permitted under the VGP. The 110th Congress considered legislation for uniform national approach on ballast water discharge issues to address aquatic nuisance species, opposed by some groups for preempting state rules. The 110th Congress considered legislation (S. 1578 and H.R. 2830) to regulate species in ballast water, but faced opposition for preempting state rules and lacking citizen suit provisions. No further action was taken on the legislation. The Clean Air Act is a federal law addressing air quality concerns, setting health-based standards for ambient air quality and national emission standards for air pollution sources. Cruise ship emissions were unregulated until February 2003 when EPA established emission standards for marine diesel engines on large vessels. In February 2003, the EPA established emission standards for new marine diesel engines on large vessels, including cruise ships, in response to a petition from the environmental group Bluewater Network. The standards are equivalent to internationally negotiated standards for nitrogen oxides. The EPA established emission standards for large vessels and cruise ships in response to a petition from Bluewater Network. The rule aligns with internationally negotiated standards for nitrogen oxides and is part of EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act. The EPA established emission standards for large vessels and cruise ships in response to a petition from Bluewater Network. The rule, under Section 213(a) of the Clean Air Act, regulates emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles, including large marine vessel engines. EPA plans to implement more stringent standards for very large marine engines and vessels in the future to align with international efforts through the IMO. The EPA established emission standards for large vessels and cruise ships in response to a petition from Bluewater Network. The agency plans to implement stricter standards for very large marine engines and vessels in the future to align with international efforts through the IMO. Environmental groups criticized the EPA for excluding foreign-flagged vessels from the rules, which were upheld in federal court in 2004. The EPA faced criticism for excluding foreign-flagged vessels from marine diesel engine rules, which were upheld in federal court in 2004. The agency stated it would consider including foreign vessels in future rulemaking for more stringent standards. The 110th Congress implemented legislation to align with MARPOL Annex VI, and the IMO adopted amendments for new global nitrogen oxide and fuel sulfur standards starting in 2011 and 2012. In October 2008, the IMO adopted amendments to Annex VI to establish new global nitrogen oxide and fuel sulfur standards starting in 2011 and 2012. The United States supported these amendments, and in December 2009, the EPA made changes to the 2003 CAA rules for Category 3 marine engines to align with the IMO requirements and set emissions standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. In December 2009, EPA aligned the 2003 CAA rules for Category 3 marine engines with IMO revisions, setting emissions standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The rule applies to newly built engines on U.S.-flagged vessels. EPA can enforce nitrogen oxide limits on foreign vessels through MARPOL Annex VI and the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships. In October 2010, the IMO approved the U.S. request to designate waters in the U.S. Caribbean. In October 2010, the IMO approved a U.S. request to designate waters in the U.S. Caribbean as an ECA, subjecting ships to more stringent emission limitations for sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter starting in 2014. The laws and regulations apply to different geographic areas based on terminology used. In 2011, ships in a designated area would face stricter emission limits for sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter from 2014. Laws and regulations apply to various geographic areas based on specific terminology. The Clean Water Act defines navigable waters, the contiguous zone, and the ocean as separate entities. Navigable waters include U.S. waters and territorial seas extending 3 miles seaward from the baseline. The Clean Water Act defines navigable waters as U.S. waters and territorial seas extending 3 miles seaward from the baseline. President Reagan's proclamation extended the territorial sea to 12 nautical miles, but it did not affect the Clean Water Act's geographic reach. The contiguous zone is defined as the zone established by the United States under Article 24 of the Convention of the Territorial. President Clinton's proclamation in 1999 extended U.S. authorities' enforcement rights at sea to 24 nautical miles from the baseline, doubling the previous limit. President Clinton's 1999 proclamation extended U.S. enforcement rights at sea to 24 nautical miles from the baseline, doubling the previous limit. This did not change the statutory definitions, so the territorial sea remains 3 miles wide, and the contiguous zone extends from 3 to 12 miles. The Clean Water Act defines the territorial sea as 3 miles wide and the contiguous zone from 3 to 12 miles. CERCLA includes the territorial seas in its definition of \"navigable waters.\" The CWA defines the \"ocean\" as the high seas beyond the contiguous zone, while the MPRSA defines \"ocean waters\" as the open seas beyond the baseline. The CWA and MPRSA define ocean and ocean waters differently, with jurisdiction limits determining where specific laws apply. For example, CWA standards apply to sewage discharges into navigable waters, while NPDES permits are needed for point source discharges. The Clean Water Act and other regulations address discharges of oil, hazardous substances, and garbage into navigable waters and the contiguous zone. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships also regulates discharges of oil and noxious substances into navigable waters. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) regulates discharges of oil and noxious substances in navigable waters. The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) governs ocean dumping within 12 nautical miles from the baseline. The Clean Water Act refers to distances from shore in miles without specific qualifications. The Clean Water Act, APPS, MPRSA, and presidential proclamations have different measures for distances from shore, with the former referring to miles and the latter to nautical miles. A nautical mile is 15% longer than a statute mile and is used primarily at sea and in aviation. This is important in Alaska, where tourism and commercial fisheries are significant for the economy, especially concerning cruise ship activities. In Alaska, cruise ship pollution has raised concerns due to a significant increase in passengers during the 1990s. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines faced penalties for environmental violations in 1999. In the 1990s, Alaska Natives and other groups became increasingly concerned about cruise ship pollution on marine resources. Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines faced penalties of $6.5 million for environmental violations in Alaska, including the discharge of oil and hazardous substances. The company admitted to a fleet-wide practice of releasing oil-contaminated bilge water. This was part of a larger $18 million federal plea agreement for environmental violations in various locations. The company admitted to discharging oil-contaminated bilge water fleet-wide. Alaska penalties were part of an $18 million federal plea agreement for environmental violations in multiple locations. Public concern led to a program in 1999 to identify cruise ship waste streams. Sampling in 2000 showed most ships' waste treatment systems did not meet standards. Fecal coliform levels in blackwater averaged 12.8 million colonies per 100 milliliters. In 2000, cruise ships had poorly functioning waste treatment systems, leading to discharges exceeding U.S. Coast Guard standards for Type II MSDs. Fecal coliform levels in blackwater and graywater were significantly higher than the Coast Guard standard. Legislation was passed in December 2000 to address these issues, following growing regional interest and attention to problems in Alaska. In December 2000, federal legislation was passed to address issues with cruise ship waste treatment systems, particularly in Alaska. The law established standards for vessels with 500 or more passengers, prohibiting discharge of untreated sewage and graywater in Alaskan waters. EPA was authorized to create regulations for sewage and graywater discharges from cruise ships until then. The federal legislation passed in December 2000 addressed cruise ship waste treatment systems in Alaska, prohibiting untreated sewage and graywater discharge. EPA was authorized to set standards for cruise ship discharges until regulations were established. Cruise ships in Alaska waters must adhere to specific discharge criteria until EPA regulations are in place. The legislation in Alaska sets limits for cruise ship discharges, including no more than 200 fecal coliforms per 100 ml and 150 mg/l total suspended solids. Vessels with advanced treatment systems must meet stricter standards, with limits of 20 fecal coliforms per 100 ml, 30 mg/l of total suspended solids, and chlorine concentrations not exceeding 10 mg/l. Sampling and recordkeeping by vessel operators are required. The legislation in Alaska sets limits for cruise ship discharges, including no more than 20 fecal coliforms per 100 ml, 30 mg/l of total suspended solids, and chlorine concentrations not exceeding 10 mg/l. Coast Guard regulations require sampling, data collection, and recordkeeping by vessel operators for oversight and enforcement. EPA has conducted a multi-year project to evaluate compliance with the law. The regulations in Alaska set limits for cruise ship discharges and include penalties for violations. EPA conducted a project to assess treatment systems on cruise ships in Alaska, sampling wastewater to evaluate performance. EPA sampled wastewater from cruise ships in Alaska during 2004 and 2005 to assess graywater and sewage, as well as treatment system performance. Information from this effort is summarized in the 2008 Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report. Additionally, EPA collaborated with Alaska on a survey and study regarding sewage and graywater treatment on large cruise vessels. The EPA collaborated with the state of Alaska on a study in Skagway Harbor in 2008 to estimate the effectiveness of advanced wastewater treatment systems on large cruise vessels. The study showed that these systems are effective in treating various pollutants, and Alaska enacted its own law in 2001 to regulate cruise ship discharges. Alaska enacted its own law in 2001 (AS 46.03.460-AS 46.03.490) to regulate cruise ship discharges of blackwater and graywater, setting standards and sampling requirements identical to federal law. Sampling requirements for all ships began in 2001, along with effluent standards for blackwater. The state law in Alaska extends effluent standards to discharges of graywater due to high fecal coliform counts detected in 2000. Sampling requirements for all ships started in 2001, with effluent standards for blackwater discharges by large cruise ships. Effluent standards for graywater discharges by large vessels began in 2003, with small ships given three years to comply. A scientific advisory panel was established to evaluate the law's effectiveness. The Alaska state law extended effluent standards to include graywater discharges in 2003. Small ships had three years to comply with the standards. A scientific advisory panel was established to evaluate the law's effectiveness. Large cruise ships have either installed advanced wastewater treatment systems or hold all wastewater for discharge outside of Alaskan waters. As of 2006, 23 out of 28 large cruise ships in Alaskan waters have installed advanced wastewater treatment systems to meet effluent standards. Small ships have not upgraded their systems, leading to consistent discharge of pollutants exceeding state water quality standards. Despite improvements in wastewater treatment on large cruise ships in Alaskan waters, smaller vessels have not upgraded their systems. This has led to consistent discharge of pollutants exceeding state water quality standards, posing risks to aquatic life and human health. In 2006, Alaska voters approved a citizen initiative requiring cruise lines to pay a $50 head tax per passenger and a corporate income tax. In 2006, Alaska voters approved a citizen initiative requiring cruise lines to pay a $50 head tax per passenger and a corporate income tax to address environmental concerns and fund local communities affected by tourism. Revenues from taxes on the cruise industry in Alaska will benefit local communities and public services. Supporters argue that the industry doesn't pay enough in taxes to offset its environmental impact. Opponents fear the tax will harm Alaska's tourism competitiveness and have taken legal action. Two cruise lines have stopped operating in Alaskan waters due to the tax. In response to a citizen initiative, two cruise ship lines have ceased operations in Alaskan waters. Alaska passed legislation in 2009 to allow more time for implementing strict wastewater treatment standards. Similar regulations on cruise ship discharges have been seen in other states like Maine. In April 2004, Maine enacted legislation regulating cruise ship discharges into coastal waters, requiring advanced wastewater treatment systems for large ships with overnight accommodations for 250+ passengers. Ships must comply with federal discharge laws, recordkeeping, and obtain a permit from the state Department of Environmental Protection. Graywater discharges were allowed before 2006 if ships operated a treatment system. Maine enacted legislation in 2004 requiring advanced wastewater treatment systems for large cruise ships with overnight accommodations for 250+ passengers. Ships must comply with federal discharge laws, recordkeeping, and obtain a permit from the state Department of Environmental Protection. Prior to 2006, graywater discharges were allowed if ships operated a treatment system. Additionally, the state applied for No Discharge Zones to prohibit blackwater discharges into state waters, with EPA approving the request for Casco Bay in June 2006. Maine applied to EPA for up to 50 No Discharge Zones to prohibit blackwater discharges into state waters. California passed laws in 2004 banning cruise ships from discharging treated wastewater, graywater, and operating waste incinerators. Additionally, California enacted laws in 2003 prohibiting passenger ships from discharging sewage sludge and oil bilge water. In 2006, California enacted S.B. 497 requiring ballast water performance standards by January 2008 and removal of invasive species by 2020. S.B. 497 mandates ballast water performance standards by January 2008 and removal of invasive species by 2020. States like Florida, Washington, and Hawaii have agreements with the industry for waste management practices on cruise ships. Under agreements with states like Florida and Washington, cruise ships must adhere to waste minimization, recycling, and management practices. For instance, cruise lines in Florida must stop wastewater discharges within 4 nautical miles, report hazardous waste annually, and undergo environmental inspections by the U.S. Coast Guard. Washington also has a memorandum of understanding with cruise ship associations for treated wastewater discharge. In April 2004, the Washington Department of Ecology, Northwest Cruise Ship Association, and Port of Seattle signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) allowing cruise ships to discharge treated wastewater into state waters, with restrictions on untreated wastewater and sludge. Environmental advocates criticize these voluntary agreements for lacking enforcement measures. In June 2009, the Department of Ecology reported that cruise ships visiting the state during the 2008 sailing season mostly complied with the MOU to stop discharging untreated wastewater. Wastewater treatment systems on cruise ships generally produce high-quality effluent. The 2008 sailing season saw cruise ships in the state mostly complying with the MOU to stop discharging untreated wastewater. Wastewater treatment systems on these ships produce high-quality effluent, comparable to on-land plants. Despite enforcement challenges, the state benefits from having measures in place to protect water quality and gather data on vessels and waste treatment equipment. Pressure from environmental advocates and the industry's desire for a positive image have prompted the cruise ship industry to implement various initiatives. The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) has adopted waste management practices for their operations, following regulations from the IMO and U.S. EPA. Guidelines require discharge of graywater and blackwater only while the ship is at least 4 miles from shore, and hazardous wastes must be recycled or disposed of according to laws. The cruise industry, in compliance with regulations from the IMO and U.S. EPA, has implemented waste management practices. These practices include discharging graywater and blackwater only when the ship is at least 4 miles from shore and recycling or disposing of hazardous wastes according to laws. Additionally, CLIA's cruise line companies have developed Safety Management System plans certified by the IMO for enhanced wastewater systems. The industry is also collaborating with manufacturers and regulators to test technologies for lower emission turbine engines and ballast water. The cruise industry has increased auditing oversight and implemented waste management practices in compliance with regulations. They have developed Safety Management System plans certified by the IMO and are working on testing technologies for lower emission turbine engines and ballast water management. Environmental groups prefer enforceable standards over voluntary ones, despite industry efforts to adopt improved practices. The industry has partnered with Conservation International to form the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance. The cruise industry has partnered with Conservation International to form the Ocean Conservation and Tourism Alliance, focusing on conservation efforts in coastal areas such as improving wastewater management, protecting natural and cultural assets, raising awareness on conservation issues, and educating vendors on environmental impacts. In partnership with Conservation International, the cruise industry works on protecting natural and cultural assets in cruise destinations, raising awareness on conservation issues, and educating vendors on environmental impacts. CLIA and CI collaborated to integrate sensitive marine areas into cruise line navigational charts for marine ecosystem protection. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. planned to retrofit its fleet with environmental measures in 2004. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCCL) partnered with Conservation International to develop a map integrating sensitive marine areas into cruise line navigational charts, aiming to protect critical marine and coastal ecosystems. In 2004, RCCL announced plans to retrofit its 29-ship fleet with advanced wastewater treatment technology, becoming the first cruise line to do so. This initiative was in response to environmental concerns and federal enforcement actions in the 1990s. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCCL) has been urged by Oceana to adopt measures to protect the ocean environment, following federal enforcement actions in the 1990s for environmental violations. Concerns about cruise ship pollution raise issues for Congress in areas such as laws and regulations, research needs, and oversight and enforcement. More assessment is needed to determine the effectiveness of current measures. The need for assessment of laws and regulations, research, and oversight in addressing cruise ship pollution is highlighted. Attention to these issues is recent, and there is a challenge in making them a national priority to obtain resources. The adequacy of existing U.S. laws, international standards, and industry initiatives in managing cruise ship pollution is questioned, raising the need for potential legislative changes. The report questions whether current laws and regulations adequately manage cruise ship pollution, particularly in areas like graywater where gaps in coverage exist. Investigations have shown significant contamination from cruise ships in this regard. Graywater contamination from cruise ships, including fecal coliform, bacteria, heavy metals, and dissolved plastics, has raised concerns. State officials found higher fecal coliform levels in graywater than in sewage lines. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended clearer regulations for controlling wastewater discharge. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended clearer regulations for controlling wastewater discharge from large passenger vessels, including uniform standards, recordkeeping, sampling, testing, and monitoring by vessel operators. The Clean Cruise Ship Act proposed uniform discharge standards, waste management procedures, recordkeeping requirements, sampling, testing, and monitoring for vessel operators. It aimed to prohibit cruise vessels from discharging sewage, graywater, or bilge water into U.S. waters. No legislative action was taken on the bill introduced in the 111th Congress. The Clean Cruise Ship Act introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to prohibit cruise vessels from discharging sewage, graywater, or bilge water into U.S. waters. It would require EPA and the Coast Guard to establish effluent limits for cruise ship discharges and mandate wastewater treatment on cruise ships. The Clean Cruise Ship Act introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to establish strict effluent limits for sewage, graywater, and bilge water discharges from cruise vessels. It would require wastewater treatment on cruise ships and authorize federal enforcement measures, including inspection and sampling. Passenger fees would fund EPA and Coast Guard implementation. Environmental advocates supported the legislation, while industry groups argued it unfairly targeted a small percentage of ships. The Clean Cruise Ship Act in the 111th Congress aimed to establish strict effluent limits for cruise ship discharges. Environmental advocates supported the legislation, while industry groups argued it unfairly targeted a small percentage of ships. Some states have passed laws regulating cruise ship discharges, potentially prompting federal legislation to harmonize state approaches. Congress is also concerned about EPA's efforts in this area. Several states have passed laws regulating cruise ship discharges, which may lead Congress to consider federal legislation to harmonize state approaches. Congress is also monitoring EPA's efforts to manage cruise ship wastes, as the agency has been collecting information and assessing the need for additional standards. EPA has not yet proposed any rules, but released a Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report in December 2008. The EPA has been collecting information and assessing the need for additional standards for cruise ship discharges. In December 2008, they released a Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report that examines various waste streams and discusses current federal actions to address them. The report identifies possible options and alternatives to manage cruise ship discharges. The EPA released a Cruise Ship Discharge Assessment Report in December 2008, which examines waste streams (bilge water, solid waste, hazardous waste) and federal actions to address them. The report suggests options to manage cruise ship discharges, but EPA has not determined their necessity, feasibility, or legal authority. Other issues include harmonizing U.S. laws for cruise ships and defining \"cruise ship\" uniformly. The EPA released a report in December 2008 on managing cruise ship discharges, suggesting options but not determining their necessity, feasibility, or legal authority. Key issues include harmonizing U.S. laws for cruise ships and defining \"cruise ship\" uniformly. Research can help identify the harm caused by vessel pollution and prioritize resources to address significant threats. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended research by various entities on waste quantities, impacts of discharges, and new control technologies. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended research on various aspects of vessel pollution, including transport processes, small passenger vessel practices, disposal options for sludge, and cumulative impacts on sensitive ecosystems. The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy recommended research on vessel pollution impacts, including disposal options for concentrated sludge and cumulative effects on sensitive ecosystems like coastal areas and coral reefs. EPA's 2008 Cruise Ship Assessment Report suggested research options such as a nationwide sampling program and studies on human health and environmental effects of cruise ships. The 2008 Cruise Ship Assessment Report recommended research options to improve air quality standards, including a nationwide sampling program and studies on human health and environmental effects of cruise ship discharges. Existing laws and regulations may not be adequately enforced or implemented according to the 2000 GAO report. EPA acknowledged the need for further research on the impacts of cruise ship discharges in semi-enclosed environments like bays and harbors. The 2000 GAO report highlighted the need for monitoring discharges from cruise ships to assess current standards and management effectiveness. It also emphasized the necessity of increased federal oversight by the Coast Guard and other agencies to address issues such as maintenance of pollution prevention equipment and falsifying oil record books for compliance with MARPOL. Increased federal oversight of cruise ships by the Coast Guard is necessary for maintenance and operation of pollution prevention equipment, monitoring of oil record books for MARPOL compliance, and verification of proper off-loading of waste. The Coast Guard's resources for enforcement of pollution regulations, including vessel inspections, have been questioned even before September 11. The adequacy of the Coast Guard's resources for enforcing pollution regulations on cruise ships has been a key oversight issue. The Coast Guard's ability to support its security missions, including vessel inspections, has been questioned both before and after September 11. Possible options for enforcement and compliance include improving monitoring, inspections, and involving passengers in detecting illegal activities. EPA has identified these options for addressing cruise ship pollution. The EPA has suggested various options for enforcing and improving compliance with pollution regulations on cruise ships, such as enhancing monitoring and inspections, involving passengers in detecting illegal activities, and charging a passenger fee for onboard marine engineers to observe waste treatment practices. The process for referring cruise ship violations to other countries has been found ineffective by the GAO, which recommended collaboration between the Coast Guard and the IMO to address this issue. The GAO found that the process for referring cruise ship violations to other countries is ineffective, and recommended collaboration between the Coast Guard and the IMO to address this issue."
