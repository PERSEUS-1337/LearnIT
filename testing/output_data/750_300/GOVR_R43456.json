    "content": "Airline passenger screening in the United States has evolved significantly since the 9/11 attacks, with new technologies and changes in policies overseen by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) created after 9/11 under the Aviation Transportation and Security Act. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was created after 9/11 under the Aviation Transportation and Security Act (ATSA) to oversee airline passenger screening in the United States. ATSA mandated comprehensive security screening for all passengers and property, but also allowed for trusted traveler programs and the use of technology to expedite screening for certain passengers. The TSA was created after 9/11 to oversee airline passenger screening in the US, allowing for trusted traveler programs and technology to expedite screening. Congress directed TSA to check all passengers against terrorist watchlists. TSA has faced challenges implementing risk-based passenger screening, often relying on a uniform risk assumption. The TSA has faced challenges implementing risk-based passenger screening, often relying on a uniform risk assumption. This contrasts with risk-based strategies used in other aspects of aviation security. Efforts to improve screening capabilities have focused on technology such as whole-body imagers and advanced X-ray equipment. The TSA's uniform approach to screening has limitations due to technology constraints, budgetary considerations, and time constraints for personnel. This has led to challenges in improving screening capabilities and creating long wait times at airports. The TSA's approach to airport screening is constrained by technology and resources, leading to long wait times for passengers. Limited space and hiring restrictions further hinder the TSA's ability to address these concerns. Cumbersome procedures like removing shoes and separating laptops for screening can deter travelers. Public perception of the TSA may be negatively impacted by inflexible security methods. The TSA's security methods, including removing shoes and separating laptops for screening, can lead to unpredictable wait times and deter travelers. Public perception of the TSA has been negatively affected by inflexible security measures, with criticism from experts like former TSA Administrator Kip Hawley. The TSA has tried to address these criticisms by shifting towards a more flexible approach to security. The TSA has faced criticism for creating a security system that is inflexible and has made air travel a nightmare. They have attempted to shift towards a risk-based screening approach, which has been met with controversy. Some initiatives have been supported by Congress, while others have been met with skepticism. The controversy stems from differing views on what constitutes risk and how it should be managed. Some security initiatives have faced skepticism from Congress and outside groups due to differing views on risk assessment and mitigation. The focus on security efforts should prioritize the main point, as holding everything may result in holding nothing. \"In a free and open society, we cannot protect every person against every risk at every moment. Security is necessarily imperfect but can be configured to minimize risk by understanding the nature of security risks.\" In a free and open society, perfect security is unattainable. Security can be configured to minimize risk by understanding the nature of security risks, which involves identifying strategies to mitigate threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences in the aviation security context. In aviation security, risk is a complex interaction of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Probability values for threats and vulnerabilities are limited, so categorical techniques are used to quantify security risk. A comprehensive risk-based strategy aims to mitigate all three elements of risk, including passenger screening initiatives. A risk-based aviation security strategy focuses on mitigating threats, vulnerabilities, and security risks. Passenger screening initiatives aim to detect and manage threats by identifying individuals who may pose risks and utilizing detection technologies. Vulnerabilities are addressed through multiple security layers like reinforcing cockpit doors and deploying air marshals. Consequences of security threats are assessed in terms of severity and potential risks, with costs and benefits of security strategies considered. Emergency management and response activities are responsible for mitigating consequences and facilitating post-incident recovery at airports. The responsibility for mitigating security threats and managing post-incident recovery at airports lies with emergency management and response activities, not the TSA. Establishing effective risk-based strategies for aviation security involves defining the risk environment and determining acceptable risk levels. TSA utilizes risk scoring extensively for assessing risks and planning security strategies, particularly in air cargo security. Unacceptable risk levels are a challenge in aviation security. TSA uses risk scoring for air cargo security but not for commercial passenger aviation due to complexity and controversy. Passenger risk assessment is mainly categorical based on biographical data checks against databases. Risk assessment of airline passengers is primarily done categorically, assigning them to different threat levels based on biographical data and behavioral indicators. The validity of behavioral-based risk scores has been questioned, and there is a lack of agreement on specific risks to mitigate in a risk-based security strategy. The TSA proposed allowing passengers to carry small knives and sports equipment on aircraft in 2013, citing reduced threats and other security measures in place. The TSA proposed allowing passengers to carry small knives and sports equipment on aircraft in 2013, stating that other security measures like armed air marshals and reinforced cockpit doors reduced the risk of hijacking. Critics argued that risks from unruly passengers wielding these items were not adequately considered. Legislation was introduced to prevent TSA from lifting the ban on small knives. At the operational level, risk-based passenger screening contrasts with TSA's historical approach of prohibiting certain items on planes. Former TSA administrator Hawley highlighted the dilemma faced by screeners in fearing to miss even the smallest threat. Former TSA administrator Hawley and Israeli expert Ron criticize the focus on prohibiting items on planes, arguing it hinders security by missing the bigger picture and failing to adapt to evolving threats like the 9/11 box cutter scenario. Ron criticizes the reliance on prohibited items lists and detection technology in aviation security, pointing out that they hinder the system's ability to adapt to evolving threats like the 9/11 box cutter scenario. He argues that terrorists exploit detection technology's limitations, as it gives them a predictable advantage. Ron emphasizes that detecting threat items alone has never prevented a planned terrorist attack. Ron criticizes the reliance on prohibited items lists and detection technology in aviation security, pointing out that they hinder the system's ability to adapt to evolving threats like the 9/11 box cutter scenario. He argues that terrorists exploit detection technology's limitations, as it gives them a predictable advantage. Ron emphasizes that detecting threat items alone has never prevented a planned terrorist attack. Comments from experts suggest integrating detection capabilities with other measures for assessing threats and minimizing vulnerabilities, requiring a more proactive approach from TSA. Advocates of risk-based security propose a departure from TSA's rigid screening measures to a more proactive and flexible approach, similar to Israel's use of demographic profiling and extensive security interviews for high-risk passengers. This approach aims to assess threats before allowing individuals to board planes. Israel utilizes demographic profiling, security interviews, and extensive screening measures to identify high-risk passengers before allowing them to board planes. Despite ongoing threats, Israel has successfully avoided major terrorist attacks on its airlines and airports for over 40 years. The effectiveness of these methods in deterring attacks remains uncertain. Implementing a similar approach in the United States is seen as challenging due to legal and practical concerns. Research by TSA's Kenneth Fletcher suggests that a risk-based approach to passenger screening tailored to the US aviation security framework would be more effective and legally defensible than the Israeli airport security model. Table 1 outlines key attributes of a risk-based aviation security framework, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive, multi-layered approach. Risk-based screening complements physical checkpoint measures, allowing TSA to focus resources on high-risk passengers and adapt security protocols based on threats. Risk-based programs complement physical screening measures, allowing TSA to focus resources on unknown and elevated risk passengers. They inform security protocols and may impact the deployment of behavioral detection officers and air marshals. Risk-based approaches to airline passenger screening have been in use since the early 1970s. Risk-based approaches to airline passenger screening have been used since the early 1970s, with rudimentary passenger profiles used by the FAA before 100% screening of all passengers was implemented in 1973. In the late 1970s, walk-through metal detectors and X-ray scanners became mandatory at airports, leading to the deployment of risk-based profiling techniques. Details about the interaction of security components have not been publicly disclosed. In the late 1970s, risk-based profiling techniques for airline passenger screening were largely abandoned with the deployment of walk-through metal detectors and X-ray scanners at airports. However, the FAA continued to use profiling tools to examine passenger name records for potential threats. In the late 1980s, FAA required airlines to ask passengers security questions regarding items in their possession. In the late 1980s, FAA required airlines to ask passengers basic security questions to address aircraft bombing threats. The questions aimed to target elevated-risk checked baggage and increase passenger awareness of security risks. The FAA required airlines to ask passengers security questions in the late 1980s to address aircraft bombing threats. These questions aimed to increase awareness of security risks and target elevated-risk checked baggage. Despite criticism for being obvious and posed by untrained agents, the questions highlighted the threat of bombers trying to deceive individuals into carrying devices on board. The TSA discontinued the use of these questions in 2006, while some other countries and airlines still use similar questions in more in-depth security screenings. Following the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, the FAA and airlines developed the Computer-Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening (CAPPS) system in the late 1990s. CAPPS uses flight reservation data to identify potential security threats, with algorithms overseen by TSA. After the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, the FAA and airlines created the Computer-Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening (CAPPS) system, now overseen by TSA. CAPPS uses flight reservation data to detect security threats, with indicators like purchasing one-way tickets or paying with cash. Additionally, the FAA, in collaboration with the FBI, established a \"no-fly\" list of known terrorists. However, on 9/11, only 12 names were on the list, none of them the hijackers. ATSA later directed TSA to enhance security measures post-9/11. After the 9/11 attacks, the ATSA directed TSA to establish trusted traveler programs and use technology to expedite screening for certain passengers, allowing focus on those needing more extensive screening. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 further directed TSA to ensure that CAPPS or its successor system evaluates all passengers. The ATSA and subsequent legislation directed TSA to establish trusted traveler programs and use technology for expedited screening, allowing focus on passengers needing more extensive screening. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated the use of CAPPS or its successor system to evaluate all passengers before boarding. This risk-based screening approach was recommended by the Department of Transportation Airport Security Rapid Response Team formed after the 9/11 attacks. The Department of Transportation Airport Security Rapid Response Team recommended a risk-based screening approach after the 9/11 attacks, leading to the development of CAPPS II for passenger prescreening and identity authentication. The team recommended applying passenger prescreening using CAPPS for assessing passenger risk on all flights. TSA started developing CAPPS II, which aimed to include identity authentication, watch list checks, and expanded risk-based assessments of passengers, integrating checks against the \"no fly\" and \"selectee\" lists for boarding denial and enhanced screening. It would categorize passengers based on threat assessments. The TSA developed CAPPS II to categorize passengers based on threat assessments and screen them against the \"no fly\" and \"selectee\" lists. Privacy concerns led to the abandonment of CAPPS II in 2004, with a focus on screening all passengers against terrorist watchlists instead. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving the \"no fly\" and \"automatic selectee\" lists for air passenger screening. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving the \"no fly\" and \"automatic selectee\" lists for air passenger screening, urging that screening be performed by TSA and carriers be required to supply information for the new prescreening system. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required TSA to assume passenger watchlist screening. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required TSA to take over passenger watchlist screening from airlines, utilizing the Terrorist Screening Database. TSA was prohibited from using algorithms to assign risk scores or commercial data for assessing passenger risk. TSA implemented the \"Secure Flight\" program in 2009 for domestic flights and in 2010 for international flights, fully operational since 2011. It screens passenger information against terrorist watchlists, including the TSDB, with subsets like the \"no fly\" and \"selectee\" lists. The TSA implemented the \"Secure Flight\" program in 2009 for domestic flights and in 2010 for international flights. It has been fully operational since 2011, screening passenger biographic information against terrorist watchlists, including the TSDB. The TSDB contains fewer than 400,000 names, with about 50,000 identities included in the \"no fly\" or \"selectee\" subsets. The TIDE repository maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center, a principal source of foreign identities in the TSDB, has grown to include about 875,000 names. The TIDE repository, a key source for foreign terrorist identities in the TSDB, has expanded to include about 875,000 names. The TSDB itself has also grown, now containing over 500,000 identities as of September 2012. This growth was driven by increased reliance on the system after the failed bombing attempt on Northwest Flight 253 in 2009. The TSDB has expanded to include over 500,000 identities as of September 2012, with a focus on improving watchlist practices after the failed bombing attempt on Northwest Flight 253 in 2009. Secure Flight compares passenger data against watchlists to determine travel eligibility. Secure Flight, part of intelligence community efforts post-bombing attempt, compares passenger data against watchlists and CDC list for airport checkpoint access decisions. Secure Flight compares passenger names to watchlists and CDC list for airport checkpoint access decisions. Records are destroyed within seven days if no potential match is found. Matches are retained for 7 years, confirmed matches for up to 99 years. Known traveler lists are kept until updated. The Secure Flight program compares passenger names to watchlists and CDC lists for airport checkpoint access decisions. Records are retained for 7 years, confirmed matches for up to 99 years. Known traveler lists are kept until updated. The program benefits from operational experience with the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which collects passenger manifest data from airlines for all international flights inbound to the United States. CBP collects passenger manifest data from airlines for international flights to the US and uses the Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) to assess travelers' risk levels. ATS-P helps CBP decide in advance whether an individual should be allowed entry into the United States. The Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) is used by CBP to assess the risk levels of inbound international travelers. It compares passenger data against terrorist and law enforcement databases to identify potential matches to terrorist identities and wanted criminals, as well as red flags like suspected use of a lost or stolen passport. The passenger module of ATS does not use a risk scoring methodology, unlike the cargo screening module. The Automated Targeting System (ATS) compares traveler data against terrorist and law enforcement databases to identify potential matches and red flags like lost or stolen passports. Data in the ATS may be retained for up to 15 years, with passenger name record data depersonalized within six months. Passenger name record data is depersonalized within six months and may be retained in an active database for up to five years before being transferred to a dormant database for up to 10 years. Travelers with passports from Visa Waiver Program countries must electronically submit biographical information through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization before boarding a U.S.-bound flight. This information is checked against various databases, and the resulting status code is transmitted to Secure Flight. Secure Flight conducts database checks for potential threats on passengers boarding U.S.-bound flights. TSA's SPOT program observes passenger behavior at airports to identify potential threats. SPOT was tested in 2003 and deployed almost 3,000 BDOs at 176 airports by FY2012. The TSA's Screening Passengers by Observational Techniques (SPOT) program aims to identify potential threats by observing passenger behavior at airports. Initiated in 2003, the program deployed nearly 3,000 BDOs at 176 airports by FY2012, costing around $200 million annually. Despite TSA's claims of using scientifically validated behaviors, questions persist about the program's effectiveness and cost. The TSA's SPOT program uses behavior detection techniques to identify potential threats at airports. It is based on scientifically validated behaviors and law enforcement methods, but there are nuanced differences from traditional law enforcement behavior analysis tools. The TSA's SPOT program utilizes behavior detection techniques to spot potential threats at airports, with nuanced differences from traditional law enforcement behavior analysis tools. Law enforcement agencies focus on investigating specific crimes with extensive interviewing methods, while the SPOT program emphasizes interpreting non-verbal cues for detection. The TSA's SPOT program uses behavior detection techniques to identify potential threats at airports, focusing on non-verbal cues. Unlike traditional law enforcement methods that rely on extensive interviews, the SPOT program stands out for its unique use of non-invasive observation techniques and a formal scoring system based on behavioral indicators. The TSA's SPOT program utilizes non-invasive observation techniques and a formal scoring system to rate suspicion based on behavioral indicators, including non-verbal cues. Unlike traditional law enforcement methods that involve lengthy interviews, the SPOT program can assess an average passenger in less than 30 seconds. Reviews of the program have questioned its effectiveness in identifying individuals. The TSA's SPOT program uses non-invasive observation techniques to quickly assess passengers for suspicious behavior. Despite TSA's claims of effectiveness, the Government Accountability Office found that known terrorists had passed through checkpoints where Behavior Detection Officers were stationed without being identified. The Government Accountability Office found that at least 16 known terrorists passed through airports with Behavior Detection Officers without being identified. The SPOT program was implemented without full validation or cost-benefit analysis, leading TSA to conduct validation studies to improve detection techniques. The TSA conducted validation studies with DHS and the American Institutes for Research, showing behavior detection techniques were effective in identifying high-risk travelers. The agency has not publicly released the study for independent analysis but has implemented steps to address GAO recommendations for improving assessment methods and program management. TSA has also collaborated with international partners to exchange information and best practices. Despite the positive results of the validation study conducted by TSA in collaboration with DHS and the American Institutes for Research, concerns have been raised by the GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General regarding the effectiveness of behavior detection techniques in the SPOT program. GAO concluded in 2013 that there was insufficient evidence to support the validity and utility of these techniques. TSA has taken steps to address GAO recommendations for improvement, including enhancing behavior assessment methods, performance metrics, data collection, and program management. Additionally, TSA has partnered with international counterparts to exchange operational information and best practices to further refine the SPOT program. The DHS Office of Inspector General and GAO have raised doubts about behavior detection techniques in the SPOT program. GAO concluded in 2013 that evidence did not support the validity and utility of these techniques. Concerns were raised about the metrics used by TSA to evaluate the program, as they do not directly relate to deterring terrorism and criminal acts targeting aviation assets. The effectiveness of the SPOT program in deterring terrorism and criminal acts targeting aviation assets has been questioned by the GAO and DHS Office of Inspector General. Metrics used to evaluate the program's impact have been found to be elusive, with concerns raised about the training and operational use of behavioral indicators by Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs). The DHS Office of Inspector General found wide individual differences among BDOs in referrals to law enforcement, questioning the training and operational use of behavioral indicators. Metrics supporting SPOT's effectiveness were not directly related to aviation security objectives, with significant lapses in records-keeping and incomplete data presented to TSA's senior leadership. TSA did not consistently provide formal refresher training for behavior detection officers. The Inspector General found significant lapses in records-keeping and incomplete data presented to TSA's senior leadership regarding the SPOT program. TSA did not consistently offer formal refresher training for behavior detection officers, raising questions about the quality and consistency of training. Performance evaluation and recurrent training for BDO instructors were also lacking, casting doubt on the program's efficacy. Evaluation and recurrent training for BDO instructors raised questions about the quality and consistency of BDO training. Concerns remain over the efficacy of the SPOT program, despite TSA championing it as a cornerstone of its risk-based approach to passenger screening. Congress has not taken specific action to eliminate or revamp the program, despite concerns raised by GAO and the DHS Office of Inspector General. Behavioral detection approaches have been sharply debated. Despite criticism of behavioral detection approaches, TSA's Pre-Check program, aimed at expediting processing for low-risk passengers, has received positive feedback. Launched in 2011 and fully operational by 2012, Pre-Check has been expanding gradually, offering no-cost enrollment to select frequent flyers of certain airlines, as well as U.S. and Canadian citizens. The TSA Pre-Check program, launched in 2011 and fully operational by 2012, offers expedited processing for low-risk passengers. It is available at no cost to select frequent flyers of certain airlines, U.S. and Canadian citizens who are members of trusted traveler programs, and eligible travelers can apply for a fee at a TSA enrollment center. The program is similar to the former Registered Traveler program. The Pre-Check program, similar to the former Registered Traveler program, allows eligible travelers to apply for expedited screening at TSA enrollment centers for a fee. Registered Traveler involved biographical and biometric data collection under a public-private partnership model. The Registered Traveler program, designed for expedited screening at airports, conducted background checks initially but later eliminated them as they were not deemed essential for threat determination. The program was eventually dismantled, and the Pre-Check program, similar in concept, now offers extensive screening for eligible travelers. The Pre-Check program, unlike the dismantled Registered Traveler program, conducts extensive biographic-based background checks for aviation security. Approved individuals receive a known traveler number for expedited screening, without issuing a biometric credential. Pre-Check, unlike Registered Traveler, conducts biographic-based background checks for aviation security. Approved individuals receive a known traveler number for expedited screening without a biometric credential. Participants may undergo random thorough physical screening to deter exploitation of expedited lanes. TSA's reliance on boarding passes for Pre-Check authentication raises concerns about limited authentication ability. TSA's reliance on boarding passes for Pre-Check authentication may be concerning due to limited ability to authenticate them. Deployment of authentication technologies faces challenges, potentially compromising access to Pre-Check lanes for cleared individuals at airports. TSA faces challenges in authenticating boarding pass information for Pre-Check screening, potentially compromising access for cleared individuals. Applicants must submit biographic and biometric data for the Pre-Check program. TSA collects biographic and biometric data from Pre-Check applicants for security threat assessments, including fingerprint-based criminal history checks through the FBI. Eligible applicants include U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, and legal permanent residents. Ineligibility criteria are based on specified time periods. TSA conducts fingerprint-based criminal history checks through the FBI for Pre-Check applicants, including U.S. citizens, nationals, and legal permanent residents. Ineligibility criteria include specific time periods for certain criminal convictions, and applicants may also be rejected based on extensive criminal history or information from government watchlists. TSA conducts criminal history checks for Pre-Check applicants, including U.S. citizens and residents. Applicants with extensive criminal history or on watchlists may be rejected. Approved travelers receive a Known Traveler Number valid for five years after paying a processing fee. Rejected applicants can appeal within 30 days. After being approved for Pre-Check, travelers receive a notification letter with a Known Traveler Number valid for five years. Those who are rejected can appeal within 30 days by providing supporting records to correct any inaccuracies. The $85 processing fee is non-refundable, so individuals with concerns about disqualification based on criminal record or eligibility requirements should consider their options carefully. TSA opened the first Pre-Check enrollment center in December 2013 at the Indianapolis airport. There will be 300 enrollment centers nationwide with an online application process. Applicants can pre-enroll online but must visit a physical site for identification. The Pre-Check program anticipates having 300 enrollment centers nationwide with an online application process. Applicants can pre-enroll online but must visit a physical site for identification and fingerprints. Early feedback from frequent travelers has been positive, with a 2012 survey showing high satisfaction rates. However, the rapid expansion of the program may limit its benefits. The Pre-Check program has seen high satisfaction rates, with almost 54% of users very satisfied or extremely satisfied. However, the rapid expansion of the program could lead to increased wait times in Pre-Check lanes as more travelers join, potentially affecting non-participating travelers as well. The Pre-Check program aims to expedite screening for half of all airline passengers by the end of FY2015. As the program grows in popularity, wait times in Pre-Check lanes may increase, benefiting both participating and non-participating travelers through managed inclusion for random selection based on Secure Flight assessments. Managed inclusion is a TSA initiative for real-time threat assessments of passengers to identify low-risk individuals eligible for random selection in Pre-Check lanes. Canine teams and behavioral detection officers screen passengers for potential threats, allowing expedited processing for those deemed low risk. The TSA initiative of managed inclusion involves screening passengers for potential threats using canine teams and behavioral detection officers. Low-risk individuals may be randomly selected for Pre-Check lanes, indicated by a lighted directional arrow at the travel document checker's kiosk. The TSA Pre-Check program includes expedited screening lanes for selected passengers, including Pre-Check members, military servicemembers, and those selected by Secure Flight. Cleared military personnel can use Pre-Check for official and personal travel, with family members under 12 allowed to accompany them. Family members under 12 years old can pass through Pre-Check lanes with cleared military personnel. Those over 12 must go through standard screening or obtain Pre-Check eligibility. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense and Coast Guard can also use expedited screening without enrolling in Pre-Check. Pre-Check lanes are used for screening airline crewmembers. The Coast Guard can participate in expedited screening without enrolling in Pre-Check starting in mid-April 2014. Airline crewmembers undergo security checks for eligibility in expedited screening. The Known Crew Member database verifies airline crew credentials for expedited screening, with TSA-managed background checks equivalent to Pre-Check applicants. Military personnel and civilian employees with defense clearances undergo extensive background investigations. The background screening for military personnel and civilian employees with defense clearances is considered equivalent to Pre-Check applicants by TSA. These individuals are seen as lower risk compared to the general population and comparable to trusted travelers vetted by TSA or CBP. The credentialing process for military personnel, defense employees, and airline crews is considered secure for expedited screening. TSA randomly selects some individuals from these groups for standard screening, adding an element of unpredictability in line with a risk-based security approach. TSA uses random selection for certain sub-populations for standard screening, adding unpredictability in line with a risk-based security approach. Various forms of data are collected and retained for risk-based screening programs, including biographic, biometric, and intelligence data. Each program has separate data collection and retention rules. TSA collects and retains data from intelligence sources and investigations on potential threats. Each risk-based program has specific data retention rules. TSA deletes data no longer needed, retaining records of individuals matching terrorist or criminal databases for longer periods. Individuals matching terrorist or criminal databases are retained for longer periods, while other records are destroyed shortly after travel completion. Data voluntarily submitted, like Pre-Check applications, is kept unless updated. TSA uses commercial databases for validation but does not share information with consumer reporting agencies. The TSA uses commercial databases for validation and risk assessments but does not disclose information to consumer reporting agencies. Personal data collected may be shared among DHS agencies for counterterrorism and homeland security purposes, as well as with intelligence, law enforcement, and judicial agencies for investigating potential violations. The TSA shares data with intelligence, law enforcement, and judicial agencies at various levels for investigating violations, with protection under the Privacy Act of 1974. TSA and DHS are required to establish appeals procedures for individuals identified as security threats. The Privacy Act of 1974 protects data shared by TSA with other agencies. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated appeals procedures for individuals identified as security threats. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 required DHS to establish an Office of Appeals and Redress for individuals facing travel delays. The DHS established the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) to address situations where individuals claim they were wrongly identified as a threat when boarding a commercial aircraft. This program allows passengers to seek redress for being inappropriately singled out. The DHS TRIP program was established to address situations where individuals claim they were wrongly identified as a threat when boarding a commercial aircraft. Passengers can file complaints online or by mail, and DHS requests supporting information within 30 days. A control number is provided for tracking the status of the inquiry. If a misidentification or name-matching issue is found, steps to resolve the situation are described. The DHS TRIP program allows passengers to file complaints if they were wrongly identified as a threat when boarding a commercial aircraft. Filers receive a control number to track their inquiry status online. If a misidentification issue is found, steps to resolve it are provided, such as retaining a DHS response letter for check-in. Passengers can appeal DHS decisions, but TSA decisions under the Secure Flight program are mostly not subject to judicial review. The TSA allows passengers to appeal decisions made by DHS regarding airline flights, but TSA decisions based on Secure Flight program records are mostly exempt from judicial review. In 2013, TSA sought information to expand expedited screening by using third-party prescreening of passengers with non-governmental data elements. The TSA sought solutions for third-party prescreening of passengers using non-governmental data elements to assess aviation risk and communicate successful assessments to TSA's Secure Flight. Third parties can use legally available data services, but data accuracy and security are important considerations. Future use of large commercial databases for airline information is possible. Parties can utilize legally available data services, with a focus on data accuracy and security. There are concerns about the potential use of large commercial databases to gather information on airline travelers, raising privacy and data accuracy issues for future passenger risk assessments. Commercial data services have traditionally been used for consumer credit risk assessment and targeted marketing. The use of commercial databases for passenger risk assessments is a growing concern, with potential privacy and data accuracy issues. Non-federal government and private databases may already be used for passenger prescreening, including CBP's ATS, Secure Flight, Pre-Check applications, Pre-Check disqualification list, and TSA's Transportation Security Enforcement Records System. The use of commercial data in passenger risk assessments is a growing concern, with systems like CBP's ATS, Secure Flight, Pre-Check applications, Pre-Check disqualification list, and TSA's Transportation Security Enforcement Records System potentially utilizing personal information for purposes beyond counterterrorism. Congress has previously restricted the use of commercial data in airline passenger prescreening. Congress has previously restricted the use of commercial data in airline passenger prescreening, including provisions in appropriations acts during the development of Secure Flight. Congressional oversight and possible legislative action may be needed as TSA's risk-based approaches to passenger prescreening evolve. Congressional oversight and potential legislative action may be necessary as TSA's risk-based passenger prescreening methods evolve, including the use of commercial data. This raises concerns about privacy and security, requiring careful review by Congress. Congressional oversight is crucial in reviewing TSA's risk-based approach to airline passenger screening to ensure effectiveness, efficiency, and data security. Experts question if risk-based screening alone is sufficient in addressing security risks. The TSA's risk-based programs are being reviewed for effectiveness, efficiency, and data security. Experts suggest that risk-based screening should be part of a comprehensive security strategy. The TSA's risk-based programs, including the Pre-Check program, are being evaluated for their adaptability to evolving threats and new capabilities. Assessing the effectiveness of the risk-based approach in passenger screening is challenging due to the newness of some elements and the lack of details on terrorist watchlists and behavioral profiling techniques. The risk-based approach to passenger screening, including the Pre-Check program, is evolving and adaptive. Details on terrorist watchlists and behavioral profiling techniques are not publicly disclosed, making it challenging to assess effectiveness. The consolidation and dissemination of terrorist watchlist information have been a key concern since the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 in 2009, but specific changes made in response have not been publicly acknowledged. Information on any evolution of behavioral detection methods by TSA is also not publicly available. The TSA's risk-based strategy and intelligence practices have not been publicly disclosed, raising concerns about their adaptation to evolving threats and new technologies. Congressional oversight may focus on the effectiveness of TSA's metrics in assessing security measures. The effectiveness of TSA's risk-based strategies and the selection of appropriate metrics for assessing security measures are key issues for congressional oversight. Identifying suitable metrics is challenging due to the secrecy surrounding security measures and the limited encounters with individuals tied to terrorism or seeking to carry out attacks. TSA's choice of metrics for behavioral detection programs is also under scrutiny. The limited encounters with individuals tied to terrorism make it challenging to establish effective metrics for TSA's security measures. Concerns arise over false alarms and singling out individuals as potential threats. TSA's focus on efficiency metrics for programs like Pre-Check raises questions about security effectiveness. The limited number of terrorist encounters raises concerns over false alarms and singling out individuals as potential threats, leading to high false alarm rates that may misdirect screening resources and complicate the lives of those mistakenly targeted. The effectiveness of initiatives to reduce false alarms in aviation passenger pre-screening, such as systematic database checks and a redress process for falsely targeted individuals, has not been disclosed. The effectiveness of steps to reduce false alarms in aviation passenger pre-screening, including a redress process for falsely targeted individuals, has not been publicly disclosed. Assessing anticipated efficiency gains from risk-based screening initiatives is crucial for oversight of TSA operations and appropriations. TSA expects savings of $120 million and staffing reductions of over 1,500 full-time positions in FY2015. Congressional oversight may examine these efficiency gains. TSA anticipates $120 million in savings and over 1,500 staffing reductions in FY2015. Congressional oversight will focus on security effectiveness, privacy, and data protections. DHS has established practices to protect personal data and comply with Privacy Act requirements. The DHS has practices in place to protect personal data and comply with Privacy Act requirements. Questions remain about the implementation of privacy protections and data security measures as TSA transitions to a risk-based approach to passenger screening. The implementation of privacy protections and data security measures in TSA's transition to a risk-based approach to passenger screening raises questions about its integration with various programs, adaptability to changes in threats and resources, identification of metrics for effectiveness, and addressing impacts of false positives. Despite elaborate security measures post-9/11, the potential for large-scale aviation attacks remains. Debate continues on balancing security, privacy, and data protection in risk-based programs for threat detection in civil aviation.
