    "content": "The federal government has supported educational statistics for over 150 years, with the Office of Education established in 1867. The National Institute of Education and National Center for Education Statistics were created in the 1970s, with the NIE being replaced by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement in 1985. The National Institute of Education (NIE) and National Center for Education Statistics were established in the 1970s. The NIE was replaced by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement in 1985, which was further replaced by the Institute of Education Sciences in 2002 through the Education Sciences Reform Act. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) in 2002 as an independent research institute within the Department of Education. The National Board of Educational Sciences (NBES) advises the Director on institute policies and research priorities. The ESRA established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) in 2002 with the National Board of Educational Sciences (NBES) advising on policies and research priorities. The IES operates through three National Education Centers and was later amended to include a fourth center under P.L. 108-446. The ESRA established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) in 2002 with the National Board of Educational Sciences advising on policies and research priorities. P.L. 108-446 added the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) to IES. P.L. 107-279 enacted the Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (NAEPAA). ETAA allows the Secretary of Education to provide grants for technical assistance activities. The ESRA established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) in 2002 with the National Board of Educational Sciences advising on policies and research priorities. P.L. 107-279 enacted the Educational Technical Assistance Act (ETAA) and the National Assessment of Educational Progress Authorization Act (NAEPAA). ETAA authorizes grants for technical assistance activities and statewide data systems, while NAEPAA authorizes national and state assessments in reading and mathematics. The ESRA established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) in 2002 with the National Board of Educational Sciences advising on policies and research priorities. Among the changes enacted through ESRA were the creation of an independent research institute and the implementation of \"scientifically-based\" or \"scientifically-valid\" standards for research. IES operates independently with more freedom from the Department of Education (ED) compared to the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI). ESRA also allows for greater oversight of IES by a technical panel (NBES). ESRA established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) as an independent research institute with more freedom from the Department of Education (ED) compared to OERI. ESRA also requires adherence to scientifically based research standards, scientifically valid research, and scientifically valid educational evaluations. The Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) established the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) with a focus on scientifically based research standards and valid educational evaluations. Funding for ESRA-related programs has continued through annual appropriations legislation, with the House of Representatives passing the Strengthening Education through Research Act in the 113th Congress.
