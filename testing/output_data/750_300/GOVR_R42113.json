Despite this decline, overall federal tax revenues have remained stable at around 17.7% of GDP since 1946. The corporate tax revenues have decreased over time, currently generating about 1.3% of GDP. Payroll tax revenue has increased from 1.4% of GDP in 1946 to 6.0% in 2010, while excise tax revenue has decreased from 3.1% to 0.5% of GDP. Corporate tax has also decreased in importance relative to other revenue sources. The corporate tax revenue has decreased over time, currently accounting for 1.3% of GDP. In 1952, it generated 32.1% of federal tax revenue, but now it only accounts for 8.9%. Individual and payroll taxes now generate 41.5% and 40.0% of federal revenue, respectively. There are various reasons for the decline in corporate tax revenues. The corporate tax currently contributes 8.9% of federal tax revenue, while individual and payroll taxes generate 41.5% and 40.0% respectively. The decline in corporate tax revenues may be due to factors like tax rate reductions and changes in the tax base. The decline in corporate tax revenues may be attributed to factors such as tax rate reductions and changes in the tax base. Both a lower average effective corporate tax rate and a reduction in the corporate tax base have contributed to the decrease in revenue generated by the corporate tax. The decline in corporate tax revenue is partly due to a lower average effective tax rate, which has decreased from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010. This reduction in the effective rate, along with a decrease in the tax base, has led to lower corporate tax revenues. The average effective tax rate for corporations has decreased from 55.8% in 1951 to 28.4% in 2010. This decline is driven by a reduction in the top statutory rate and other factors. Since 1951, the average effective tax rate for corporations has decreased significantly to 28.4% in 2010, driven by a reduction in the statutory rate and various tax benefits like investment tax credits and Section 199 deductions. The Section 199 deduction, along with changes to depreciation rules, has contributed to reducing the effective corporate tax rate below the statutory rate. This deduction has been available since 2004 for certain activities, mainly in the domestic manufacturing industry. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 also played a role in lowering effective tax rates. Changes to depreciation rules, including the Tax Reform Act of 1986, have contributed to reducing effective corporate tax rates. Bonus depreciation in 2002 and 2009 aimed to stimulate the economy. Other factors like inflation and the foreign tax credit have had minimal effects on falling tax rates. The effective corporate tax rates have generally fallen over time due to changes in depreciation rules, including the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Bonus depreciation in 2002 and 2009 aimed to stimulate the economy. Other factors like inflation and the foreign tax credit have had minimal effects on falling tax rates. The net effect of these factors has been small compared to the impact of accelerated depreciation and the investment tax credit. The average effective corporate tax rate has generally decreased over time, with two spikes occurring around 2000 and 2007 during recessions. Businesses can offset losses by carrying them back to receive tax refunds, reducing their average effective tax rate. In response to large losses during recessions, Congress temporarily extended the carryback period from two years to five years in 2002 and 2008 to help struggling corporations reduce their taxes. The carryback period was extended from two years to five years in 2002 and 2008 to stimulate the economy by reducing taxes for struggling corporations. The decline in corporate tax revenue is not solely due to lower effective tax rates but also because more business income is generated by partnerships and S corporations, which are not subject to corporate income tax. The corporate tax base has shrunk as more business income is generated by partnerships and S corporations, which are not subject to corporate income tax. In 1980, C corporations generated 78% of business income, but by 2007, they only accounted for 44%. Meanwhile, partnerships' share of income increased from 3% to 28% during the same period. The distribution of business income in the United States shifted from C corporations to partnerships and S corporations between 1980 and 2007. C corporations' share decreased from 78% to 44%, while partnerships' share increased from 3% to 28% and S corporations' share rose from 1% to nearly 17%. This change led to a smaller corporate tax base and a drop in corporate tax revenues. The shift in business income distribution from C corporations to partnerships and S corporations between 1980 and 2007 resulted in a smaller corporate tax base. The popularity of S corporations increased after the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which set lower tax rates for individuals and corporations, leading to more businesses organizing as S corporations. Legislation later increased the S corporation shareholder limit from 35 to 100. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 set individual tax rate at 28% and corporate tax rate at 34%, leading to more businesses opting for S corporations. The shareholder limit for S corporations was later increased from 35 to 100, making it a more attractive option. By 2007, S corporations accounted for 12% of businesses, up from 4% in 1980. The shift in business income distribution has affected the corporate tax base, with a decrease in profitability of corporate firms. The profitability of the corporate sector has declined significantly since 1966, as measured by the profit to net asset ratio. This ratio reflects how effectively the corporate sector is utilizing its resources to generate profits. The decrease in corporate profitability has impacted the tax base, compounded by the shift towards S corporations after the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The profit to asset ratio reflects corporate sector efficiency in generating profits. Corporate profitability has declined significantly since 1966, impacting the tax base. Economists attribute the decline to various factors. The decline in corporate profitability since 1966 has been attributed to factors such as a shift to more volatile industries and a change in the age distribution of corporations. This has led to a reduction in overall profits. The decline in corporate profitability since 1966 has been attributed to factors such as a shift in the age of corporations to younger firms, profit-shifting to lower-tax countries, and the use of income reported for tax purposes. The decline in corporate profitability since 1966 has been attributed to factors such as profit-shifting among multinational corporations to lower-tax countries and the manipulation of income reported for tax purposes to reduce tax liability. Corporate tax revenues have been decreasing for the past six decades, with economists noting discrepancies between income reported to the IRS and shareholders. Corporate tax revenues have been declining for the last six decades, with growing differences in income reported to the IRS and shareholders. Three primary factors responsible for the decline include a decrease in the average effective corporate tax rate, an increase in business activity by pass-through structures like partnerships and S corporations, and changes affecting the tax treatment of investment and capital recovery. The decline in corporate tax revenues is attributed to a lower effective tax rate, increased business activity by pass-through structures, and decreased corporate sector profitability. This has led to a shrinking corporate tax base, prompting discussions on reforming the tax system by reducing rates and broadening the tax base. The discussion on corporate tax reform focuses on reducing statutory rates and achieving revenue neutrality by broadening the tax base. Research suggests that a revenue-neutral reduction of the top statutory corporate tax rate may be possible, depending on how much room there is to broaden the base. Reducing the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 25% would require repealing all corporate tax expenditures and making changes to tax preferences for noncorporate businesses. Business tax reforms may lead to some activity returning to the corporate sector, naturally broadening the base. Business tax reforms, including reducing the corporate rate and enacting changes for noncorporate businesses, may lead to business activity returning to the corporate sector and broadening the tax base. Reforms may also target American multinationals operating overseas to reduce profit shifting. The section provides an overview of calculating average effective tax rates and data sources for the variables used in the calculation. The calculation of average effective tax rates involves using data from various sources and equations that identify different levels of government. The equation for the average effective corporate tax rate (AECTR) is presented with specific variables and indices."
