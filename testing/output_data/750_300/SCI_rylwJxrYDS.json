    "content": "The proposed vq-wav2vec algorithm learns discrete representations of audio segments using gumbel softmax or online k-means clustering. This enables the application of NLP algorithms that require discrete inputs. Experiments show that BERT pre-training achieves state-of-the-art results in TIMIT phoneme classification and WSJ speech recognition. Learning discrete speech representations has gained recent interest, with autoencoding being a popular approach. In this paper, the authors combine two lines of research by learning discrete representations of speech through a context prediction task instead of reconstructing the input. This approach enables the application of NLP algorithms that require discrete inputs. The paper combines research on learning discrete speech representations through context prediction, enabling the application of NLP algorithms to speech data. The vq-wav2vec encoder maps raw audio to a dense representation, quantizes it, and aggregates it into context representations for training acoustic models. The vq-wav2vec encoder quantizes raw audio into context representations for training acoustic models, utilizing a Gumbel-Softmax approach and online k-means clustering to choose discrete variables. The study utilizes the wav2vec loss and architecture, Gumbel-Softmax approach, and online k-means clustering to train a Deep Bidirectional Transformer (BERT) on discretized unlabeled speech data. Results show BERT representations outperform log-mel filterbank inputs and dense wav2vec representations on TIMIT and WSJ benchmarks, enabling the application of NLP algorithms to audio data. The study demonstrates that BERT representations outperform log-mel filterbank inputs and dense wav2vec representations on TIMIT and WSJ benchmarks, allowing NLP algorithms to be applied to speech data. WAV2VEC learns audio representations through a self-supervised context-prediction task using convolutional neural networks. The model distinguishes future samples from distractors by minimizing contrastive loss. The model is trained to distinguish future samples from distractors by minimizing contrastive loss for different step sizes. The representations produced by the context network are input to the acoustic model instead of log-mel filterbank features. BERT is a pre-training approach for NLP tasks that uses a transformer encoder model to build a representation of text. Transformers use self-attention to encode input sequences and an optional source sequence. The original BERT model combines masked language modeling and next sentence prediction tasks for training. Our approach, vq-wav2vec, learns vector quantized representations of audio data using a future time-step prediction task. It follows the same architectural choices as wav2vec with two convolutional networks for feature extraction and aggregation. Our approach, vq-wav2vec, utilizes vector quantized representations of audio data through a future time-step prediction task. It employs convolutional networks for feature extraction and aggregation, along with a quantization module to create discrete representations. The encoder network maps raw speech segments to dense feature representations, which are then quantized and reconstructed. The aggregator optimizes a context prediction task similar to wav2vec. The vq-wav2vec approach uses vector quantized representations of audio data for future time-step prediction. It involves an encoder network for feature extraction, a quantization module for creating discrete representations, and an aggregator for optimizing a context prediction task similar to wav2vec. The quantization module replaces the original representation with a fixed size codebook containing different representations. It utilizes Gumbel-Softmax and online k-means clustering for computing one-hot representations. The Gumbel-Softmax is used for selecting discrete codebook variables in a differentiable way, along with online k-means clustering. Multiple vector quantizations are performed on different parts of z to prevent mode collapse. The approach involves applying a linear layer, ReLU, and another linear layer to the dense representation z to output logits l \u2208 R V. The Gumbel-Softmax method allows for selecting discrete codebook variables in a differentiable manner. It involves applying linear layers and ReLU to the dense representation z to output logits for Gumbel-Softmax. The selection process involves using uniform samples and true gradients during training. The vector quantization approach by van den Oord et al. (2017) is an alternative method for index selection. During the forward pass, the Gumbel-Softmax method selects codebook variables using uniform samples. The vector quantization approach by van den Oord et al. (2017) offers a differentiable index selection method. The codebook variable is chosen based on Euclidean distance to input features, and gradients are obtained for future time step prediction loss optimization. The codebook variable representation is chosen based on Euclidean distance to input features during the forward pass. Gradients for the encoder network are obtained by back-propagating, and the final loss includes terms for future prediction task and moving codebook vectors closer to the encoder. The stop gradient operator sg(x) \u2261 0 and hyper-parameter \u03b3 are used in the context of future prediction tasks. The codebook vectors are adjusted using straight-through gradient estimation, ensuring encoder outputs are close to centroids. Mode collapse issues are addressed by avoiding using only some codewords, with previous solutions including re-initializing codewords or adding regularizers to the loss function. In addressing mode collapse issues, a new strategy is proposed to independently quantize partitions of the feature vector z, similar to product quantization. This approach leads to larger dictionaries and improved downstream performance. The dense feature vector z is organized into groups and represented by integer indices for enhanced representation. The dense feature vector z is organized into groups and represented by integer indices for enhanced representation. The codebook can be initialized in two ways, either sharing variables across groups or referencing the same vector for a particular index in a group. The codebook vector in VQ approaches can be shared or not shared across groups. Sharing variables generally yields competitive results. Once a vq-wav2vec model is trained, audio data can be discretized for algorithms requiring discrete inputs. After training a vq-wav2vec model, audio data can be discretized for algorithms needing discrete inputs. Using the discretized data, BERT pre-training can be applied to predict masked input tokens. The trained BERT model can then improve speech recognition by feeding representations into an acoustic model. Recent advances in BERT training focus on masked input token prediction. BERT model is trained to build representations for improving speech recognition by masking spans of consecutive discretized speech tokens. This modification makes masked token prediction harder.

Gumbel-Softmax uses 13.5k codewords for audio signal representation, enabling training of BERT models with a small vocabulary. Comparison between Gumbel-Softmax and k-means for vector quantization is conducted using BERT small configuration. In an experiment comparing Gumbel-Softmax to k-means for vector quantization, a vq-wav2vec k-means model with a large number of codewords was trained. Results for TIMIT phoneme recognition show that the models using BERT small configuration outperform the baseline. Table 3 shows TIMIT phoneme recognition results in terms of phoneme error rate (PER) for vq-wav2vec models with Gumbel-Softmax and k-means clustering, both using BERT small configuration. Gumbel-Softmax is more accurate than k-means in the no language model setup, but the differences disappear. In experiments without a language model, Gumbel-Softmax and k-means clustering show comparable performance, with Gumbel-Softmax being more accurate initially. However, these differences diminish after BERT training. The large codeword model helps reduce the gap to the original wav2vec model. Additionally, on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, vq-wav2vec and BERT achieve a new state of the art with a 11.67% PER. In experiments, vq-wav2vec and BERT achieve a new state of the art with an 11.67% PER on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task. The gap to the original wav2vec model is reduced, and a standard sequence to sequence model can also be trained for speech recognition after audio is discretized. In preliminary experiments, a standard sequence to sequence model was trained on the vq-wav2vec Gumbel-Softmax discretized Librispeech corpus. Results show promise, although not as good as the state of the art due to the lack of data augmentation used.
