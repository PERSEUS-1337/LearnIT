    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Faster Access to Specialized Treatments Act\" or \"FAST Act\". Congress finds that the FDA plays a critical role in ensuring the safety and effectiveness of new medicines. Advances in medical sciences have led to a better understanding of diseases, promoting investment in innovative treatments for unmet medical needs. Advances in medical sciences, including genomics and molecular biology, have led to the development of targeted medicines for serious diseases. These new treatments utilize biomarkers, pharmacogenomics, and adaptive clinical trial designs. Advances in medical sciences have led to the development of targeted medicines for serious diseases, utilizing biomarkers, pharmacogenomics, and adaptive clinical trial designs. FDA should implement more effective processes for expedited development and review of innovative medicines for unmet medical needs, including rare diseases. The FDA should implement effective processes for expedited development and review of innovative medicines for unmet medical needs, including rare diseases, using modern scientific tools and endpoints. This can lead to fewer, smaller, or shorter clinical trials without compromising FDA's high standards for drug approval, benefiting patients with expedited access to safe treatments. The FDA should enhance its authority to expedite access to safe and effective innovative therapies for serious or life-threatening diseases, by considering appropriate scientific data and tools. The FDA should amend its regulations to enhance authority for expedited approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions, allowing for quicker access to novel treatments. Congress supports applying accelerated approval and fast track provisions to expedite development. The FDA should utilize accelerated approval and fast track provisions to expedite the development and availability of treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES OR CONDITIONS. Amends Section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to expedite approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases. The Secretary will facilitate the development and expedite the review of a new drug designated as a Fast Track Product if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease, demonstrating potential to address unmet medical needs. The sponsor of a new drug may request the Secretary to designate the drug as a fast track product, which will be expedited for review if intended for a serious or life-threatening disease with unmet medical needs. The Secretary will designate a drug as a fast track product within 60 days of receiving a request if it meets certain criteria, expediting the development and review process for approval. The Secretary designates a drug as a fast track product if it meets specific criteria, expediting the approval process for serious or life-threatening diseases. The Secretary may approve a product for serious or life-threatening diseases based on its effect on a surrogate or clinical endpoint. The Secretary may approve a product for serious or life-threatening diseases based on its effect on a surrogate or clinical endpoint, including endpoints that predict clinical benefit through various types of evidence. The evidence supporting an endpoint predicting clinical benefit may include various types of evidence such as epidemiological, pathophysiologic, pharmacologic, or therapeutic evidence using biomarkers or scientific methods. Approval of a product may be subject to post-approval studies to verify the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity. The sponsor must conduct post-approval studies to verify the product's effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality. They must also submit promotional materials for review before dissemination. The sponsor must conduct post-approval studies to verify the product's effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality. Promotional materials must be reviewed before dissemination, 30 days prior to and after approval, with the possibility of expedited withdrawal of approval by the Secretary if requirements are not met. The Secretary can initiate an expedited subsection for post-approval studies if the sponsor fails to conduct required studies, verify predicted effects, or if evidence shows the product is not safe or effective. The Secretary can initiate an expedited subsection for post-approval studies if the sponsor fails to verify predicted effects, or if evidence shows the product is not safe or effective. The Secretary can review incomplete applications for fast track product approval if preliminary data suggests effectiveness. The review can start before the complete application is submitted if the applicant provides a submission schedule. The Secretary can review incomplete applications for fast track approval if preliminary data suggests effectiveness. The review can start before the complete application is submitted if the applicant provides a submission schedule and pays any required fees. The Secretary can review incomplete applications for fast track approval based on preliminary data suggesting effectiveness. This review process can begin before the complete application is submitted if the applicant provides a submission schedule and pays required fees. The provisions related to expediting drug development and application review do not apply until the application is complete. The Secretary is also responsible for developing and sharing information about these provisions with relevant stakeholders. The Secretary is responsible for developing and disseminating information about provisions for accelerated approval and fast track products. This includes encouraging the development of surrogate endpoints and scientific tools to predict clinical benefit. The Secretary encourages the development of surrogate endpoints and scientific tools to predict clinical benefit for serious or life-threatening conditions with unmet medical needs. SEC. 4. GUIDANCE; AMENDED REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must issue draft guidance within one year of the enactment of the Act, followed by final guidance after public comment, to implement the amendments made by section 3 and amend regulations for accelerated approval. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must issue guidance and amend regulations to implement amendments for accelerated approval, considering issues related to fast track processes for drugs designated for rare diseases. The guidance and regulations for accelerated approval must address issues related to fast track processes for drugs designated for rare diseases, including incorporating novel approaches for reviewing surrogate endpoints based on pathophysiologic and pharmacologic evidence. The guidance for accelerated approval must address issues related to fast track processes for drugs designated for rare diseases, incorporating novel approaches for reviewing surrogate endpoints based on evidence, especially in cases where data collection is unlikely. The issuance of guidance or regulations shall not delay the review or approval of requests or applications. SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT REVIEW. The Secretary will contract with an independent entity to evaluate the FDA's application of new drug review processes and their impact on innovative treatments for serious conditions. The FDA will evaluate the impact of new drug review processes on innovative treatments for serious conditions through consultation with various stakeholders. The amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act encourage innovative approaches for product assessment under accelerated approval while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards."
