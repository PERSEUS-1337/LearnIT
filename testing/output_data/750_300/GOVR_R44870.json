    "content": "Many governments recognize the international risks posed by environmental degradation and climate change, leading to the negotiation of international agreements to protect the environment and promote sustainable growth. Efforts by wealthier countries alone are deemed insufficient, with lower-income countries also needing to take measures to address these issues. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992) was the first international treaty to acknowledge the need for international financial assistance to support actions on global environmental problems in lower-income countries. International financial assistance is a key method for governments to address global environmental issues in lower-income countries. The UNFCCC, ratified by the United States in 1992, requires higher-income Parties to provide new and additional financial resources to meet agreed costs. Higher-income Parties committed to providing new and additional financial resources to meet the costs incurred by developing country Parties in complying with their obligations under the UNFCCC. The United States has delivered financial and technical assistance for climate change activities over the past several decades. The United States has provided financial and technical assistance for climate change activities in developing countries through bilateral and multilateral programs. This assistance has been delivered through various agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of State, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Export-Import Bank, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. The importance of burden sharing among developed country Parties is also emphasized. The United States has provided financial and technical assistance for climate change activities in developing countries through various agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of State, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Export-Import Bank, and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Multilateral assistance has also been provided through contributions to environmental funds at international financial institutions and organizations like the Global Environment Facility, the Green Climate Fund, and the World Bank's Climate Investment Funds. The Green Climate Fund (GCF), UN Development Program, UN Environment Program, UNFCCC's Special Climate Change Fund, Least Developed Country Fund, World Bank's Climate Investment Funds, and Forest Carbon Partnership Facility are key entities for climate finance. The UNFCCC establishes a financial mechanism to provide funds to developing countries, with the GEF being an official operating entity. The GEF, established in 1991, is an official operating entity of the financial mechanism under the UNFCCC. The relationship between the UNFCCC and the GEF is outlined in a memorandum of understanding. The US has made commitments to all six GEF resource replenishments. The George H. W. Bush Administration supported the establishment of the GEF in 1991. The United States has made commitments to all six GEF resource replenishments, totaling $2.732 billion. U.S. disbursements to the GEF since 1994 have totaled approximately $2.2 billion. In 2009, the COP to the UNFCCC in Copenhagen took note of the Copenhagen Accord. In 2009, the COP to the UNFCCC in Copenhagen noted the Copenhagen Accord. The following year, in Cancun, the COP officially adopted elements of the accord in the Cancun Agreements, including Fast start financing with a commitment by developed countries to provide new resources approaching $30 billion for 2010-2012 to address climate finance needs of developing countries. The agreement includes a commitment by developed countries to provide new and additional resources approaching $30 billion for the period 2010-2012 to address the climate finance needs of developing countries. Additionally, there is a pledge to mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 for the same purpose, with funds coming from various sources. The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, aims to address climate change by bringing all nations together to combat it and support developing countries. Developed countries are committed to providing financial resources, with a pledge to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 from various sources. The Paris Agreement aims to combat climate change and support developing countries by mobilizing financial support from developed countries. Developed countries, including the United States, are obligated to provide financial assistance for climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. Additionally, the agreement encourages all parties to voluntarily contribute to climate finance regardless of their economic status. The Paris Agreement encourages all Parties to provide financial support voluntarily, regardless of economic standing. Developed countries are urged to lead in mobilizing climate finance from various sources, aiming for a progression beyond previous efforts. The COP Decision reaffirms the pledge of $100 billion annually by 2020 from developed countries, extending the commitment through 2025. The COP Decision reaffirms the collective pledge by developed countries of $100 billion annually by 2020, extending the commitment through 2025. President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2017, with the process not completed until November 4, 2020. President Donald Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on June 1, 2017, with the process completed on November 4, 2020. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was designated as an operating entity of the UNFCCC in 2009, with its design agreed upon during the 2011 COP in Durban, South Africa. The GCF operates independently with its own board, trustee, and secretariat, being accountable to the Conference of Parties. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established during the 2011 COP in Durban, South Africa. It operates independently with its own board, trustee, and secretariat, being accountable to the Conference of Parties. The fund aims to assist developing countries in combating climate change through grants and concessional financing provided by developed country Parties to the Convention. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established in 2011 during the COP in Durban, South Africa. It provides grants and concessional financing to help developing countries combat climate change. The fund is capitalized by financial inputs from developed countries and other sources. It became operational in 2014 with pledges totaling $10.3 billion, including a $3 billion pledge from the Obama Administration. The U.S. Department of State made contributions of $500 million in 2016. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established in 2011 during the COP in Durban, South Africa, to help developing countries combat climate change. Parties pledged approximately $10.3 billion for the fund's initial capitalization in the summer of 2014. The Obama Administration pledged $3 billion over four years. The U.S. Department of State made contributions of $500 million in 2016 and 2017 from the Economic Support Fund. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 allows the President to use the Economic Support Fund to provide assistance for economic or political stability. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request aims to eliminate U.S. funding for the Green Climate Fund in alignment with President Trump's promise to cease payments to UN climate change programs. President Trump has criticized the GCF, stating that no contribution was made with FY2017 budget authority. The budget request released on May 23, 2017, proposes to eliminate U.S. funding for the Green Climate Fund in FY2018, aligning with President Trump's promise to stop payments to UN climate change programs. Trump has criticized the GCF for redistributing wealth out of the U.S. and sending billions of dollars to other countries. Despite the previous $1 billion disbursement under Obama, the U.S. remains a member of the GCF board during the initial capitalization phase under the Trump Administration. The U.S. disbursed $1 billion to the Green Climate Fund under the Obama Administration, ensuring its board membership during the initial capitalization phase. The Trump Administration has not confirmed its continued membership. Future U.S. engagement with the GCF will be decided as part of a wider internal process on climate change policy. The GCF's relationship with the U.S.' other climate finance commitments, including UNFCCC 2020 pledges, is outlined. The Green Climate Fund's relationship with the United States' climate finance commitments, including UNFCCC 2020 pledges, is not directly tied to public funding. The GCF is just one of many possible sources for financing, as outlined in the Cancun negotiating text. The future of U.S. engagement with the GCF will be determined as part of a broader internal process on climate change policy. The Green Climate Fund is one of many public and multilateral sources for financing, but it is not expected to solely contribute to the $100 billion goal. Development bank instruments, carbon markets, and private capital are also crucial for mobilizing assistance. Bilateral aid is another important source of funding. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is a key source of climate change assistance, alongside other multilateral and bilateral funding channels. Private capital, development bank instruments, and carbon markets are crucial for mobilizing assistance, with the GCF not interfering with bilateral aid to developing countries. U.S. allocations for climate assistance will continue through authorized congressional appropriations. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) works alongside bilateral and multilateral funding channels for climate change assistance. The GCF board is responsible for ensuring complementarity with other U.N. mechanisms. Future negotiations may impact multilateral choices provided by the UNFCCC, with donor countries retaining options. U.S. allocations for multilateral assistance are guided by Congress and authorized appropriations. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) operates alongside other climate change funding channels. Future negotiations could affect multilateral choices under the UNFCCC. U.S. allocations for assistance are guided by Congress. Table 1 shows donor Parties to the GCF and their pledges. Withdrawal from the PA may have mixed implications for the U.S. The top 20 donor countries in order of pledges per capita. Withdrawal from the PA, including financial commitments, may have positive and negative implications for the United States. Possible benefits include fiscal savings from the $1 billion annual climate finance provided under the Obama Administration. Some criticize financial assistance for inefficiencies. Some critics question the effectiveness of international financial assistance, including climate finance, due to bureaucratic inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and misuse of funds. Reductions in financial assistance could free up funds for other priorities. Climate finance aims to help developing countries reduce their reliance on GHG-intensive fuels and technologies. Some argue that reductions in international financial assistance could support markets for these products, including U.S. exports, and redefine U.S. international relations in terms of sovereignty and national interest. Some stakeholders believe that U.S. withdrawal from commitments under the PA could redefine U.S. international relations, emphasizing issues of sovereignty, national interest, and control of domestic economics, legal systems, and political values. Possible repercussions include investment efficiencies and higher costs of responding to climate-related catastrophes in the future. The future costs of responding to climate-related catastrophes may be higher than preventing them today. Economic efficiencies may be found more readily in developing countries. Reductions in international financial assistance could lead to greater economic inefficiencies. Climate finance, specifically adaptation assistance, may support humanitarian and security interests, as reported by the U.S. Central Command. Climate finance, including adaptation assistance, may benefit U.S. businesses with low-emissions technologies in developing countries. The U.S. Central Command has warned that global climate change impacts could worsen poverty, social tensions, and political institutions in the developing world, affecting both the countries and U.S. interests. Reductions in international financial assistance could harm lower-income countries and U.S. interests. Climate finance in developing countries benefits U.S. businesses with low-emissions technologies. Financial commitments under the PA enhance U.S. global environmental leadership. Financial commitments under the Paris Agreement enhance U.S. global environmental leadership, allowing the U.S. to influence international economic and environmental policies. Withdrawal from the agreement would not release the U.S. from general commitments under the UNFCCC to provide new and additional financial resources. The Trump Administration's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement would release the United States from specific obligations but not from general commitments under the UNFCCC to provide financial resources. The Administration has not clarified its intentions regarding prior obligations. The Trump Administration's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement would release the United States from specific obligations but not from general commitments under the UNFCCC to provide financial resources. The Administration has not clarified its intentions regarding prior obligations, including the goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion per year by 2020. The impact of the withdrawal and cessation of U.S. payments to climate change programs would depend on the effectiveness of other nations, regional governments, states, cities, and the private sector in compensating for the lack of U.S. assistance, potentially eroding international efforts to help developing countries. The decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement by the Trump Administration could impact international efforts to help developing countries confront climate change. U.S. contributions for climate change-related activities are determined by Congress, which authorizes federal agency programs and provides guidance for these initiatives. The U.S. Congress is responsible for authorizing federal agency programs and appropriations for international climate change assistance. Congressional committees oversee U.S. interests in these programs."
