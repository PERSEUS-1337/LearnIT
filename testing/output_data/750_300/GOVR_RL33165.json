    "content": "The electric utility industry is a major source of air pollution, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. The EPA released an analysis comparing costs and benefits of controlling this pollution through market-oriented mechanisms. The analysis compared different proposals, including the Administration's \"Clear Skies\" proposal and bills introduced by Senators Jeffords and Carper. The EPA's analysis compared versions of the \"Clear Skies\" proposal with bills from Senators Jeffords and Carper, focusing on achieving health and environmental goals in cost-effective ways. The Administration initially resisted conducting the study due to cost and difficulty but relented after the Clear Skies bill failed to advance in the Senate committee. The Clear Skies bill faced opposition due to a lack of analysis comparing its provisions to other Senate bills. The EPA conducted a cost-benefit analysis after Stephen Johnson became EPA Administrator. As EPA Administrator, Stephen Johnson conducted a cost-benefit analysis of Clear Skies and other Senate bills, focusing on air pollution from electric utility generating facilities. The combustion of fossil fuels emits pollutants like particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury, all regulated under the Clean Air Act. The combustion of fossil fuels emits pollutants like particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury, all regulated under the Clean Air Act. Other gases such as carbon dioxide may contribute to global warming. Emissions of SO2 and NOx have decreased due to regulations, while CO2 emissions remain unregulated. The curr_chunk provides estimates of SO2, NOx, and CO2 emissions from electric generating facilities. SO2 and NOx emissions have declined due to regulations, while CO2 emissions have continued to rise. In 2003, fossil-fuel-fired electric generating plants accounted for a significant portion of the country's emissions. Annual emissions of Hg from utility facilities are uncertain, with about 45 tons coming from electric generating units. The curr_chunk discusses the uncertain annual emissions of Hg from utility facilities, with about 45 tons coming from electric generating units. The evolution of air pollution controls and the growing scientific understanding have led to a complex system of controls in place. Additional controls, particularly for NOx as a precursor to ozone, are currently being implemented. The growing scientific understanding of health and environmental impacts has led to a complex system of controls over power plant emissions. Additional controls are being implemented for NOx, SO2, and Hg pollutants. The US agreed to voluntary limits on CO2 emissions under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Bush Administration rejected the Kyoto Protocol in favor of a voluntary reduction program. The United States agreed to voluntary limits on CO2 emissions, rejecting the mandatory limits of the Kyoto Protocol. The Senate passed a resolution in 2005 calling for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases without significant harm to the economy. Efforts are being made to simplify the air quality control regime with a \"multi-pollutant\" approach for utility emissions. The \"multi-pollutant\" approach aims to simplify the air quality control regime by regulating utility emissions of SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 to achieve effective environmental controls while maintaining industry stability. This approach has already been integrated into existing law through finalized rules like the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). The industry aims for a stable regulatory regime with new rules like the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), and Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) to reduce emissions of SO2, NOx, and Hg from coal-fired power plants. More reductions are planned with new ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particles. The Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR), implemented in 2005, focuses on reducing SO2 and NOx emissions that affect visibility in national parks and wilderness areas. Additional reductions in emissions are planned to comply with new air quality standards for ozone and fine particles. Mercury emissions are also a concern, with 44 states issuing fish consumption advisories due to mercury contamination in water bodies. Mercury emissions are a major concern, with 44 states issuing fish consumption advisories due to contamination in water bodies. Legislation addressing power plant pollution in a comprehensive way could achieve health and environmental goals more effectively. Six bills in the 109th Congress propose multi-pollutant controls. The 109th Congress has introduced six bills for multi-pollutant controls on power plants, including SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions. The proposed legislation, known as \"Clear Skies,\" aims to implement national or regional caps on emissions through a system of tradeable allowances, similar to the acid rain program. Some bills also include CO2 caps. The 109th Congress has introduced six bills for multi-pollutant controls on power plants, including SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions. The proposed legislation, known as \"Clear Skies,\" aims to implement national or regional caps on emissions through a system of tradeable allowances. Key questions in the congressional debate include the stringency of caps, the speed of reductions, and whether CO2 should be included. All bills would require a 70%-80% reduction of NOx and SO2 emissions from 1998 levels, and 70%-90% reduction of mercury emissions. The Clear Skies bill (S. 131) proposes emissions caps for NOx, SO2, and mercury with reduction targets of 70%-90%. The bill has the least stringent standards and deadlines for compliance by 2018, but actual reductions may be delayed due to banking provisions. The Clear Skies bill proposes emissions caps for NOx, SO2, and mercury with reduction targets of 70%-90% by 2018. However, actual reductions may be delayed for up to a decade due to banking provisions allowing utilities to overcomply early and use credits for future emission reductions. The Clear Skies bill proposes emissions caps for NOx, SO2, and mercury with reduction targets of 70%-90% by 2018. EPA analysis suggests full 70% emission reductions may not be achieved until 2026 or later due to banking provisions allowing utilities to overcomply early and use credits for future emission reductions. Jeffords and Carper bills, with earlier and more stringent caps, would lead to full compliance at least a decade sooner than Clear Skies. The Jeffords and Carper bills propose earlier and more stringent emissions caps compared to Clear Skies, leading to full compliance at least a decade sooner. Clear Skies does not impose controls on carbon dioxide, while the Jeffords and Carper bills do, potentially affecting compliance strategies and market dynamics. EPA's cost-benefit analysis examined six options. The EPA's cost-benefit analysis, released on October 27, examined six options for achieving compliance with emissions caps. The analysis showed little difference between the four Clear Skies options, suggesting they can be considered as one. Senator Carper's Clean Air Planning Act and Senator Jeffords' Clean Power Act were also included in the analysis. The EPA's analysis compared various options for emissions caps, including Clear Skies, Carper, and Jeffords. The most recent version of Clear Skies was chosen for examination. The EPA's analysis compared emissions caps options, including Clear Skies, Carper, and Jeffords. The most recent version, the Managers' Mark version, was chosen for examination. EPA's baseline assumes no additional action on emissions beyond rules finalized by mid-2004, despite three recently finalized rules by EPA on SO2, NOx, and Hg control. EPA's decision not to include these rules in the analysis is unclear. The EPA's baseline assumes no additional action on emissions beyond rules finalized by mid-2004, despite three recently finalized rules on SO2, NOx, and Hg control. EPA included these rules as a \"sixth proposal\" for controlling pollutants, leading to uncertainty about future clean air regulation. The EPA's baseline assumes no additional action on emissions beyond rules finalized by mid-2004. The uncertainty surrounding future clean air regulation is highlighted by the evolving nature of proposed legislation and regulations. The 109th Congress or later versions would maintain the deadlines from the 2003 proposal. The Managers' Mark is an evolving proposal that could change if the Committee resumes consideration. Regulations supporting passed legislation would face uncertainties and delays similar to finalized regulations not in EPA's baseline. EPA's cost analysis focuses on Electric Demand Price Elasticity. EPA's cost analysis emphasizes Electric Demand Price Elasticity and Short-term Construction Constraints. Two scenarios are analyzed for each parameter to account for different assumptions and limitations. EPA analyzes scenarios for short-term construction constraints related to SO2 and NOx emissions control equipment, as well as electricity demand growth and natural gas supply assumptions. EPA analyzes scenarios for short-term construction constraints related to SO2 and NOx emissions control equipment, as well as electricity demand growth and natural gas supply assumptions. EPA developed four scenarios based on different combinations of assumptions regarding electricity demand growth and natural gas prices. EPA developed four scenarios based on different assumptions regarding electricity demand growth and natural gas supply for proposed legislation. The scenarios include variations in price elasticity, construction constraints, and demand response. The EPA developed scenarios with different assumptions on electricity demand growth and natural gas supply. The scenarios vary in price elasticity, construction constraints, and demand response. The report uses EPA's Demand Response Scenario as a benchmark analysis due to a compromise based on factors and lack of alternative combinations. Including a short-term demand response function in the modeling is strongly supported. The EPA's Demand Response Scenario is chosen as a benchmark analysis due to a compromise based on factors and lack of alternative combinations. Including a short-term demand response function in the modeling is strongly supported, with well-established electricity price elasticities, particularly short-term elasticities. EPA's decision to only include this refinement in one scenario is unclear. The EPA's Demand Response Scenario includes a demand function, but it is unclear why this refinement was only included in one scenario. Other assumptions in the Demand Response Scenario, such as boilermaker labor availability, are debatable. EPA assumes limited labor for constructing control equipment until 2010 in three scenarios. The EPA assumes limited boilermaker labor for constructing control equipment until 2010 in three scenarios, which has been questioned by the Institute of Clean Air Companies. The Institute of Clean Air Companies (ICAC) conducted their own analysis on boilermaker labor availability during the rulemaking on CAIR. They found no constraint on construction, even if the 2015 deadline of CAIR was moved to 2010. ICAC stated that the air pollution control industry has demonstrated the ability to install significant amounts of air pollution control equipment in short periods of time, citing recent installations in Germany and Japan. The air pollution control industry has shown the ability to install significant amounts of control equipment quickly, as seen in recent installations in Germany and Japan. The projected installations under IAQR will also require a significant number of control installations, but resources are not expected to be limiting. Factors like modular construction methods and non-union labor will reduce the demand for union boilermakers. Factors such as modular construction methods and non-union labor will reduce the demand for union boilermakers. Additional boilermaker labor can be sourced from Canadian boilermaker union, ship builders, and iron workers if needed. There will be sufficient capacity to meet the projected IAQR and control installation requirements for 2010 and 2015, with the possibility of completing the 2015 requirements by 2010. The availability of boilermakers from various sources will meet the projected IAQR and control installation requirements for 2010 and 2015, with the potential to complete the 2015 requirements by 2010. Limited availability only affects specific scenarios, prompting a choice between addressing this constraint or the demand elasticity assumption. The EPA's analysis includes a scenario with zero price elasticity for electricity demand. Despite questions about this assumption, it is deemed more important to include a demand elasticity function in the benchmark analysis than to remove the feasibility constraint. The future natural gas supply is uncertain, with no concrete facts available. The EPA's base case scenario includes a demand response scenario and addresses the uncertainty of future natural gas supply. Sensitivity analysis is crucial for understanding cost estimates, with EPA projecting more natural gas availability at lower prices compared to EIA. The EPA's base case scenario projects more natural gas availability at lower prices than EIA's supply curves. Despite concerns about feasibility constraints and market volatility, the EIA curves may be more representative of future supplies. Based on concerns about feasibility constraints and market volatility, the analysis uses the Demand Response Scenario as the basis for discussion. Clear Skies is projected to cost substantially less than other bills in both short- and long-term, with minimal costs and benefits compared to the baseline case. Clear Skies is projected to cost substantially less than other bills in both short- and long-term, with minimal costs and benefits compared to the baseline case. It has less stringent requirements and later deadlines, resulting in lower annual costs. The provisions for Hg are weak compared to other bills, and there are no provisions for CO2. Clear Skies aims to revamp the existing structure of the Clean Air Act. Clear Skies bill has weaker provisions for Hg and no provisions for CO2 compared to other bills. It aims to revamp the Clean Air Act with a more cost-effective approach. Clear Skies' benefits are substantially less than Carper and Jeffords bills, providing $6 billion in annual benefits in 2010 compared to $51 billion (Carper) and $83 billion (Jeffords). The Clear Skies bill offers $6 billion in annual benefits in 2010, lower than the $51 billion (Carper) and $83 billion (Jeffords) benefits of other bills. Clear Skies' pollution caps are less stringent, resulting in lower benefits compared to the Carper and Jeffords bills. EPA compares the effects of the three bills to a baseline that excludes current Clean Air Act requirements. The Clear Skies bill has less stringent pollution caps and a more relaxed implementation schedule compared to other bills. When adjusting the baseline to include current Clean Air Act requirements, Clear Skies shows minimal incremental costs and benefits. EPA has successfully integrated Clear Skies' market-based regulatory scheme into new regulations. The analysis suggests EPA's success in incorporating Clear Skies' market-based regulatory scheme into new regulations. Senator Jeffords' bill would have the greatest benefits, surpassing the Carper bill and Clear Skies in both 2010 and 2020. Senator Jeffords' bill, S. 150, is projected to have significant benefits compared to the Carper bill and Clear Skies. In 2010, its benefits would be $83 billion annually, surpassing the Carper bill by $32 billion and Clear Skies by 14 times. By 2020, the benefits are estimated to be $66 billion annually, three-and-a-half times more than the Carper bill and 22 times more than Clear Skies. S. 150, the Jeffords bill, is projected to have significant benefits compared to the Carper bill and Clear Skies. In 2010, its benefits would be $83 billion annually, surpassing the Carper bill by $32 billion and Clear Skies by 14 times. By 2020, the benefits are estimated to be $66 billion annually, three-and-a-half times more than the Carper bill and 22 times more than Clear Skies. EPA 2010 and 2020 Cost and Benefit Estimates for the proposals are also provided. The Jeffords bill, S. 150, is projected to be the most costly bill among the proposals. EPA analysis shows that a shortage of skilled labor will limit the installation of scrubbers by 2010, leading to coal-fired power plants shutting down. The bill would reduce coal production and generation by 40%, requiring a significant increase in natural gas and renewable fuel generators at great cost. Jeffords bill would reduce coal production and coal-fired electric generation by about 40%, leading to a significant increase in natural gas and renewable fuel generators at great cost. It would result in an additional 65 gigawatts of generation from renewable sources and nearly 100 gigawatts of additional oil- and gas-fired capacity. The net benefits of S. 150 far exceed those of Clear Skies and S. 843 (Carper). The cost of S. 150 may lead Clear Skies' proponents to view it as expensive, but its net benefits far surpass those of Clear Skies and S. 843 (Carper). S. 843 aims for significant emission reductions beyond the Clean Air Act, with lower costs than S. 150 but higher than Clear Skies. The bill's phased-in schedule helps mitigate short-term price increases. S. 843 aims for substantial emission reductions beyond the Clean Air Act, with a phased-in schedule to avoid short-term price increases. The bill also includes a flexible CO2 requirement to reduce emissions at a low cost, as highlighted in EPA's sensitivity analyses. The EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on various bills to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at a nominal cost. Three key variables were price elasticity, construction constraints, and electricity growth with constrained natural gas supply. Different combinations were examined, including one with no construction constraints. The EPA analyzed different scenarios for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, including the No Construction Constraint Scenario, EPA Base Case Scenario, and Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario. These scenarios varied in terms of price elasticity, construction constraints, and electricity growth assumptions. The No Construction Constraint Scenario, part of the EPA's analysis on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, removes short-term construction constraints but maintains a zero demand price elasticity assumption. This scenario has minimal impact on S. 843 and the Managers' Mark. The removal of zero demand price elasticity assumption in the analysis has a substantial impact on the cost of S. 150, with a 36% increase in the short-term and a 157% increase in the long-term. This exceeds the savings gained by removing EPA short-term construction constraints. The removal of zero demand price elasticity assumption in the analysis significantly impacts the cost of S. 150, leading to a 36% increase in the short-term and a 157% increase in the long-term. This exceeds the savings from removing EPA short-term construction constraints. The EPA Base Case Scenario replaces short-term price elasticity with zero elasticity, maintaining construction constraints. This results in a 63% increase in costs for S. 150 in 2010 and a 147% increase in 2020 compared to the benchmark analysis. For S. 843, removal of price elasticity leads to an 86% higher cost estimate in 2010. The removal of price elasticity for S. 843 in 2020 results in a cost estimate 86% higher than the benchmark estimate for 2010. This suggests that demand response and short-term construction constraint assumptions heavily influence EPA's cost estimates for S. 843. EPA's assumptions have little effect on S. 843 cost estimates in the long-term or for the Managers' Mark. The Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario for S.843 removes demand price elasticity, increases demand for electricity, and tightens natural gas supply, resulting in higher costs compared to the benchmark analysis. The combination of zero demand response, higher electricity demand, and tighter natural gas supply leads to increased costs, especially for S. 150. The impact is more significant for S. 150 compared to S. 843 and the Managers' Mark due to the assumptions of zero demand price elasticity. The impact of EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity is significant for S.150, less so for S.843, and nonexistent for the Managers' Mark. A more comprehensive analysis of future natural gas availability is needed to determine appropriate targets for multi-pollutant legislation. EPA's assumption greatly affects the short and long-term cost estimates for S.150, especially when higher electricity growth and natural gas assumptions are considered. EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity significantly impacts the cost estimates for S.150, especially with higher electricity growth and natural gas assumptions. The effect is less pronounced for S.843 in the short term but decreases over the long term due to its less aggressive time frame. EPA's assumptions have a significant effect on both bills in the short term, which decreases substantially over time. Assuming short-term construction constraints have significant effects on S. 843, which decrease over the long term. EPA's assumptions have little impact on cost estimates for the Managers' Mark, developed using EPA's model. The economic impact of the Managers' Mark is minimal compared to existing laws and regulations. The Managers' Mark has minimal economic impact compared to existing laws and regulations. Two bills analyzed by EPA, S. 150 and S. 843, aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions with specific caps set for different years. The S. 150 provision sets an emissions cap of 2.05 billion tons annually starting in 2010, while S. 843 would set a cap of about 2.655 billion tons in 2009, decreasing to 2.454 billion tons in 2013. S. 150's reduction requirement is more in line with the Kyoto Protocol compared to S. 843, resulting in higher CO2 allowance costs. The S. 150 provision sets emissions cap at 2.05 billion tons annually from 2010, while S. 843 sets cap at 2.655 billion tons in 2009, decreasing to 2.454 billion tons in 2013. S. 150's reduction requirement aligns more with Kyoto Protocol, leading to higher CO2 allowance costs. EPA estimates S. 150's carbon dioxide reduction costs at $19 per metric ton in 2010 and $33 per metric ton in 2020, comparable to current EU market prices. The EPA and its contractor did not develop new data on the cost or cost-effectiveness of control technologies for meeting the stringent 8% reduction below 1990 levels required under the Kyoto Protocol. They relied on assumptions from analyses conducted in 2005, which used data collected in 2003. Mercury control technology has advanced rapidly since 2003. The current EU price for a metric ton of carbon dioxide reduction is about $25. EPA estimates for carbon dioxide allowance prices in 2010 and 2020 are based on previous analyses. The analysis of emission controls for mercury may overstate costs due to advancements in technology since 2003. The cost of activated carbon injection controls is now one-fourth of what it was in 2003, according to the air pollution control industry. EPA's assumptions on mercury control costs may not accurately reflect current prices. The cost of activated carbon injection controls for coal-fired plants has decreased significantly since 2003. EPA's analysis shows that benefits outweigh costs for emission reduction bills S. 150 and S. 843, mainly in terms of human health effects from reducing emissions of SO2 and fine particles. EPA's analysis and CRS's reanalysis show benefits outweighing costs for bills S. 150 and S. 843, mainly in terms of human health effects from reducing emissions of SO2 and fine particles. Selected health effects avoided by the proposals are summarized in Table 6. Environmental benefits were not monetized due to methodological difficulties. The analysis of bills S. 150 and S. 843 shows benefits outweighing costs, mainly in terms of human health effects from reducing emissions of SO2 and fine particles. Environmental benefits, such as reductions in SO2 emissions leading to significant environmental benefits, were not monetized due to methodological difficulties. Reductions in SO2 emissions could have significant environmental benefits, including forest growth and reduced damage to building materials. The analysis does not estimate these benefits or the effects of regional haze formation. Mercury deposition has led to fish consumption advisories with economic impacts. The analysis also does not model mercury health effects, which have economic benefits ranging from a few million dollars to several. The analysis did not model mercury health effects, which have economic benefits ranging from a few million dollars to several billion dollars per year. The impact of omitting these benefits would be significant, especially for S. 150 and S. 843 with more aggressive Hg control schemes. Additionally, the analysis did not estimate the possible benefits of controlling CO2 emissions due to the lack of an accepted methodology for such an estimate. The analysis did not estimate the benefits of controlling CO2 emissions, which could be a significant omission, especially for bills like S. 150 and S. 843 with aggressive Hg control schemes. The Jeffords bill, being the most aggressive in controlling CO2, may be disadvantaged due to this factor. EPA's analysis highlights the importance of considering multi-pollutant legislation. The Jeffords bill may be disadvantaged in controlling CO2 emissions compared to Clear Skies, which does not cap CO2 emissions. EPA's analysis shows that Clear Skies has little cost and a small benefit after adjusting for rules, while the Jeffords and Carper bills have more stringent standards with benefits outweighing costs. Carbon dioxide costs depend on the amount. The Jeffords and Carper bills have more stringent standards than Clear Skies legislation, with benefits outweighing costs. Carbon dioxide costs depend on reduction requirements and implementation schedules. Mercury control costs are dependent on timely data, but EPA's analysis lacks current cost information. EPA's benefit analysis is limited and incomplete. Costs for mercury control are dependent on timely data, but EPA's analysis lacks current cost information. The analysis is limited and incomplete, working in favor of Clear Skies alternatives by overstating costs and assuming constraints on labor availability. The EPA's analysis of Clear Skies alternatives overstates costs and penalizes short-term pollution reduction schedules. It fails to consider the impact of natural gas price volatility on implementation strategies and costs, and is based on outdated 2003 assumptions. This outdated analysis may not contribute substantially to congressional debate."
