    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 2290.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to define terms related to telemedicine, including \"asynchronous store and forward\" and \"distant site\" for health care providers. The amended Section 2290.5 of the Business and Professions Code defines key terms for telemedicine, including \"health care provider\" as a licensed individual or a marriage and family therapist intern, \"originating site\" where services are provided via telecommunications, and \"synchronous interaction\" as real-time communication between a patient and a distant health care provider. Telehealth is the delivery of healthcare services through technology to facilitate diagnosis, treatment, education, and patient self-management. It includes synchronous interactions between patients and healthcare providers at distant sites.
