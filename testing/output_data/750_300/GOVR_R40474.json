    "content": "This report examines recent gun regulations in the District of Columbia and proposed congressional amendments. Key laws discussed include federal provisions like the National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act, the D.C. Firearms Control Regulation Act, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act (H.R. 645), and the District's Firearms Control Amendment Act and Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act. The report discusses recent gun regulations in the District of Columbia, including federal laws like the National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act, as well as the District's Firearms Control Amendment Act and Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act. Congressional proposals, such as the Second Amendment Enforcement Act (H.R. 645) and Title II of S. 160 from the 111th Congress, have also been introduced to address the District's firearms laws. The report analyzes congressional proposals to amend the District of Columbia's gun laws, comparing Title II of S. 160 from the 111th Congress with H.R. 645 from the 112th Congress. It examines the impact of these proposals on current DC firearms laws, tracing the differences section by section. The report analyzes congressional proposals to amend DC's firearms laws following the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, affirming an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense within the home. The Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller affirmed an individual's right to possess a firearm for self-defense within the home, declaring unconstitutional three provisions of the District's Firearms Control Regulation Act. The Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller declared unconstitutional three provisions of the District's Firearms Control Regulation Act, including the registration of handguns, carrying a pistol without a license, and requirements for firearms to be kept unloaded or secured. The opinion did not address the District's license to carry requirement. After the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, the DC Council enacted emergency legislation to amend the city's gun laws temporarily. This attempt was met with criticism as some felt the changes did not comply with the Heller decision. The DC Council enacted the Firearms Control Emergency Amendment Act of 2008, which was met with criticism for not complying with the Heller decision. In response, H.R. 6691, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, was introduced in Congress to potentially loosen the District's existing gun laws. In response to the DC Council's Firearms Control Emergency Amendment Act of 2008, H.R. 6691, the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, was introduced in the 110th Congress by Representative Travis Childers. The bill aimed to overturn or loosen the District's existing gun laws. It was later incorporated into H.R. 6842, which passed in the House but did not become law. In the 111th Congress, Senator John Ensign introduced S.Amdt. 575 to S. 160, which was approved by the Senate on February 26, 2009, and became Title II. In the 111th Congress, Senator John Ensign introduced S.Amdt. 575 to S. 160, the District of Columbia Voting Rights Act of 2009, which was approved by the Senate on February 26, 2009. Despite passing in the Senate, movement on the legislation was stalled, and the DC Council continued to enact emergency legislation until permanent legislation could take effect. In 2009, the Firearms Control Amendment Act of 2008 (FCAA) and the Inoperable Pistol Amendment Act of 2008 (IPAA) were passed by the DC Council and transmitted to Congress for approval. These acts amended firearms provisions in the DC Code and imposed additional restrictions on firearm regulation. The FCAA and IPAA were enacted in 2009, amending firearms provisions in the DC Code and imposing new restrictions on firearm regulation. These amendments were challenged and upheld in court in 2010. The language of Title II- S. 160 was adopted from a previous bill introduced in Congress. The language of Title II- S. 160, adopted from a previous bill, was challenged and upheld in court in 2010. The most recent congressional legislation, H.R. 645, aims to amend firearms provisions in the DC Code, limiting the District's ability to regulate firearm possession and repealing the registration scheme. The FCAA and IPAA would be amended by H.R. 645, limiting DC's firearm regulations and repealing the registration scheme. Federal firearms laws set minimum standards in the US, with states able to supplement them. Federal firearms laws in the United States establish minimum standards, with states able to supplement them. The District of Columbia can enact its own laws under the Home Rule Act. The District of Columbia has the authority to create its own laws under the Home Rule Act, including regulations on firearms. This power is often used to amend laws previously enacted by Congress. The District of Columbia has the authority to create its own laws under the Home Rule Act, including regulations on firearms. Congress retains the ability to legislate for the District and impose limits on its legislative authority. The Home Rule Act grants the District of Columbia the authority to create its own laws, including regulations on firearms. However, Congress retains the right to legislate for the District and impose limits on its legislative authority. The District of Columbia can only amend or repeal congressional acts if Congress did not intend for them to be unchangeable. Congressional limits on the District's authority are explicitly stated in certain acts, such as H.R. 645 and S. 160. The District of Columbia's authority to legislate on firearms is limited, as stated in certain acts like H.R. 645 and S. 160. The District cannot prohibit or unduly burden individuals from acquiring, possessing, transporting, or using firearms not prohibited by Federal law. The District of Columbia is restricted in enacting laws that discourage private ownership or use of firearms not prohibited by Federal law. The phrase \"transporting for legitimate purposes\" is included in H.R. 645 to address transportation requirements. The proposed language in H.R. 645 emphasizes that the Council would not have the authority to create laws related to firearms regulation. It is unclear what would constitute a restriction on individuals' ability to acquire firearms. The language also seems to prevent the District from prohibiting firearms possession by any persons. The proposed language in H.R. 645 restricts the Council from creating laws on firearms regulation. It is unclear what would constitute a restriction on individuals' ability to acquire firearms. The language also prevents the District from prohibiting firearms possession by any persons not prohibited under federal law. The proposed language in H.R. 645 restricts the District from creating its own firearms laws beyond federal regulations. It is unclear what would violate the prohibition against discouraging private firearm ownership. The language also does not revoke the District's authority to enforce sanctions for criminal misuse of firearms. The proposed language in H.R. 645 restricts the District from creating its own firearms laws beyond federal regulations. It does not directly revoke the District's authority to enforce sanctions for criminal misuse of firearms, but limits the scope of this authority. The District could regulate the carrying of firearms, but not explicitly prohibit it. The proposed language in H.R. 645 restricts the District from creating its own firearms laws beyond federal regulations. It allows the District to regulate the carrying of firearms, but not explicitly prohibit it, except at certain locations. The District could argue for a complete prohibition on open or concealed carry, despite the congressional provision. The District could argue for a complete prohibition on open or concealed carry, despite the congressional provision in H.R. 645. The DC Code's definition of \"machine gun\" included any firearm designed to shoot. Prior to Heller, the DC Code's definition of \"machine gun\" included any semiautomatic weapon capable of shooting more than 12 shots without manual reloading, leading to restrictions on registering pistols. Under the DC Code's old definition, a \"machine gun\" was any weapon capable of shooting more than 12 shots without manual reloading, leading to restrictions on registering pistols. The NFA defines a \"machine gun\" as a weapon that can shoot automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, including the frame, receiver, and parts for conversion. The District of Columbia amended its definition of \"machine gun\" to align with the federal definition, allowing for the registration of semiautomatic firearms. However, the District also prohibits certain firearms based on lists similar to those in other states like California. The District of Columbia amended its definition of \"machine gun\" to align with the federal definition, allowing for the registration of semiautomatic firearms. However, the District also prohibits certain firearms based on lists similar to those in other states like California. If H.R. 645 were enacted, it would restore the pre-Heller definition of \"machine gun\" and continue to align with the federal definition. The bill H.R. 645 would revert to the pre-Heller definition of \"machine gun\" in the District of Columbia, aligning it with the federal definition. This change would impact the registration of firearms, particularly handguns, which were previously restricted but now allowed for self-defense purposes. The FCAA in the District of Columbia now allows the registration of pistols for self-defense, including semiautomatic handguns that meet federal definitions. There is an exemption for temporary possession of a registered firearm in another person's home, as long as the possessor is not prohibited from having a firearm. The FCAA in the District of Columbia allows the registration of pistols for self-defense, including semiautomatic handguns. An exemption from registration is granted for temporary possession of a registered firearm in another person's home, as long as the possessor is not prohibited from having a firearm and believes it is necessary for self-defense. Amendments have been made to the qualification and information requirements for firearm registration. Applicants for firearm registration in the District of Columbia are prohibited if convicted of certain offenses within five years prior to applying, including intrafamily offenses and multiple DUI violations. Those with a history of violent behavior or civil protection orders issued against them are also prohibited. The FCAA sets strict eligibility criteria for firearm registration. Applicants for firearm registration in the District of Columbia must meet strict eligibility criteria. Those with a history of violent behavior, civil protection orders, or foreign protection orders are prohibited from registering a firearm. The FCAA also mandates completion of a firearms training course and limits the Chief of Police to registering only one pistol per person every 30 days. The Chief of Police in the District of Columbia must submit registered pistols for ballistics identification and is limited to registering only one pistol per person every 30 days, except for new residents who can register more than one pistol if owned lawfully in another jurisdiction for six months prior. The registration scheme also serves as a license for firearm owners and a permit to purchase, while H.R. 645 continues to prohibit certain firearms. H.R. 645 would repeal the registration requirement for firearms in DC, eliminating the need for a registration certificate or licensing of gun owners. It would also remove all registration language and conforming amendments. H.R. 645 would eliminate the registration requirement for firearms in DC, including the need for licensing of gun owners. It would also remove restrictions on the number of handguns an individual can purchase per month. Amendments would be made to DC Code \u00a7 [phone number scrubbed] regarding sales and transfers of ammunition and firearms. H.R. 645 would amend DC law to allow the transfer of ammunition to any person, including DC residents, and eliminate restrictions on the number of handguns an individual can purchase per month. The provision under Section 5 of H.R. 645 would allow the transfer of ammunition to any person, including DC residents, and eliminate the requirement for a licensed dealer to track ammunition inventory. H.R. 645 and Title II- S. 160 propose different ways to permit interstate purchase of firearms. Title II- S. 160 would amend federal law to allow federal licensees in Maryland or Virginia to sell handguns to DC residents. H.R. 645 would amend the DC Code to facilitate interstate firearms transfers. H.R. 645 proposes an exception to federal law to allow Maryland and Virginia firearms dealers to sell handguns to District of Columbia residents, facilitating interstate firearms transfers under the DC Code. H.R. 645 proposes an exception to federal law allowing Maryland and Virginia firearms dealers to sell handguns to District residents if legal conditions are met. The GCA mandates secure gun storage for licensed dealers but does not specify storage methods. The District's trigger lock requirement, deemed unconstitutional, exceeded federal law. The District's trigger lock requirement, declared unconstitutional, was more stringent than federal law, mandating firearms to be unloaded, disassembled, or secured with a trigger lock. The FCAA amended this provision to align with federal policy on gun storage. Under the FCAA, any firearm in lawful possession must be unloaded and secured by trigger lock, with restrictions on storing loaded firearms where minors could access them without permission. The FCAA requires firearms to be securely stored to prevent minors from accessing them without permission. Violation of these storage responsibilities can result in criminal penalties. Title II- S. 160 aims to repeal this section of the FCAA. The FCAA mandates secure storage of firearms to prevent minors from accessing them without permission, with penalties for violations. Title II- S. 160 seeks to repeal this requirement. H.R. 645, like DC law, penalizes allowing minors access to loaded firearms resulting in injury. It defines unlawful storage as knowingly leaving a loaded firearm accessible to minors without permission. In H.R. 645, unlawful storage of a loaded firearm occurs if a person knowingly leaves it where a minor can access it without permission, resulting in injury or death. Violators may face a fine up to $1,000 and/or one year in prison, with exceptions for securely locked containers. The penalties for unlawful storage of a loaded firearm include a fine up to $1,000 and/or one year in prison, with exceptions for securely locked containers or trigger locks. Exceptions to the penalties for unlawful storage of a loaded firearm include situations where the firearm is secured with a trigger lock, stored on the person's body, accessed by a minor due to unlawful entry, used in self-defense, supervised hunting or target shooting by a parent or adult, or in possession of a law enforcement officer on duty. No prosecution is pursued if the victim of the shooting is the child of the violator, unless the violation was intentional. Currently, under DC law, a violation of the registration scheme, such as maintaining an unregistered firearm, can result in a fine of up to $1,000 or imprisonment for up to one year. If the victim of a shooting is the child of the violator, prosecution is only pursued if the violation was intentional or grossly negligent. The current DC law imposes fines or imprisonment for unregistered firearm possession, with harsher penalties for repeat offenders. H.R. 645 aims to repeal this provision, while Title II- S. 160 seeks to eliminate criminal penalties for selling firearms to minors. H.R. 645 aims to repeal the registration scheme in the DC Code, while Title II- S. 160 would remove criminal penalties for selling firearms to minors. The District also amended definitions such as \"machine gun\" and \"firearm\" to harmonize with Titles 7 and 22 of the DC Code. Section 9 of H.R. 645 continues this harmonization process. The FCAA and IPAA aim to harmonize definitions between Titles 7 and 22 of the DC Code. Section 9 of H.R. 645 continues this process by aligning terms such as \"firearm,\" \"machine gun,\" and others. The IPAA allows DC to restrict firearm possession on its property and private entities to do the same, with exceptions for law enforcement. The FCAA and IPAA aim to harmonize definitions between Titles 7 and 22 of the DC Code. Section 10 of H.R. 645 allows private persons or entities in the District of Columbia to prohibit or restrict possession of firearms on their property, with exceptions for law enforcement personnel. The FCAA and IPAA aim to harmonize definitions between Titles 7 and 22 of the DC Code. Section 10 of H.R. 645 allows private persons or entities in the District of Columbia to prohibit or restrict possession of firearms on their property, with exceptions for law enforcement personnel. This provision differs from existing DC law by further limiting private landlords' ability to restrict tenants from possessing firearms on their premises. The second part of Section 10 pertains to the District's authority to regulate firearms on public property. The District of Columbia allows private landlords to restrict tenants from possessing firearms on their premises. The District also has the authority to prohibit firearms on public property with security measures in place. The District of Columbia allows private landlords to restrict tenants from possessing firearms on their premises, and has the authority to prohibit firearms on public property with security measures in place. Proposed language would apply to buildings or structures under its control, potentially limiting regulation of firearms on other real property. The proposed language in the District of Columbia potentially limits the regulation of firearms on real property under its control, specifically buildings and structures. It is unclear if the District could regulate firearms in other types of buildings under its control, and the authority granted does not extend to lessees occupying District-controlled buildings. The District of Columbia's proposed language limits firearm regulation on its controlled real property, particularly buildings and structures. It is uncertain if the District can regulate firearms in other types of buildings under its control, and the authority does not apply to lessees in District-controlled buildings. The ambiguity lies in whether the District can regulate firearm possession in buildings without security measures or only in those with security measures. The District of Columbia's proposed language limits firearm regulation on its controlled real property, particularly buildings and structures. The Chief's authority to issue licenses for concealed carry would be reinstated under H.R. 645. The bill also maintains the prohibition on carrying rifles or shotguns within the District. Upon enactment of H.R. 645, the Chief would regain the authority to issue concealed carry licenses. The bill upholds the prohibition on carrying rifles or shotguns within the District of Columbia, with exceptions discussed below. States can also enforce their own laws on firearm carrying. The IPAA amended the provision regulating law enforcement officers' concealed firearm carry. The District allows registered firearm holders to carry within their home, for recreational purposes, at their place of business, or while transporting it lawfully. The Chief's authority to issue licenses seems revoked under the IPAA, limiting carry scenarios to these four circumstances. H.R. 645 would modify the provision granting authority to carry firearms without a license. It would allow individuals to carry firearms in their dwelling house, place of business, or on their own land without needing a license. H.R. 645 would allow individuals to carry firearms without a license in their dwelling house, place of business, or on their own land, as well as for recreational, sporting, education, or training purposes, and while being transported for lawful purposes as authorized by law. H.R. 645 would restore the Chief's authority to issue concealed carry licenses, allowing firearm owners to carry their weapons outside specific circumstances. The bill would also maintain provisions for lawful transportation of firearms. The bill, similar to IPAA regulations, allows lawful transportation of firearms for any purpose as long as the firearm is unloaded and not readily accessible in a vehicle. H.R. 645 makes technical changes to the District Code regarding the transportation of firearms, including toy and antique pistols. Violators are subject to criminal penalties. H.R. 645 makes technical changes to the District Code regarding firearms, including toy and antique pistols, prohibiting their use in violent crimes. Violators face criminal penalties, and the bill grants jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings for cases related to firearms dealer licenses. The bill H.R. 645 grants jurisdiction to the Office of Administrative Hearings over firearm registration certificate denials or revocations. Provisions in the DC Code related to the FCAA and IPAA would be repealed under the bill. The congressional proposal in H.R. 645 would repeal provisions in the DC Code related to firearm registration certificates, dealer's licenses, and firearm transfers. This would require individuals to meet new requirements under the FCAA to obtain a registration certificate for engaging in firearm-related activities. The FCAA created new requirements for obtaining a registration certificate for firearm-related activities, including dealer's licenses and transfers. H.R. 645 would repeal the District's registration scheme, allowing individuals not prohibited by federal or District law to apply for a dealer's license or purchase firearms from licensed dealers. The federal GCA prohibits certain individuals from possessing firearms, including those convicted of a crime punishable by over one year of imprisonment and fugitives. Duties such as reporting lost or stolen firearms would be repealed under the proposed legislation. The federal Gun Control Act (GCA) prohibits specific individuals from owning firearms, such as those convicted of a crime punishable by over one year of imprisonment and fugitives. The GCA lists nine categories of prohibited persons, including those with mental health issues, illegal immigrants, and dishonorably discharged military personnel. The federal Gun Control Act prohibits certain individuals from owning firearms, including those convicted of a crime punishable by over one year of imprisonment, fugitives, individuals with mental health issues, illegal immigrants, dishonorably discharged military personnel, those who have renounced U.S. citizenship, individuals under court orders restraining them from harassing or threatening an intimate partner, and those convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. It is illegal for both licensed dealers and non-licensed persons to sell or transfer a firearm to someone they know falls within one of these categories. Under federal regulations, it is illegal for licensed dealers and non-licensed persons to sell or transfer firearms to individuals who fall within certain prohibited categories. To transfer firearms, one must meet federal law requirements and additional eligibility criteria under the FCAA and DC law. Under H.R. 645, licensed dealers must still follow federal and DC law requirements when transferring firearms. Private sales between non-licensed individuals must go through a licensed dealer. The bill would prohibit transfers to those prohibited from possessing firearms, but would remove registration requirements. Under H.R. 645, licensed dealers must still follow federal and DC law requirements when transferring firearms. The bill would prohibit transfers to those prohibited from possessing firearms, but would remove registration requirements. Additionally, the assault weapons ban created by the FCAA would be affected by Section 14 of H.R. 645. The assault weapons ban created by the FCAA includes a new definition of \"assault weapon\" that covers specific firearms and their variations, including semiautomatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns with military-type characteristics. It also includes shotguns with revolving cylinders, except those designed for .22 caliber rimfire ammunition. The Chief has the authority to designate any firearm as an assault weapon. The FCAA's assault weapons ban defines \"assault weapon\" to include specific firearms like semiautomatic rifles, pistols, and shotguns with military features. The Chief can also designate any firearm as an assault weapon, except for shotguns designed for .22 caliber rimfire ammunition. The new definition applies to the Assault Weapon Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990. The FCAA defines \"assault weapon\" to include specific firearms with military features and applies this definition to the Assault Weapon Manufacturing Strict Liability Act of 1990. Manufacturers, importers, or dealers of assault weapons can be held strictly liable for damages resulting from discharge in DC. The FCAA also prohibits possession, sale, or transfer of large capacity ammunition in the District. The FCAA in the District of Columbia prohibits possession, sale, or transfer of large capacity ammunition feeding devices, defined as devices that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. This would be repealed by Section 14 of H.R. 645. The FCAA in DC prohibits possession of large capacity ammunition feeding devices, defined as holding more than 10 rounds. This provision would be repealed by Section 14 of H.R. 645. Under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, licensed dealers are required to run background checks through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System before transferring firearms to non-licensed individuals. This process includes obtaining a unique identification number from the system or waiting three business days for a response. The licensee can transfer a firearm after completing a background check and receiving approval, unless a state imposes a waiting period. Non-licensed individuals are not required to undergo a background check under federal law. The DC Code mandates a 48-hour waiting period for pistol or handgun transfers within the District. The DC Code imposes a 48-hour waiting period for pistol or handgun transfers within the District. Under the IPAA, the waiting period for firearm transfers is now 10 days, applying to all firearms, not just pistols. The IPAA extends the waiting period for firearm transfers to 10 days for all firearms, not just pistols. If repealed, the waiting period for handguns would revert back to 48 hours. The FCAA includes provisions on microstamping for firearms. The FCAA introduces new provisions on microstamping for firearms, requiring semiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011, to be microstamp-ready. It also creates two new sections, 503 and 504, setting forth requirements for determining compliance. The FCAA introduces new provisions requiring semiautomatic pistols manufactured after January 1, 2011, to be microstamp-ready. Section 503 outlines the requirements for determining compliance and mandates manufacturers to provide specific information to law enforcement. Section 504 prohibits the sale of pistols not on the California Roster of Handguns Certified for Sale. New Section 504 of the FCAA prohibits the manufacture, sale, transfer, or possession of semiautomatic pistols not on the California Roster of Handguns Certified for Sale in the District of Columbia as of January 1, 2009. Residents can only sell or transfer ownership through a licensed firearms dealer if they lawfully own a pistol not on the roster. The FCAA prohibits the possession of pistols not on the California Roster unless lawfully owned and registered before January 1, 2009. Residents can only sell or transfer ownership through a licensed firearms dealer. The Chief must review the roster annually for updates. Discharging a firearm without a permit is also unlawful. The California Roster must be reviewed annually for updates by the Chief, who can revise the list of handguns deemed not unsafe. The District prohibits firearm discharge without a special permit, except for self-defense. It can also restrict possession of firearms on its property and private property within the District, except for law enforcement personnel. The District can restrict possession of firearms on its property and private property within the District, except for law enforcement personnel. H.R. 645 would repeal these provisions."
