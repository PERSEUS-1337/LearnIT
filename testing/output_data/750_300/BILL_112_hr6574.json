Since September 11, 2001, around 30,000 veterans have been discharged from the Armed Forces due to personality or adjustment disorders. These veterans are then unable to access disability compensation, severance pay, or retirement pay. Additionally, many of them struggle to find employment due to the stigma associated with their discharge label. Many veterans separated for personality or adjustment disorders face challenges in finding employment due to the stigma associated with their discharge label. The Department of Defense had low regulatory compliance in separating members based on these disorders between 2001 and 2007. A Mental Health Discharge Board of Review is proposed to review such separations. Between 2001 and  2007, the rate of veterans separated for personality or adjustment disorders was as low as 40 percent. A Mental Health Discharge Board of Review is recommended to ensure veterans wrongly separated on these grounds can access disability benefits and employment opportunities. The Department of Defense is reviewing military separations based on mental conditions that do not amount to disability. The Department of Defense is amending Chapter 79 of title 10, United States Code to establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review within each military department to review separations based on mental conditions not amounting to disability. The Department of Defense is establishing Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review within each military department to review separations of covered individuals from the armed forces with mental conditions not amounting to disability. Each board will consist of at least five members, including a licensed psychologist and psychiatrist. The Secretary of each military department will provide adequate administrative and behavioral health support staff for the boards.

After completing the review, the board must provide the claimant with the outcome.

Compliance with Administrative Procedure Act Transparency is required.

The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review may recommend different types of separation for covered individuals, including retirement for disability. If a recommendation is not made, a brief statement of reasons must be provided. The military department concerned must correct the individual's military records based on the Board's recommendation. The military department corrects the records of covered individuals based on recommendations from the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review. Corrections are effective as of the separation date. If a covered individual received a lump-sum payment at separation, their future benefits will be adjusted accordingly. The amount of pay or benefits for individuals based on military record corrections will be reduced if they received a lump-sum payment at separation. Regulations for this section will be set by the Secretary of Defense, with specified deadlines for required reviews. The regulations under paragraph (1) will set deadlines for required reviews.
