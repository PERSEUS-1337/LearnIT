    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nonprofit Athletic Organization Protection Act of 2004\". It includes findings related to nonprofit athletic organizations. Congress finds that amateur sports and education-based athletics are vital for youth development, promoting leadership, teamwork, and discipline. Participation in these activities is linked to academic success and social growth. Nonprofit organizations prioritize the well-being of young people through enacting rules, despite the risk of injuries. Amateur athletics promote good health and well-being in American society. Injuries are a risk but should not overshadow the benefits of sports participation. School sports and amateur competition help reduce obesity levels and lead to healthier adults with fewer health issues in the future. Playing rules in amateur sports are necessary to provide young people with age- and skill level-appropriate competition, involving intense physical activity and some element of danger. Rules making anticipates tradeoffs and balancing acts. Sport involves intense physical activity and a certain element of danger. Rules makers must draw clear lines and cannot afford vagueness. Athletes accept the risks of injuries in sports, and lawsuits based on rule development are deemed unfair. Rules makers face an increasing number of lawsuits for negligence in developing rules for sports, which could deter talented individuals from serving on rules committees. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, economic loss refers to pecuniary loss from harm, including loss of earnings, medical expenses, and loss of business opportunities. Harm includes physical, nonphysical, economic, and noneconomic losses. Noneconomic loss encompasses physical and emotional pain and suffering. The term \"noneconomic loss\" in applicable State law includes various nonpecuniary losses such as pain, suffering, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life. The term \"nonprofit organization\" refers to organizations described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, exempt from tax under section 501(a), or not-for-profit organizations operated primarily for charitable, civic, or educational purposes. A nonprofit athletic organization is a nonprofit organization primarily focused on adopting rules for athletic competitions. This includes employees, agents, and volunteers. An athletic organization is a nonprofit organization that sets rules for athletic competitions. It includes employees, agents, and volunteers acting within their duties. The term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia and other US territories. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR NONPROFIT ATHLETIC ORGANIZATIONS. Liability protection for nonprofit athletic organizations is provided, except in certain circumstances. The organization must have been acting within its duties and properly licensed for the competition or practice. Liability protection for nonprofit athletic organizations is provided as long as the rules are followed, proper licensing is in place, and harm is not caused by misconduct. Employees, agents, and volunteers are also covered under this protection. Liability protection for nonprofit athletic organizations extends to employees, agents, and volunteers. Civil actions can still be brought against individuals within the organization. Exceptions to this protection may apply based on state laws. Protection for nonprofit athletic organizations includes liability limitations under certain state laws, such as mandatory risk management procedures and employee training. Liability can still apply to individuals within the organization despite this protection. Nonprofit athletic organizations are protected by liability limitations under state laws, holding them accountable for the actions of employees, agents, and volunteers. However, the limitation on liability does not apply to certain claims under federal, state, or local laws such as antitrust, labor, environmental, defamation, tortious interference of contract law, civil rights law, or other relevant laws. The liability exemption provided does not cover claims related to antitrust, labor, environmental, defamation, tortious interference of contract law, civil rights law, or discrimination under federal, state, or local laws. SEC. 5. PREEMPTION. This Act preempts State laws inconsistent with it, except for laws providing extra liability protection for nonprofit athletic organizations' rule-making activities. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act takes effect upon enactment and applies to claims for harm caused by nonprofit athletic organizations filed after the effective date, only if the harm or conduct occurred after that date."
