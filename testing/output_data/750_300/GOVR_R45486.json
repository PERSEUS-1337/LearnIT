    "content": "The child nutrition programs, managed by the USDA-FNS, include the NSLP, SBP, Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, Special Milk Program, and Child and Adult Care Food Program, providing meals and snacks in institutional settings like schools and child care facilities. The child nutrition programs, including NSLP, SBP, Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, Special Milk Program, Child and Adult Care Food Program, and Summer Food Service Program, were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. Some authorities expired on September 30, 2015, but had minimal impact on program operations. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (HHFKA) expired in 2015, but had minimal impact on child nutrition program operations. In the 114th Congress, lawmakers began but did not complete child nutrition reauthorization, which involves potentially making changes to permanent statutes. In the 114th Congress, reauthorization legislation for child nutrition programs was reported by both the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. However, the legislation died at the end of the Congress. There were no significant child nutrition reauthorization efforts in the 115th Congress. The 114th Congress saw child nutrition reauthorization efforts that ultimately failed. The 115th Congress did not have significant reauthorization efforts, but the 2018 farm bill did include some provisions related to child nutrition programs. These issues may be relevant for future reauthorization efforts or policymaking opportunities. The 114th Congress and 2018 farm bill negotiations raised child nutrition-related topics that may be relevant for future reauthorization efforts or policymaking. Issues include the nutritional quality of foods served in schools, access to meals, and stakeholder involvement from school food authorities. The report provides an overview of current issues in child nutrition programs, including topics such as on-site consumption in summer meals, the Community Eligibility Provision, and stakeholder involvement from school food authorities, advocacy organizations, and food industry organizations. It highlights recent issues raised by Congress and program stakeholders, drawing examples from legislative proposals in the 114th and 115th Congresses. The curr_chunk provides a high-level review of recent issues in child nutrition programs, drawing examples from legislative proposals in the 114th and 115th Congresses. References to CRS reports for more detailed information are included. The child nutrition programs, including school meals, must meet specific requirements for federal reimbursement, such as nutritional standards updated under the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. For more detailed information, refer to CRS Report R43783, R44373, and R41354. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) required the USDA to update nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods. Schools meeting the standards receive increased federal subsidies. The HHFKA mandated USDA to update nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods, with regulations issued within specific timeframes. Increased federal subsidies were provided for schools meeting the new requirements, along with funding for technical assistance. Various organizations and stakeholders supported the nutrition standards, which were detailed in subsequent regulations, not the HHFKA itself. The HHFKA mandated USDA to update nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods, with regulations issued within specific timeframes. Various organizations and stakeholders, including nutrition and public health advocacy groups, supported the updated standards based on Dietary Guidelines for Americans and Institute of Medicine recommendations. USDA-FNS published final rules for school meals in January 2012 and competitive foods in July 2016, increasing fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in school lunches. The updated standards for school meals increased fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while limiting calories, sodium, whole grains, and proteins. Milk options were restricted to low-fat and fat-free varieties. Senior high school students were required to choose a half-serving of fruits or vegetables with their meal. Competitive foods had limits on calories, sodium, and fat. The nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods included limits on calories, sodium, and fat. Senior high school students were required to choose a half-serving of fruits or vegetables with their meal. The standards phased in during school years 2012-2013 and 2014-2015. The meal standards for school meals and competitive foods were implemented starting in school year 2012-2013. Some schools faced challenges with implementing the changes, such as difficulty obtaining whole grain and low-sodium products, student acceptance issues, reduced participation, increased costs, and food waste. These challenges were reported by the School Nutrition Association (SNA) and in news stories. The School Nutrition Association (SNA) and news stories reported challenges with implementing meal standards in school meals, including issues with student acceptance, reduced participation, increased costs, and food waste. Studies by the U.S. Government Accountability Office and USDA confirmed these issues in SY2012-2013 and SY2013-2014. SNA advocated for changes to the standards, while others argued for maintaining them for children's health. In January 2014, USDA made adjustments to the standards. In the first two years of implementation, the School Nutrition Association (SNA) advocated for changes to meal standards, while others argued for maintaining them for children's health. USDA made adjustments to the standards in January 2014, and Congress enacted provisions loosening requirements from SY2015-2016 through SY2017-2018. In December 2018, USDA published a final rule indefinitely changing aspects of the standards starting in SY2019-2020. USDA made changes to school meal standards in response to advocacy from the School Nutrition Association and others. Starting in SY2019-2020, flavored, low-fat milk can be offered, a 50% whole grain-rich requirement is in place, and exemptions for nonwhole grain-rich products are allowed. The USDA made changes to school meal standards in response to advocacy, allowing flavored, low-fat milk to be offered alongside a 50% whole grain-rich requirement. Exemptions for nonwhole grain-rich products are permitted, and sodium limits have been adjusted over time. The nutrition standards for school meals remain largely unchanged. The USDA made changes to school meal standards, including allowing flavored, low-fat milk and adjusting whole grain and sodium requirements. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress aimed to review and revise nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods. In the 115th Congress, legislative proposals aimed to revise nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods. The House-passed version of the 2018 farm bill would have required USDA to review and revise these standards to ensure they are based on research for school-age children, do not add extra costs, and maintain healthy meals for students. However, this provision was not included in the enacted bill. Child nutrition reauthorization proposals in the 114th Congress aimed to alter nutrition standards for school meals. The House committee's proposal (H.R. 5003) would have required USDA to review and revise school meal standards every three years based on certain criteria. Additionally, student fundraisers would no longer have had to meet competitive food standards. The Senate committee's proposal (S. 3136) aimed to revise whole grain and sodium requirements for school meals within 90 days of enactment. Negotiations resulted in an agreement to allow federally reimbursable meal foods to be sold a la carte. The Senate committee's proposal aimed to revise whole grain and sodium requirements for school meals within 90 days of enactment. Negotiations resulted in an agreement to reduce the whole grain-rich requirement to 80% and delay the sodium requirement for two years. Fresh fruit and vegetable snacks served in FFVP must be in their natural state without additives, but there have been discussions about including frozen, dried, and canned options. The 2014 farm bill funded a pilot project to include canned, dried, and frozen fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) in select states. Stakeholders have debated whether to maintain only fresh products or allow other types of produce. The 2014 farm bill funded a pilot project in select states to incorporate canned, dried, and frozen fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP). According to the final evaluation in 2017, 56% of pilot schools chose to include these products, leading to decreased vegetable offerings and increased fruit offerings. However, there was no significant impact on students' vegetable consumption, while fruit consumption remained unchanged. During the pilot project, schools introduced dried and canned fruits in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP), resulting in decreased vegetable offerings and increased fruit offerings. However, there was no significant impact on students' vegetable consumption, and fruit consumption declined on FFVP snack days. Student satisfaction with FFVP slightly decreased, parents' responses were mixed, and school administrators generally favored the changes. Legislative proposals are being considered for more permanent changes to FFVP offerings. Legislative proposals to change FFVP offerings are being considered, such as allowing CDF and pur\u00e9ed forms of fruits and vegetables in the program. In the 115th Congress, a bill was introduced to remove \"fresh\" from the program name, but this provision was not included in the final bill. In the 114th Congress, a similar proposal was made to allow schools to serve \"all forms\" of fruits and vegetables. In the 114th Congress, child nutrition reauthorization legislation proposed allowing schools to serve all forms of fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP). The Senate committee's proposal included temporary exemptions for schools with limited resources to serve canned, dried, or frozen fruits and vegetables, with a requirement to transition to fresh products over time. Schools participating in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and/or School Breakfast Program (SBP) must comply with federal requirements to purchase domestic commodities or products to the maximum extent practicable under the Buy American requirements. Under Buy American requirements, schools in the NSLP and/or SBP must buy domestic commodities or products produced and processed substantially in the US, as defined by statute and USDA guidance. \"Processed substantially\" means the product is processed in the United States with over 51% domestically grown ingredients, as defined by USDA guidance. The Buy American requirements apply to any foods purchased with funds from the nonprofit school food service account, as outlined in USDA regulations and guidance. The June 2017 memorandum outlines Buy American requirements for foods purchased with funds from the nonprofit school food service account. Schools are encouraged to integrate Buy American into their procurement processes and can make exceptions on a limited basis for products not produced in the U.S. The guidance allows School Food Authorities (SFAs) to make exceptions to Buy American requirements when U.S. products are not available in sufficient quantities or are significantly more expensive. SFAs must document any exceptions made and can request waivers for products that do not meet these criteria. State agencies are responsible for reviewing SFAs' compliance with Buy American regulations. SFAs must interpret and document exceptions to Buy American requirements, with the possibility of requesting waivers for non-compliant products. State agencies are tasked with reviewing SFAs' compliance and taking corrective action when necessary, as mandated by the 2018 farm bill. The 2018 farm bill requires USDA to enforce Buy American requirements and ensure understanding of responsibilities by States and school food authorities within 180 days. It clarifies that domestic products must be processed in the U.S. and contain meats, vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural commodities produced domestically. The 2018 farm bill mandates USDA to enforce Buy American rules, specifying that domestic products must be processed in the U.S. and contain meats, vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural commodities produced domestically. Proponents argue for stricter requirements due to economic and food safety concerns, particularly regarding sourcing from China. Proponents of stricter requirements for domestic sourcing in the Senate-passed farm bill cite economic and food safety reasons, expressing concern over sourcing from China. Some argue for maintaining schools' discretion in food procurement, stating that high-quality domestic options may not always be available or cost-effective. Summer meals are typically provided in group settings through the Summer Food Service Program and the National School Lunch Program's Summer Seamless Option. Policymakers have considered various proposals in recent years. In group settings, children are provided meals through the Summer Food Service Program and the National School Lunch Program's Summer Seamless Option. Policymakers have explored alternatives to congregate meals, especially in rural areas where onsite consumption is challenging. Reaching children in rural areas has been reported as very difficult. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act provided $85 million for projects to improve access to summer meals in urban and rural areas. One project, the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC), started in 2011 and continues in limited states and Tribal Organizations. Reaching children in rural areas for summer meals is a significant challenge. The Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC) project provides electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals, offering either $30 or $60 per month on an EBT card for WIC or SNAP. The Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC) project provides electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals, offering either $30 or $60 per month on an EBT card for WIC or SNAP. Participants in SNAP jurisdictions can redeem benefits for SNAP-eligible foods at any SNAP-authorized retailer, while WIC EBT participants are limited to WIC-eligible foods at WIC-authorized retailers. An evaluation of Summer EBT from FY2011 to FY2013 found a significant decrease in very low food security among participants. An evaluation of Summer EBT from FY2011 to FY2013 showed a decrease in very low food security among participants, with improvements in children's consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Both WIC and SNAP models saw increased consumption, with greater increases at sites using the WIC model. Congress has provided funding for Summer EBT projects, including $28 million in the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The WIC and SNAP models showed increased consumption, with greater increases at sites using the WIC model. Congress provided funding for Summer EBT projects, including $28 million in the FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Awardees for summer 2017 included Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Oregon, Virginia, and the Chickasaw and Cherokee nations. In October 2018, USDA-FNS announced a new strategy for determining grant recipients in FY2019. In summer 2018, USDA awarded grants to Tennessee and Texas, along with other jurisdictions. USDA-FNS announced a new strategy for grant recipients in FY2019, prioritizing new states, statewide projects, and projects for summers 2019-2021. Proposals in the 114th and 115th Congresses aimed to expand Summer EBT funding. In the 114th and 115th Congresses, proposals were made to expand Summer EBT funding, including allowing a portion of SFSP's mandatory funding to cover Summer EBT and authorizing up to $50 million in discretionary funding. The Obama Administration recommended nationwide expansion of Summer EBT over 10 years. Funding from the 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act was also used for demonstration projects, including the Enhanced Summer Food Service. The Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) was funded through the 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act and included initiatives such as lengthening operations at meal sites, adding recreational or educational activities, meal delivery in rural areas, and providing food backpacks for children. Evaluations of eSFSP were conducted from 2011 to 2014. The Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) included initiatives like extending operations, adding activities at meal sites, meal delivery in rural areas, and providing food backpacks for children. Evaluations from 2011 to 2014 showed increased summer meal participation rates and consistent food insecurity levels for children in the meal delivery and backpack programs. However, results should be interpreted cautiously due to small sample sizes and lack of comparison groups. The eSFSP initiatives showed increased summer meal participation rates and consistent food insecurity levels for children in meal delivery and backpack programs. Caution is advised in interpreting results due to small sample sizes and lack of comparison groups. Another project provided exemptions from congregate feeding requirements to outdoor meal sites experiencing excessive heat since 2015. The USDA has granted exemptions to outdoor meal sites in the SFSP and SSO programs experiencing excessive heat since 2015. Exempted sites must serve children in congregate settings on non-excessive heat days and provide meals in alternative forms on excessively hot days. Other proposals and hearings related to congregate feeding in SFSP have been discussed in recent years. In the 114th Congress, child nutrition reauthorization proposals aimed to allow rural meal sites to provide SFSP meals for offsite consumption, particularly in rural areas and nonrural areas with high eligibility for free or reduced-price meals. Congregate feeding sites would also be able to offer meals for offsite consumption episodically under certain conditions. The HHFKA created the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) to provide free meals to students in schools with high proportions of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Participation in CEP has increased since its nationwide availability in SY2014-2015. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) offers free meals to students in schools with high numbers of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Participation in CEP has grown since its nationwide launch in SY2014-2015, with over 20,700 schools involved as of SY2016-2017. Supporters argue that CEP enhances meal access, reduces stigma, and lowers administrative costs. CEP has gained support for improving meal access, reducing stigma, and cutting administrative costs in 22% of NSLP schools. However, some have proposed restrictions on CEP eligibility to target resources more effectively. This has also led to data issues for other programs. CEP has caused data issues for other federal and state programs, particularly the Title I-A program, as free and reduced-price lunch data is no longer collected under CEP's automatic eligibility process. The use of free and reduced-price lunch data for eligibility and funding in schools has been impacted by the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP). Students may qualify for free, reduced-price, or full-price meals, leading to issues of unpaid meal costs and schools' responses to such situations. In recent years, schools have faced the issue of students not paying for their meals, leading to various responses such as creating meal debts or implementing \"lunch shaming\" practices like providing alternative meals or barring participation in school events until the debt is repaid. Many schools have responded to students not paying for meals by implementing \"lunch shaming\" practices, such as providing alternative cold meals or barring participation in school events until the debt is repaid. Lunch shaming instances have been reported in news articles from different states, with limited national data available on the prevalence of such practices. Unpaid meal costs create a financial burden on school meal programs. Many school districts struggle with unpaid meal costs, which burden their meal programs financially. Schools rely on student payments for meals as a primary source of revenue, and failure to recover these funds results in \"bad debt\" that must be covered by nonfederal funding sources. Congress and USDA have taken steps since 2010 to address this issue. Since 2010, Congress and USDA have addressed the issue of unpaid meal costs in schools. If schools cannot recover these funds, they become \"bad debt\" that must be covered by nonfederal sources. Section 143 of the HHFKA required USDA to review states' and school districts' policies on unpaid meal charges and consider establishing national standards for meal charges and alternate meals. Recommendations may be made based on the findings. USDA was tasked with preparing a report on national standards for meal charges and alternate meals, but ultimately recommended updating policy guidance instead. This led to a memorandum requiring schools to implement and communicate new policies. USDA-FNS recommended updating policy guidance on unpaid meal charges and providing best practices for decision making by States and localities. SFAs were required to establish a written meal charge policy by July 1, 2017, with instructions on handling situations where a child does not pay for a meal. USDA-FNS also offered clarification through webinars, memoranda, and a best practice guide based on previous research and a Request for Information (RFI) on \"Unpaid Meal Charges.\" In a Report to Congress, USDA recommended updating policy guidance on unpaid meal charges based on findings from a study and a Request for Information (RFI) published in 2014. The study and RFI revealed that meal charge policies were mainly determined at the school and district levels, with varying levels of formality and enforcement. The responses to the RFI showed that meal charge policies were mainly decided at the school and district levels with different levels of formality and enforcement. School officials preferred local control, while national advocacy groups favored national standards. Lunch shaming and unpaid meal costs were also discussed in the 115th Congress. In the 115th Congress, national standards were favored for meal charge policies. The Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017 sought to prevent discrimination against children eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress, such as the Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017, aimed to establish national standards for how schools treat children unable to pay for meals. States have also enacted laws addressing unpaid meal costs and lunch shaming, like Illinois requiring schools to serve regular meals to students who cannot pay and allowing districts to request state assistance for debts over $500. In 2018, Illinois passed legislation requiring schools to provide regular meals to students who cannot pay and allowing districts to seek state aid for debts over $500. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act imposed new rules on school lunch pricing, mandating reviews and potential price increases, with the option to use nonfederal funds to meet requirements. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act mandated SFAs to review lunch prices and potentially raise them using a formula or nonfederal funds. The goal was to ensure children receiving free and reduced-price lunches get the full value of federal funds, as subsidies were previously cross-subsidizing other meal programs. The USDA study found that federal subsidies for free and reduced-price lunches were cross-subsidizing other aspects of the meals programs, including paid lunches. This occurs because all federal reimbursements are mixed into the same nonprofit school food service account. Raising prices may reduce participation in paid lunches, but under the paid lunch equity formula, prices must eventually match or exceed the difference between federal reimbursements for free and paid lunches. If not, schools must increase prices over time to make up the difference. Under the paid lunch equity formula, schools must increase prices over time to match or exceed the difference between federal reimbursements for free and paid lunches. For example, if the federal reimbursement was $3.37 for free lunches and $0.37 for paid lunches, schools not charging at least $3.00 per paid lunch would need to gradually increase prices until they close the gap. Schools cannot raise prices by more than 10 cents annually, but they have the option to do so. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) required schools to gradually increase the price of paid lunches if they were not charging at least $3.00 per lunch. Revenue from competitive foods had to go to the school food authority-run nonprofit school food service account, and the revenue had to equal or exceed the costs of obtaining those foods. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act required schools to increase paid lunch prices gradually if below $3.00. Revenue from competitive foods must go to the SFA-run NSFSA, ensuring it covers the costs. USDA provided exemptions for financially stable SFAs for SY2013-2014 to SY2017-2018. The USDA provided exemptions for financially stable SFAs for SY2013-2014 to SY2017-2018. Legislative proposals in recent Congresses considered eliminating paid lunch equity requirements. In recent Congresses, legislative proposals considered eliminating paid lunch equity requirements, with the House committee's proposal aiming to eliminate the requirements and the Senate committee's proposal suggesting a broader \"non-federal revenue target.\" The curr_chunk provides a list of acronyms related to various food programs in schools, such as CACFP, CEP, NSLP, SBP, and USDA-FNS."
