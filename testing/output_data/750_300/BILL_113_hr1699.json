The \"Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act\" aims to establish a standard for labeling foods produced using genetic engineering, including fish, to inform consumers about the production process. Congress recognizes the material changes in genetically engineered food and the right of individuals to know if their food was produced using genetic engineering. The Food and Drug Administration requires labeling of over 3,000 ingredients, additives, and processes. More than 60 countries, including the United Kingdom and other key trading partners of the United States, have laws mandating disclosure of genetically engineered food on labels. Several countries, including European Union members, South Korea, Japan, Brazil, Australia, India, China, and others, have laws mandating disclosure of genetically engineered food on labels. The Codex Alimentarius, a United Nations food standards organization, allows governments to decide on labeling genetically engineered foods. Mandatory labeling can help preserve the economic value of exports and sensitive domestic markets. Mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods can help preserve economic value in exports and sensitive domestic markets. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear disclosure of genetically engineered ingredients in food, with exceptions for restaurant food, medical food, and certain other foods. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to require clear disclosure of genetically engineered ingredients in food, with exceptions for restaurant food, medical food, and certain other foods. This includes foods produced using genetically engineered vaccines or processing aids. The paragraph discusses the definition of genetic engineering involving in vitro nucleic acid techniques and fusion of cells beyond the taxonomic family to overcome natural barriers. The term 'genetically engineered' refers to a food material produced through intentional genetic engineering techniques, such as injection of nucleic acid or fusion of cells across different taxonomic families to overcome natural barriers. The term 'genetically engineered' for food refers to material produced through intentional genetic engineering, including organisms or their progeny resulting from genetic engineering. The term 'genetically engineered ingredient' refers to any food ingredient derived from genetically engineered organisms. The term 'genetically engineered ingredient' refers to a material derived from genetically engineered organisms, regardless of detectable molecular changes or the organism's suitability for human consumption. This definition is included in an amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include a provision regarding guaranty for violations involving misbranded food. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to include a provision for violations involving misbranded food. This provision requires a recipient of misbranded food to provide a guaranty signed by a person in the United States stating that the food is not genetically engineered. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act amendment requires recipients of misbranded food to provide a guaranty stating the food is not genetically engineered. Recipients are exempt from penalties regardless of how they use the food. The amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act exempts recipients of misbranded food from penalties, regardless of how they use the food. This includes processing, using as an ingredient, repacking, or producing the food. No person can avoid responsibility for violating the Act. The amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act exempts recipients of misbranded food from penalties, regardless of how they use the food, including processing, repacking, or producing it. No person can avoid responsibility for violating the Act by transferring liability to another party. The amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act exempts recipients from penalties for misbranded food, but they cannot transfer liability to another party. The terms 'genetically engineered' and 'genetically engineered ingredient' are defined in section 403(z). Section 301(h) is amended to include '303(d)(2)'. Section 303(d) addresses unintended contamination. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is amended to exempt agricultural producers from penalties for misbranded food if the violation occurs due to unintended contamination. This amendment adds section 303(d)(2) to the Act. Agricultural producers are exempt from penalties for misbranded food under section 301 if contamination with genetically engineered material is unintended. The Secretary must establish labeling regulations for agricultural producers within one year of the Act's enactment to address unintended contamination with genetically engineered material. The Secretary must establish labeling regulations for agricultural producers within one year of the Act's enactment to address unintended contamination with genetically engineered material. This is a result of the negligence of the producer, and the Secretary shall promulgate proposed regulations for compliance."
