    "content": "The Water Resources Development Act of 2000 authorized federal agencies to participate in Everglades restoration projects under the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The Everglades is crucial to the South Florida ecosystem, which includes national wildlife refuges and national park units. Changes in water quantity, quality, and distribution since the 1950s have significantly impacted the region's ecology. Florida is home to over six million people and a large agricultural economy. Changes in water quantity and quality since the 1950s have significantly impacted the region's ecology, leading to water shortages during the dry season. The Everglades, a network of wetland landscapes, once stretched 220 miles from Orlando to Florida Bay. The Everglades in Florida, affected by lower rainfall in 2007, are expected to face more frequent water shortages as urban and agricultural demand increases. The network of wetland landscapes once spanned 220 miles from Orlando to Florida Bay, with water flowing south through slow-moving creeks and marshes to Lake Okeechobee during the rainy season. The flat topography allowed water to move slowly south to Florida Bay through a shallow, wide area. The Everglades in Florida once spanned 220 miles from Orlando to Florida Bay, with water flowing south through slow-moving creeks and marshes to Lake Okeechobee. The wetlands acted as natural filters and retention areas that recharged aquifers, supporting a variety of species. However, by the mid-1800s, the Everglades were seen as an unproductive swamp. Flood control and reclamation efforts altered the hydrology for development along the East Coast. The Everglades in South Florida were once rich in species diversity, but by the mid-1800s, they were viewed as unproductive swamps. Human interventions like the C&SF project altered the hydrology with canals and levees for flood control and development. The C&SF project by the Army Corps of Engineers in South Florida, authorized in 1948, altered the Everglades' water regime with canals and levees. This changed water flow from Lake Okeechobee, leading to less water during the dry season and more during the rainy season. The Everglades ecosystem has changed due to altered water flow from Lake Okeechobee, leading to habitat loss and reduced size. Urban and agricultural development have further impacted the ecosystem with degraded water quality from pollutants like excess nutrients and pesticides. Loss of plant and animal species in the Everglades due to degraded water quality from pollutants like excess nutrients, metals, and pesticides. Restoration efforts by the federal government and the State of Florida include acquiring lands and implementing a multi-species recovery plan. The federal government and the State of Florida have undertaken restoration activities to address the health of the Everglades, including acquiring lands and preparing a multi-species recovery plan. The South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force coordinates these activities with goals to \"get the water right,\" restore natural habitats, and foster compatibility of built and natural systems. The South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force coordinates restoration activities with goals to \"get the water right,\" restore natural habitats, and foster compatibility of built and natural systems. The plan focuses on capturing and storing freshwater for use during the dry season, with an estimated cost of nearly $20 billion, $10.9 billion of which would be spent under CERP. CERP aims to restore natural hydrologic functions, improve water quality, and provide water supplies by capturing and storing freshwater for use during the dry season. Approximately 80% of the captured water would be directed to the natural system, with the remaining 20% for agricultural and urban consumption. The plan involves removing 240 miles of levees and canals, building reservoirs, underground storage wells, and pumping stations to replicate natural flow. Title VI of WRDA 2000 approved CERP as part of the Final Integrated Feasibility. CERP involves removing 240 miles of levees and canals, and constructing reservoirs, underground storage wells, and pumping stations to capture and redistribute water. WRDA 2000 approved CERP and authorized $700 million in federal funds for initial projects. WRDA 2007 authorized additional activities, including the Indian River Lagoon and Picayune Strand restoration projects. The Administration proposes CERP projects for authorization in the next WRDA. WRDA 2007 authorized Indian River Lagoon and Picayune Strand projects, totaling $2.0 billion in authorizations. Title VI of WRDA 2000 established cost-sharing for construction and O&M of CERP projects between Florida and the federal government after negotiations. Title VI of WRDA 2000 established cost-sharing for construction and O&M of CERP projects between Florida and the federal government. CERP authorization was achieved after negotiations among various stakeholders. Federal agencies receive appropriations for CERP activities through annual appropriations bills. Information on appropriations status for CERP activities is available in CRS Report RL34009. Support for CERP remains broad, but concerns persist over implementation, including project prioritization, federal efforts, excess phosphorous mitigation, and restoration effectiveness. Since WRDA 2000, $0.37 billion in federal funds and $1.63 billion in state funds have been allocated to CERP projects, with a focus on Acceler8 efforts to expedite priority projects. Concerns remain over project prioritization, federal efforts, excess phosphorous mitigation, restoration effectiveness, and uncertainties in technologies. Some state funds have been allocated to CERP projects, particularly those part of the Acceler8 effort to expedite priority projects. Concerns exist regarding the prioritization favoring water supply over ecosystem restoration, with some stakeholders worried about the Corps' mission expanding into water supply projects for municipal and agricultural users. Proponents argue that the priority projects offer benefits for both water supply and restoration. Some stakeholders raise concerns about the Corps' mission expanding into water supply projects, while proponents of Accerler8 argue for prioritizing projects with both water supply and restoration benefits. Federal water resources policies support federal participation in ecosystem restoration projects like CERP based on environmental benefits for the nation. Some stakeholders are concerned that specific Everglades restoration projects may have primarily local benefits rather than national benefits. The increasing costs of CERP, particularly related to land acquisition, are worrying stakeholders who fear it may limit funds for other ecosystem restoration projects. Acceler8 proponents argue that these rising costs are a reason to expedite the process. The increasing costs of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) are a concern for stakeholders who fear it may limit funds for other ecosystem restoration projects nationwide. Sponsors and beneficiaries of traditional Corps projects are worried that funds may be diverted from their projects. No CERP projects have been completed since enactment, and all 15 components scheduled for completion by 2007 have been delayed. The delay in completing all 15 CERP components scheduled by 2007 raises concerns about the plan's feasibility. For instance, delays in the Modified Waters Deliveries Project (Mod Waters) may impact water flows for CERP components in the Everglades National Park. This interdependency of CERP and non-CERP projects for ecosystem restoration goals is a significant issue. The interdependency of CERP and non-CERP projects for ecosystem restoration goals is a significant issue. Potential delays in restoration may result from a pre-CERP project impacting water flows for CERP components in Everglades National Park. Controversy also surrounds a Florida state law that extends phosphorus mitigation deadlines for the Everglades. The potential delays in restoration are related to a Florida state law that extends phosphorus mitigation deadlines for the Everglades. Critics argue that the law may compromise restoration efforts, while proponents believe it represents a realistic strategy for curbing phosphorus pollution. Funding for restoration projects is conditioned on achieving water quality standards in federal properties. The FY2006 Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-54) conditions funds for restoration on meeting water quality standards in federal properties, with potential reductions if standards are not achieved. Congressional interest is shown in overseeing water quality standards for waters entering federal lands in Florida. Some question the effectiveness and necessity of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). Some environmental groups question the effectiveness and necessity of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) in achieving water quality standards for waters entering federal lands in Florida. Concerns include the complexity and cost of the plan, lack of measures to improve water quality in the Everglades, and the focus on water supply over ecological restoration. The Corps revised the project implementation sequencing to prioritize restoration activities earlier on. The Corps revised the project implementation sequencing for CERP to include restoration activities in earlier phases, addressing concerns about the focus on water supply over ecological restoration. Some environmental groups support CERP but worry about using funds designated for land acquisition for other CERP projects. Land acquisition is seen as essential for successful Everglades restoration. Some groups are concerned about using funds designated for land acquisition for other CERP projects in Florida. They argue that acquiring land early in the restoration process is crucial for successful Everglades restoration and to prevent irreversible damage from development. Management of Lake Okeechobee and flood issues in central Florida are also being questioned for their impact on the ecosystem. Some are concerned about irreversible damage from development in the Greater Everglades and question the management of Lake Okeechobee and flood issues in central Florida. Integration of water management and climate change impacts into Everglades restoration efforts is also being questioned. Ecosystem restoration is a developing science with evolving technologies and data support. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) is implementing adaptive management to address uncertainties in ecosystem restoration. Pilot projects, including testing aquifer storage, are being used to manage uncertainty in restoration outcomes. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) is utilizing pilot projects, such as aquifer storage and recovery (ASR), to manage uncertainties in ecosystem restoration outcomes. ASR involves storing surface water in aquifers for later use during dry periods, but the effectiveness of these pilot projects is still uncertain."
