    "content": "The federal K-12 education legislation, starting from the Improving America's Schools Act in 1994 to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, focused on granting flexibility to grantees. The NCLB expanded existing flexibility authorities and introduced new ones for state and local administration of federal K-12 education programs. This report outlines these authorizations and will be updated periodically to include significant developments. The report outlines authorizations for state and local flexibility in administering federal K-12 education programs, including waivers for federal program requirements. This flexibility is granted in exchange for meeting accountability requirements. The report will be updated periodically to include new developments. State and local aid recipients may have federal program requirements waived based on eligibility criteria, allowing for flexibility in the use of federal aid. This includes consolidating programs, transferring funds, and waiving specific requirements to broaden the range of activities funded. The federal government has the authority to waive program requirements for federal aid programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to allow for a broader range of activities. However, these flexibility authorities do not apply to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) due to specific issues and requirements unique to that program. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) will not be discussed further in this report, as federal involvement in K-12 education pertains to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). ESEA programs are authorized through FY2008, and the 110th Congress is considering whether to amend and extend the ESEA. This report will be updated regularly to reflect major legislative developments. The report discusses the federal K-12 education program requirements under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), including special flexibility authorities for waivers. It also addresses concerns expressed by some grantees about these requirements. The report will be updated regularly to reflect legislative developments. The report discusses special flexibility authorities for waivers of federal K-12 education program requirements under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). These authorities allow for waivers or exemptions from certain requirements for states and LEAs. The report outlines program requirements for federal K-12 programs, which can be waived for states and LEAs under special flexibility authorities. These requirements, known as \"accountability requirements,\" ensure federal funds are used appropriately. Federal K-12 education programs have specific requirements for eligibility, fund allocation, and outcomes, while also allowing flexibility in instructional methods and grade levels. These programs focus on student populations with special needs and specific instructional services like educational technology. Federal K-12 education programs focus on student populations with special needs, specific instructional services, innovative approaches, and subject areas like math or science. Most larger programs fall under student populations with special needs, while smaller to moderate programs cover instructional services, innovative approaches, and subject areas. Federal K-12 education programs are categorized into different areas such as student populations with special needs, specific instructional services, innovative approaches, and subject areas like math or science. Most programs fall under specific categories, while one program, the Innovative Programs authority of ESEA Title V-A, is considered a \"block grant\" due to its broad range of support activities. The ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs authority is considered a \"block grant\" due to its broad support activities. Federal requirements and non-regulatory policy guidance are important distinctions for state and local recipients of federal aid. \"Requirements\" must be met by grantees as a matter of law, derived from authorizing statutes or federal regulations. Program regulations supplement statutory language on complex issues where the U.S. Department of Education prioritizes specific actions. The Code of Federal Regulations updates supplement statutory language on complex issues prioritized by the U.S. Department of Education for grantees to take specific actions. Non-regulatory policy guidance is also published. The U.S. Department of Education publishes regulations and non-regulatory policy guidance for aid programs. Non-regulatory policy guidance includes extensive Q&A and \"Dear Colleague\" letters from the Secretary of Education. Grantees are not legally required to follow this guidance. Grantees may perceive \"non-regulatory\" guidance from the U.S. Department of Education as a way to avoid challenges in using federal aid, treating it as equivalent to regulations. \"Non-regulatory\" guidance from the U.S. Department of Education may lead grantees to believe they will face fewer challenges in using federal aid, treating it as equivalent to regulations. This guidance is similar to \"competitive priorities\" set by ED for grant programs. The U.S. Department of Education establishes priorities for grant competitions, giving preferential consideration to applicants who meet these priorities, such as serving schools with high percentages of low-income students. These priorities are not regulations but are published in the Federal Register. The U.S. Department of Education establishes priorities for grant competitions, giving preferential consideration to applicants who meet these priorities. These priorities are typically published in the announcement of the grant competition in the Federal Register. There has been a trend towards less voluminous regulations for federal education programs, with some programs having no regulations at all, relying on statutory guidance. The U.S. Department of Education has been prioritizing grant applicants who meet established priorities, which are outlined in the Federal Register. There is a trend towards fewer regulations for federal education programs, with some programs having no regulations and relying solely on statutory guidance. In cases where regulations are still published, they are generally briefer and address fewer issues compared to before the early 1990s. Proposed program regulations for ESEA Title I-A post-1994 and NCLB of 2001 have become briefer and address fewer issues, focusing mainly on standards, assessments, accountability, schoolwide programs, private school participation, and fund allocation within states and LEAs. The U.S. Department of Education has adopted a minimalist approach in publishing regulations for ESEA Title I-A, covering a limited number of topics. The U.S. Department of Education has adopted a minimalist approach in publishing regulations for ESEA Title I-A, focusing on a limited number of topics. The Secretary intends to issue nonregulatory guidance to address legal and policy issues under the Title I programs. This guidance will provide flexibility and clarification for states, LEAs, schools, parents, and other affected parties. The Secretary of Education plans to issue nonregulatory guidance for Title I programs, providing flexibility and clarification for educational agencies and stakeholders. This guidance will outline different approaches to meet program requirements and demonstrate evidence of meeting goals. The education assistance program requirements for federal grants aim to establish accountability for appropriate use of funds by SEAs, LEAs, and other aid grantees. This includes ensuring funds are focused on eligible localities, pupils, and purposes. The federal education assistance program aims to establish three forms of accountability for fund usage: target accountability, outcome accountability, and fiscal accountability. Target accountability ensures funds are focused on eligible recipients, outcome accountability ensures funds improve student achievement, and fiscal accountability ensures financial integrity. The federal education assistance program aims to improve student achievement and enhance K-12 instruction by ensuring financial integrity and preventing the supplanting of state or local funds. Specific types of requirements to support high need pupil groups or localities/schools, limit fund uses, conduct audits, enhance parental participation, implement staff qualifications, report program activities, meet student achievement goals, and evaluate effectiveness of federally supported programs. The curr_chunk discusses the regulations imposed on grantees of federally supported instructional services, including minimum qualifications for school staff, reporting program activities, meeting student achievement goals, and evaluating effectiveness. Violations may result in repayment of funds or prohibition from receiving further grants. Additionally, authorizing statutes may provide specific sanctions for states or LEAs that fail to meet requirements. The curr_chunk discusses general requirements and sanctions for states or LEAs that fail to meet federal education assistance requirements. These requirements are outlined in the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) and financial management circulars published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) and financial management requirements from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) are key for LEAs participating in federal programs. Other regulations cover civil rights, student privacy, and child nutrition programs. Additionally, federal regulations from other agencies may apply to LEAs and schools as employers. LEAs participating in federal programs must comply with various requirements, such as providing free or reduced-price school lunches to low-income families. Federal regulations from agencies other than the Education Department may also apply, covering areas like workplace safety, environmental protection, and labor relations. State and local educational agencies have flexibility in areas like grade levels and instructional techniques. Educational agencies have wide discretion in using federal education assistance, including grade levels, subject areas, and instructional techniques. Requirements for instructional methods are usually broad, allowing state and local discretion. Complaints about specific program requirements often focus on certain types of requirements. Complaints about ESEA and related program-specific requirements often focus on restrictions such as commingling funds, limitations on resource use, targeting aid to specific pupils or schools, and eligibility criteria. Complaints about ESEA and related program-specific requirements often focus on restrictions such as commingling funds, limitations on resource use, targeting aid to specific pupils or schools, and eligibility criteria, including restrictions on the use of resources purchased with federal program funds for activities other than those conducted under that program. The NCLB includes prohibitions against commingling funds, restrictions on resource use, targeting aid to pupils in poverty, eligibility criteria for flexibility programs, and outcome accountability requirements to increase effectiveness. The NCLB includes outcome accountability requirements to increase effectiveness of education services, which may seem inflexible to state or local perspectives, especially in low enrollment LEAs receiving small grants under federal programs. The NCLB outcome accountability requirements may appear inflexible to state or local perspectives, particularly in low enrollment LEAs receiving small federal grants. This categorical approach of larger ED programs may lead to fragmentation of services, inefficient resource use, and partial needs treatment instead of a focus on the whole child. The traditional federal categorical approach criticized for fragmented instruction, inefficient resource use, and partial needs treatment instead of focusing on the whole child and their instructional program. The traditional federal categorical approach has been criticized for fragmented instruction and inefficient resource use, focusing more on targeting resources than improving pupil achievement. Difficulties may arise from implementing federal programs in states with varying educational policies and demographic conditions. Some problems with categorical program structures may stem from misunderstandings of federal statutes and regulations. Some problems with categorical program structures and associated requirements in states and LEAs may be due to misunderstandings of federal statutes and regulations, or strict interpretations by state and local officials. Despite efforts to focus federal aid on students in need, regulatory burdens and constraints on the use of federal funds are still a concern for state and local education officials. State and local education officials sometimes complain about constraints on the use of federal funds, as highlighted in a 1998 Government Accountability Office report. LEA staff find it challenging to meet program-specific and cross-cutting requirements for federal K-12 education assistance. LEA staff struggle to access current and concise information on various federal requirements for K-12 education assistance. This lack of information leads to a cautious approach that limits their flexibility in utilizing available options. LEA staff often respond cautiously to information gaps, limiting their flexibility. They express concerns about the costs of meeting administrative responsibilities and face challenges with timelines and management in federal K-12 education programs. Prior to the enactment of NCLB, authorities were adopted allowing waivers for federal K-12 program requirements by SEAs and LEAs. These waivers are limited in scope and can be requested on a case-by-case basis or through blanket authority. Some federal programs offer waivers for specific requirements under ESEA and other programs, with varying levels of flexibility and accountability. Waivers can be requested on a case-by-case basis or through blanket authority. Additionally, schoolwide program authority under ESEA Title I-A provides a high degree of flexibility in fund usage at the school level. Five types of special flexibility are provided under various federal programs, including Ed-Flex and Secretarial case-by-case waivers, schoolwide program authority under ESEA Title I-A, flexibility in the use of funds under the Innovative Programs block grant, and flexibility for small, rural LEAs. These flexibility options were established before the NCLB of 2001. The Ed-Flex authority allows the Department of Education to delegate waiver authority to states for selected ESEA programs. Initially authorized in 1994, it was expanded to 12 states. The Ed-Flex authority allows states to waive requirements for selected ESEA programs. Initially authorized in 1994 for up to six states, it was expanded to 12 states in 1996 and later modified in 1999. Amendments were made in 2001 and the authority was extended in 2006 until the next reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. The Ed-Flex authority, initially authorized in 1994 for up to six states, was expanded to 12 states in 1996 and modified in 1999. Amendments were made in 2001, and the authority was extended in 2006 until the next reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. No state has been granted Ed-Flex authority since January 2002, and the authority for ED to grant it to additional states expired in FY2004. The Ed-Flex authority, initially authorized in 1994 for up to six states, was expanded to 12 states in 1996 and modified in 1999. No state has been granted Ed-Flex authority since January 2002, and the authority for ED to grant it to additional states expired in FY2004. Recent congressional action (P.L. 109-211) addressed the expiration of authority for all 10 Ed-Flex states by January 2007. All states with Ed-Flex authority as of September 30, 2004 retain that authority until reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. Under P.L. 109-211, states with Ed-Flex authority as of September 30, 2004 retain that authority until ESEA Title I, Part A is reauthorized. States must waive state and federal requirements for LEAs and schools, meet curriculum and performance standards under ESEA Title I-A, and monitor LEA and school performance. No extension of Ed-Flex authority beyond the initial 10 states is allowed. States with Ed-Flex authority must waive state and federal requirements for LEAs and schools, meet curriculum and performance standards under ESEA Title I-A, and monitor their performance. They are also required to submit annual reports on outcomes to the Department of Education. Ed-Flex applies to various federal programs under ESEA Titles. The ESEA programs administered via SEAs and allocated funds by formula include Title I-A (Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged), Title I-B-3 (William F. Goodling Even Start Family Literacy Programs), Title I-C (Education of Migratory Children), Title I-D (Prevention and Intervention Programs for Children and Youth Who Are Neglected, Delinquent, or At-Risk), Title I-F (Comprehensive School Reform Program), Title II-A (Teacher and Principal Training and Recruiting Fund), Title II-D-1 (State and Local Technology Grants), Title III-B-4 (Emergency Immigrant Education Act) if Title III-A is not in effect, Title IV-A-1 (Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities), Title V-A (Innovative Programs), and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Perkins Act). The Ed-Flex statutes allow participating states to waive certain administrative requirements of ESEA programs administered by SEAs and funded by formula, including Title I-A, Title I-B-3, Title I-C, Title I-D, Title I-F, Title II-A, Title II-D-1, Title III-B-4 (if Title III-A is not in effect), IV-A-1, V-A, and the Perkins Act. These waivers do not apply to certain types of requirements unless they align with the statutory purposes. The General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) and Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) outline requirements that cannot be waived by Ed-Flex states, such as fiscal accountability and equitable funding for educational services. The Ed-Flex program allows waivers for certain educational requirements, such as maintaining spending levels, equitable funding, parental involvement, and civil rights compliance. LEAs or schools in Ed-Flex states must apply for waivers through their SEA, providing necessary information. ESEA Title I-A school selection requirements, civil rights requirements, and Ed-Flex states' waiver process through SEAs. SEAs cannot waive their own requirements and must ensure the underlying purposes of statutory requirements are met. Local waivers can be terminated if student performance is inadequate or declines. Local waivers can be terminated if student performance is inadequate or declines, and states must submit annual reports on waivers granted, including their effects on student performance. Starting two years after P.L. 106-25, ED will make these state reports available to Congress and the public. The second annual report must include information on the effects of waivers on student performance. Starting two years after P.L. 106-25, ED will make state reports available to Congress and the public, and submit a report summarizing the state reports, including information on the effects of Ed-Flex waivers on state reform efforts and pupil performance. The 2001 report lacked details on the use of Ed-Flex authority by states and programmatic impacts. The 2001 report on Ed-Flex authority lacked information on state use and program impacts. No subsequent annual reports have been published by ED. Waivers can be granted to SEAs or LEAs by the U.S. Secretary of Education for flexibility in education programs. The Ed-Flex authority allows waivers to be granted by the U.S. Secretary of Education for flexibility in education programs, specifically in Title IX, Part D of the ESEA. Requests for waivers must include specific, measurable educational goals. The Secretary of Education can waive most requirements for programs under the ESEA upon request from SEAs, LEAs, Indian tribes, or schools. Waiver requests must include specific, measurable educational goals. Certain requirements cannot be waived under the ESEA Title IX-D case-by-case waiver authority. The ESEA Title IX-D case-by-case waiver authority allows for waivers of certain requirements, but there are four types of requirements that cannot be waived: prohibitions against using funds in state school finance programs, for religious worship or instruction, for sex education, and eligibility requirements for charter schools. The ESEA Title IX-D waiver authority allows for waivers of certain requirements, but prohibitions against using funds for religious worship or instruction, sex education, and eligibility requirements for charter schools cannot be waived. Waivers granted under ESEA Title IX-D may not exceed four years, with the possibility of extension if it contributes to improved student achievement. The Secretary can grant waivers under ESEA Title IX-D for up to four years, with the possibility of extension if it improves student achievement. Waivers can be terminated if pupil performance is inadequate or if the waiver is no longer necessary. The Secretary must publish a notice of the waiver decision in the Federal Register. The Secretary of Education can grant waivers under ESEA Title IX-D for up to four years, with the possibility of extension if it improves student achievement. A memorandum from ED's Office of the Inspector General highlighted the Department's failure to publish notices of waiver decisions. In response, ED published a list of 197 waivers granted between 2002 and 2006, with few being substantive. Between 2002 and 2006, the Secretary of Education granted 197 waivers under ESEA Title IX-D, with most being minor. 65% were waivers of administrative cost limitations for Indian education grants, while others were related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, pilot programs, and fund obligation extensions. Between 2002 and 2006, the Secretary of Education granted 197 waivers under ESEA Title IX-D. 45 waivers were related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, pilot programs, and fund obligation extensions. 18 waivers were specifically for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, 5 for pilot programs, 6 for providing supplemental educational services, and 6 for LEAs identified as needing improvement to act as SES providers. The remaining 10 waivers were for general programmatic exceptions. The Secretary of Education granted 197 waivers under ESEA Title IX-D between 2002 and 2006. These waivers included provisions for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, pilot programs, fund obligation extensions, supplemental educational services, and LEAs identified for improvement to act as SES providers. Additionally, there were general programmatic waivers for exceptions to ESEA Title I-A requirements. Annual reports on waiver effects and effectiveness were required but it is unclear if any have been submitted. Another waiver authority applies to schools in the Public Charter Schools program. The Secretary of Education granted 197 waivers under ESEA Title IX-D between 2002 and 2006, including provisions for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, pilot programs, fund obligation extensions, and LEAs acting as SES providers. Annual reports on waiver effects were required but it is unclear if any were submitted. Another waiver authority applies to schools in the Public Charter Schools program, allowing waivers for any requirement under the Secretary's administrative authority. Under the PCS waiver authority, the Secretary of Education can waive requirements except those related to the definition of a charter school eligible for PCS funds. This authority is used infrequently and for limited purposes. Schools participating in the ESEA Title I-A program with 40% or more low-income students can conduct schoolwide programs with flexibility in fund use. This allows federal aid to improve services for all students, rather than just the most disadvantaged. Title I-A and other federal K-12 education programs can be used to improve services for all students, not just the most disadvantaged. Schoolwide programs that meet program intent and beneficiary needs are exempt from certain regulations, such as health, safety, civil rights, parental participation, and fiscal accountability. Funds must supplement, not supplant, other federal funds. Title I-A and other federal K-12 education programs must supplement, not supplant, other federal and non-federal funds. Commingling or flexibility in fund use is allowed for schoolwide programs, but IDEA program requirements must still be met. This authority is most significant for Title I-A programs. The schoolwide program authority applies to a wide variety of federal K-12 education programs, primarily significant for Title I-A. Other programs typically focus on LEAs overall, not individual schools, except for the IDEA which is specifically limited. The schoolwide program authority allows schools to use Title I-A funds on a schoolwide basis, combining them with state and local funds without separate accounting. This flexibility is significant compared to the traditional \"targeted assistance\" program format. Few additional requirements are needed for schoolwide programs in return for this flexibility. The schoolwide program authority provides flexibility compared to the traditional \"targeted assistance\" Title I-A program format. Schoolwide programs have few additional requirements and have grown rapidly in recent years, serving a large majority of Title I-A pupils. The eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs was reduced to 40% of pupils from low-income families by the NCLB. The eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs was reduced from 50% to 40% of pupils from low-income families by the NCLB, allowing high poverty schools to provide special assistance to all disadvantaged pupils. The NCLB reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs from 50% to 40% of pupils from low-income families, allowing high poverty schools to provide special assistance to all disadvantaged pupils. This change aims to ensure equitable distribution of Title I-A services to all students in need. The NCLB reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs to 40% of low-income pupils, aiming for equitable distribution of Title I-A services. There is little evidence on the achievement effects of this expansion, and small rural LEAs have flexibility to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) allows small, rural LEAs to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs. This flexibility was initially authorized under P.L. 106-554 and extended by the NCLB. LEAs with fewer than 600 pupils or located in sparsely populated areas can benefit from this special flexibility authority. LEAs with total average daily attendance below 600 pupils, or located in rural areas with low population density, can combine funds from specific ESEA programs for various educational activities. LEAs with low attendance or in rural areas can combine funds from specific ESEA programs for educational activities, including Title I-A, III, and IV-B. This flexibility is provided due to the small size of grants received by these LEAs. The \"REAP Flex\" authority allows small, rural LEAs to combine and transfer funds among specific program activities to make more effective use of their grants. This flexibility is similar to the Transferability authority available to all LEAs under NCLB, with the main difference being that it is specifically tailored for small, rural LEAs. The \"REAP Flex\" authority allows small, rural LEAs to transfer 100% of funds among programs like ESEA Titles III and IV-B, providing greater flexibility compared to the broader Transferability authority. Eligible LEAs can also receive supplementary grants. The small, rural LEA authority allows for the transfer of funds among programs like ESEA Titles III and IV-B, with the advantage of receiving supplementary grants. Participation in the rural LEA flexibility authority is widespread, with approximately 4,781 LEAs eligible and an estimated 51% participating in 2005-2006. In July 2007, participation in REAP Flex is widespread among approximately 4,781 LEAs, with an estimated 51% participating in the rural LEA flexibility authority in 2005-2006. LEAs most often transferred funds from ESEA Titles II-A and IV-A into Titles I-A and V-A. Rural LEAs found this flexibility useful due to small formula allocations for school improvement activities. Rural LEAs found the flexibility of REAP Flex and ESEA Title V-A (Innovative Programs) beneficial due to small formula allocations for school improvement activities. There was confusion at the LEA level between REAP Flex and general Transferability authority. Some LEAs eligible for both were unclear on which authority they were using. ESEA Title V-A, Innovative Programs, is a K-12 education program administered by ED considered a block grant, providing flexibility to states and LEAs in the use of federal aid funds. ESEA Title V-A, Innovative Programs, is a K-12 education program administered by ED as a block grant, offering flexibility to states and LEAs in utilizing federal aid funds. Block grants in education cover a wide range of activities and student types, allowing states to use funds as needed. The consolidation of categorical programs into block grants, like Title V-A in 1981, provides more flexibility in funding allocation. Title V-A funds are allocated to states based on population aged 5-17, with a minimum grant requirement. SEAs distribute funds to LEAs using state-developed formulas considering public and private school enrollment. State-developed formulas allocate Title V-A funds from SEAs to LEAs based on enrollment, with adjustments for high-cost pupils. Minimum suballocation percentages to LEAs vary by program funding levels. The minimum percentage of funds that must be suballocated to LEAs varies depending on the program's funding level. States must suballocate at least 85% of the grant they received under the program for FY2002 to LEAs. Most states are required to suballocate 100% of their Title V-A grants above the FY2002 level to LEAs, with exceptions for states receiving the minimum grant amount. Of the funds retained by states, no more than 15% may be used. States must suballocate at least 85% of their Title V-A grants above the FY2002 level to LEAs, with exceptions for states receiving the minimum grant amount. Of the funds retained by states, no more than 15% may be used for administrative costs, with the remainder allocated to specified programs and services. The curr_chunk discusses the use of Title V-A funds by LEAs for various educational purposes such as pupil assessments, achievement standards, charter schools, school choice options, school repair, and statewide education reform programs. LEAs have the flexibility to choose from 27 different innovative assistance programs. LEAs can use Title V-A funds for various innovative assistance programs, including charter schools, same-gender classrooms, school nurses, education reform projects, and programs to improve academic achievement for disadvantaged students. Title V-A funds can be used by LEAs for projects and activities that encourage improvements in the area served, including programs to improve academic achievement for disadvantaged students. The program was first enacted in 1981 as Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act. The statute prohibits SEAs from influencing LEA decisions on the use of Title V-A funds. The program was initially authorized in 1981 as Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act, consolidating over 40 federal K-12 education programs in response to a Reagan Administration proposal for a broader block grant. The block grant initially reduced federal education programs, but new categorical programs were authorized soon after. A study found that 58% of LEAs used Title V-A funds for instructional materials. Based on a recent study by the ED, 58% of LEAs used Title V-A funds for instructional materials, 39% for educational technology, and 34% for targeted academic services. Large LEAs often used funds for teacher professional development and school improvement. However, resources were not frequently directed towards high-need students or schools. Title V-A funds were used for teacher professional development and school-based improvement efforts, but were not often targeted at high-need pupils or schools. Decisions on fund use were influenced by long-term LEA plans and individual school priorities. Appropriations for Title V-A declined from $442 million in FY1982 to $99 million in FY2007, with zero funds provided in FY2008, possibly leading to the program's termination. The funding for Title V-A has decreased significantly over the years, from $442 million in FY1982 to $99 million in FY2007. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 did not provide any funds for Title V-A, potentially leading to the program's termination. The lack of support and promotion for increased funding has contributed to this trend. Title V-A funding has decreased significantly over the years, with limited information on its effects reducing incentives to maintain funding levels. The program has not received favorable treatment in funding decisions compared to programs with demonstrated targeting of funds or improved outcomes. The Title V-A program has faced challenges in maintaining funding levels due to limited information on its effects. It has not received favorable treatment in funding decisions compared to programs with demonstrated outcomes. The NCLB amendment required states to submit annual summaries on how the program contributes to improving student achievement. The NCLB amendment requires states to submit annual summaries on how assistance under Title V-A is improving student academic achievement or the quality of education. Authorities under the NCLB allow SEAs and LEAs to increase Title V-A funding by transferring funds from other federal programs. Additional provisions providing flexibility to states and LEAs are also mentioned. The NCLB amendment allows states to enhance Title V-A funding by transferring funds from other federal programs. Additional provisions offer flexibility to states and LEAs, such as consolidated applications and funds for administrative convenience. The NCLB amendment provides flexibility for SEAs and LEAs through consolidated applications and funds for administrative convenience. This includes authority for consolidated applications, plans, and reports for ESEA programs, as well as the consolidation of certain funds for SEA or LEA administration of federal programs. The NCLB amendment provides flexibility for SEAs and LEAs through consolidated applications and funds for administrative convenience. Title VI, Part A, Subpart 2 of the ESEA allows most LEAs to transfer up to 50% of their formula grants among four ESEA programs. The NCLB amendment allows LEAs to transfer up to 50% of their formula grants among four ESEA programs. LEAs failing to meet AYP requirements can transfer only 30% of their grants to address the failure, with restrictions for LEAs under corrective actions. States may provide guidance on the transfers. States may transfer up to 50% of program funds among select ESEA programs, excluding funds required for suballocation to LEAs or state administration. LEAs can only transfer 30% of grants to address AYP failures, with restrictions for those under corrective actions. The Transferability authority allows states to transfer funds among select ESEA programs, excluding funds for LEAs or state administration. The total appropriations for programs subject to this authority in FY2008 is approximately $3.5 billion. LEAs can make transfers without specific approval, but plans must be modified accordingly. The Transferability authority allows LEAs to transfer approximately $3.5 billion among ESEA programs without specific approval. Funds can be used for a wide range of purposes, including the Innovative Programs block grant, but all program requirements still apply. Transfers cannot cross fiscal years. The Transferability authority allows LEAs to transfer funds among ESEA programs, including the Innovative Programs block grant. Program requirements still apply, and funds cannot be transferred across fiscal years. Participation in Transferability is relatively modest, with 12-16% of LEAs participating in 2005-2006. According to a study by ED in July 2007, participation in Transferability is modest, with 12-16% of LEAs involved in 2005-2006. There is confusion between REAP Flex and Transferability authorities at the LEA level, leading to conflicting reports on participation. LEAs mostly transfer funds from ESEA Title II-A. LEAs participating in Transferability often moved funds from ESEA Title II-A and Title IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A to compensate for reductions in formula grants and target resources on schools failing to meet progress standards. Many LEAs used Transferability to shift funds from ESEA Title II-A and Title IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A to address funding reductions and target resources on underperforming schools. Reasons for not participating included lack of information, satisfaction with existing flexibility, or insufficient funding levels. Under a new State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act (ESEA Title VI, Part A, Subpart 3), up to seven states may consolidate all state administration and activity funds under various education programs. Under the State-Flex authority, states can consolidate funds from multiple education programs for various purposes authorized under any ESEA program for a period of five years. Under the \"State-Flex\" authority, states can use consolidated funds for any purpose authorized under any ESEA program for five years. States risk losing this authority if they do not meet AYP requirements for two consecutive years, and the authority can be terminated by ED for non-compliance. If all requirements are met after five years, the authority is renewed. Selected states must enter into local performance agreements. The \"State-Flex\" authority allows states to use consolidated funds for ESEA programs for five years, with the risk of losing authority if AYP requirements are not met. States must enter into local performance agreements with 4-10 LEAs, aligning fund use with state's funds. LEAs with child poverty rates of 20% or more can consolidate funds under this authority. LEAs with child poverty rates of 20% or more can consolidate funds under the State-Flex authority, aligning fund use with the state's funds. Participating states may specify purposes for LEAs' use of funds received under the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant. Florida is the only state granted State-Flex authority so far. Under the State-Flex authority, Florida was the only state granted flexibility to align fund use with the state's funds, but they withdrew before implementation. No other state has participated in the program. Local-Flex authority allows up to 80 LEAs to consolidate funds under Title II-A. Under the Local-Flex authority, up to 80 LEAs can consolidate funds from various programs under ESEA for five years, with a 4% limit for administration. Failure to meet state AYP requirements would result in losing this authority. Under the Local-Flex authority, LEAs can consolidate funds from ESEA programs for five years, with a 4% limit for administration. Failure to meet state AYP requirements would result in losing this authority. LEAs must comply with the requirements of the flexibility agreement to maintain their authority. Under the Local-Flex authority, LEAs can consolidate funds from ESEA programs for five years, with a 4% limit for administration. Their authority would be renewed for another two-year term. Certain requirements cannot be waived, such as those related to civil rights, fiscal accountability, and equitable participation by private school pupils and teachers. Participating states and LEAs must prepare annual reports on fund usage. Only Seattle, Washington, has participated in the Local-Flex program. Seattle, Washington is the only LEA that has participated in the Local-Flex program, but their eligibility has been temporarily suspended due to not meeting AYP for two consecutive years. Despite a series of competitions held by the ED for State-Flex and Local-Flex authority, there has been very little interest from states and LEAs in obtaining these flexibilities. Seattle has applied for a new Local-Flex agreement, but there has been minimal interest from states and LEAs in obtaining these authorities. Only one LEA has participated in Local-Flex, and no states in State-Flex. Major barriers to participation include additional responsibilities with few clear benefits. A recent study found that major barriers to participation in State-Flex and Local-Flex programs included additional responsibilities with few benefits, limited organizational capacity, and lack of information dissemination. A new round of competition for these authorities began in March 2004, with no set deadline for participation. A new round of competition for State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities started in March 2004 with no set deadline. Participants would receive preference in future grant competitions due to their comprehensive planning to improve teacher quality and student achievement. State-Flex and Local-Flex participants receive preference in grant competitions for their comprehensive planning to improve teacher quality and student achievement. These programs allow for a wide range of fund usage authorized under any ESEA program. State-Flex and Local-Flex programs offer broad flexibility in fund usage under ESEA programs, with a limited number of participants. Despite invitations to compete, interest from SEAs and LEAs has been minimal. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs offer flexibility in fund usage under ESEA programs, with limited participation. Interest from SEAs and LEAs has been minimal despite multiple invitations to compete. The State-Flex authority is limited in scope, requiring states to meet administrative responsibilities and restricting the share of funds for state-level activities. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs provide flexibility in fund usage under ESEA programs, with limited participation. States are responsible for meeting administrative responsibilities, and the share of funds for state-level activities is relatively small. The largest affected program, ESEA Title I-A, has a 1% share for state administration. States have influence over funds consolidated by LEAs with local performance agreements. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs provide flexibility in fund usage under ESEA programs, with limited participation. States have influence over funds consolidated by LEAs with local performance agreements, including the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs offer flexibility in fund usage under ESEA programs, with states having control over funds consolidated by LEAs. The inclusion of the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant in the Local-Flex authority is of limited significance. Comparing the flexibility authorities in the final NCLB provisions with earlier versions of H.R. 1 shows differences in the level of flexibility granted. The final NCLB provisions offer flexibility in fund usage under ESEA programs, with states controlling funds consolidated by LEAs. A comparison with earlier versions of H.R. 1 shows differences in flexibility granted. The Senate's broader state and local flexibility/performance agreement authority was not included in the final legislation. The Senate's broader state and local flexibility/performance agreement authority in H.R. 1 was not included in the final legislation, despite sparking debate. It would have provided more flexibility than the enacted State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities, with increased outcome accountability. However, all these authorities are less extensive than optional performance agreement/grant consolidation. The H.R. 1/Senate flexibility/performance agreement authority offered greater flexibility than State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities, with increased outcome accountability. It was more limited than optional grant consolidation proposals from the 106th Congress. The scope included a maximum of 7 participating states and 25 LEAs in other states, with similar program requirements for consolidated funds. The H.R. 1/Senate flexibility/performance agreement authority provided greater flexibility than State-Flex and Local-Flex, with increased outcome accountability. It involved a maximum of 7 participating states and 25 LEAs in other states, with similar program requirements for consolidated funds. The range of ESEA programs subject to the flexibility authority was broad and included most state-administered formula grant programs authorized by the ESEA. The H.R. 1/Senate flexibility/performance agreement authority provided greater flexibility than State-Flex and Local-Flex, with increased outcome accountability. It involved a maximum of 7 participating states and 25 LEAs in other states, with similar program requirements for consolidated funds. The range of ESEA programs subject to the flexibility authority was broad, including Title I-A grants for Education of the Disadvantaged and Limited English Proficient/Immigrant Education. Participating states could reallocate funds among and within LEAs as long as the resulting allocations targeted funds on concentrations of poor children. State-Flex provides no similar authority. The Senate version of H.R. 1 provided greater flexibility and outcome accountability compared to State-Flex and Local-Flex. Participating states could reallocate funds among LEAs to target concentrations of poor children, but State-Flex did not have this authority. Additionally, states and LEAs were required to exceed AYP goals by a statistically significant amount to show achievement gains beyond state standards. The Senate version of H.R. 1 provided greater flexibility and outcome accountability compared to State-Flex and Local-Flex. States and LEAs were required to exceed AYP goals by a statistically significant amount to show achievement gains beyond state standards. This report concludes with an analysis of selected cross-cutting issues related to the special forms of flexibility described above. The report analyzes special forms of flexibility in education policy, focusing on how states and LEAs can use federal aid funds according to their priorities. These flexibility authorities aim to enhance the utilization of funds beyond federal priorities. States and LEAs have the ability to use federal aid funds according to their own priorities, which may differ from federal priorities. Special flexibility authorities allow for waivers of federal program requirements in exchange for accountability based on pupil achievement, with limitations on participation and program scope. Special flexibility authorities allow states and LEAs to waive federal program requirements in exchange for accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes, with increased attention and consequences related to outcome accountability. These waivers are applicable to Title I-A and other ESEA programs, with the context of substantially increased accountability requirements. The special flexibility authorities, particularly those enacted as part of the NCLB, offer states and LEAs the ability to waive federal program requirements in exchange for accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes. These authorities have been adopted in a policy context of increased accountability requirements and authorized flexibility for ESEA and related federal programs. Transferability is the most utilized flexibility authority, while REAP Flex is widely used by eligible small, rural LEAs. The most widely used flexibility authority among eligible small, rural LEAs is REAP Flex, while other authorities like State-Flex and Local-Flex have limited interest. Flexibility authorities require regular reporting on their usage and impact on pupil achievement, but specific impacts are not well-documented. Common characteristics and cross-cutting issues of special flexibility authorities are discussed. The current flexibility authorities have limited impact on pupil achievement. ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program authority is broad but limited to the school level for schools with low-income pupils. The ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program authority allows for the use of federal funds in schools with above-average low-income pupil rates, but its significance is limited to Title I-A programs. Waiver authorities require individual requests to the U.S. Secretary of Education or state education agencies under Ed-Flex authority. Title I-A is limited, with waiver authorities requiring individual requests to the U.S. Secretary of Education or state education agencies. LEAs must apply for waivers under Ed-Flex authority, with a 50% fund transfer limit. Rural LEA flexibility authority is for low-enrollment LEAs. State-Flex authority has limited funds available. The rural LEA flexibility authority is available to a select group of low-enrollment LEAs, with limited funds subject to State-Flex authority. Local-Flex authority is available in a maximum of 80 LEAs, with a low rate of participation due to limited flexibility. Certain requirements cannot be waived under these authorities. The limited flexibility provided by State-Flex authorities has led to low participation rates. Certain requirements, such as fiscal accountability and ESEA Title I-A standards, cannot be waived. These authorities do not cover Title I-A and do not allow for fund reallocation among LEAs. The flexibility authorities for State-Flex do not cover the largest ESEA program, Title I-A, and do not allow states to reallocate funds among LEAs. A 1999 GAO report found that these authorities do not address the main regulatory burdens of states and LEAs related to IDEA, ADA, child nutrition programs, and environmental requirements. The flexibility authorities enacted do not address the main regulatory burdens of states and LEAs related to IDEA, ADA, child nutrition programs, and environmental requirements. Some SEA staff view Ed-Flex as of limited value, while others see it as encouraging innovation and flexibility. The Ed-Flex program allows for waivers of certain requirements, seen as encouraging innovation and flexibility by some SEA staff. These authorities have been adopted during a period of increased flexibility in federal program requirements. The NCLB has provided increased flexibility for LEAs and schools in using funds, especially in schoolwide programs. This flexibility is seen as relatively marginal compared to the broader flexibility granted under the NCLB for programs related to teachers and educational technology. The NCLB has granted increased flexibility for LEAs and schools in using funds, particularly in schoolwide programs. However, the additional flexibility provided by special authorities seems relatively marginal. Waivers can remove federal regulatory barriers to local educational reform, but there is limited information on their use. Limited information is available on the use of new forms of flexibility authorized under the NCLB. Waivers granted under pre-NCLB authorities have been used for few purposes not clearly related to innovation. ESEA Title IX-D authority has allowed some states to participate in a growth model pilot for determining AYP under ESEA Title I-A. The NCLB eliminated or relaxed restrictions for all states and LEAs. ESEA Title IX-D allowed some states to participate in a growth model pilot for determining AYP under ESEA Title I-A. A recent study found that flexibility authority was mainly used to transfer funds out of ESEA Title II-A and Title IV-A. The two widely used forms of flexibility authority, REAP Flex and Transferability, were mainly utilized to move funds from ESEA Title II-A and Title IV-A into Titles I-A and V-A. This was done to compensate for reductions in formula grants, target resources on underperforming schools, and utilize funds with high flexibility. In the pre-NCLB era, Secretarial waivers, Ed-Flex, and other flexibility authorities were used to compensate for reductions in formula grants under ESEA Title I-A and V-A, target resources on schools failing to meet adequate yearly progress standards, and use funds with flexibility. The Secretarial waivers and Ed-Flex were used to waive requirements for ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program eligibility, targeting of funds on schools with low-income pupils, deadlines for standards and assessments, and limitations on fund use for teacher programs. This provided flexibility in using funds for schoolwide programs. The use of funds under pre-NCLB programs like Class Size Reduction and Eisenhower Professional Development Programs is discussed. There are questions about granting schools with low poverty rates the authority to operate schoolwide programs. Granting schools with low poverty rates the authority to operate schoolwide programs may limit the scope of these programs due to the school's Title I-A grant being based on the number of children from low-income families. There is no systematic evidence that schoolwide programs are more effective than targeted assistance programs in improving the education of disadvantaged pupils. Using waivers to maintain or expand the number of schools participating in Title I-A could be challenging. No systematic evidence supports the superiority of schoolwide programs over targeted assistance programs in improving education for disadvantaged students. Waivers to increase Title I-A school participation may disperse funds to low-poverty schools, reducing support for high-poverty schools. Ed-Flex allows waivers for Title I-A school selection but may undermine program effectiveness. Ed-Flex allows waivers for ESEA Title I-A school selection, potentially undermining accountability requirements. LEAs and states often request waivers for various program requirements, such as teacher hiring and training. Following the enactment of NCLB, programs, LEAs, and states frequently requested waivers of requirements related to teacher hiring, small LEAs forming consortia for CSR grants, minimum shares of teacher training funds for math and science instruction, and limits on CSR funds for professional development. Waivers were requested to accommodate strict limitations on fund use based on local conditions. Following the enactment of NCLB, waivers were frequently requested to accommodate strict limitations on fund use based on local conditions, such as teacher hiring and program eligibility thresholds. The NCLB consolidated programs like CSR and Eisenhower into a more flexible ESEA Title II program supporting teacher development. The NCLB consolidated programs like CSR and Eisenhower into a more flexible ESEA Title II program supporting teacher and principal recruitment and training. Limited waivers have been granted under ESEA Title IX-D post-NCLB era, with little information on the impact of flexibility on pupil achievement. States with Ed-Flex authority must report on waivers granted and their impact. Limited information is available on the impact of special forms of flexibility on pupil achievement. States with Ed-Flex authority have been required to submit annual reports on waivers granted, but the reported information has been of limited value. No reports have been published on the actual purposes or effects of waivers under the Ed-Flex authority enacted in 1999. Anecdotal information on achievement effects of Ed-Flex and Secretarial waivers in a few LEAs was included in a 1999 ED report. The 1999 ED report included anecdotal information on the achievement effects of Ed-Flex and Secretarial waivers in a limited number of LEAs, primarily focusing on whether affected schools met state AYP standards. Supporters of special flexibility authorities argue that these waivers have a broader impact on state and local public education systems, as highlighted in a 1998 ED report on Ed-Flex. Supporters of special flexibility authorities often point to evidence of their impact on state and local public education systems. A 1998 ED report on Ed-Flex concluded that it supports standards-based reform by facilitating program coordination, strengthening planning processes, and streamlining program administration. Ed-Flex allows LEAs and schools to develop instructional programs without standard federal or state program constraints, streamlining administration by reducing paperwork. It supports resources utilization for increased student achievement and narrowing achievement gaps by focusing on outcomes rather than procedures. Limited data shows improved pupil achievement outcomes in states, LEAs, or schools. The Ed-Flex program aims to improve student achievement and reduce achievement gaps by focusing on outcomes rather than procedures. However, there is limited data showing the effectiveness of special flexibility authorities in achieving these goals, raising questions about the program's impact and benefits. The Ed-Flex program aims to improve student achievement by focusing on outcomes rather than procedures. However, there is limited data on the effectiveness of special flexibility authorities, raising questions about their impact. Will sufficient information be available to analyze their benefits and impact? Little relevant information has been disseminated by ED on the use of waivers and other special authorities. The Education Department has not provided enough information on the effectiveness of special flexibility authorities, making it difficult to evaluate their significance and impact on student achievement. This lack of data raises questions about whether outcomes-based approaches are a sufficient substitute for other forms of accountability requirements. The Education Department's lack of data on the effectiveness of special flexibility authorities raises questions about whether outcome-based approaches can adequately replace other forms of accountability requirements. The special flexibility authorities in this report are linked to state and LEA goals, AYP requirements, and various programs like Ed-Flex. Evidence from a GAO study supports the effectiveness of states granted Ed-Flex authority. The GAO study found that states granted Ed-Flex authority differed in the clarity and specificity of their outcome goals. Five of the original 12 Ed-Flex states had set no specific objectives for LEAs or schools granted waivers, with only one state establishing outcome objectives specifically linked to the affected entities. The GAO study found that states granted Ed-Flex authority had varying levels of clarity and specificity in their outcome goals. Limited ED oversight was noted, with states providing annual reports of varying detail. The most significant outcome accountability requirement was meeting AYP requirements. The GAO study found that states granted Ed-Flex authority had varying levels of clarity and specificity in their outcome goals, with limited ED oversight. The most significant outcome accountability requirement was meeting AYP requirements, with no substantial additional outcome accountability for participating LEAs and states beyond that which is applicable to all other Title I-A and ESEA programs. States with special flexibility authority under Ed-Flex focus on meeting AYP requirements, with increased consequences for failing to do so. This requirement is not additional but significant compared to other states and LEAs. States with special flexibility authority under Ed-Flex must meet AYP requirements with increased consequences for non-compliance. This accountability enhancement aligns with the nature of their flexibility authority. The report discusses the limited enhancement of outcome accountability requirements in the context of special flexibility authorities granted to states under NCLB. The provisions aim to increase accountability while providing additional flexibility in the use of federal aid funds. Some proponents argue that increasing state and local flexibility in using federal education aid funds does not require additional outcome or accountability requirements. They believe that allowing states and LEAs to use funds as they see fit is sufficient justification for such policies. Increasing state and local flexibility in using federal education aid funds is seen as sufficient justification by proponents, who believe it can lead to improved pupil outcomes. Critics argue that granting special forms of flexibility without additional accountability requirements is unjustified. Critics argue that special flexibility authorities lack accountability provisions and are used for unproven purposes, unlike generally applicable requirements seen as national priorities."
