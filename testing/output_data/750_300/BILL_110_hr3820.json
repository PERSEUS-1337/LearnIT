    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Motor Vehicle Advanced Safety Technology Tax Act of 2007\". Congress finds that commercial motor vehicle crashes are a major concern in the United States, especially with the increasing number of trucks and their role in transporting hazardous materials. A 2004 report shows that large truck crashes are 2.6 times more likely to result in fatalities compared to passenger cars. The number of fatalities from these crashes is a significant portion of all crash fatalities. In 2005, 5,212 individuals died and 114,000 were injured in large truck-related crashes in the United States, with a total of 25,533 fatalities from 2001 to 2005. These crashes also have a significant economic cost on society. From 2001 to 2005, there were 25,533 large truck-related fatalities in the United States, costing society $230.6 billion annually. The average cost of a crash involving a truck over 10,000 pounds is $91,112, with a fatal crash costing $3,604,518. The estimated cost of a crash involving a truck over 10,000 pounds is $91,112, with a fatal crash costing $3,604,518. Investments in advanced safety technologies by vehicle suppliers and manufacturers aim to mitigate commercial vehicle crash scenarios. The Department of Transportation has set goals in this regard. Advanced safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles aim to reduce crash scenarios and mitigate their effects. The Department of Transportation has a goal to decrease the traffic fatality rate by 2011. Accelerated production and deployment of these technologies can help achieve this goal, reducing injuries and fatalities on the roads and highways, ultimately lowering the societal cost of crashes. Congress aims to increase the deployment of advanced vehicle safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles through tax incentives to reduce injuries and fatalities on the roads and highways, ultimately lowering societal costs. The IRS Code is amended to include a new section providing a tax credit for advanced commercial vehicle safety systems. This aims to promote the use of advanced safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles to reduce road injuries and fatalities. The IRS Code now offers a tax credit for commercial vehicle advanced safety systems, equal to 50% of the system's cost, not exceeding $1,500 per system or $3,500 per vehicle. The tax credit for commercial vehicle advanced safety systems is limited to $1,500 per system, $3,500 per vehicle, and $350,000 per taxpayer in a taxable year. The tax credit for commercial vehicle advanced safety systems is limited to $350,000 per taxpayer in a taxable year. A qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety system includes brake stroke monitoring, lane departure warning, collision warning, and vehicle stability systems. The tax credit for commercial vehicle advanced safety systems is limited to $350,000 per taxpayer in a taxable year. A qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety system includes brake stroke monitoring, lane departure warning, collision warning, and vehicle stability systems that significantly enhance safety or security. The system must be certified by the manufacturer. The qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety system must be certified by the manufacturer to be appropriate for the specific vehicle and function as designed when installed properly. The qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety system must be certified by the manufacturer or authorized installer to be appropriate for the specific vehicle and function as designed when installed properly. If not installed by the manufacturer or authorized installer, the system must be certified by the installer to be properly installed and functioning before the vehicle is used for its intended purpose. The qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety system must be certified by the installer to be properly installed and functioning on the vehicle before first use by the taxpayer for its intended purpose. Original use of the system must begin with the taxpayer, and depreciation or amortization is allowable. The term 'qualified commercial vehicle' refers to any highway motor vehicle used for commerce with a weight rating of 26,001 pounds or more or a seating capacity of at least 15 individuals. Depreciation is allowed for the advanced safety system installed on such vehicles. The term 'qualified commercial vehicle' includes vehicles with a weight rating of 26,001 pounds or more, a seating capacity of at least 15 individuals, or used as a school bus or intercity/local bus. The term 'brake stroke monitoring system' refers to an onboard system for air-braked vehicles that uses electronic sensors to detect brake issues and alerts the driver. The curr_chunk discusses the definitions of different safety systems for vehicles, including a brake monitoring system, lane departure warning system, and collision warning system. The brake monitoring system uses electronic sensors to detect brake issues and alert the driver, while the lane departure warning system alerts the driver of unintended lane movements, and the collision warning system warns of potential collisions. The curr_chunk defines safety systems for vehicles, including collision warning and vehicle stability systems that provide alerts for potential collisions and rollovers. The curr_chunk explains the definition of a vehicle stability system as an active safety system that intervenes in high-risk situations by automatically adjusting vehicle speed or applying brakes. The curr_chunk discusses the treatment of controlled groups as a single taxpayer for tax purposes, including special rules like basis reduction for property. In applying section 52 to this section, section 1563 shall be applied without regard to subsection (b)(2)(C). Special rules include basis reduction for property eligible for a credit under subsection (a) and recapture of the credit if the property ceases to be eligible. Property used outside the United States is not qualified for the credit. The credit under subsection (a) can be recaptured if the property is no longer eligible. Property used outside the United States or by a tax-exempt entity is not qualified for the credit. The credit under subsection (a) can be recaptured if the property is no longer eligible. Property used by a tax-exempt entity for a qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety system must be clearly disclosed by the seller to the buyer for proper tax treatment. The taxpayer must disclose the amount of any credit allowable for qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety systems. No credit will be allowed if the taxpayer elects not to take the credit. The taxpayer must provide supporting documentation as required by the Secretary to claim a credit for qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety systems. If the taxpayer chooses not to take the credit, no credit will be allowed. The taxpayer must provide documentation as required by the Secretary for the purchase of qualified advanced commercial vehicle advanced safety systems, including system type and purchase/installation dates. The taxpayer must provide documentation for the purchase of qualified advanced commercial vehicle advanced safety systems, including system type, purchase/installation dates, and required certifications. This section does not apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2012. The taxpayer must provide documentation for the purchase of qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety systems, including system type, purchase/installation dates, and required certifications. This section does not apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2012. The commercial vehicle advanced safety system credit is part of the general business credit under section 38 of the Code. The text introduces new paragraphs (32) and (38) related to the commercial vehicle advanced safety system credit under section 45O(a) of the Code. Additionally, there are conforming amendments to sections 1016(a) and 6501(m) of the Code. The new paragraph (38) is added at the end, referencing section 45O(g)(1). Subsection (m) of section 6501 is amended to include reference to 45O(g)(5). The table of sections is updated with a new item after section 45N. The amendments made by section 45O apply to property placed in service after the enactment of this Act."
