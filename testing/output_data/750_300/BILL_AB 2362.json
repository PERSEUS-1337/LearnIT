    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Existing law requires landlords to provide written notification to tenants before applying pesticides in certain ways without a licensed pest control operator. The bill aims to ensure that owners and tenants in common interest developments are notified in writing before pesticides are applied by the homeowner association or its agents, similar to the notification required when pesticides are applied by a licensed pest control operator. Section 4777 of the Civil Code defines terms related to pesticide application in common interest developments, including \"adjacent separate interest,\" \"authorized agent,\" \"broadcast application,\" and \"electronic delivery.\" (3) \"Broadcast application\" is spreading pesticide over an area larger than two square feet.\n(4) \"Electronic delivery\" is sending a document electronically to an authorized electronic address.\n(5) A \"licensed pest control operator\" is someone licensed by the state to apply pesticides.\n(6) A \"pest\" is a living organism that causes property damage, economic loss, or transmits diseases. (7) A \"pesticide\" is any substance intended for controlling pests, excluding certain types defined by federal law. An association applying pesticide without a licensed operator must provide written notice to affected owners and tenants, including information on pests to be controlled and the pesticide product to be used. The curr_chunk requires information on the pest to be controlled and the pesticide product to be used, as mandated by state law. CAUTION \u2013 Pesticides are toxic chemicals. Proper use conditions must be followed for certain pesticides, as the risks may be outweighed by benefits. Minimize exposure to reduce risk. If experiencing symptoms similar to flu within 24 hours of pesticide application, contact a healthcare provider or Poison Control. If experiencing flu-like symptoms within 24 hours of pesticide exposure, contact a physician or Poison Control (1-800-222-1222). For more information, contact the County Health Department for health questions or the Department of Pesticide Regulation for regulatory information (916-324-4100). The association must provide notice at least 48 hours before applying pesticide, including the date, time, and frequency of application. The notification should state that these details are subject to change. Individual notice must be given to owners and tenants of the separate interest and adjacent units that need to be informed. At least 48 hours before pesticide application in a common area, the association must post written notice if possible. If not feasible, individual notice must be given to adjacent owners and tenants. Notice to tenants of separate interests must be provided through first-class mail, personal delivery to a tenant 18 years or older, or electronic delivery if an electronic mailing address is available. If the pest poses an immediate threat to health and safety, the association must post written notice within one hour after pesticide application. Notice to tenants of separate interests must be provided through first-class mail, personal delivery to a tenant 18 years or older, or electronic delivery if an electronic mailing address is available. Upon receipt of written notification, the owner or tenant may agree to allow pesticide application immediately or at an agreed upon time. Prior to receiving written notification, the association or authorized agent can orally agree to immediate pesticide application if requested by the owner or tenant. The written notice must be left in a visible place before the pesticide application. The association or authorized agent can orally agree to immediate pesticide application if requested by the owner or tenant. A written notice must be provided to all relevant parties before the pesticide application, and a copy of this notice should be attached to the board meeting minutes following the application."
