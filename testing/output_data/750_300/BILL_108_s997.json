Congress finds that the Middle Rio Grande bosque in Albuquerque, New Mexico is the largest continuous cottonwood forest in the Southwest, an old inhabited area, home to 6 pueblos, and a critical habitat for migratory birds. The adjacent portion of the Middle Rio Grande provides water to many people in New Mexico. The Middle Rio Grande bosque in Albuquerque, New Mexico is crucial for migratory birds and provides water to many people in the state. It should be maintained to protect endangered species, ensure the flow of the river, and enhance public accessibility. Environmental restoration is a key focus for the Corps of Engineers, which should work towards reestablishing important habitats. The Corps of Engineers aims to enhance public access to the Middle Rio Grande bosque and prioritize environmental restoration to support native vegetation growth. They should also work on reestablishing hydrologic connections between the river and the bosque for long-term health. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(1) Critical restoration project: Immediate and substantial ecosystem restoration, preservation, recreation, and protection benefits.\n(2) Middle Rio Grande: Portion of the Rio Grande from Cochiti Dam to Elephant Butte Dam in New Mexico.\n(3) Secretary: Secretary of the Army.\n\nSEC. 3. MIDDLE RIO GRANDE RESTORATION. The Secretary will conduct critical restoration projects along the Middle Rio Grande, selecting projects based on feasibility studies and utilizing existing studies and plans. Local participation is required in carrying out the Act. The Secretary will consult with public and private entities active in ecosystem restoration in the Rio Grande watershed, including those involved in the Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Act Collaborative Program and the Bosque Improvement Group of the Middle Rio Grande Bosque Initiative. Cost-sharing agreements will be established before project implementation. Before critical restoration projects are carried out under the Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Act Collaborative Program and the Bosque Improvement Group of the Middle Rio Grande Bosque Initiative, the Secretary will enter into cost-sharing agreements with non-Federal interests. These agreements will require non-Federal interests to pay 25% of the total project costs and provide necessary land, easements, rights-of-way, relocations, and dredged material disposal areas. Non-Federal interests are required to pay 25% of total project costs and provide necessary land, easements, rights-of-way, relocations, and dredged material disposal areas for critical restoration projects. They must also cover 100% of operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, and rehabilitation costs incurred after the enactment of the Act and hold the United States harmless from any liabilities. Non-Federal interests must cover costs for critical restoration projects, including operation and maintenance expenses, and hold the United States harmless from any liabilities. Recreational features are also included in these projects. Non-Federal interests are responsible for covering costs for critical restoration projects, including operation and maintenance expenses, and liabilities. Recreational features in these projects should not exceed 30% of the total project cost, with non-Federal interests covering any additional costs. Non-Federal interests are responsible for covering costs for critical restoration projects, including operation and maintenance expenses, and liabilities. Any excess costs beyond the specified amount must be paid by the non-Federal interests. They can receive credit towards their share of design or construction costs if the work they perform is deemed integral to the project by the Secretary. Authorization of appropriations for this Act includes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2005 through 2013."
