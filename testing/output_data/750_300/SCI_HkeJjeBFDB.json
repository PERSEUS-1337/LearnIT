To deploy compact models effectively, reducing performance gap and enhancing robustness to perturbations is crucial. Noise plays a significant role in improving neural networks training by addressing the goals of generalization and robustness. Noise can improve neural networks training by enhancing generalization and robustness. Introducing variability through noise at input or supervision levels can lead to significant improvements in model performance. Techniques like \"Fickle Teacher\" and \"Soft Randomization\" demonstrate how noise can enhance generalization and robustness in models. Adding Gaussian noise to the student model's output from the teacher on the original image enhances adversarial robustness significantly. Random label corruption also surprisingly improves model robustness. This study emphasizes the benefits of incorporating constructive noise in knowledge distillation and encourages further research in this area. The design of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for real-world deployment requires consideration of memory, computational requirements, performance, reliability, and security, especially in resource-constrained devices or applications. The design of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for efficient real-world deployment involves considerations such as memory and computational requirements, performance, reliability, and security. Compact models are necessary for resource-constrained devices like self-driving cars with strict latency requirements. It is crucial to evaluate model performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data to ensure reliability under distribution shift. In real-world deployment, it is crucial to consider the changing environment and evaluate model performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Models need to be robust against malicious attacks and techniques like model quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation are used to achieve high performance in compressed models. Knowledge distillation involves training a smaller network under the supervision of a larger one, resembling human learning. Knowledge distillation is an interactive learning method where a smaller network (student) is trained under the supervision of a larger pre-trained network (teacher). Mimicking the softened softmax output of the teacher model improves the student model's performance, but there is still a performance gap between them. The performance gap between the student model and the teacher model remains despite the improvements achieved through knowledge distillation. Capturing knowledge from the larger network and transferring it to a smaller model effectively is still an open question. It is crucial to enhance the robustness of the student model to various perturbations for real-world deployment. Incorporating methods into knowledge distillation to improve student model robustness is crucial. Inspiration is drawn from neuroscience on how humans learn, emphasizing neuroplasticity and collaborative learning. Neuroplasticity is essential for learning, as connections between neurons constantly change. Learning for children often involves collaboration and interaction with the environment. Cognitive biases and trial-to-trial response variation play a significant role in human decision-making, leading to sub-optimal outcomes. Introducing constructive noise in the student-teacher collaborative learning framework can act as a deterrent to cognitive biases and trial-to-trial response variation in human decision-making. Introducing noise in the student-teacher collaborative learning framework can help deter cognitive bias and improve learning by mimicking trial-to-trial response variation in humans. This can lead to more accurate and robust models in knowledge distillation.

The study presents a case for the beneficial effects of noise in knowledge distillation, analyzing its impact on model generalization and robustness. It explores different noise types to enhance the student model's generalization and robustness, aiming to transfer the teacher model's uncertainty to the student. The study introduces novel approaches for incorporating noise in the teacher-student collaborative learning framework to improve generalization and robustness of the student model. Two methods, \"Fickle Teacher\" and \"Soft Randomization\", utilize Dropout and Gaussian noise, respectively, to enhance knowledge distillation and adversarial robustness while limiting the drop in generalization. The method \"Soft Randomization\" introduces Gaussian noise in knowledge distillation to improve student model's adversarial robustness significantly while limiting generalization drop. Random label corruption is shown to enhance adversarial robustness with minimal impact on generalization, acting as a deterrent to cognitive bias. Noise has long been used as a regularization technique to improve generalization in various experimental and computational studies. Many methods use noise as a regularization technique to improve generalization in deep neural networks. Techniques like Dropout and injecting noise to the gradient have been shown to be crucial for non-convex optimization. Noise helps in reducing overfitting and improving the performance of the system. Many studies have shown that noise techniques like Dropout and injecting noise to the gradient are crucial for non-convex optimization. Randomization techniques that inject noise during training and inference have been effective against adversarial attacks. Randomized smoothing transforms classifiers into smooth classifiers with certifiable l2-norm robustness guarantees. Label smoothing and randomized smoothing techniques have been effective against adversarial attacks. Label smoothing improves deep neural network performance, but it may impair knowledge distillation. Adding constructive noise to the knowledge distillation framework could lead to lightweight, well-generalizing models. The study by et al. (2019) found that label smoothing can hinder knowledge distillation. Adding constructive noise to the knowledge distillation framework may lead to lightweight, well-generalizing models with improved robustness. The researchers used CIFAR-10 for their empirical analysis due to its prevalence in knowledge distillation and robustness literature. They employed the Hinton method to train the student model. The researchers conducted experiments on Wide Residual Networks (WRN) using the Hinton method for knowledge distillation, with \u03b1 = 0.9 and \u03c4 = 4. Images were normalized between 0 and 1, following a standard training scheme. The experiments were conducted on Wide Residual Networks (WRN) with image normalization between 0 and 1. ImageNet images from the CINIC dataset were used for out-of-distribution generalization evaluation. Adversarial robustness was tested using Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack. The models were also tested for robustness against common corruptions. In the robustness evaluation, the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack was used to test the worst robustness accuracy for 5 random initialization runs. The models were also tested for robustness against common corruptions and perturbations. In the student-teacher learning framework, signal-dependent noise was added to the output logits of the teacher model to analyze its effect on generalization and robustness. In the student-teacher learning framework, signal-dependent noise is added to the output logits of the teacher model to analyze its effect on generalization and robustness. Different types of noise are injected and their impact on model performance is studied. Random signal-dependent noise improves generalization to CIFAR-10 test set while marginally reducing out-of-distribution generalization to CINIC-ImageNet. Our method introduces signal-dependent noise to the teacher model's output logits, improving generalization to CIFAR-10 test set while slightly reducing out-of-distribution generalization to CINIC-ImageNet. Additionally, our approach enhances adversarial and natural robustness of the models compared to previous methods.

Inspired by brain variability, we use dropout in the teacher model to add variability in the supervision signal. This approach improves the distillation process effectiveness, especially with lower levels of noise. Using dropout in the teacher model adds variability to the supervision signal during knowledge distillation to the student model, improving the effectiveness of the process. This method differs from previous approaches that utilized dropout for uncertainty estimates or knowledge distillation for calibration. The proposed method utilizes dropout for uncertainty encoding in distilling knowledge to a student model, different from previous approaches. It involves using the teacher model's logits with activated dropout to train the student for more epochs, capturing the teacher's uncertainty directly. This approach aims to help the student generalize better. Training the student model with dropout using the proposed method significantly improves generalization and robustness, as shown in Figure 12a. The approach involves utilizing the teacher model's logits with activated dropout to capture uncertainty and train the student for more epochs. This helps the student generalize better on unseen and out-of-distribution data, as well as improve generalization to PGD attacks. The performance of the teacher model drops with higher dropout rates, and the comparison is done for dropout rates in the range [0 - 0.5]. Refer to the appendex for training parameters. The proposed method significantly improves generalization and robustness of the student model with dropout. Training parameters can be found in the appendex. Even when the teacher model's performance decreases after a dropout rate of 0.2, the student model's performance continues to improve up to a dropout rate of 0.4. Both PGD Robustness and natural robustness increase for dropout rates up to 0.2, indicating that adding trial-to-trial variability is beneficial. The student model's performance improves up to a dropout rate of 0.4, despite the teacher model's decrease after 0.2. Adding trial-to-trial variability benefits PGD Robustness and natural robustness. Noise injection from the exponential family enhances adversarial robustness but hinders generalization. Adding Gaussian noise to the input image while distilling knowledge to the student model can enhance adversarial robustness without sacrificing generalization. By using a teacher model trained on clean images to train the student model with random Gaussian noise, the method aims to retain adversarial robustness gain observed with randomized training and mitigate generalization loss. The loss function in the knowledge distillation framework is minimized, incorporating soften logits and balancing factors. Training with six Gaussian noise levels results in increased adversarial robustness and decreased generalization loss. Our proposed method, utilizing temperature parameters and balancing factors from the Hinton method, enhances adversarial robustness and reduces generalization loss. Compared to training with Gaussian noise alone, our method achieves superior performance in both generalization and robustness. It significantly improves adversarial robustness even at lower noise intensity levels, outperforming the student model trained alone. Additionally, our method enhances robustness to common corruptions. Our method enhances adversarial robustness and improves robustness to common corruptions, as shown in Figures 3, 4, and 5. It achieves 33.85% compared to 3.53% for the student model trained alone at \u03c3 = 0.05 noise intensity. The robustness to noise and blurring corruptions increases with Gaussian noise intensity, except for fog and frost in weather corruptions. Digital corruption robustness improves, except for contrast and saturation. The effect varies at different intensities, with frost showing increased robustness at lower noise levels before decreasing.

This approach aims to improve adversarial robustness and resilience to common corruptions by encouraging the model to not be overconfident in its predictions. The study explores the impact of random label noise on improving model generalization by introducing constructive noise to reduce memorization in deep neural networks. Various types of noise are considered, such as Gaussian noise, impulse noise, and blur, to enhance the model's tolerance to noisy labels. The study investigates the effects of random label corruption on model generalization by introducing noise like blur, motion blur, zoom blur, brightness, fog, frost, snow, and saturation. Different levels of corruption are tested on teacher and student models, showing improved generalization even with high corruption levels during knowledge distillation to the student. The study found that both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization increases for high levels of label corruption. Knowledge distillation outperforms the teacher model, and random label corruption significantly boosts adversarial robustness. Training with 5% random labels increased robustness from 0% to 10.89%, with similar results for different levels of corruption. The study found that random label corruption significantly boosts adversarial robustness, with a 5% increase leading to a PGD-20 robustness of 10.89%. The increase in robustness is observed for different levels of corruption up to 40%, with a slight decrease at 50%. Introducing variability in the knowledge distillation framework through noise at various levels shows promising results and warrants further study.

Hinton et al. proposed using a final softmax function with a raised temperature and smooth logits of the teacher model as soft targets for the student model, minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between output probabilities. Knowledge distillation involves minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between output probabilities of teacher and student models using hyperparameters like temperature and balancing ratio. Domain shift can impact model generalization in real-world scenarios. In real-world scenarios, domain shift can affect model generalization. To evaluate out-of-distribution performance, ImageNet images from the CINIC dataset were used. This dataset contains 2100 images randomly selected for each CIFAR-10 category.

Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing a threat to their deployment in real-world scenarios. Deep Neural Networks are highly vulnerable to imperceptible perturbations that can fool them, posing a threat to their real-world deployment. Research has focused on evaluating and defending against these adversarial attacks. In order to assess the robustness of models against adversarial attacks, the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack is utilized. This attack initializes an adversarial image by adding random noise within an epsilon bound to the original image. The model then adjusts the image in the direction of loss with a specified step size, clipping it within the epsilon bound and valid image range.

It adjusts the image in the direction of loss with a specified step size, clipping it within the epsilon bound and valid image range. Adversarial robustness is crucial for security, representing a worst-case distribution shift that models need to withstand. Recent works have shown that Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to real-world perturbations, not just adversarial attacks. Hendrycks et al. (2019) curated a set of naturally occurring examples that significantly degrade classifier accuracy. Gu et al. (2019) also measured model's robustness to these perturbations. In their study, Gu et al. (2019) found that state-of-the-art classifiers are brittle to minute transformations in video frames, which they refer to as natural robustness. They also discovered that robustness to synthetic color distortions can serve as a proxy for natural robustness. In our study, we use robustness to common corruptions and perturbations in CIFAR-C as a proxy for natural robustness. It is important to balance generalization and adversarial robustness in models, ensuring they perform well in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Recent research has shown the negative impact of overemphasizing robustness to norm bounded perturbations. Recent studies have highlighted the negative impact of adversarially trained models on natural robustness. Adversarial training improves robustness to mid and high frequency perturbations but at the expense of low frequency perturbations. Recent studies have shown a trade-off between adversarial robustness and generalization in models, but this may not apply to overall model robustness. Recent studies have highlighted a trade-off between adversarial robustness and generalization in models, but this may not necessarily apply to the overall model's robustness. To address this, a method involving random swapping of softmax logits based on the uncertainty of the teacher model is proposed. Two variants of random swapping are suggested: Swap Top 2 and Swap All, which swap logits if their difference is below a certain threshold. Training the student model with dropout requires more epochs due to variability in the teacher model, improving in-distribution generalization but impacting out-of-distribution generalization. It does not significantly affect robustness. Training the student model with dropout requires more epochs for convergence and capturing the teacher model's uncertainty. Different dropout rates require varying numbers of epochs and learning rate reductions.
