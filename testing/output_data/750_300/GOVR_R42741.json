    "content": "The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program offers private health insurance to federal employees, retirees, and their dependents, providing over $40 billion in benefits annually. Participation is voluntary, with about 85% of employees and 90% of retirees enrolled. Coverage options include individual, family, and self plus one plans starting in 2016. Coverage options for eligible individuals in the FEHB Program include individual, family, and self plus one plans. Plans are either fee-for-service (FFS) or health maintenance organizations (HMOs), with premiums shared between the federal government and the employee or retiree. All plans cover basic services like hospital and physician care, with varying benefits and cost-sharing requirements. Prior to the creation of FEHB in 1959, federal employees could not obtain health insurance through the federal government. Instead, they had to purchase coverage voluntarily or through union and employee association plans. In 1950, private sector employers started offering health insurance to their employees, with some covering a portion of the premiums. President Truman's Commission recommended federal government health insurance in 1951. Congress passed the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) to provide health insurance for federal employees. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established parameters for health insurance coverage for federal employees, including eligibility, types of plans, and government's share of premiums. It also created an Employees Health Benefits Fund and outlined the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established an Employees Health Benefits Fund to pay for program expenses and outlined the role of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM has the authority to contract with insurers and manage FEHB. The general model of FEHB allows enrollees to choose coverage from competing private insurers, with employees and retirees sharing the cost of premiums with the federal government. Many amendments have been made to FEHBA since its passage. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established the Employees Health Benefits Fund and outlined OPM's role in managing FEHB. Enrollees can choose coverage from private insurers, with costs shared between employees, retirees, and the government. While some aspects of FEHB have remained consistent, changes have been made to the government's share of premiums, eligibility, services, and benefits. Congress plays a role in modifying FEHB through proposing changes or reacting to them. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) established the Employees Health Benefits Fund and outlined OPM's role in managing FEHB. Enrollees can choose coverage from private insurers, with costs shared between employees, retirees, and the government. Changes have been made to the government's share of premiums, eligibility, services, and benefits, with Congress playing a role in modifying FEHB. Policymakers and researchers have been interested in FEHB as a model for health insurance programs and expanding coverage. The FEHB model consists of competing insurers providing coverage to enrollees with minimal intervention from OPM. The FEHB model, established in 1959, allows enrollees to choose coverage from private insurers with costs shared between employees, retirees, and the government. It is viewed as successful in giving enrollees cost-conscious choices and constraining overall cost growth. Researchers have explored exporting aspects of the FEHB model to other health care programs like Medicare, expanding access to FEHB, or creating new programs modeled after FEHB to provide coverage to individuals not federal workers or retirees. Some policymakers and researchers have considered exporting aspects of the successful FEHB model to other health care programs like Medicare. They have also explored expanding access to FEHB or creating new programs modeled after FEHB to provide coverage to individuals outside of federal workers or retirees, such as small business employees or the uninsured. Legislation has been introduced to create new programs or expand FEHB eligibility. Additionally, it has been suggested that certain features of FEHB could serve as a good model for state-level health insurance exchanges, and lessons learned from FEHB may be instructive for establishing these exchanges at the state and federal levels. Some have suggested that features of FEHB could be a model for state health insurance exchanges. Congressional interest in FEHB extends beyond its applicability as a model, as policymakers have a responsibility for its viability and sustainability. Congress has a financial interest in the program. The report provides information on how Congress has interacted with the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program in the past, including discussions on certain changes to the program and how Congress has the authority to restructure FEHB for its viability and sustainability. The report discusses how Congress has influenced the evolution of the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program by conditioning federal funds on policy changes, adjusting the government's share of FEHB premiums, modifying program eligibility, and implementing policies affecting the relationship between Medicare and FEHB. The report also includes a summary of the enacting FEHB legislation and a list of laws that have amended the program. The report discusses how Congress has influenced the evolution of the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program by conditioning federal funds on policy changes, adjusting the government's share of FEHB premiums, modifying program eligibility, and implementing policies affecting the relationship between Medicare and FEHB. Congress can place conditions on the use of federal funds, and it has done so to make changes to FEHB, such as prohibiting the use of appropriated federal funds to cover abortions except in cases where the life of the woman is in danger. The 103rd Congress passed a law prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortions, except in cases of danger to the woman's life, rape, or incest. This provision has been included in subsequent appropriations bills each year. The government's share of FEHB premiums has increased over the years. The government's share of FEHB premiums has increased over the years, with laws enacting policy changes to place conditions on the use of federal funds. Initially set at 50%, the government's share was later adjusted to 40% of the simple average of the big six premiums, eventually increasing to 50% in 1974. The government's share of FEHB premiums was initially set at 40% of the simple average of the big six premiums, increasing to 50% in 1974. The formula remained unchanged until 1997 when the Balanced Budget Act introduced the current formula where the government contributes 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans, not exceeding 75% of any one plan's premium. The government contributes 72% of the weighted average premium of all plans for FEHB, not exceeding 75% of any one plan's premium. Eligibility includes federal employees, retirees, and their family members. Since its enactment, eligibility for enrollment in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA) has been extended to more categories of federal employees, retirees, and their family members. In 1978, part-time employees were included, and in 1988, certain temporary workers were also covered. Additionally, in 1988, Congress authorized temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) for employees separated from service for reasons other than gross misconduct, allowing them to continue coverage in FEHB by paying the entire premium. In 1988, Congress authorized temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) in FEHB for separating employees and their dependents for up to 18 months, with exceptions for children aging out of their parents' plans. TCC enrollees must pay the entire FEHB premium and a 2% administrative fee. FEHB was established five years before Medicare, with little interaction initially. In 1982, Congress passed a law enabling federal workers to be eligible for Medicare based on their federal employment. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (P.L. 86-382) established the FEHB program for the federal workforce, outlining eligibility, benefits, and premium sharing. In 1982, the Responsibility Act (P.L. 97-248) extended Medicare eligibility to federal workers based on their federal employment. The FEHB program was established by P.L. 86-382 on July 1, 1960, for federal employees, outlining eligibility, benefits, premium sharing, and OPM's role. Eligible participants included current federal employees and retirees who retired after July 1, 1960, with specific enrollment requirements. Retirees who retired after July 1, 1960, with at least 12 years of service or for a disability were eligible for the FEHB program. They needed to be enrolled in an FEHB plan for at least five years prior to retirement. Family members of employees and retirees were also eligible. OPM could approve different types of health benefit plans to participate in FEHB. The FEHB program offers three types of health benefit plans: Service Benefit Plan, Indemnity Benefit Plan, and Employee Organization Plans. These plans provide different levels of benefits and are available to employees, retirees, and their families. Employee organization plans under the FEHB program are sponsored by employee organizations and available to employees, retirees, and their families. These plans include group-practice and individual-practice prepayment plans for comprehensive medical coverage. Under P.L. 86-382, the government's share of premiums in FEHB plans was 50% of the lowest rate charged by a carrier for service benefit and indemnity plans. The biweekly government share for individual coverage ranged from $1.25 to $1.75, and for family coverage, it was not less than $1.25 and not more than $1.75. Under P.L. 86-382, the government's share of premiums in FEHB plans was 50% of the lowest carrier rate. The biweekly government share for individual coverage was $1.25 to $1.75, and for family coverage, it was $3.00 to $4.25. For female employees with family coverage, the share was $1.75 to $2.50. Employees in other plans had a 50% share if the premium was under $2.50. The Postal Employees Salary Increase Act of 1960 (P.L. 86-568) authorized FEHB coverage for employees of county committees under the Soil Conservation. The government's share of biweekly premiums in FEHB plans ranged from $1.75 to $2.50, with a 50% share for employees and retirees in certain plans. For female employees with family coverage, the government's share was 30% if the premium was less than $6.00. The government's share in FEHB plans was 30% of the premium if it was less than $6.00.

P.L. 88-59 extended the deadline for applications from qualified employee organizations to participate in FEHB from December 31, 1959, to December 31, 1963, and removed the requirement for organizations to have offered health care benefits prior to applying. Prior to the passage of P.L. 88-284 in March 17, 1964, employee organizations had to provide health care benefits by July 1, 1959, to offer coverage under FEHB. The act expanded FEHB coverage to include employees with work-related injuries, foster children, and unmarried children up to age 21. It also allowed employees to maintain their FEHB coverage in retirement if enrolled by December 31, 1964.

The government's share of the big six average premiums in the FEHB plan was increased to 60% in 1975, with a maximum cap of 75% of the total premium amount for any one health plan. Health insurance plans participating in FEHB had to comply with OPM's decisions in disputes over health benefits entitlement. P.L. 93-363 allowed access to licensed clinical psychologists and optometrists without prior referral in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. P.L. 93-363, enacted on July 30, 1974, granted Federal Employee Health Benefits Program enrollees direct access to licensed clinical psychologists and optometrists without the need for a referral. Enrollees were entitled to payment or reimbursement for services rendered.

The amendments in P.L. 94-342, enacted on July 6, 1976, restored eligibility for health benefits coverage to certain individuals whose survivor annuities were restored. This allowed surviving spouses covered by FEHB to reenroll in the health benefits plan if their annuity was terminated due to remarriage and later restored. The P.L. 95-368 act established uniformity in benefits and coverage under FEHB by preempting certain state and local laws inconsistent with FEHB contracts. It provided protections to medically underserved populations. Surviving spouses whose annuity was terminated due to remarriage and later restored can reenroll in FEHB. The P.L. 95-368 act established uniformity in benefits and coverage under FEHB by preempting certain state and local laws inconsistent with FEHB contracts. It provided protections to medically underserved populations and allowed insurance carriers to pay for health services for members of these populations. Additionally, the act changed the requirement for employee organizations appealing to sponsor a health benefit plan. The Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-437) allowed part-time career employees and their dependents to access FEHB coverage, defining part-time career employment as a 16-32 hour work week.

The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-360) included provisions affecting FEHB, later repealed by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Repeal Act of 1989 (P.L. 101-234). It would have required OPM to reduce rates for retirees in FEHB who were Medicare eligible. The Coverage Repeal Act of 1989 (P.L. 101-234) would have required OPM to reduce rates for retirees in FEHB who were Medicare eligible and submit a report to Congress on changes to FEHB for Medicare-eligible individuals. The Federal Employees Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-654) required OPM to submit reports to Congress on incorporating health benefit plans for Medicare-eligible individuals and adopting NAIC standards for Medicare supplemental health benefit plans under FEHB.

The act allowed OPM to levy fines on providers for false charges and created temporary continuation of FEHB coverage (TCC) for separating employees and their families, requiring them to pay the full premium for up to 18 months after separation. The Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) allows separating federal employees and their families to maintain FEHB coverage for up to 18 months after separation by paying the full premium plus a 2% administrative charge. TCC is available to employees separated for reasons other than gross misconduct and those no longer meeting unmarried dependent child requirements. OPM was directed to offer health benefits coverage to temporary federal employees with one year of continuous service, who must pay the total premium amount.

P.L. 101-76 adjusted the big six formula in response to Aetna's withdrawal from FEHB for plan years 1990 and 1991. The government's share of FEHB plans for years 1990 and 1991 is calculated by adjusting the Aetna high option premium based on the average percentage change in other plans. This act does not apply if comprehensive reform legislation amends FEHB financing. OPM must submit reform recommendations to Congress within 180 days of enactment. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (P.L. 101-239) required USPS to pay FEHB premiums for survivors of postal employees who retired or died after October 1, 1986.

P.L. 102-393 prohibited the use of funds to make changes to FEHB that would impact Medicare beneficiaries. The act P.L. 102-393 restricted the use of funds to implement changes to FEHB that would affect Medicare beneficiaries. It prevented OPM from requiring retired FEHB enrollees eligible for Medicare benefits to pay the difference in out-of-pocket costs with nonparticipating Medicare providers and from eliminating the waiver of FEHB plan coinsurance for prescription drugs used by Medicare-covered FEHB enrollees. These changes were intended for plan year 1993 but were not implemented due to the act. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (P.L. 102-484) continued FEHB benefits for individuals involuntarily separated from the Department of Defense due to a reduction in force.

This provision applies to those with TCC based on separation after the enactment date and before October 1, 1997, or February 1, 1998. The act limits the individual's payments for coverage to the employee's share of premiums and requires the last employing agency to cover the remaining portion. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 required most FEHB plans to apply Medicare Part B limitations on payments for physician services to benefits provided to retired FEHB enrollees aged 65 or older. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66) required most FEHB plans to apply Medicare Part B limitations on payments for physician services to benefits provided to retired FEHB enrollees aged 65 or older. Physicians and suppliers accepting Medicare payments must also accept equivalent payment and cost sharing from FEHB, with nonparticipating providers not allowed to exceed limiting charges. The Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-123) extended and modified the restructured big six formula for plan years 1990 through 1998. It also did not include a provision restricting funding for abortion, unlike previous appropriations acts.

FEHB plans must comply with ACA provisions regarding health insurance coverage. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) contains provisions that apply to health insurance coverage, including FEHB plans. OPM has provided guidance on implementing ACA provisions, some of which require FEHB plans to comply with new requirements. OPM has expanded ACA provisions for FEHB plans, requiring implementation before specified dates. Adult children up to age 26 can stay on parent's plan, effective January 2011. TCC is available for three years when child ages out at 26. Disabled children can also remain on parent's plan until age 26. As of January 2011, the ACA extended dependent coverage for adult children up to age 26 on FEHB plans. Disabled children can also remain on their parent's plan indefinitely if the disability occurred before age 26. FEHB plans must now offer certain preventive care services with no out-of-pocket costs as required by the ACA. The ACA extended dependent coverage for adult children up to age 26 on FEHB plans and required certain preventive care services to be offered with no out-of-pocket costs. Plans must provide a summary of benefits and coverage to applicants and enrollees. The ACA required plans to provide a summary of benefits and coverage (SBC) and a uniform glossary of terms to applicants and enrollees. The SBC offers simple information about a plan's benefits, while the glossary helps consumers understand health insurance terms. OPM mandated all FEHB plans to offer an SBC and glossary for the 2013 plan year. The ACA also banned lifetime limits on certain health benefits.

Additionally, the ACA required large group plans, including FEHB plans, to report a medical loss ratio and provide annual rebates to enrollees based on premium revenue ratios starting in 2011. The ACA required large group plans, including FEHB plans, to provide annual rebates to enrollees if the ratio of premium revenue spent on clinical claims and health quality costs is less than 85%. Carriers must issue rebates directly to OPM, which are then deposited into the health plan's contingency reserve to reduce the following year's premiums. The ACA requires rebates to be issued directly to OPM and deposited into the health plan's contingency reserve to reduce the following year's premiums. The act also modified the definition of qualified medical expenses, affecting FSAs, HSAs, and HRAs, restricting coverage of OTC medicines without a prescription except for insulin.

It also raised the penalty for nonqualified withdrawals from HSAs and lowered maximum contributions to HCFSA under FEHB. Eligible Indian tribes have been allowed to participate since May 1, 2012. The ACA lowered the maximum annual contributions to a Health Care Flexible Spending Account (HCFSA) under FEHB from $5,000 to $2,500, indexed to inflation for subsequent years. Eligible Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations can purchase FEHB for their tribal employees since May 1, 2012, with the tribe or tribal organization paying the government's share of the premium. Administrative requirements were imposed on employers affecting federal agencies. The ACA allowed tribes and tribal organizations to purchase health coverage for employees, not retirees. It imposed administrative requirements on employers, including reporting the cost of employer-sponsored coverage on W-2 forms. Starting in 2014, insurers and employers must report individual coverage details to the government. The ACA required insurers, employers, and government agencies to file a return with individual coverage details starting in 2014, with the effective date delayed until 2015. Members of Congress and certain congressional staff are only eligible for health plans created under the ACA or offered through an exchange. Beginning January 1, 2014, Members of Congress and designated staff could only access health plans created under the ACA or offered through an exchange. They could no longer purchase FEHB plans as active employees, but could enroll in a health plan through a SHOP exchange with an employer contribution. Upon retirement, they are allowed to enroll in an FEHB plan. For more details, refer to CRS. The ACA imposed new fees on health insurance plans starting in 2014, affecting most FEHB carriers. Additionally, a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute fee was imposed on insurers. Members of Congress and designated staff can enroll in an FEHB plan upon retirement. For more information, refer to CRS Report R43194. The ACA imposed fees on health insurance plans starting in 2014, affecting most FEHB carriers.

The Director of OPM must offer at least two multistate plans through each exchange in each state, providing individual or group coverage for small employers. Enrollees in an MSP will be treated as a separate risk pool from FEHB, with separate units or offices established to ensure no interference with FEHB administration. Additional personnel can be appointed for MSP activities, but the program must remain separate from FEHB. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-67) allowed FEHB enrollees to choose \"self plus one\" coverage in addition to individual and family coverage. The government's share of premiums for self plus one coverage is determined the same way as for individual and family coverage, with OPM finding the weighted average premium of all plans in FEHB each year. The government's share of premiums for self plus one coverage in FEHB is determined by OPM based on the weighted average premium of all plans, with OPM paying either 72% of the average or 75% of a specific plan's premium, whichever is lower. An actuarial analysis will be used for the first contract year of self plus one coverage."
